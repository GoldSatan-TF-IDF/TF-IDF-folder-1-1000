introduction i the last century was yet in its infancy when the author of the romany rye first saw the light in the sleepy little east anglian township of east dereham in the county distinguished by borrow as the one in which the people eat the best dumplings in the world and speak the purest english pretty quiet dereham was the retreat in those days of a lady bountiful in the person of dame eleanor fenn relict of the worthy editor of the paston letters it is better known in literary history as the last restingplace of a sad and unquiet spirit escaped from a world in which it had known nought but sorrow of englands sweetest and most pious bard william cowper but destiny was weaving a robuster thread to connect east dereham with literature for george borrow was born there on july th and nomad though he was the place was always dear to his heart as his earliest home in after ramblings far and wide both in ireland and in scotland the borrows settled in norwich where george was schooled under a master whose name at least is still familiar to english youth dr valpy brother of dr richard valpy among his schoolfellows at the grammar school were rajah brooke and dr james martineau george borrow a hardened truant from his earliest teens was once horsed to undergo a flogging on the back of james martineau and he never afterwards took kindly to the philosophy of that remarkable man we are glad to know that edward valpys ferule was weak though his scholarship was strong stories were current that even in those days george used to haunt the gipsy tents on that mousehold heath which lives eternally in the breezy canvases of old crome and that he went so far as to stain his face with walnutjuice to the right egyptian hue are you suffering from jaundice borrow asked the doctor or is it merely dirt while at norwich too he was greatly influenced in the direction of linguistics by the english pocket goethe william taylor the head of a clan known as the taylors of norwich to distinguish them from a race in which the principle of heredity was even more strikingly developedthe taylors of ongar in february his father the gallant captain thomas borrow died and his articles in the firm of a norwich solicitor having determined george went to london to commence literary man in the old sense of the servitude under the wellknown booksellerpublisher sir richard phillipps in grub street he translated and compiled galore but when the trees began to shoot in he broke his chain and escaped to the country to the dingle and to isopel berners to dwell upon the bare outlines of borrows early career would be a superfluously dull proceeding we shall only add a few names and dates to the framework supplied with a fidelity that is rare in much more formal works of autobiography in the pages of lavengro from the same pages we may detach just a few of the earlier influences which went to make up the rare and complex individuality of the writer borrows father a fine old soldier in revealing his sons youthful idiosyncrasy projects a clear mental image of his own habit of mind the boy had the impertinence to say the classics were much overvalued and amongst other things that some horrid fellow or other some welshman i think thank god it was not an irishman was a better poet than ovid that a boy of his years should entertain an opinion of his own imean one which militates against all established authority is astonishing as well might a raw recruit pretend to offer an unfavourable opinion on the manual and platoon exercise the idea is preposterous the lad is too independent by half borrows account of his fathers death is a highly affecting piece of english the ironical humour blent with pathos in his picture of this illrewarded old disciplinarian who combined a tenderness of heart with a fondness for military metaphor that frequently reminds one of my uncle toby the details of the ailments and the portents that attended his infantile career and above all the glimpses of the wandering military life from barrack to barrack and from garrison to garrison inevitably remind the reader of the childish reminiscences of laurence sterne a writer to whom it may thus early be said that george borrow paid no small amount of unconscious homage a homage of another sort fully recognised and declared was that paid to the great work of defoe and to the spirit of strange and romantic enterprise which it aroused in its reader after robinson crusoe there played across the disk of his youthful memory a number of weird and hairy figures never to be effaced a strange old herbalist and snakekiller with a skin cap first whetted his appetite for the captivating confidences of roadside vagrants and the acquaintanceship serves as an introduction to the scene of the gipsy encampment where the young sapengro or serpent charmer was first claimed as brother by jasper petulengro the picture of the encampment may serve as an example of borrovian prose nervous unembarrassed and graphic one day it happened being on my rambles i entered a green lane which i had never seen before at first it was rather narrow but as i advanced it became considerably wider in the middle was a driftway with deep ruts but right and left was a space carpeted with a sward of trefoil and clover there was no lack of trees chiefly ancient oaks which flinging out their arms from either side nearly formed a canopy and afforded a pleasing shelter from the rays of the sun which was burning fiercely above suddenly a group of objects attracted my attention beneath one of the largest of the trees upon the grass was a kind of low tent or booth from the top of which a thin smoke was curling beside it stood a couple of light carts whilst two or three lean horses or ponies were cropping the herbage which was growing nigh as a pendant to the landscape take a flemish interior the home of the borrows had been removed in the meantime in accordance with the roving traditions of the family from norman cross to edinburgh and from edinburgh to clonmel and to the school i went at clonmel where i read the latin tongue and the greek letters with a nice old clergyman who sat behind a black oaken desk with a huge elzevir flaccus before him in a long gloomy kind of hall with a broken stone floor the roof festooned with cobwebs the walls considerably dilapidated and covered over with stray figures in hieroglyphics evidently produced by the application of a burnt stick in ireland too he made the acquaintance of the gossoon murtagh who taught him irish in return for a pack of cards in the course of his wanderings with his fathers regiment he develops into a wellgrown and wellfavoured lad a shrewd walker and a bold rider people may talk of first loveit is a very agreeable event i dare saybut give me the flush the triumph and glorious sweat of a first ride at norwich he learns modern languages from an old emigré a true disciple of the ancien cour who sets boileau high above dante and some misty german metaphysics from the norwich philosopher who consistently seeks a solace in smoke from the troubles of life his father had already noted his tendency to fly off at a tangent which was strikingly exhibited in the lawyers office where within the womb of a lofty deal desk when he should have been imbibing blackstone and transcribing legal documents he was studying monsieur vidocq and translating the welsh bard ab gwilym he was consigning his legal career to an early grave when he wrote this elegy on the worthy attorney his master he has long since sunk to his place in a respectable vault in the aisle of a very respectable church whilst an exceedingly respectable marble slab against the neighbouring wall tells on a sunday some eye wandering from its prayerbook that his dust lies below to secure such respectabilities in death he passed a most respectable life a more respectablelooking individual never was seen in the meantime as a sequel to his questionings on the subjects of reality and truth the author was asking himself what is death and the query serves as a prelude to the first of the many breezy dialogues with that gipsy cousingerman to autolycus jasper petulengro what is your opinion of death mr petulengro my opinion of death brother is much the same as that in the old song of pharaoh when a man dies he is cast into the earth and his wife and child sorrow over him if he has neither wife nor child then his father and mother i suppose and if he is quite alone in the world why then he is cast into the earth and there is an end of the matter and do you think that is the end of mantheres an end of him brother mores the pity why do you say so life is sweet brother do you think so think so theres night and day brother both sweet things sun moon and stars brother all sweet things theres likewise a wind on the heath life is very sweet brother who would wish to die i would wish to die you talk like a gorgiowhich is the same as talking like a fool were you a romany chal you would talk wiser wish to die indeed a romany chal would wish to live for ever in sickness jasper theres the sun and stars brother in blindness jasper theres the wind on the heath brother if i could only feel that i would gladly live for ever dæta well now go to the tents and put on the gloves and ill try to make you feel what a sweet thing it is to be alive brother leaving norwich and his legal trammels a few weeks after his fathers death in lavengro reaches londonthe scene of grub street struggles not greatly relaxed in severity since the days of newbery gardener and christopher smart as the genius of hawthorne was cooped up and enslaved for the american peter parley so that of borrow was hagridden by a bookseller publisher of an even worse type the radical alderman and philanthropic sweater sir richard phillipps for this stonyhearted faddist he covered reams of paper with printers copy and we are told that the kind of compilation that he liked and probably executed best was that of newgate lives and trials he had wellnigh reached the end of his tether when he had the conversation with phillippss head factotum taggart which we cite below and recommend feelingly to the consideration of every literary aspirant sordid and commonplace enough are the details simple and free from every kind of inflation the language in which they are narrated yet how picturesque are these vignettes of london life how vivid and yet how strange are the figures that animate them the harsh literary impresario with his drug in the market who seems to have stalked straight out of smollett the gnarled old applewoman with every wrinkle shown on her stall upon london bridge the grasping armenian merchant who softened at the sound of his native tongue the giddy young spendthrift francis ardry and the confiding young creature who had permitted him to hire her a very handsome floor in the west end the gipsies and thimbleriggers in greenwich parkwhat moving and lifelike figures are these stippled in with a seeming absence of art yet as strange and as rare as a night in bagdad a chapter of balzac or the most fantastic scene in the new arabian nights this brief recapitulationin which it has been possible but just to touch upon a few of the inner springs of borrows life as revealed in the autobiographical lavengrobrings us once again to that spring day in may thwhen the author disposed of an unidentifiable manuscript for the sumptuous equivalent of on may nd after little more than a years residence in london he abandons the city from london he proceeds to amesbury in wiltshire which he reaches on may rd visits stonehenge the roman camp of old sarum and salisbury on may th he leaves salisbury and after an encounter with the longlost son of the old applewoman returned from botany bay strikes northwest on the th he has been walking four days in a northerly direction when he arrives at the inn where the maid jenny refreshes him at the pump and he meets the author with whom he passes the night on the st he purchases the horse and cart of jack slingsby whom he had previously seen but once at tamworth many years ago when he was little more than a child on june st he makes the first practical experience of a vagrants life and passes the night in the open air in a shropshire dell on june th he is visited by leonora herne the grandchild of the old brimstone hag who was jealous of the cordiality with which the young stranger had been received by the petulengroes and initiated in the secrets of their gipsy tribe three days later betrayed to the old woman by leonora he is drabbed ie poisoned with the manricli or doctored cake of mrs herne his life is in imminent danger but he is saved by the opportune arrival of peter williams he passes sunday june th with the welsh preacher and his wife winifred on the st he departs with his itinerant hosts to the welsh border before entering wales however he turns back with ambrose jasper petulengro and settles with his own stockintrade as tinker and blacksmith at the foot of the dingle hard by mumpers lane near willenhall in staffordshire here at the end of june takes place the classical encounter between the philologer and the flaming tinmanall this is it not related in lavengro and substantiated with much hard labour of facts and dates by dr w i knapp in his exhaustive biography of george borrow the allurement of his genius is such that the etymologist shall leave his roots and the philologer his maesogothic to take to the highway and dwell in the dingle with don jorgelavengros triumph over the flaming tinman is the prelude to what professor saintsbury justly calls the miraculous episode of ysopel berners and the narrative of the authors life is thence continued with many digressions but with a remarkable fidelity to fact as far as the main issue is concerned until the narrative though not the lifestory of the author abruptly terminates at horncastle in august there follows what is spoken of as the veiled period of borrows life from to the years in which we drift are generally veiled from posterity the system of psychometry carried to such perfection by obermann and amiel could at no time have been exactly congenial to borrow who spoke of himself at this period as digging holes in the sand and filling them up again roughly speaking the years appear to have been spent comparatively uneventfully for the most part in norfolk in december he walked to london to interview the british and foreign bible society covering a hundred and twelve miles in twentyseven hours on less than sixpennyworth of food and drink he was thirty years old at the time and the achievement was the pride of his remaining years six months later on the strength of his linguistic attainments he managed to get on the paid staff of the society to the bewilderment of norwich friends who were inclined to be ironical on the subject of the transformation of the chum of hanged thurtell and the disciple of godless billy taylor into a bible missionary in july then borrow sets out on his eastern travels as the accredited agent of the bible society goes to st petersburg the finest city in the world and obtains the russian imprimatur for a manchu version of that suspicious novelty the bible he carried this scheme into execution to the general satisfaction and he returns to london in then to the south of europe whence he reappears larger than life and twice as natural in his masterly autobiographical romance of the bible in spain the work which made his name which was sold by thousands which was eagerly acclaimed as an invaluable addition to sunday literature and pirated in a generous spirit of emulation by american publishers we are now come to the circumstance of the composition of lavengro the bible in spain when it appeared in implied a wonderful background to the authors experience a career diversified by all kinds of wild adventures sorcery jews gentiles rambles gipsies prisonswhat you will the personal element in the bookso suggestive of mystery and romanceexcited the strongest curiosity apart from this however the reading public of were not unnaturally startled by a book which seemed to profess to be a good serious missionary work but for which it was manifest that gil blas and not bishop heber had been taken as a model not that any single comparison of the kind can convey the least idea of the complex idiosyncrasy of such a work there is a substratum of guide book and gil blas no doubt but there are unmistakable streaks of defoe of dumas and of dickens with all his native prejudices and insular predilections strong upon him a narrative so wide awake amidst a vagrant population of questionable morals and alien race suggests an affinity with hajji baba a close kinsman we conceive of the borrovian picaro but above all as one follows the author through the mazes of his book one is conscious of two strangely assorted figures never far from the itinerants side and always ready to improve the occasion if a shadow of an opportunity be afforded one who is prolific of philological chippings might be compared to a semblance of max müller while the other alternately denouncing the wickedness and deriding the toothlessness of a grim giant pope may be likened at a distance to john bunyan about the wholeto concludeis an atmosphere not too pronounced of the newgate calendar and a few patches of sawdust from the prize ring may not people well have wondered the good pious english folk to whom luck is a scandal as the bible societys secretary wrote to borrow what manner of man is this this muleteermissionary this natural man with a pen in the hand of a prizefighter but of a prizefighter who is afflicted with the fads of a philologerand a pedant at that the surprise may be compared to what that of a previous generation would have been had it seen johnson and boswell and baretti all fused into one man the incongruity is heightened by familiarity with borrows tall blonde scandinavian figure and the reader is reminded of those roving northmen of the days of simple mediæval devotion who were wont to signalise their conversion from heathen darkness by a mediterranean venture combining the characters of a piratical cruise and a pious pilgrimage that curiosity exaggerated and was a marvelmonger we shall attempt to demonstrate but in the meantime it was there and it was very strong as for borrow he was prepared to derive stimulus from it just as long as it maintained the unquestioning attitude of jasper petulengro when he expressed the sentiments of gipsydom in the wellworn lor brother how learned you are in february borrow wrote to murray that he had begun his lifea kind of biography in the robinson crusoe styleand was determined that it should surpass anything that he had already written it had been contemplated he added for some months already as a possible sequel to the bible in spain if that proved successful hitherto he wrote the public had said good to his gypsies of spain better to the bible in spain and he wanted it when no appeared to say best five years rapidly passed away until in the summer of the book was announced as about to appear shortly under the title of lavengro an autobiography which was soon changed to life a drama the difficulty of writing a book which should have no humbug in it proved as may well be supposed immense and would in any case be quite sufficient to account for the long period of gestation his perplexities may have often been very near akin to those ascribed to the superstitious author in the sixtyfifth chapter of lavengro his desire to be original sadly cramping the powers of his mind his fastidiousness being so great that he invariably rejected whatever ideas he did not consider to be legitimately his own as a substitute for the usual padding of humbug sycophancy and secondhandideas he bethought himself of philology and he set himself to spring fragments of philological instruction often far from sound upon his reader in the most unexpected places that his ingenuity could devise he then began to base hopes upon the book in proportion to its originality at the last moment however the author grew querulous about his work distrustful of the reception that would be given to it and even as to the advisability of producing it at all much yet remained to be done but for a long time he refused not only to forward new copy to albemarle street but even to revise the proofs of that which he had already written and it required all the dunning that murray and the printer woodfall dare apply before lavengro with its altered subtitle for at the last moment borrow grew afraid of openly avowing his identity with the speaking likeness which he had created could be announced as just ready in the athenæum of dec th lavengro the scholar the gypsy the priest eventually appeared in three volumes on feb th the autobiographical lavengro stopped short in july at the conclusion of the hundredth chapter with an abruptness worthy of the sentimental journey the author had succeeded in extending the area of mystery but not in satisfying the public borrows confidences were so very different in complexion from those which the critics seemed to have expected that they were taken aback and declared to the public almost with one accord that the writers eccentricities had developed into mannerisms that his theories of life were political manifestoes that his dialects were gibberish and his defiance of the orthodox canons of autobiography scarcely less than an outrage upon the public taste from the general public came a fusillade of requests to solve the prevailing mystery of the book was it fact or fiction or if fact and fiction were blended in what proportions borrow ought to have been prepared for a question so natural in the mouths of literary busybodies at any time and especially at a time when partisan spirit was rampant and the vitality of the lampoon as a factor in politics so far from extinct to show his contempt alike for the critical verdict and the popular curiosity after a quarrel or at least a sharp coolness with john murray he published in two volumes in may the romany rye which carries on the story of lavengro for just about a month further namely down towards the end of august and there again stops dead whether we regard coherence or the rate of progress no more attempt at amendment is perceptible than can be discerned in the later as compared with the earlier volumes of tristram shandy the peculiarities of the earlier volume are indeed here accentuated while the author had evidently only been confirmed by the lapse of years in the political philosophy to which he had already given expression at the end was printed an appendix a sort of catalogue raisonné of borrovian prejudices satirising with unmeasured bitterness the critics of lavengro the resumption of a story after an interval of over six years with appendages so extravagant whether we regard their tenor or their length and with an indifference so sublime to the popular desire that he should get along with his personal narrative was hardly calculated to conciliate critical opinion but it had one capital effect it drew from whitwell elwin himself a norfolk man and a literary critic of the widest grasp and knowledge this remarkable testimony that far from exaggerating such incidents as were drawn from his own experience not a few as he himself could verify borrows descriptions were rather within the truth than beyond it however picturesquely they may be drawn the lines are invariably those of nature there can be no doubt that the larger part and possibly the whole of the work is a narrative of actual occurrences here then is the heart of the mystery or of the mystery that is apparent the phenomenon is due primarily to the fact that borrows book is so abnormally true as regards the matter while in manner of presentation it is so strikingly original there are superficial traces no doubt of not a few writers of the eighteenth century in some of his effects borrow reproduces sterne essentially sternean for instance is the interview between the youthful author and the experienced mr taggart well young gentleman said taggart to me one morning when we chanced to be alone a few days after the affair of cancelling how do you like authorship i scarcely call authorship the drudgery i am engaged in said i what do you call authorship said taggart i scarcely know said i that is i can scarcely express what i think it shall i help you out said taggart turning round his chair and looking at me if you like said i to write something grand said taggart taking snuff to be stared atlifted on peoples shoulders well said i that is something like it taggart took snuffwell said he why dont you write something grand i have said i what said taggart why said i there are those ballads taggart took snuff and those wonderful versions from ab gwilym taggart took snuff again you seem to be very fond of snuff said i looking at him angrily taggart tapped his box have you taken it long threeandtwenty years what snuff do you take universal mixture and you find it of use taggart tapped his box in what respect said i in manythere is nothing like it to get a man through but for snuff i should scarcely be where i am now have you been long here threeandtwenty years dear me said i and snuff brought you through give me a pinchpah i dont like it and i sneezed take another pinch said taggart no said i i dont like snuff then you will never do for authorship at least for this kind so i begin to think what shall i do taggart took snuff you were talking of a great work what shall it be taggart took snuff do you think i could write one taggart uplifted his two forefingers as if to tap he did not however it would require time said i with half a sigh taggart tapped his box a great deal of time i really think that my ballads taggart took snuff if published would do me credit ill make an effort and offer them to some other publishertaggart took a double quantity of snuff equally sternelike is the conclusion to a chapter italywhat was i going to say about italy less superficial is the influence of cervantes and his successors of the picaresque school down to the last and most representative of them in england namely defoe and smollett profoundest of all perhaps is the influence of defoe of whose powers of intense realisation exhibited in the best parts of robinson crusoe we get a fine counterpart amid the outcasts in mumpers lane bound up with the truthfulness and originality of the author is that strange absence of sycophancy which we may flatter ourselves is no exceptional thing but which is in reality a very rare phenomenon in literature apart from this independence of character which he so justly prized and a monomania or two such as his devotion to philology or detestation of popery borrows mental peculiarities are not by any means so extravagant as has been supposed his tastes were for the most part not unusual though they might be assorted in a somewhat uncommon manner he was a thorough sportsman in the best sense but he combined with his sporting zeal an instinctive hatred of gambling of bad language and of tyranny or cruelty in any form he entertained a love for the horse in the stable without bowing down to worship the stagecoachmen the jockeys and other ignoble heroes of horsey life he loved his country and the quiet unpretending church of england he was ready to exalt the obsolescent fisticuffs and the strong ale of old england but he was not blind either to the drunkenness or to the overbearing brutality which he had reason to fear might be held to disfigure the character of the swilling and prizefighting sections among his compatriots a borrow was a master of whim but it is easy to exaggerate his eccentricity as a traveller who met with adventures upon the roads of britain he was surpassed by a dozen writers that could be named and in our own dayto mention oneby that truly eccentric being the druid b the druid had a special affinity with borrow in regard to his kindness for an old applewoman his applewoman kept a stall in the strand to which the druid was a constant visitor mainly for the purpose of having a chat and borrowing and repaying small sums rarely exceeding one shilling as an author again borrow was as jealous as one of thackerays heroines he could hardly bear to hear a contemporary book praised whim if you will but scarcely an example of literary eccentricity borrow developed a delightful faculty for adventure upon the high road but such a faculty was far less singular than his giftakin to the greatest painters power of suggesting atmosphereof investing each scene and incident with a separate and distinct air of uncompromising reality many persons may have had the advantage of hearing conversation as brilliant or as wise as that of the dinner at dillys what is distinctive of genius is the power to convey the general feeling of the interlocutors to suggest a dramatic effect an artistic whole as boswell does by the cumulative effect of infinitesimal factors the triumph in each case is one not of opportunities but of the subtlest literary sense similarly borrows fixed ideas had little that was really exceptional or peculiar about them his hatred of mumbojumbo and priestcraft was but a part of his steady love of freedom and sincerity his linguistic mania had less of a philological basis than he would have us believe impatience that babel should act as a barrier between kindred souls an insatiable curiosity prompted by the knowledge that the language of minorities was in nine cases out of ten the direct route to the heart of the secret of folks that puzzled himsuch were the motives that stimulated a hunger for strange vocabularies not in itself abnormal the colloquial faculty which he undoubtedly possessedfor we are told by taylor that when barely eighteen he already knew english welsh irish latin greek hebrew german danish french italian and portugueserarely goes with philological depth any more than with idiomatic purity borrow learnt some languages to translate many to speak imperfectly but as a comparative philologist with claims to scientific equipment his targum with its boasted versions from thirty languages or dialects pales considerably before the almost contemporary philological grammar based upon a comparison of over sixty tongues by the dorset poet william barnes who like borrow himself was a selftaught man to mention but two more english contemporaries of borrow there was thomas watts of the british museum who could read nearly fifty languages including chinese and canon cook the editor of the speakers commentary who claimed acquaintance with fiftyfour it is commonly said of cardinal mezzofanti that he could speak thirty and understand sixty it is quite plain from the pages of lavengro itself that borrow did not share gregory xvis high estimate of the cardinals mental qualifications unrivalled linguist though he was that a wordmaster so abnormal is apt to be deficient in logical sense seems to have been borrows deliberate opinion with a saving clause as to exceptions and i have often thought that it must have been shakespeares too for does he not ascribe a command of tongues to the man who is perhaps the most consummate idiot in the whole range of shakespearean portraiture maria that quaffing and drinking will undo you i heard my lady talk of it yesterday and of a foolish knight that you brought in here to be her wooer sir toby belch who sir andrew aguecheekmaria ay he sir toby hes as tall a man as any in illyria maria whats that to the purpose sir toby why he has three thousand ducats a year maria ay but hell have but a year in all these ducats hes a very fool and a prodigal sir toby fie that youll say so he plays o the viol de gamboys and speaks three or four languages word for word without book the extraordinary linguistic gifts of a mezzofanti were not it is true concentrated in borrow whose powers in this direction have been magnified but they were sufficiently prominent in him to have a determining effect upon his mind thus he was distinguished less for broad views than for an extraordinary faculty for detail when he attempts to generalise we are likelier to get a flood of inconsequent prejudices than a steady flow of reasoned opinions we can frequently study an author with good effect through the medium of his literary admirations we have already noticed a few of borrows predilections in real life with regard to literature his predilections or more particularly what zola would call his haines were fully as protestant and as thorough his indifference to the literature of his own time might be termed brutal his intellectual selfsufficiency was worthy of a macaulay or of a donne a fellowdenouncer of snobs he made thackeray very uncomfortable by his contemptuous ignorance of the snob papers and even of the name of the periodical in which they were appearing concerning keats he once asked have they not been trying to resuscitate him when miss strickland wanted to send him her lives he broke out for gods sake dont madam i should not know where to put them or what to do with them scotts woodstock he picked up more than once and incontinently threw down as trashy as a general rule he judged a modern author by his prejudices if these differed by a hairs breadth from his own he damned the whole of his work he had to his credit a vast fund of quaint outoftheway reading not to be acquainted with this was dense unpardonable ignorance what he had not read was scarcely knowledge he was not what one could fairly call unread in the classical authors for in a survey of his reviewers he compared himself complacently enough with cervantes bunyan and le sage he had the utmost suspicion of literary models to try to be like somebody else was the too popular literary precept that he held in the greatest abhorrence the gravity of his prescription of wordsworth as a specific in cases of chronic insomnia is probably due rather to the thorough sincerity of his view than to any conscious subtlety of humour he disliked scott especially for his easy tolerance of jacobites and papists while he distrusted his portraits those portraits of the rougher people which may have frequently been overpraised by scotts admirers we most of us love scott it is a fact beyond the power of nice discrimination as to the verisimilitude of a portrait such as that of meg merrilies we must allow borrow to be a most competent critic but we are at a loss to sympathise with his failure to appreciate studies of such lifelike fidelity as edie ochiltree and andrew fairservice whose views anent the muckle hure that sitteth on seven hills as if ane wasna braid eneugh for her auld hinder end had so much that was in sympathy with borrows own of all such prejudices and peculiarities no less than of his gifts borrow was ridiculously proud in certain respects he was as vainly querulously and childishly assertive as goldsmith himself while in the haughty selfisolation with which he eschewed the society of people with endowments as great or even greater than his own he was quite the opposite of poor goldy if the latter had regarded his interlocutors straight in the eyes with a look that told them he was prepared to knock them down at a moments notice upon the least provocation we should probably have heard less of his absurdities a man who even in his old age could walk off with e j trelawny a under his arm as mr wattsdunton assures us borrow could was certainly not one to be trifled with borrows absolute unconventionality was of course an offence to many to englishmen who were dreaming in the fifties of a kind of industrial millennium with cobden as the prophet and macaulay as the preacher of a new gospel of commercial prosperity and universal peace and progress borrows prerailroad prejudices and low tastes appeared obscurantist dark squalid unintelligible b he ran out his books upon a line directly counter to the literary current of the day and naturally enough the critical billow broke over him hazlitts propositionso readily accepted by the smug generation of his daythat london was the only place in which the child could grow up completely into the manwould have appeared the most perverse kind of nonsense to borrow the complexity of a modern type such as that of a big organiser of industrial labour did not impress him he esteemed the primitive above the economic man and was apt to judge a human being rather as robinson crusoe might have done than in the spirit of a juryman at an industrial exhibition again his feeling for nature was intimate rather than enthusiastic at a time when people still looked for a good deal of pretty gloverlike composition in their landscapes one of the most original traits of borrows genius was the care and obstinacy with which he defended his practical vigorous and alert personality against the allurements of wordpainting of nature and of reverie he could respond tothe thrill of natural beauty he could enjoy his mood when it veritably came upon him just as he could enjoy a tankard of old ale or linger to gaze upon a sympathetic face but he refused to pamper such feelings still more to simulate them he refused to allow himself to become the creature of literary or poetic ecstasy he refused to indulge in the fashionable debauch of dilettante melancholy he wrote about his life quite naturally as if there were nothing in it another and closely allied cause of perplexity and discontent to the literary connoisseurs was borrows lack of style by style in the generation of macaulay and carlyle of dickens and george eliot was implied something reconditea wealth of metaphor imagery allusion colour and perfumea palette a pouncebox an optical instrument a soundingboard a musical box anything rather than a living tongue to a later race of stylists who have gone as far as samoa and beyond in the quest of exotic perfumery borrow would have said simply in the words of old montaigne to smell though well is to stinkmalo quam bene olere nil olere borrow in fact by a right instinct went back to the straightforward manner of swift and defoe smollett and cobbett whose vigorous prose he specially admired and he found his choice ill appreciated by critics whose sense of style demanded that a clear glass window should be studded with bullseyes to his distinctions of being a poet wellnigh incapable of verse and a humourist with marvellously little pathos borrow thus added one which we are inclined to regard as the greatest of allthat of being a great nineteenthcentury prosewriter without a style though he did not elaborate or strive to attain to the cultism or polite style of contemporary genius borrow seems to have written with some difficulty or at any rate a lack of facility and impervious as he was to criticism he retained in his prose a number of small faults that he might easily have got rid of his manner of introducing his generalities and conclusions is often either superfluous or lame and clumsy despite his natural eloquence his fondness for the apostrophe is excessive he preserved an irritating habit of parading such words as éclat penchant and monticle and persisted in saying of a verity and using the word individual in the sense of person such blemishes are microscopic enough it was not such trifles as these that proved stumblingblocks to the men of blood and foam as he called his critics of the generality of the critics of that day it would probably be well within the mark to aver that their equipment was more solid and their competence more assured than that of their successors it would be safe to assert that their selfsufficiency was also decidedly more pronounced now for reasons which we have endeavoured to explain the equanimity of the critical reviewers was considerably ruffled by lavengro perplexed by its calling itself an autobiography they were at the same time discontented both with its subjectmatter and its style to a not altogether misplaced curiosity on the part of the public as to borrows antecedents the author of the bible in spain had responded by lavengro which he fully meant to be what it indeed was a masterpiece yet public and critics were agreed in failing to see the matter in this light as the reader will probably have deduced from the foregoing pages the trouble was mainly due to the following causes first baffled curiosity secondly a dislike for borrows prejudices thirdly a disgust at his philistinism in refusing to bow down and worship the regnant idols of taste fourthly the total absence in borrow of the sentimentality for which the soul of the normal englishman yearns fifthly disappointment at not finding the critics due from an accepted author in quotable passages of picturesque prose these views are appropriately summed up through the medium of the pure and scentless taste of the athenæum the varied contents of lavengro are here easily reduced to one denominationbalderdash for the emission of which the athenæum critic proceeds in the interests of course of the highest gentility to give george borrow a good scolding how sadly removed was such procedure from borrows own ideal of reviewing as set forth in the very volume under consideration such operations should always he held be conducted in a spirit worthy of an editor of quintilian in a gentlemanly oxfordlike manner no vituperation no insinuations occasionally a word of admonition but gently expressed as an oxford ma might have expressed it some one had ventured to call the bible in spain a grotesque book but the utterance had been drowned in the chorus of acclamation now borrow complained that he had had the honour of being rancorously abused by every unmanly scoundrel every sycophantic lacquey and every political and religious renegade in the kingdom his fury was that of an angry bull tormented by a swarm of gnats his worst passions were aroused his most violent prejudices confirmed his literary zeal never extremely alert was sensibly diminished this last result at least was a calamity nevertheless the great end had in the main already been accomplished borrow had broken through the tameness of the regulation literary memoir and had shown the naked footprint on the sand the great unknown had gone down beneath his associations his acquirements and his adventures and had to a large extent revealed himselfa primitive man with his breast by no means wholly rid of the instincts of the wild beast grappling with the problem of a complex humanity an epitome of the eternal struggle which alone gives savour to the wearisome process of civilisation for the conventional man of the lapidary phrase and the pious memoir corrected by the maiden sister and the family divine borrow dared to substitute the genus homo of natural history perhaps it was only to be expected that like the discoveries of another du chaillu his revelations should be received with a howl of incredulity almost alone as far as we can discover among the critics of the day émile montégut realised to the full the true greatness the originality the abiding quality and interest of borrows work writing in september upon legentilhomme bohémien an essay which appears in his ecrivains modernes de langleterre between studies on mistress browning and alfred tennyson montégut remarks of borrows humoristic odyssey unfinished and fragmentary these writings can dispense with a conclusion for they have an intrinsic value and each page bears the impress of reality the critic who has to give his impressions of one of borrows books is in much the same case as a critic who had to give his impressions in turn of the different parts of gil blas as they successively appeared the work is incomplete but each several part is excellent and can be appreciated by itself borrow has resuscitated a literary form which had been many years abandoned and he has resuscitated it in no artificial manneras a rhythmical form is rehabilitated or as a dilettante reestablishes for a moment the vogue of the roundel or the virelaybut quite naturally as the inevitable setting for a picture which has to include the actors and the observations of the authors vagabond life to a clear and unprejudiced mind observation of the life of the common folk and above all of the itinerant population and of their equivocal moral code of necessity and invariably compels resort to the form and manner of the novéla picaresca the huge sensational romance sue the creaking machinery of melodrama boucicault with which it has been attempted in our own day to portray certain tableaux of the life of the people only succeed owing to the extravagance of their construction in demonstrating the complete ignorance on the part of the writers of the subject which they pretend to describe borrow has not of set purpose adopted the picaresque form search his pages where you will you will find not a trace of such an intention he has rediscovered the picaresque method as it were instinctively by the mere fact of his having to express sentiments of a certain description he has indeed rediscovered it by the same process which led cervantes and hurtado de mendoza to invent itby virtue of that necessity which always enables genius to give the most appropriate clothing to its conceptions to attain this result however it is necessary that genius should not be thrown off its balance by deliberate ambition or too much preoccupied by the immediate desire to succeed by his conformity to all these conditions borrow has become without giving a thought to such purpose the quevedo and the mendoza of modern england beyond all this there is quite another and perhaps an even more potent reason why the critics of a later generation have felt constrained to place this work of borrows upon a higher pedestal than their predecessors did as within the four angles of a painting there is nothing more difficult to confine than sunlight and atmosphere so in literature is it a task of the highest achievement to compass the wind on the heath the sunshine and the rain we know the dark background the mystery and the awe of the forest how powerfully they are suggested to us by some old writers and some modern ones such as spenser and fouqué by the author of the pathfinder and thoreau the scent of the soil once again in rain and in shine is it not conveyed to us with an astonishing distinctness that is the product of a literary endowment of the rarest order by such writers as izaak walton and robert burns and among recent writers in varying degrees by richard jefferies and by barnes by t e brown and thomas hardy and then there is the kindred touch hardly if at all less rare which evokes for us the camaraderie and blithe spirit of the highway the winding road the flashing stream the bordering coppice the view from the crest the twinkling lights at nightfall from the sheltering inn traceable in a long line of our most cherished writers from chaucer and lithgow and nash defoe and fielding and hazlitt and holcroft the fascination of the road that these writers have tried to communicate has never perhaps been expressed with a nicer discernment than in the confessions of rousseau that inveterate pedestrian who walked europe to the rhythm of ideas as epochmaking as any that have ever emanated from the mind of man la chose que je regrette le plus writes rousseau dans les details de ma vie dont jai perdu la mémoire est de navoir pas fait des journaux de mes voyages jamais je nai tant pensé tant existé tant vécu tant été moi si jose ainsi dire que dans ceux que jai faits seul et à pied la marche a quelque chose qui anime et avive mes idées je ne puis presque penser quand je reste en place il faut que mon corps soit en branle pour y mettre mon esprit la vue de la campagne la succession des aspects agréables le grand air le grand appétit la bonne sante que je gagne en marchant la liberté du cabaret léloignement de tout ce qui me fait sentir ma dépendance de tout ce qui me rappelle à ma situation tout cela dégage mon âme it is a possession in a rare degree of this wonderful openair quality as a writer that constrains us in our generation to condone any offences against the mint and anise and cummin decrees of literary infallibility that borrow may have from time to time committed and when it is realised in addition what a unique knowledge he possessed of the daily life the traditions the folklore and the dialects of the strange races of vagrants forming such a picturesque element in the life of the road the documentary value as apart from the literary interest of borrows work becomes more and more manifest lavengro is not a book it is true to open sesame to the first comer or to yield up one tithe of its charm upon a first acquaintance yet in spite of the foaming vipers as borrow styles his critics lavengros roots have already struck deep into the soil of english literature as dr hake predicted that they would we know something about the dim retreating arcady from dr jessopp we know something of the old farmers and tranters and woodlanders from hardy something of late georgian london from dickens something of the old lancashire millhands from mrs gaskell andsomething of provincial townlife in the forties and fifties from george eliot it has fallen to borrow to hold up the mirror to wild nature on the roadside and the heath the personages in these inimitable books are not merely snapshots they are living pictures and more than that the people are moving about amid fluttering leaves and flickering sunlight and waves of shadow and rippling brooks one neither misses the colours of the landscapes nor the very sounds of the voices moreover the characters though we feel that they have never come within the range of our experience yet did actually live and move and talk as they are represented and we know too that such characters have passed away from our earthimproved off the face of it and we regret in spite of ourselves that these gypsies are gone the rogues will never come back a feeling of disappointment is apt to come over us as we read and we are ready to stop and ask angrily why cant we drop in among the tents and see an ursula or a pakomovna and have our fortunes told as of yore and we know that it cannot be and that the romany rye is a being who lived and moved in a different age from ours as different as the age of hector and achilles when warriors fought in their chariots round the walls of troy and the longhaired achaians hurled their spears and stole one anothers horses in the darkness and kings made long speeches armed to the teeth and ran away with other kings wives or multiplied their own we go on to confess to ourselves that we must be content with hearing about all the strange experience of the romany rye at secondhand and since it must be so we shall do well to surrender ourselves to such a magician as this and make the best of it after the publication of the romany rye in borrow made one more contribution to belles lettres in the book called wild wales issued in three volumes in it commemorates a journey made in the summer of while its heroic championship of the bardic literature recalls the earlier enthusiasm for ab gwilym if after his return from spain a definite sphere of activity abroad could have been allotted to borrow by preference in the east as he himself desired we might have had from his pen contributions to the study of eastern life that would have added lustre to a group of writers already brilliantly represented in england by curzon and kinglake lane and morier palgrave and burton with burtons love of roving adventure of strange tongues and of anthropology in its widest sense the author of the bible in spain had many points in common as it was the later years of borrows life were spent somewhat moodily and with some of the mystery of swifts or of rousseaus at oulton near lowestoft whence at christmas he sent a message to the neighbouring hermit edward fitzgerald at woodbridge in the vain hope of eliciting a visit a his wife who had been won with her widows jointure and dower during the flush of his missionary successes in died at the end of january b and on july th after years spent in a strange seclusion at oulton tended latterly by his stepdaughter henrietta george borrow was found dead in his bed dying as he had lived alone not long after his death which took place when he was seventyeight borrows oulton home was pulled down all that now remains to mark the spot where it once stood are the old summerhouse in which he wrote lavengro and the ragged firtrees that sighed the requiem of his last hours without appealing to the shires but in the eastern counties alone he has been commemorated since his death by such writers as henry dutt and whitwell elwin by egmont hake by theodore wattsdunton and by dr jessopp and now ere the close of the century it has fallen to the lot of yet another east anglian to place a small stone upon the cairn of george borrow ii the two books lavengro and romany rye are in reality one work an unfinished autobiography commenced upon a moderate and quite feasible scale but after about a third of the ground is covered the scale is enormously increased the narrative encumbered by a vast amount of detail makes less and less progress and finally stops short without any obvious but rather a lame and impotent conclusion at chapter xlvii of the romany rye or chapter cxlvii of the work considered as one whole the disproportion of the scale will be sufficiently indicated when we point out that the first twentytwo years of the authors life are treated pretty equally in fiftyseven chapters i to lvii the remaining ninety chapters lviii to cxlvii are wholly taken up by the incidents of less than four months the four summer months of the first twentytwo years of the authors life are far from commonplace the interest is well sustained but is seldom intenseat no point is the authors memory sufficiently teeming to cause an overflow but with the conclusion of his sojourn in london may nd commences an itinerant life the novelty of which graves every incident in the most vivid possible manner upon the writers recollection with his emancipation from town life a new graphic impulse is developed borrow seizes a new palette and sets to work with fresher colours upon a stupendous canvas this canvas may be described as taking the form of a triptych in the first compartment we have the first sensations of the roadfarers life and some minor adventures a visit to stonehenge the strange meeting with a returned convict who turns out to be the old applewomans son the vignette of the hostelry with the figures of the huge fat landlord and the handmaid jenny the visit to the stranger gentleman who protects himself by touching against evil chance the interview with the rev mr platitude and the bargain struck with the travelling tinker jack slingsby whose stockintrade and profession the writer determines to adopt then comes the wordmasters detection in his new sphere of life by the malignant gipsy godmother mrs herne from whose remorseless attempt to poison him he is rescued by the kindly hearted welsh preacher peter williams and his wife winifred in requital he manages to relieve the good man of a portion of the load of superstitious terror by which he is burdened this section of the narrative is terminated by a graphic description of hisrenewal of associateship with his old friend jasper petulengro the satisfaction he gives that worthy for having been the innocent cause of mrs hernes death and his decision to pitch his tent in the dingle chapters lviii to lxxxii are taken up with the foregoing incidents which lead up to the central episode of the autobiography the settlement in the dingle with which the reader is here presented this episode forming the second panel in the detailed scheme occupies chapters lxxxiii to cxvi but it is bisected near the middle by the termination of lavengro at chapter c the two parts are united now for the first time and are given a prominent setting in relief from the rest of the narrative the third compartment of the triptych which occupies chapters cxvii to cxlvii that is chapters xvii to xlvii of the romany rye is devoted to what we may call the horsedealing episode after the loss of isopel berners the romany rye as the authorhero is now termed consoles himself by the purchase of a splendid horse to obtain which he consents much against his will to accept a loan of from jasper petulengro the product of that worthys labours in the prize ring he travels across england with the horse meeting with adventures by the way narrating them to others and obtaining some curious autobiographical narratives in return finally he reaches horncastle and sells the animal at the horse fair there for here in august the narrative of his life abruptly ends it must not be supposed by any means that the interest of borrows two autobiographical volumes is concentrated in the last eighteen chapters of lavengro and the first sixteen chapters of the romany rye the quality of continuity is it is true best preserved in the dingle episode artistically the brynhildic figure of isopel serves as the best relief that could be found for borrows own titanic self there is undoubtedly a feeling of unity here which is hardly to be felt in any other part of the borrovian odyssey it is nevertheless true that taken as a whole a marked characteristic of the two volumes is the evenness with which the charms are scattered hither and thither betwixt the four covers attractive therefore as the isopel berners episode unquestionably is and convenient as it is to the reader to have it detached for him in its unity its perusal must not be taken for a moment to absolve the lover of good literature from traversing chapter by chapter canto by canto the whole of the borrevian epic it is outside the dingle that he will have to look for the faithfully described bewilderment of the old applewoman after the loss of her book and for the compassionate delineation of the old man with the bees and the donkey who gave the young rye to drink of mead at his cottage and was unashamed at having shed tears on the road the most heroic of the pugilistic encounters takes place it is true in the thick of the dingle but it is elsewhere that the reader will have to look for the description of the memorable thrashing inflicted upon the bullying stagecoachman by the elderly individual who followed the craft of engraving and learnt fisticuffs from sergeant broughton in the same neighbourhood he will find the admirable vignette of the old man who could read the inscription on chinese crockery pots but could not tell whats oclock and the life narratives of the jockey and of the inexpert thimblerigger murtagh who was imprisoned three years for interrupting the popes game at picquet but finally won his way by cardsharping to the very threshold of the cardinalate in the second half of the romany rye too he will find the noble apostrophes to youth and ale and england the true country for adventures which he will compare as examples of borrovian eloquence with the stirring description of embattled england in the third chapter of lavengro or the apostrophe to the irish cob and the authors first ride in chapter thirteen borrows is a wonderful book for one to lose ones way in among the dense undergrowth but it is a still grander book for the reader to lose himself in in the dingle best of all he can forget his own troublesome personality as completely as if he were in the depths of the ancient forest along with gurth and wamba labyrinthine however as the autobiography may at first sight appear the true lover of borrow will soon have little difficulty in finding the patteran or gypsy trail for indeed the romany element runs persistently as a chorusthread through the whole of the autobiographical writings which serves as a clue to the delights of which his work is so rich a storehouse the question that really exercises borrovians most is the relative merit of stories and sections of the narrativethe comparative excellence of the early life in lavengro and of the later detached episodes in the romany rye most are in some sort of agreement as to the supremacy of the dingle episode which has this advantage borrow is always at his best when dealing with strange beings and abnormal experiences when he is describing ordinary mortals he treats them with coldness as mere strangers the commonplace towndwellers seldom arouse his sympathy never kindle his enthusiasm he is quite another being when we wander by his side within the bounds of his enchanted dingle this history of certain doings in a staffordshire dingle during the month of july begins with a battleroyal which places borrow high amongst the narrators of human conflicts from the days of the iliad to those of pierce egan yet the chapters that set forth this episode of the dingle are less concerned with the gestes than with the sayings of its occupants rare indeed are the dramatic dialogues amid the sylvan surroundings of the treecrowned hollow that surpass in interest even the vivid details of the memorable fray between the flaming tinman and the pugilistic philologer preeminent amongst the dialogues are those between the male occupant of the dingle and the popish propagandist known as the man in black more fascinating still perhaps are the wordmasters conversations with jasper most wonderful of all in the opinion of many is his logomachy with ursula under the thorn bush we shall not readily forget jaspers complaints that all the oldfashioned goodtempered constables are going to be set aside or his gloomy anticipations of the iron roads in which people are to thunder along in vehicles pushed forward by fire and smoke as for his comparison of the gypsies to cuckoos the roguish charring fellows for whom every one has a bad word yet whom every one is glad to greet once again when the spring comes round or ursulas exposition of gypsy love and marriagebeneath the hedgethese are borrow at his best as he is most familiar to us in the open air among gypsies with the popish emissary it is otherwise his portrait is the creation of borrows most studied hatred yet it must be admitted that the man in black is a triumph of complex characterisation a joyous liver and an unscrupulous libertine sceptical as voltaire as atheistic as a german professor as practical as a jew banker as subtle as a jesuit he has as many ways of converting the folks among whom he is thrown as panurge had of eating the corn in ear for the simple and credulous crosses and beads for the hardhearted and venalmaterial considerations for the cultured and educateda fine tissue of epigrams and anthropology for the ladiesflattery and badinage a spiritual ancestor of anatole frances marvellous fulllength figure of jerôme coignard borrows conception takes us back first to rabelais and secondly to the seventeenthcentury conviction of the profound machiavellism of jesuitry the man in black and jasper are great but the master attraction of the region that we are to traverse is admittedly isopel berners it will perhaps be observed that our heroine makes her appearance on the stage rather more in the fashion of molly seagrim than of that other engaging amazon of romance diana vernon whose long hair streaming in the wind forms one single point of resemblance to our fair isopel in other respects certainly no two heroines could be more dissimilar unaided even by the slightest assistance from the graphic arts the difficulty of picturing the lineaments of this muscular beauty as she first burst on the sight of our autobiographer upon the declivity of the dingle may be freely confessed ere an attempt is made to describe her we know however on the testimony of a sincere admirer that she was over six feet high with looseflowing flaxen hair that she wore a tight bodice and a skirt of blue to match the colour of her eyes and that eighteen summers had passed over her head since she first saw the light in the great house of long melford a nursery in which she learnt to fear god and take her own part and a place the very name of which she came to regard as a synonym for a strong right arm borrows first impression of her was one of immensity she was big enough he said to have been born in a church almost simultaneously he observed her affinity to those scandinavian divinities to which he assigned the first place in the pantheon of his affections she reminded him indeed of the legendary ingeborg queen of norway it is remarkable and well worth noticing that the impression that she produced was instantaneous our wanderer had never been impressed in any similar fashion by any of the gypsy women with whom he was brought into contact though as many a legend and ballad can attest such women have often exerted extraordinary attraction over englishmen of pure blood but it is evident that his physical admiration was reserved for a tall blonde of the scandinavian type to which he gave the name of a brynhilde hence notwithstanding his love of the economics of gypsy life his gypsy women are for the most part no more than scenic characters they clothe and beautify the scene but they have little dramatic force about them and when he comes to delineate a heroine isopel berners she is physically the very opposite of a romany chi fewer words will suffice to describe isopels first impressions of her future partner in the dingle she unmistakably regarded him as a chaffing fellow who was not quite right in his head and there is reason for believing that though she came to entertain a genuine regard for the young squire her opinions as to the condition of his brain underwent no sensible modification she herself is fairly explicit on this subject she seems indeed to have arrived at the deliberate conviction that if not abnormally selfish he was at any rate fundamentally mad and there was perhaps a germ of truth in the conclusion sufficient at any rate to colour lombrosos theory of the inherent madness of men of genius one of the testimonies that we have as to borrows later life at oulton is to the effect that he got bewildered at times and fancied himself wodin but the substratum of sanity is strongly exhibited in the remedy which he himself applied what do you think i do when i get bewildered after this fashion i go out to the sty and listen to the grunting of the pigs until i get back to myself of isopels history we know extremely little save what she herself tells us her father was an officer who was killed in a naval action before he could fulfil the promise of marriage he had made to her mother a small milliner who died in the workhouse at long melford within three months of the effort of giving birth to an amazon so large and so fierce and so well able to take her own part as isopel at fourteen this fine specimen of workhouse upbringing was placed in service from which she emancipated herself by knocking down her mistress after two years more at the large house she was once more apprenticed and this time knocked down her master in return for an affront a second return to the workhouse appearing inadvisable she traversed the highways of england in various capacities and became acquainted with some of those remarkable though obscure characters who travelled the roads of our country at that period a sense of loneliness drove her among unworthy travelling companions such as the flying tinker and grey moll in whose society she breaks upon our notice some of the vagrants with whom she came into contact had occasionally attempted to lay violent hands upon her person and effects but had been invariably humbled by her without the aid of either justice or constable of her specific exploits as a bruiser we hear of at least two near dover once the cart she and her old mistress travelled with was stopped by two sailors who would have robbed and stripped the owners let me get down she exclaimed simply and so saying she got down and fought with them both until they turned round and ran away on another occasion while combing out her long hair beneath a hedge she was insulted by a jockey starting up though her hair was unbound she promptly gave him what he characterised as a most confounded whopping and the only drubbing i ever had in my life and lor how with her right hand she fibbed me while she held me round the neck with her left arm i was soon glad to beg her pardon on my knees which she gave me in a moment when she saw me in that conditionbeing the most placable creature in the world and not only her pardon but one of the hairs which i longed for which i put through a shilling for purposes of pleasant deception at country fairs the hair with the shilling attached to it eventually became a treasured possession of the romany rye rude as some of these characteristics may appear we are left in no manner of doubt as to the essential nobility befitting her name of miss bernersher character and bearing her carriage especially of the neck and shoulders reminded the postilion of the marchioness of and he took her unhesitatingly for a young lady of high rank and distinction who had temporarily left her friends and was travelling in the direction of gretna green with the fortunate rye the wordmaster in disabusing the postilion of this idea gave utterance to the conviction that he might search the world in vain for a nature more heroic and devoted like a lady of the highest quality the beauteous queen of the dingle was subject to the vapours and to occasional fits of inexplicable weeping but as a general rule she shared with borrow himself a proud contempt for that mad puppy gentility and her predominant characteristic like his was the simplicity that puzzled by reason of its directness and its purity that these qualities were not unaccompanied by a considerable amount of hauteur is shown by her uncompromising rejection of the ceremonial advances made to her by that accomplished courtier the man in black lovely virgin said he with a graceful bow and stretching out his hand allow me to salute your fingers i am not in the habit of shaking hands with strangers said belle i did not presume to request to shake hands with you said the man in black i merely wished to be permitted to salute with my lips the extremities of your two forefingers i never permit anything of the kind said belle i do not approve of such unmanly ways his importunity is rebuked more forcibly upon another occasion when the nymph bids the priest with asperity to hold his mumping gibberish the striking beauty of belle especially that of her blue eyes and flaxen hair and the impressiveness of her demeanour calm and proud which compelled the similitude to a serious and queenly heroine such as queen theresa of hungary or brynhilda the valkyrie the beloved of sigurd the serpentkiller is emphasised by the contrast drawn between her and the handsome brunette mrs petulengro who is for the nonce subjugated by isopels beauty and craves the privilege of acting as her tirewoman alas as is so often the case in life lavengro and the reader are only just beginning to realise the beauty and the value of the bellissima as the man in black calls her when she is on the point of sinking beneath our horizon passing away like the brief music of an aubade rapidly much too rapidly do we approach that summer dawn when belle dressed neatly and plainly her hair no longer plaited in romany fashion or floating in the wind but secured by a comb uncovered no longer but wearing a bonnet her features very pale allowed her cold hand to be wrungit was for the last timeby the unconscious rye the latter ascended to the plain and thence looked down towards the dingle isopel berners stood at the mouth the beams of the early morning sun shone full on her noble face and figure i waved my hands towards her she slowly lifted up her right arm i turned away and never saw isopel berners again hardly less forlorn is the reader than the philologist when the latter arrives back at

her armenian determined when the need is past to regularise his uncertificated relations with the glorious damozel and resigned when concession is fruitless to sink those objections to america which belle had disavowed but which he had been proud to share with disbanded soldiers sextons and excisemen to this decision his tortuous conferences with jasper and his frank soliloquy in the dingle had bent him fully fortyeight hours before belles ultimate departure unwilling though he was to incur the yoke of matrimony i figured myself in america says he in his reverie over the charcoal fire in an immense forest clearing the land destined by my exertions to become a fruitful and smiling plain methought i heard the crash of the huge trees as they fell beneath my axe and then i bethought me that a man was intended to marryi ought to marry and if i married where was i likely to be more happy as a husband and a father than in america engaged in tilling the ground i fancied myself in america engaged in tilling the ground assisted by an enormous progenywell why not marry and go and till the ground in america i was young and youth was the time to marry in and to labour in i had the use of all my faculties my eyes it is true were rather dull from early study but i could see tolerably well with them and they were not bleared i felt my arms and thighs and teeththey were strong and sound enough so now was the time to labour to marry eat strong flesh and beget strong childrenthe power of doing all this would pass away with youth which was terribly transitory i bethought me that a time would come when my eyes would bebleared and perhaps sightless my arms and thighs strengthless and sapless when my teeth would shake in my jaws even supposing they did not drop out no going awooing then no labouring no eating strong flesh and begetting lusty children then and i bethought me how when all this should be i should bewail the days of my youth as misspent provided i had not in them founded for myself a home and begotten strong children to take care of me in the days when i could not take care of myself and thinking of these things i became sadder and sadder and stared vacantly upon the fire until my eyes closed in a doze it is significant that upon his return from the dream that followed this reverie the wouldbe colonist blew upon the embers and filled and heated the kettle that he might be able to welcome isopel with a cup of the beverage that she loved it was the newly awakened benedick brushing his hat in the morning but unhappily his conversion was not so complete as benedicks lovemaking and armenian do not go together and in the colloquy that ensued belle could not feel assured that the man who proposed to conjugate the verb to love in armenian was master of his intentions in plain english it was even so the man of tongues lacked speech wherewith to make manifest his passion the vocabulary of the wordmaster was insufficient to convince the workhouse girl of one of the plainest meanings a man can well have from the banter of the man of learning the queen of the dingle sought refuge in a precipitate flight almost simultaneously the wordmaster albeit with reluctance decided that it was high time to give over his mocking and scoffing when he returned with this resolve to the dingle isopel berners had quitted it never to return yet ever and anon that splendid and pathetic figure will cross the sky line of his mental visionand of ours then the image of isopel berners came into my mind and the thought how i had lost her for ever and how happy i

his wife the tinker was greatly depressed having recently been intimidated by a rival one bosville the flaming tinman and forced by threats to quit the road the wordmaster who meditated passing the summer as an amateur vagrant and had some or in his pocket conceived the idea of buying the ponycart the implements and the beat of the tinker one jack slingsby whose face he remembered having seen some ten years before i want a home and work he said to the tinker as for a home i suppose i can contrive to make a home out of your tent and cart and as for work i must learn to be a tinker it would not be hard for one of my trade to be a tinker what better can i do what about the naming tinman said the tinker oh dont be afraid on my account said the wordmaster if i were to meet him i could easily manage him one way or the other i know all kinds of strange words and names and as i told you before i sometimes hit people when they put me out he accordingly purchases slingsbys property and further invests in a waggoners frock to the pony he gives the name of ambrol which signifies in gypsy a pear he spends a first night under the hedge in a drizzling rain and then spends two or three days in endeavouring to teach himself the mysteries of his new trade while living in this solitary way he is detected by mrs herne an old gypsy woman one of the hairy ones as she terms herself who carried a good deal of devils tinder about with her and had a bitter grudge against the wordmaster she hated him for having wormed himself as she fancied into the confidence of the gypsies and learned their language she regarded him further as the cause of differences between herself and her sonsinlawas an apple of discord in the romany camp she employed her grandchild leonora to open relations in a friendly way with lavengro and then to persuade him to eat of a drabbed of poisoned cake lavengro was grievously sick but was saved in the nick of time by the appearance upon the scene of a welsh preacher peter williams and his wifetwo good souls who wandered over all wales and the greater part of england comforting the hearts of the people with their doctrine and doing all the good they could they never slept beneath a roof unless the weather was very severe the preacher had a heavy burden upon his mind to wit the sin against the holy ghost committed when he was but a lad lavengro journeys for several days with the preacher and his wife assuring the former that in common with most other boys he himself when of tender years had committed twenty such sins and felt no uneasiness about them the young mans conversation had the effect of greatly lightening the despair of the old preacher the latter begged the wordmaster to accompany him into wales on the border however lavengro encountered a gypsy pal of his youthful days jasper petulengro and turned back with him mr petulengro informs him of the end of his old enemy mrs herne baffled in her designs against the stranger the old woman had hanged herself you observe brother said petulengro springing from his horse there is a point at present between us there can be no doubt that you are the cause of mrs hernes deathinnocently you will say but still the cause now i shouldnt like it to be known that i went up and down the country with a pal who was the cause of my motherinlaws death that is to say unless he gave me satisfaction so they fell to with their naked fists on a broad strip of grass in the shade under some lofty trees in half an hours time lavengros face was covered with blood whereupon mr petulengro exclaimed put your hands down brother im satisfied blood has been shed which is all that can be expected for an old woman who carried so much brimstone about with her as mrs herne so we resumed our route mr petulengro sitting sideways on his horse and i driving my little ponycart and when we had proceeded about three miles we came to a small publichouse which bore the sign of the silent woman where we stopped to refresh our cattle and ourselves and as we sat over our bread and ale it came to pass that mr petulengro asked me various questions and amongst others how i intended to dispose of myself i told him that i did not know whereupon with considerable frankness he invited me to his camp and told me that if i chose to settle down amongst them and become a rommany chal i should have his wifes sister ursula who was still unmarried and occasionally talked of me i declined his offer assigning as a reason the recent death of mrs herne of which i was the cause although innocent a pretty life i should lead with those two said i when they came to know it pooh said mr petulengro they will never know it i shant blab and as for leonora that girl has a head on her shoulders unlike the woman in the sign said i whose head is cut off you speak nonsense mr petulengro as long as a woman has a head on her shoulders shell talkbut leaving women out of the case it is impossible to keep anything a secret an old master of mine told me so long ago i have moreover another reason for declining your offer i am at present not disposed for society i am become fond of solitude i wish i could find some quiet place to which i could retire to hold communion with my own thoughts and practise if i thought fit either of my trades what trades said mr petulengro why the one which i have lately been engaged in or my original one which i confess i should like better that of a kaulomescro ah i have frequently heard you talk of making horseshoes said mr petulengro i however never saw you make one and no one else that i am aware i dont believe come brother dont be angryits quite possible that you may have donethings which neither i nor any one else has seen you do and that such things may some day or other come to light as you say nothing can be kept secret be that however as it may pay the reckoning and let us be going i think i can advise you to just such a kind of place as you seem to want and how do you know that i have got wherewithal to pay the reckoning i demanded brother said mr petulengro i was just now looking in your face which exhibited the very look of a person conscious of the possession of property there was nothing hungry or sneaking in it pay the reckoning brother and when we were once more upon the road mr petulengro began to talk of the place which he conceived would serve me as a retreat under present circumstances i tell you frankly brother that it is a queer kind of place and i am not very fond of pitching my tent in it it is so surprisingly dreary it is a deep dingle in the midst of a large field on an estate about which there has been a lawsuit for some years past i daresay you will be quiet enough for the nearest town is five miles distant and there are only a few huts and hedge publichouses in the neighbourhood brother i am fond of solitude myself but not that kind of solitude i like a quiet heath where i can pitch my house but i always like to have a gay stirring place not far off where the women can pen dukkerin a and i myself can sell or buy a horse if needfulsuch a place as the chong gav b i never feel so merry as when there brother or on the heath above it where i taught you rommany shortly after this discourse we reached a milestone and a few yards from the milestone on the left hand was a crossroad thereupon mr petulengro said brother my path lies to the left if you choose to go with me to my camp good if not chal devlehi c but i again refused mr petulengros invitation and shaking him by the hand proceeded forward alone and about ten miles farther on i reached the town of which he had spoken and following certain directions which he had given discovered though not without some difficulty the dingle which he had mentioned it was a deep hollow in the midst of a wide field the shelving sides were overgrown with trees and bushes a belt of sallows surrounded it on the top a steep winding path led down into the depths practicable however for a light cart like mine at the bottom was an open space and there i pitched my tent and there i contrived to put up my forge i will here ply the trade of kaulomescro said ichapter iithe shoeing of ambrol it has always struck me that there is something highly poetical about a forge i am not singular in this opinion various individuals have assured me that they never pass by one even in the midst of a crowded town without experiencing sensations which they can scarcely define but which are highly pleasurable i have a decided penchant for forges especially rural ones placed in some quaint quiet spota dingle for example which is a poetical place or at a meeting of four roads which is still more so for how many a superstitionand superstition is the soul of poetryis connected with these cross roads i love to light upon such a one especially after nightfall as everything about a forge tells to most advantage at night the hammer sounds more solemnly in the stillness the glowing particles scattered by the stroke sparkle with more effect in the darkness whilst the sooty visage of the sastramescro a half in shadow and half illumined by the red and partial blaze of the forge looks more mysterious and strange on such occasions i draw in my horses rein and seated in the saddle endeavour to associate with the picture before mein itself a picture of romance whatever of the wild and wonderful i have read of in books or have seen with mine own eyes in connection with forges i believe the life of any blacksmith especially a rural one would afford materials for a highly poetical history i do not speak unadvisedly having the honour to be free of the forge and therefore fully competent to give an opinion as to what might be made out of the forge by some dextrous hand certainly the strangest and most entertaining life ever written is that of a blacksmith of the olden north a certain volundr or velint b who lived in woods and thickets made keen swordsso keen indeed that if placed by a running stream they would fairly divide an object however slight which was borne against them by the waterand who eventually married a kings daughter by whom he had a son who was as bold a knight as his father was a cunning blacksmith i never see a forge at night when seated on the back of my horse at the bottom of a dark lane but i somehow or other associate it with the exploits of this extraordinary fellow with many other extraordinary things amongst which as i have hinted before are particular passages of my own life one or two of which i shall perhaps relate to the reader i never associate vulcan and his cyclops with the idea of a forge these gentry would be the very last people in the world to flit across my mind whilst gazing at the forge from the bottom of the dark lane the truth is they are highly unpoetical fellows as well they may be connected as they are with grecian mythology at the very mention of their names the forge burns dull and dim as if snowballs had been suddenly flung into it the only remedy is to ply the bellows an operation which i now hasten to perform i am in the dingle making a horseshoe having no other horses on whose hoofs i could exercise my art i made my first essay on those of my own horse if that could be called horse which horse was none being only a pony perhaps if i had sought all england i should scarcely have found an animal more in need of the kind offices of the smith on three of his feet there were no shoes at all and on the fourth only a remnant of one on which account his hoofs were sadly broken and lacerated by his late journeys over the hard and flinty roads you belonged to a tinker before said i addressing the animal but now you belong to a smith it is said that the household of the shoemaker invariably go worse shod than that of any other craft that may be the case of those who make shoes of leather but it shant be said of the household of him who makes shoes of iron at any rate it shant be said of mine i tell you what my gry a whilst you continue with me you shall both be better shod and better fed than you were with your late master i am in the dingle making a petul b and i must here observe that whilst i am making a horseshoe the reader need not be surprised if i speak occasionally in the language of the lord of the horseshoemr petulengro i have for some time past been plying the peshota or bellows endeavouring to raise up the yag or fire in my primitive forge the angar or coals are now burning fiercely casting forth sparks and long vagescoe chipes or tongues of flame a small bar of sastra or iron is lying in the fire to the length of ten or twelve inches and so far it is hot very hot exceeding hot brother and now you see me prala snatch the bar of iron and place the heated end of it upon the covantza or anvil and forthwith i commence cooring c the sastra as hard as if i had been just engaged by a master at the rate of dui caulor or two shillings a day brother and when i have beaten the iron till it is nearly cool and my arm tired i place it again in the angar and begin again to rouse the fire with the pudomengro which signifies the blowing thing and is another and more common word for bellows and whilst thus employed i sing a gypsy song the sound of which is wonderfully in unison with the hoarse moaning of the pudamengro and ere the song is finished the iron is again hot and malleable behold i place it once more on the covantza and recommence hammering and now i am somewhat at fault i am in want of assistance i want you brother or some one else to take the bar out of my hand and support it upon the covantza whilst i applying a chinomescro or kind of chisel to the heated iron cut off with a lusty stroke or two of the shukaro baro or big hammer as much as is required for the petul but having no one to help me i go on hammering till i have fairly knocked off as much as i want and then i place the piece in the fire and again apply the bellows and take up the song where i left it off and when i have finished the song i take out the iron but this time with my plaistra or pincers and then i recommence hammering turning the iron round and round with my pincers and now i bend the iron and lo and behold it has assumed something the outline of a petuli am not going to enter into farther details with respect to the processit was rather a wearisome one i had to contend with various disadvantages my forge was a rude one my tools might have been better i was in want of one or two highly necessary implements but above all manual dexterity though free of the forge i had not practised the albeytarian art for very many years never sincebut stay it is not my intention to tell the reader at least in this place how and when i became a blacksmith there was one thing however which stood me in good stead in my labour the same thing which through life has ever been of incalculable utility to me and has not unfrequently supplied the place of friends money and many other things of almost equal importanceiron perseverance without which all the advantages of time and circumstances are of very little avail in any undertaking i was determined to make a horseshoe and a good one in spite of every obstacleay in spite o dukkerin at the end of four days during which i had fashioned and refashioned the thing at least fifty times i had made a petul such as no master of the craft need have been ashamed of with the second shoe i had less difficulty and by the time i had made the fourth i would have scorned to take off my hat to the best smith in cheshire but i had not yet shod my little gry a this i proceeded now to do after having first well pared the hoofs with my churi b i applied each petul hot glowing hot to the pindro c oh how the hoofs hissed and oh the pleasant pungent odour which diffused itself through the dingle an odour good for an ailing spirit i shoed the little horse bravelymerely pricked him once slightly with a cafi d for doing which i remember he kicked me down i was not disconcerted however but getting up promised to be more cautious in future and having finished the operation i filed the hoof well with the rin baro e then dismissed him to graze amongst the trees and putting my smaller tools into the muchtar f i sat down on my stone and supporting my arm upon my knee leaned my head upon my hand heaviness had come over mechapter iiithe dark hour comes upon lavengro and his soul is heavy within him heaviness had suddenly come over me heaviness of heart and of body also i had accomplished the task which i had imposed upon myself and now that nothing more remained to do my energies suddenly deserted me and i felt without strength and without hope several causes perhaps cooperated to bring about the state in which i then felt myself it is not improbable that my energies had been overstrained during the work the progress of which i have attempted to describe and everyone is aware that the results of overstrained energies are feebleness and lassitudewant of nourishment might likewise have something to do with it during my sojourn in the dingle my food had been of the simplest and most unsatisfying description by no means calculated to support the exertion which the labour i had been engaged upon required it had consisted of coarse oaten cakes and hard cheese and for beverage i had been indebted to a neighbouring pit in which in the heat of the day i frequently saw not golden or silver fish but frogs and eftes swimming about i am however inclined to believe that mrs hernes cake had quite as much to do with the matter as insufficient nourishment i had never entirely recovered from the effects of its poison but had occasionally especially at night been visited by a grinding pain in the stomach and my whole body had been suffused with cold sweat and indeed these memorials of the drow have never entirely disappearedeven at the present time they display themselves in my system especially after much fatigue of body and excitement of mind so there i sat in the dingle upon my stone nerveless and hopeless by whatever cause or causes that state had been producedthere i sat with my head leaning upon my hand and so i continued a long long time at last i lifted my head from my hand and began to cast anxious unquiet looks about the dinglethe entire hollow was now enveloped in deep shadei cast my eyes up there was a golden gleam on the tops of the trees which grew towards the upper parts of the dingle but lower down all was gloom and twilightyet when i first sat down on my stone the sun was right above the dingle illuminating all its depths by the rays which it cast perpendicularly downso i must have sat a long long time upon my stone and now once more i rested my head upon my hand but almost instantly lifted it again in a kind of fear and began looking at the objects before methe forge the tools the branches of the trees endeavouring to follow their rows till they were lost in the darkness of the dingle and now i found my right hand grasping convulsively three forefingers of the left first collectively and then successively wringing them till the joints cracked then i became quiet but not for long suddenly i started up and could scarcely repress the shriek which was rising to my lips was it possible yes all too certain the evil one was upon me the inscrutable horror which i had felt in my boyhood had once more taken possession of me i had thought that it had forsaken me that it would never visit me again that i had outgrown it that i might almost bid defiance to it and i had even begun to think of it without horror as we are in the habit of doing of horrors of which we conceive we run no danger and lo when least thought of it had seized me again every moment i felt it gathering force and making me more wholly its own what should i doresist of course and i did resist i grasped i tore and strove to fling it from me but of what avail were my efforts i could only have got rid of it by getting rid of myself it was a part of myself or rather it was all myself i rushed amongst the trees and struck at them with my bare fists and dashed my head against them but i felt no pain how could i feel pain with that horror upon me and then i flung myself on the ground gnawed the earth and swallowed it and then i looked round it was almost total darkness in the dingle and the darkness added to my horror i could no longer stay there up i rose from the ground and attempted to escape at the bottom of the winding path which led up the acclivity i fell over something which was lying on the ground the something moved and gave a kind of whine it was my little horse which had made that place its lairmy little horse my only companion and friend in that now awful solitude i reached the mouth of the dingle the sun was just sinking in the far west behind me the fields were flooded with his last gleams how beautiful everything looked in the last gleams of the sun i felt relieved for a moment i was no longer in the horrid dingle in another minute the sun was gone and a big cloud occupied the place where he had been in a little time it was almost as dark as it had previously been in the open part of the dingle my horror increased what was i to doit was of no use fighting against the horrorthat i saw the more i fought against it the stronger it became what should i do say my prayers ah why not so i knelt down under the hedge and said our father but that was of no use and now i could no longer repress cries the horror was too great to be borne what should i do run to the nearest town or village and request the assistance of my fellowmen no that i was ashamed to do notwithstanding the horror was upon me i was ashamed to do that i knew they would consider me a maniac if i went screaming amongst them and i did not wish to be considered a maniac moreover i knew that i was not a maniac for i possessed all my reasoning powers only the horror was upon methe screaming horror but how were indifferent people to distinguish between madness and this screaming horror so i thought and reasoned and at last i determined not to go amongst my fellowmen whatever the result might be i went to the mouth of the dingle and there placing myself on my knees i again said the lords prayer but it was of no use praying seemed to have no effect over the horror the unutterable fear appeared rather to increase than diminish and i again uttered wild cries so loud that i was apprehensive they would be heard by some chance passenger on the neighbouring road i therefore went deeper into the dingle i sat down with my back against a thorn bush the thorns entered my flesh and when i felt them i pressed harder against the bush i thought the pain of the flesh might in some degree counteract the mental agony presently i felt them no longer the power of the mental horror was so great that it was impossible with that upon me to feel any pain from the thorns i continued in this posture a long time undergoing what i cannot describe and would not attempt if iwere able several times i was on the point of starting up and rushing anywhere but i restrained myself for i knew i could not escape from myself so why should i not remain in the dingle so i thought and said to myself for my reasoning powers were still uninjured at last it appeared to me that the horror was not so strong not quite so strong upon me was it possible that it was relaxing its grasp releasing its prey o what a mercy but it could not beand yet i looked up to heaven and clasped my hands and said our father i said no more i was too agitated and now i was almost sure that the horror had done its worst after a little time i arose and staggered down yet farther into the dingle i again found my little horse on the same spot as before i put my hand to his mouth he licked my hand i flung myself down by him and put my arms round his neck the creature whinnied and appeared to sympathize with me what a comfort to have any one even a dumb brute to sympathize with me at such a moment i clung to my little horse as if for safety and protection i laid my head on his neck and felt almost calm presently the fear returned but not so wild as before it subsided came again again subsided then drowsiness came over me and at last i fell asleep my head supported on the neck of the little horse i awoke it was dark dark nightnot a star was to be seenbut i felt no fear the horror had left me i arose from the side of the little horse and went into my tent lay down and again went to sleep i awoke in the morning weak and sore and shuddering at the remembrance of what i had gone through on the preceding day the sun was shining brightly but it had not yet risen high enough to show its head above the trees which fenced the eastern side of the dingle on which account the dingle was wet and dank from the dews of the night i kindled my fire and after sitting by it for some time to warm my frame i took some of the coarse food which i have already mentioned notwithstanding my late struggle and the coarseness of the fare i ate with appetite my provisions had by this time been very much diminished and i saw that it would be speedily necessary in the event of my continuing to reside in the dingle to lay in a fresh store after my meal i went to the pit and filled a can with water which i brought to the dingle and then again sat down on my stone i considered what i should next do it was necessary to do something or my life in this solitude would be unsupportable what should i do rouse up my forge and fashion a horseshoe but i wanted nerve and heart for such an employment moreover i had no motive for fatiguing myself in this manner my own horse was shod no other was at hand and it is hard to work for the sake of working what should i do read yes but i had no other book than the bible which the welsh methodist had given me well why not read the bible i was once fond of reading the bible ay but those days were long gone by however i did not see what else i could do on the present occasionso i determined to read the bibleit was in welsh at any rate it might amuse me so i took the bible out of the sack in which it was lying in the cart and began to read at the place where i chanced to open it i opened it at the part where the history of saul commences at first i read with indifference but after some time my attention was riveted and no wonder i had come to the visitations of saul those dark moments of his when he did and said such unaccountable things it almost appeared to me that i was reading of myself i too had my visitations dark as ever his were o how i sympathized with saul the tall dark man i had read his life before but it had made no impression on me it had never occurred to me that i was like him but i now sympathized with saul for my own dark hour was but recently passed and perhaps would soon return again the dark hour came frequently on saul time wore away i finished the book of saul and closing the volume returned it to its place i then returned to my seat on the stone and thought of what i had read and what i had lately undergone all at once i thought i felt wellknown sensationsa cramping of the breast and a tingling of the soles of the feetthey were what i had felt on the preceding day they were the forerunners of the fear i sat motionless on my stone the sensations passed away and the fear came not darkness was now coming again over the earth the dingle was again in deep shade i roused the fire with the breath of the bellows and sat looking at the cheerful glow it was cheering and comforting my little horse came now and lay down on the ground beside the forge i was not quite deserted i again ate some of the coarse food and drank plentifully of the water which i had fetched in the morning i then put fresh fuel on the fire and sat for a long time looking on the blaze i then went into my tent i awoke on my own calculation about midnightit was pitch dark and there was much fear upon mechapter iva classical encounterlong melford to the rescue two mornings after the period to which i have brought the reader in the preceding chapter i sat by my fire at the bottom of the dingle i had just breakfasted and had finished the last morsel of food which i had brought with me to that solitude what shall i now do said i to myself shall i continue here or decamp this is a sad lonely spotperhaps i had better quit it but whither should i go the wide world is before me but what can i do therein i have been in the world already without much success no i had better remain here the place is lonely it is true but here i am free and independent and can do what i please but i cant remain here without food well i will find my way to the nearest town lay in a fresh supply of provision and come back turning my back upon the world which has turned its back upon me i dont see why i should not write a little sometimes i have pens and an inkhorn and for a writingdesk i can place the bible on my knee i shouldnt wonder if i could write a capital satire on the world on the back of that bible but first of all i must think of supplying myself with food i rose up from the stone on which i was seated determining to go to the nearest town with my little horse and cart and procure what i wanted the nearest town according to my best calculation lay about five miles distant i had no doubt however that by using ordinary diligence i should be back before evening in order to go lighter i determined to leave my tent standing as it was and all the things which i had purchased of the tinker just as they were i need not be apprehensive on their account said i to myself nobody will come here to meddle with themthe great recommendation of this place is its perfect solitudei dare say that i could live here six months without seeing a single human visage i will now harness my little gry and be off to the town at a whistle which i gave the little gry which was feeding on the bank near the uppermost part of the dingle came running to me for by this time he had become so accustomed to me that he would obey my call for all the world as if he had been one of the canine species now said i to him we are going to the town to buy bread for myself and oats for youi am in a hurry to be back therefore i pray you to do your best and to draw me and the cart to the town with all possible speed and to bring us back if you do your best i promise you oats on your return you know the meaning of oats ambrol ambrol whinnied as if to let me know that he understood me perfectly well as indeed he well might as i had never once fed him during the time he had been in my possession without saying the word in question to him now ambrol in the gypsy tongue signifieth a pear so i caparisoned ambrol and then going to the cart removed two or three things from out it into the tent i then lifted up the shafts and was just going to call to the pony to come and be fastened to them when i thought i heard a noise i stood stock still supporting the shaft of the little cart in my hand and bending the right side of my face slightly towards the ground but i could hear nothing the noise which i thought i had heard was not one of those sounds which i was accustomed to hear in that solitudethe note of a bird or the rustling of a bough it wasthere i heard it againa sound very much resembling the grating of a wheel amongst gravel could it proceed from the road oh no the road was too far distant for me to hear the noise of anything moving along it again i listened and now i distinctly heard the sound of wheels which seemed to be approaching the dingle nearer and nearer they drew and presently the sound of wheels was blended with the murmur of voices anon i heard a boisterous shout which seemed to proceed from the entrance of the dingle here are folks at hand said i letting the shaft of the cart fall to the ground is it possible that they can be coming here my doubts on that point if i entertained any were soon dispelled the wheels which had ceased moving for a moment or two were once again in motion and were now evidently moving down the winding path which led to my retreat leaving my cart i came forward and placed myself near the entrance of the open space with my eyes fixed on the path down which my unexpected and i may say unwelcome visitors were coming presently i heard a stamping or sliding as if of a horse in some difficulty and then a loud curse and the next moment appeared a man and a horse and cart the former holding the head of the horse up to prevent him from falling of which he was in danger owing to the precipitous nature of the path whilst thus occupied the head of the man was averted from me when however he had reached the bottom of the descent he turned his head and perceiving me as i stood bareheaded without either coat or waistcoat about two yards from him he gave a sudden start so violent that the backward motion of his hand had nearly flung the horse upon his haunches why dont you move forward said a voice from behind apparently that of a female you are stopping up the way and we shall be all down upon one another and i saw the head of another horse overtopping the back of the cart why dont you move forward jack said another voice also of a female yet higher up the paththe man stirred not but remained staring at me in the posture which he had assumed on first perceiving me his body very much drawn back his left foot far in advance of his right and with his right hand still grasping the halter of the horse which gave way more and more till it was clean down on its haunches whats the matter said the voice which i had last heard get back with you belle moll said the man still staring at me heres something not overcanny or comfortable here what is it said the same voice let me pass moll and ill soon clear the way and i heard a kind of rushing down the path you need not be afraid said i addressing myself to the mani mean you no harm i am a wanderer like yourselfcome here to seek for shelteryou need not be afraid i am a rome chabo by matriculationone of the right sort and no mistake good day to ye brother i bids ye welcome the man eyed me suspiciously for a momentthen turning to his horse with a loud curse he pulled him up from his haunches and led him and the cart farther down to one side of the dingle muttering as he passed me afraid hm i do not remember ever to have seen a more ruffianlylooking fellow he was about six feet high with an immensely athletic frame his face was black and bluff and sported an immense pair of whiskers but with here and there a grey hair for his age could not be much under fifty he wore a faded blue frock coat corduroys and highlowson his black head was a kind of red nightcap round his bull neck a barcelona handkerchiefi did not like the look of the man at all afraid growled the fellow proceeding to unharness his horse that was the word i think but other figures were now already upon the scene dashing past the other horse and cart which by this time had reached the bottom of the pass appeared an exceedingly tall woman or rather girl for she could scarcely have been above eighteen she was dressed in a tight bodice and a blue stuff gown hat bonnet or cap she had none and her hair which was flaxen hung down on her shoulders unconfined her complexion was fair and her features handsome with a determined but open expression she was followed by another female about forty stout and vulgarlooking at whom i scarcely glanced my whole attention being absorbed by the tall girl whats the matter jack said the latter looking at the man only afraid thats all said the man still proceeding with his work afraid at whatat that lad why he looks like a ghosti would engage to thrash him with one hand you might beat me with no hands at all said i fair damsel only by looking at me i never saw such a face and figure both regalwhy you look like ingeborg queen of norway she had twelve brothers you know and could lick them all though they were heroes on dovrefeld in norway were once together seen the twelve heroic brothers of ingeborg the queen none of your chaffing young fellow said the tall girl or i will give you what shall make you wipe your face be civil or you will rue it well perhaps i was a peg too high said i i ask your pardonheres something a bit lower as i was jawing to the gav yeck divvus a i met on the drom miro rommany chi b none of your rommany chies young fellow said the tall girl looking more menacingly than before and clenching her fist you had better be civil i am none of your chies and though i keep company with gypsies or to speak more proper half and halfs i would have you to know that i come of christian blood and parents and was born in the great house of long melford i have no doubt said i that it was a great house judging from your size i shouldnt wonder if you were born in a church stay belle said the man putting himself before the young virago who was about to rush upon me my turn is first then advancing to me in a menacing attitude he said with a look of deep malignity afraid was the word wasnt itit was said i but i think i wronged you i should have said aghastyou exhibited every symptom of one labouring under uncontrollable fear the fellow stared at me with a look of stupid ferocity and appeared to be hesitating whether to strike or not ere he could make up his mind the tall girl stepped forward crying hes chaffing let me at him and before i could put myself on my guard she struck me a blow on the face which had nearly brought me to the ground enough said i putting my hand to my cheek you have now performed your promise and made me wipe my face now be pacified and tell me fairly the ground of this quarrel grounds said the fellow didnt you say i was afraid and if you hadnt who gave you leave to camp on my ground is it your ground said i a pretty question said the fellow as if all the world didnt know that do you know who i am i guess i do said i unless i am much mistaken you are he whom folks call the flaming tinman to tell you the truth im glad we have met for i wished to see you these are your two wives i suppose i greet them theres no harm done theres room enough here for all of uswe shall soon be good friends i dare say and when we are a little better acquainted ill tell you my history well if that doesnt beat all said the fellow i dont think hes chaffing now said the girl whose anger seemed to have subsided on a sudden the young man speaks civil enough civil said the fellow with an oath but thats just like you with you it is a blow and all over civil i suppose you would have him stay here and get into all my secrets and hear all i may have to say to my two morts two morts said the girl kindling upwhere are they speak for one and no more i am no mort of yours whatever some one else may be i tell you one thing black john or anselo for tother ant your name the same thing i told the young man here be civil or you will rue it the fellow looked at the girl furiously but his glance soon quailed before hers he withdrew his eyes and cast them on my little horse which was feeding amongst the trees whats this said he rushing forward and seizing the animal why as i am alive this is the horse of that mumping villain slingsby its his no longer i bought it and paid for it its mine now said the fellow i swore i would seize it the next time i found it on my beatay and beat the master too i am not slingsby alls one for that you dont say you will beat me afraid was the word im sick and feeble hold up your fists wont the horse satisfy you horse nor bellows either no mercy then heres at you mind your eyes jack there youve got it i thought so shouted the girl as the fellow staggered back from a sharp blow in the eye i thought he was chaffing at you all along never mind anselo you know what to dogo in said the vulgar woman who had hitherto not spoken a word but who now came forward with all the look of a fury go in apopli youll smash ten like hethe flaming tinman took her advice and came in bent on smashing but stopped short on receiving a lefthanded blow on the nose youll never beat the flaming tinman in that way said the girl looking at me doubtfully and so i began to think myself when in the twinkling of an eye the flaming tinman disengaged himself of his frockcoat and dashing off his red nightcap came rushing in more desperately than ever to a flush hit which he received in the mouth he paid as little attention as a wild bull would have done in a moment his arms were around me and in another he had hurled me down falling heavily upon me the fellows strength appeared to be tremendous pay him off now said the vulgar woman the flaming tinman made no reply but planting his knee on my breast seized my throat with two huge horny hands i gave myself up for dead and probably should have been so in another minute but for the tall girl who caught hold of the handkerchief which the fellow wore round his neck with a grasp nearly as powerful as that with which he pressed my throat do you call that fair play said she hands off belle said the other woman do you call it fair play to interfere hands off or ill be down upon you myself but belle paid no heed to the injunction and tugged so hard at the handkerchief that the flaming tinman was nearly throttled suddenly relinquishing his hold of me he started on his feet and aimed a blow at my fair preserver who avoided it but said coolly finish tother business first and then im your woman whenever you like but finish it fairlyno foul play when im byill be the boys second and moll can pick you up when he happens to knock you down the battle during the next ten minutes raged with considerable fury but it so happened that during this time i was never able to knock the flaming tinman down but on the contrary received six knockdown blows myself i can never stand this said i as i sat on the knee of belle i am afraid i must give in the flaming tinman hits very hard and i spat out a mouthful of blood sure enough youll never beat the flaming tinman in the way you fightits of no use flipping at the flaming tinman with your left hand why dont you use your right because im not handy with it said i and then getting up i once more confronted the flaming tinman and struck him six blows for his one but they were all lefthanded blows and the blow which the flaming tinman gave me knocked me off my legs now will you use long melford said belle picking me up i dont know what you mean by long melford said i gasping for breath why this long right of yours said belle feeling my right armif you do i shouldnt wonder if you yet stand a chance and now the flaming tinman was once more ready much more ready than myself i however rose from my seconds knee as well as my weakness would permit me on he came striking left and right appearing almost as fresh as to wind and spirit as when he first commenced the combat though his eyes were considerably swelled and his nether lip was cut in two on he came striking left and right and i did not like his blows at all or even the wind of them which was anything but agreeable and i gave way before him at last he aimed a blow which had it taken full effect would doubtless have ended the battle but owing to his slipping the fist only grazed my left shoulder and came with terrific force against a tree close to which i had been driven before the tinman could recover himself i collected all my strength and struck him beneath the ear and then fell to the ground completely exhausted and it so happened that the blow which i struck the tinker beneath the ear was a righthanded blow hurrah for long melford i heard belle exclaim there is nothing like long melford for shortness all the world over at these words i turned round my head as i lay and perceived the flaming tinman stretched upon the ground apparently senseless he is dead said the vulgar woman as she vainly endeavoured to raise him up he is dead the best man in all the north country killed in this fashion by a boy alarmed at these words i made shift to get on my feet and with the assistance of the woman placed my fallen adversary in a sitting posture i put my hand to his heart and felt a slight pulsation hes not dead said i only stunned if he were let blood he would recover presently i produced a penknife which i had in my pocket and baring the arm of the tinman was about to make the necessary incision when the woman gave me a violent blow and pushing me aside exclaimed ill tear the eyes out of your head if you offer to touch him do you want to complete your work and murder him outright now hes asleep you have had enough of hisblood already you are mad said i i only seek to do him service well if you wont let him be blooded fetch some water and fling it into his face you know where the pit is a pretty manœuvre said the woman leave my mard a in the hands of you and that limmer b who has never been true to us i should find him strangled or his throat cut when i came back do you go said i to the tall girl take the can and fetch some water from the pit you had better go yourself said the girl wiping a tear as she looked on the yet senseless form of the tinker you had better go yourself if you think water will do him good i had by this time somewhat recovered my exhausted powers and taking the can i bent my steps as fast as i could to the pit arriving there i lay down on the brink took a long draught and then plunged my head into the water after which i filled the can and bent my way back to the dingle before i could reach the path which led down into its depths i had to pass some way along its side i had arrived at a part immediately over the scene of the last encounter where the bank overgrown with trees sloped precipitously down here i heard a loud sound of voices in the dingle i stopped and laying hold of a tree leaned over the bank and listened the two women appeared to be in hot dispute in the dingle it was all owing to you you limmer said the vulgar woman to the other had you not interfered the old man would soon have settled the boy im for fair play and long melford said the other if yow old man as you call him could have settled the boy fairly he might for all i should have cared but no foul work for me and as for sticking the boy with our gulleys when he comes back as you proposed i am not so fond of your old man or you that i should oblige you in it to my souls destruction hold your tongue or ill i listened no farther but hastened as fast as i could to the dingle my adversary had just begun to show signs of animation the vulgar woman was still supporting him and occasionally cast glances of anger at the tall girl who was walking slowly up and down i lost no time in dashing the greater part of the water into the tinmans face whereupon he sneezed moved his hands and presently looked round him at first his looks were dull and heavy and without any intelligence at all he soon however began to recollect himself and to be conscious of his situation he cast a scowling glance at me then one of the deepest malignity at the tall girl who was still walking about without taking much notice of what was going forward at last he looked at his right hand which had evidently suffered from the blow against the tree and a halfstifled curse escaped his lips the vulgar woman now said something to him in a low tone whereupon he looked at her for a moment and then got upon his legs again the vulgar woman said something to him her looks were furious and she appeared to be urging him on to attempt something i observed that she had a clasped knife in her hand the fellow remained standing for some time as if hesitating what to do at last he looked at his hand and shaking his head said something to the woman which i did not understand the tall girl however appeared to overhear him and probably repeating his words said no it wont do you are right there and now hear what i have to saylet bygones be bygones and let us all shake hands and camp here as the young man was saying just now the man looked at her and then without any reply went to his horse which was lying down among the trees and kicking it up led it to the cart to which he forthwith began to harness it the other cart and horse had remained standing motionless during the whole affair which i have been recounting at the bottom of the pass the woman now took the horse by the head and leading it with the cart into the open part of the dingle turned both round and then led them back till the horse and cart had mounted a little way up the ascent she then stood still and appeared to be expecting the man during this proceeding belle had stood looking on without saying anything at last perceiving that the man had harnessed his horse to the other cart and that both he and the woman were about to take their departure she said you are not going are you receiving no answer she continued i tell you what both of you black john and you moll his mort this is not treating me over civillyhowever i am ready to put up with it and to go with you if you like for i bear no malice im sorry for what has happened but you have only yourselves to thank for it now shall i go with you only tell me the man made no manner of reply but flogged his horse the woman however whose passions were probably under less control replied with a screeching tone stay where you are you jade and may the curse of judas cling to youstay with the bit of a mullo a whom you helped and my only hope is that he may gulley b you before he comes to behave you with us indeed after whats past no nor nothing belonging to you fetch down your mailla a gocart and live here with your chabo b she then whipped on the horse and ascended the pass followed by the man the carts were light and they were not long in ascending the winding path i followed to see that they took their departure arriving at the top i found near the entrance a small donkeycart which i concluded belonged to the girl the tinker and his mort were already at some distance i stood looking after them for a little time then taking the donkey by the reins i led it with the cart to the bottom of the dingle arrived there i found belle seated on the stone by the fireplace her hair was all dishevelled and she was in tears they were bad people said she and i did not like them but they were my only acquaintance in the wide worldchapter visopel berners a tall girl of eighteen and her story in the evening of that same day the tall girl and i sat at tea by the fire at the bottom of the dingle the girl on a small stool and myself as usual upon my stone the water which served for the tea had been taken from a spring of pellucid water in the neighbourhood which i had not had the good fortune to discover though it was well known to my companion and to the wandering people who frequented the dingle this tea is very good said i but i cannot enjoy it as much as if i were well i feel very sadly how else should you feel said the girl after fighting with the flaming tinman all i wonder is that you can feel at all as for the tea it ought to be good seeing that it cost me ten shillings a pound thats a great deal for a person in your station to pay in my station id have you to know young manhowever i havent the heart to quarrel with you you look so ill and after all it is a good sum to pay for one who travels the roads but if i must have tea i like to have the best and tea i must have for i am used to it though i cant help thinking that it sometimes fills my head with strange fancieswhat some folks call vapours making me weep and cry dear me said i i should never have thought that one of your size and fierceness would weep and cry my size and fierceness i tell you what young man you are not over civil this evening but you are ill as i said before and i shant take much notice of your language at least for the present as for my size i am not so much bigger than yourself and as for being fierce you should be the last one to fling that at me it is well for you that i can be fierce sometimes if i hadnt taken your part against blazing bosville you wouldnt be now taking tea with me it is true that you struck me in the face first but well let that pass so that mans name is bosville whats your own isopel berners how did you get that name i say young man you seem fond of asking questions will you have another cup of tea i was just going to ask for another well then here it is and much good may it do you as for my name i got it from my mother your mothers name then was isopel isopel berners but had you never a father yes i had a father said the girl sighing but i dont bear his name it is the fashion then in your country for children to bear their mothers name if you ask such questions young man i shall be angry with you i have told you my name and whether my fathers or mothers i am not ashamed of it it is a noble name there you are right young man the chaplain in the great house where i was born told me it was a noble name it was odd enough he said that the only three noble names in the country were to be found in the great house mine was one the other two were devereux and bohun what do you mean by the great house the workhouse is it possible that you were born thereyes young man and as you now speak softly and kindly i will tell you my whole tale my father was an officer of the sea and was killed at sea as he was coming home to marry my mother isopel berners he had been acquainted with her and had left her but after a few months he wrote her a letter to say that he had no rest and that he repented and that as soon as his ship came to port he would do her all the reparation in his power well young man the very day before they reached port they met the enemy and there was a fight and my father was killed after he had struck down six of the enemys crew on their own deck for my father was a big man as i have heard and knew tolerably well how to use his hands and when my mother heard the news she became half distracted and ran away into the fields and forests totally neglecting her business for she was a small milliner and so she ran demented about the meads and forests for a long time now sitting under a tree and now by the side of a riverat last she flung herself into some water and would have been drowned had not some one been at hand and rescued her whereupon she was conveyed to the great house lest she should attempt to do herself further mischief for she had neither friends nor parentsand there she died three months after having first brought me into the world she was a sweet pretty creature im told but hardly fit for this world being neither large nor fierce nor able to take her own part so i was born and bred in the great house where i learnt to read and sew to fear god and to take my own part when i was fourteen i was put out to service to a small farmer and his wife with whom however i did not stay long for i was half starved and otherwise illtreated especially by my mistress who one day attempted to knock me down with a besom i knocked her down with my fist and went back to the great house and how did they receive you in the great house not very kindly young manon the contrary i was put into a dark room where i was kept a fortnight on bread and water i did not much care however being glad to have got back to the great house at any rate the place where i was born and where my poor mother died and in the great house i continued two years longer reading and sewing fearing god and taking my own part when necessary at the end of the two years i was again put out to service but this time to a rich farmer and his wife with whom however i did not live longless time i believe than with the poor ones being obliged to leave for knocking your mistress down no young man knocking my master down who conducted himself improperly towards me this time i did not go back to the great house having a misgiving that they would not receive me so i turned my back to the great house where i was born and where my poor mother died and wandered for several days i know not whither supporting myself on a few halfpence which i chanced to have in my pocket it happened one day as i sat under a hedge crying having spent my last farthing that a comfortablelooking elderly woman came up in a cart and seeing the state in which i was she stopped and asked what was the matter with me i told her some part of my story whereupon she said cheer up my dear if you like you shall go with me and wait upon me of course i wanted little persuasion so i got into the cart and went with her she took me to london and various other places and i soon found that she was a travelling woman who went about the country with silks and linen i was of great use to her more especially in those places where we met evil company once as we were coming from dover we were met by two sailors who stopped our cart and would have robbed and stripped us let me get down said i so i got down and fought with them both till they turned round and ran away two years i lived with the old gentlewoman who was very kind to me almost as kind as a mother at last she fell sick at a place in lincolnshire and after a few days died leaving me her cart and stock in trade praying me only to see her decently buried which i did giving her a funeral fit for a gentlewoman after which i travelled the country melancholy enough for want of company but so far fortunate that i could take my own part when anybody was uncivil to me at last passing through the valley of todmorden i formed the acquaintance of blazing bosville and his wife with whom i occasionally took journeys for companys sake for it is melancholy to travel about alone even when one can take ones own part i soon found they were evil people but upon the whole they treated me civilly and i sometimes lent them a little money so that we got on tolerably well together he and i it is true had once a dispute and nearly came to blows for once when we were alone he wanted me to marry him promising if i would to turn off grey moll or if i liked it better to make her wait upon me as a maidservant i never liked him much but from that hour less than ever of the two i believe grey moll to be the best for she is at any rate true and faithful to him and i like truth and constancy dont you young man yes said i they are very nice things i feel very strangely how do you feel young man very much afraid afraid at what at the flaming tinman dont be afraid of him he wont come back and if he did he shouldnt touch you in this state id fight him for you but he wont come back so you neednt be afraid of him im not afraid of the flaming tinmanwhat then are you afraid of the evil one the evil one said the girl where is he coming upon me never heed said the girl ill stand by youchapter via foaming draughtthe magic of ale the kitchen of the publichouse was a large one and many people were drinking in it there was a confused hubbub of voices i sat down on a bench behind a deal table of which there were three or four in the kitchen presently a bulky man in a green coat of the newmarket cut and without a hat entered and observing me came up and in rather a gruff tone cried want anything young fellow bring me a jug of ale said i if you are the master as i suppose you are by that same coat of yours and your having no hat on your head dont be saucy young fellow said the landlord for such he was dont be saucy or whatever he intended to say he left unsaid for fixing his eyes upon one of my hands which i had placed by chance upon the table he became suddenly still this was my left hand which was raw and swollen from the blows dealt on a certain hard skull in a recent combat what do you mean by staring at my hand so said i withdrawing it from the table no offence young man no offence said the landlord in a quite altered tone but the sight of your hand then observing that our conversation began to attract the notice of the guests in the kitchen he interrupted himself saying in an undertone but mums the word for the present i will go and fetch the ale in about a minute he returned with a jug of ale foaming high heres your health said he blowing off the foam and drinking but perceiving that i looked rather dissatisfied he murmured alls righti glory in you but mums the word then placing the jug on the table he gave me a confidential nod and swaggered out of the room what can the silly impertinent fellow mean thought i but the ale was now before me and i hastened to drink for my weakness was great and my mind was full of dark thoughts the remains of the indescribable horror of the preceding night it may kill me thought i as i drank deep but who cares anything is better than what i have suffered i drank deep and then leaned back against the wall it appeared as if a vapour was stealing up into my brain gentle and benign soothing and stilling the horror and the fear higher and higher it mounted and i felt nearly overcome but the sensation was delicious compared with that i had lately experienced and now i felt myself nodding and bending down i laid my head on the table on my folded hands and in that attitude i remained some time perfectly unconscious at length by degrees perception returned and i lifted up my head i felt somewhat dizzy and bewildered but the dark shadow had withdrawn itself from me and now once more i drank of the jug this second draught did not produce an overpowering effect upon meit revived and strengthened mei felt a new man i looked around me the kitchen had been deserted by the greater part of the guests besides myself only four remained these were seated at the farther end one was haranguing fiercely and eagerly he was abusing england and praising america at last he exclaimed so when i gets to new york i will toss up my hat and damn the king that man must be a radical thought ichapter viia disciple of william cobbettthe scholar encounters the priest the individual whom i supposed to be a radical after a short pause again uplifted his voice he was rather a strongbuilt fellow of about thirty with an illfavoured countenance a white hat on his head a snuffcoloured coat on his back and when he was not speaking a pipe in his mouth who would live in such a country as england he shouted there is no country like america said his nearest neighbour a man also in a white hat and of a very illfavoured countenancethere is no country like america said he withdrawing a pipe from his mouth i think i shalland here he took a draught from a jug the contents of which he appeared to have in common with the othergo to america one of these days myself poor old england is not such a bad country after all said a third a simplelooking man in a labouring dress who sat smoking a pipe without anything before him if there was but a little more work to be got i should have nothing to say against her i hope however you hope who cares what you hope interrupted the first in a savage tone you are one of those sneaking hounds who are satisfied with dogs wages a bit of bread and a kick work indeed who with the spirit of a man would work for a country where there is neither liberty of speech nor of action a land full of beggarly aristocracy hungry boroughmongers insolent parsons and their wives and daughters as william cobbett says in his register ah the church of england has been a source of incalculable mischief to these realms said another the person who uttered these words sat rather aloof from the rest he was dressed in a long black surtout i could not see much of his face partly owing to his keeping it very much directed to the ground and partly owing to a large slouched hat which he wore i observed however that his hair was of a reddish tinge on the table near him was a glass and spoon you are quite right said the first alluding to what this last had said the church of england has done incalculable mischief here i value no religion three halfpence for i believe in none but the one that i hate most is the church of england so when i get to new york after i have shown the fine fellows on the quay a spice of me by the king ill toss up my hat again and the church of england too and suppose the people of new york should clap you in the stocks said i these words drew upon me the attention of the whole four the radical and his companion stared at me ferociously the man in black gave me a peculiar glance from under his slouched hat the simplelooking man in the labouring dress laughed what are you laughing at you fool said the radical turning and looking at the other who appeared to be afraid of him hold your noise and a pretty fellow you said he looking at me to come here and speak against the great american nation i speak against the great american nation said i i rather paid them a compliment by supposing they would put me in the stocks well i call it abusing them to suppose they would do any such thing stocks indeedthere are no stocks in all the land put me in the stocks why the president will come down to the quay and ask me to dinner as soon as he hears what i have said about the king and the church i shouldnt wonder said i if you go to america you will say of the president and country what now you say of the king and church and cry out for somebody to sent you back to england the radical dashed his pipe to pieces against the table i tell you what young fellow you are a spy of the aristocracy sent here to kick up a disturbance kicking up a disturbance said i is rather inconsistent with the office of spy if i were a spy i should hold my head down and say nothing the man in black partially raised his head and gave me another peculiar glance well if you arnt sent to spy you are sent to bully to prevent people speaking and to run down the great american nation but you shant bully me i say down with the aristocracy the beggarly aristocracy come what have you to say to thatnothing said i nothing repeated the radical no said i down with them as soon as you can as soon as i can i wish i could but i can down with a bully of theirs come will you fight for them no said i you wont no said i though from what i have seen of them i should say they are tolerably able to fight for themselves you wont fight for them said the radical triumphantly i thought so all bullies especially those of the aristocracy are cowards here landlord said he raising his voice and striking against the table with the jug some more alehe wont fight for his friends a white feather said his companion he he tittered the man in black landlord landlord shouted the radical striking the table with the jug louder than before who called said the landlord coming in at last fill this jug again said the other and be quick about it does any one else want anything said the landlord yes said the man in black you may bring me another glass of gin and water cold said the landlord yes said the man in black with a lump of sugar in it gin and water cold with a lump of sugar in it said i and struck the table with my fist take some said the landlord inquiringly no said i only something came into my head hes mad said the man in black not he said the radical hes only shamming he knows his master is here and therefore has recourse to these manœuvres but it wont do come landlord what are you staring at why dont you obey your orders keeping your customers waiting in this manner is not the way to increase your business the landlord looked at the radical and then at me at last taking the jug and glass he left the apartment and presently returned with each filled with its respective liquor he placed the jug with the beer before the radical and the glass with the gin and water before the man in black and then with a wink to me he sauntered out here is your health sir said the man of the snuffcoloured coat addressing himself to the man in black i honour you for what you said about the church of england every one who speaks against the church of england has my warm heart down with it i say and may the stones of it be used for mending the roads as my friend william says in his register the man in black with a courteous nod of his head drank to the man in the snuffcoloured coat with respect to the steeples said he i am not altogether of your opinion they might be turned to better account than to serve to mend the roads they might still be used as places of worship but not for the worship of the church of england i have no fault to find with the steeples it is the church itself which i am compelled to arraign but it will not stand long the respectable part of its ministers are already leaving it it is a bad church a persecuting church whom does it persecute said i the man in black glanced at me slightly and then replied slowly the catholics and do those whom you call catholics never persecute said inever said the man in black did you ever read foxs book of martyrs said i he he tittered the man in black there is not a word of truth in foxs book of martyrs ten times more than in the flos sanctorum said i the man in black looked at me but made no answer and what say you to the massacre of the albigenses and the vaudois whose bones lie scattered on the cold alp or the revocation of the edict of nantes the man in black made no answer go to said i it is because the church of england is not a persecuting church that those whom you call the respectable part are leaving her it is because they cant do with the poor dissenters what simon de montfort did with the albigenses and the cruel piedmontese with the vaudois that they turn to bloody rome the pope will no doubt welcome them for the pope do you see being very much in want will welcome hollo said the radical interfering what are you saying about the pope i say hurrah for the pope i value no religion three halfpence as i said before but if i were to adopt any it should be the popish as its called because i conceive the popish to be the grand enemy of the church of england of the beggarly aristocracy and the boroughmonger system so i wont hear the pope abused while i am by come dont look fierce you wont fight you know i have proved it but i will give you another chance i will fight for the popewill you fight against him o dear me yes said i getting up and stepping forward i am a quiet peaceable young man and being so am always ready to fight against the popethe enemy of all peace and quietto refuse fighting for the aristocracy is a widely different thing from refusing to fight against the popeso come on if you are disposed to fight for him to the pope broken bells to saint james broken shells no popish vile oppression but the protestant succession confusion to the groyne hurrah for the boyne for the army at clonmel and the protestant young gentlemen who live there as well an orangeman said the man in black not a platitude said i the man in black gave a slight start amongst that family said i no doubt something may be done but amongst the methodist preachers i should conceive that the success would not be great the man in black sat quite still especially amongst those who have wives i added the man in black stretched his hand towards his gin and water however said i we shall see what the grand movement will bring about and the results of the lessons in elocution the man in black lifted the glass up to his mouth and in doing so let the spoon fall but what has this to do with the main question said i i am waiting here to fight against the pope come hunter said the companion of the man in the snuffcoloured coat get up and fight for the pope i dont care for the young fellow said the man in the snuffcoloured coat i know you dont said the other so get up and serve him out i could serve out three like him said the man in the snuffcoloured coat so much the better for you said the otherthe present work will be all the easier for you get up and serve him out at once the man in the snuffcoloured coat did not stirwho shows the white feather now said the simplelooking man he he he tittered the man in black who told you to interfere said the radical turning ferociously towards the simplelooking man say another word and illand you said he addressing himself to the man in black a pretty fellow you to turn against me after i had taken your part i tell you what you may fight for yourself ill see you and your pope in the pit of eldon before i fight for either of you so make the most of it then you wont fight said i not for the pope said the radical ill see the pope dear me said i not fight for the pope whose religion you would turn to if you were inclined for any i see how it is you are not fond of fighting but ill give you another chance you were abusing the church of england just now ill fight for itwill you fight against it come hunter said the other get up and fight against the church of england i have no particular quarrel against the church of england said the man in the snuffcoloured coat my quarrel is with the aristocracy if i said anything against the church it is merely for a bit of corollary as master william cobbett would say the quarrel with the church belongs to this fellow in black so let him carry it on however he continued suddenly i wont slink from the matter either it shall never be said by the fine fellows on the quay of new york that i wouldnt fight against the church of england so down with the beggarly aristocracy the church and the pope to the bottom of the pit of eldon and may the pope fall first and the others upon him thereupon dashing his hat on the table he placed himself in an attitude of offence and rushed forward he was as i have said before a powerful fellow and might have proved a dangerous antagonist more especially to myself who after my recent encounter with the flaming tinman and my wrestlings with the evil one was in anything but fighting order any collision however was prevented by the landlord who suddenly appearing thrust himself between us there shall be no fighting here said he no one shall fight in this house except it be with myself so if you two have anything to say to each other you had better go into the field behind the house but you fool said he pushing hunter violently on the breast do you know whom you are going to tackle withthis is the young chap that beat blazing bosville only as late as yesterday in mumpers dingle grey moll told me all about it last night when she came for some brandy for her husband who she said had been half killed and she described the young man to me so closely that i knew him at once that is as soon as i saw how his left hand was bruised for she told me he was a lefthand hitter arnt it all true young man arnt you he that beat flaming bosville in mumpers dingle i never beat flaming bosville said i he beat himself had he not struck his hand against a tree i shouldnt be here at the present moment hear hear said the landlord now thats just as it should be i like a modest man for as the parson says nothing sits better upon the young man than modesty i remember when i was young fighting with tom of hopton the best man that ever pulled off coat in england i remember too that i won the battle for i happened to hit tom of hopton in the mark as he was coming in so that he lost his wind and falling squelch on the ground do ye see he lost the battle though i am free to confess that he was a better man than myselfindeed the best man that ever fought in england yet still i won the battle as every customer of mine and everybody within twelve miles round has heard over and over again now mr hunter i have one thing to say if you choose to go into the field behind the house and fight the young man you can ill back him for ten pounds but no fighting in my kitchenbecause why i keeps a decent kind of an establishment i have no wish to fight the young man said hunter more especially as he has nothing to say for the aristocracy if he chose to fight for them indeedbut he wont i know for i see hes a decent respectable young man and after all fighting is a blackguard way of settling a dispute so i have no wish to fight however there is one thing ill do said he uplifting his fist ill fight this fellow in black here for half a crown or for nothing if he pleases it was he that got up the last dispute between me and the young man with his pope and his nonsense so i will fight him for anything he pleases and perhaps the young man will be my second whilst you come doctor said the landlord or whatsoever you be will you go into the field with hunter ill second you only you must back yourself ill lay five pounds on hunter if you are inclined to back yourself and will help you to win it as far do you see as a second can because why i always likes to do the fair thing oh i have no wish to fight said the man in black hastily fighting is not my trade if i have given any offence i beg anybodys pardon landlord said i what have i to pay nothing at all said the landlord glad to see you this is the first time that you have been at my house and i nevercharge new customers at least customers such as you anything for the first draught youll come again i daresay shall always be glad to see you i wont take it said he as i put sixpence on the table i wont take it yes you shall said i but not in payment for anything i have had myself it shall serve to pay for a jug of ale for that gentleman said i pointing to the simplelooking individual he is smoking a poor pipe i do not mean to say that a pipe is a bad thing but a pipe without ale do you see bravo said the landlord thats just the conduct i like bravo said hunter i shall be happy to drink with the young man whenever i meet him at new york where do you see things are better managed than here if i have given offence to anybody said the man in black i repeat that i ask pardonmore especially to the young gentleman who was perfectly right to stand up for his religion just as inot that i am of any particular religion no more than this honest gentleman here bowing to hunter but i happen to know something of the catholicsseveral excellent friends of mine are catholicsand of a surety the catholic religion is an ancient religion and a widelyextended religion though it certainly is not a universal religion but it has of late made considerable progress even amongst those nations who have been particularly opposed to itamongst the prussians and the dutch for example to say nothing of the english and then in the east amongst the persians amongst the armenians the armenians said i o dear me the armenians have you anything to say about those people sir said the man in black lifting up his glass to his mouth i have nothing further to say said i than that the roots of ararat are occasionally found to be deeper than those of rome theres half a crown broke said the landlord as the man in black let fall the glass which was broken to pieces on the floor you will pay me the damage friend before you leave this kitchen i like to see people drink freely in my kitchen but not too freely and i hate breakages because why i keeps a decent kind of an establishment chapter viiifirst lessons in armenian the publichouse where the scenes which i have attempted to describe in the preceding chapters took place was at the distance of about two miles from the dingle the sun was sinking in the west by the time i returned to the latter spot i found belle seated by a fire over which her kettle was suspended during my absence she had prepared herself a kind of tent consisting of large hoops covered over with tarpaulin quite impenetrable to rain however violent i am glad you are returned said she as soon as she perceived me i began to be anxious about you did you take my advice yes said i i went to the publichouse and drank ale as you advised me it cheered strengthened and drove away the horror from my mindi am much beholden to you i knew it would do you good said belle i remembered that when the poor women in the great house were afflicted with hysterics and fearful imaginings the surgeon who was a good kind man used to say ale give them ale and let it be strong he was no advocate for tea then said i he had no objection to tea but he used to say everything in its season shall we take ours nowi have waited for you i have no objection said i i feel rather heated and at present should prefer tea to aleeverything in its season as the surgeon said thereupon belle prepared tea and as we were taking it she said what did you see and hear at the publichouse really said i you appear to have your full portion of curiosity what matters it to you what i saw and heard at the publichouse it matters very little to me said belle i merely inquired of you for the sake of a little conversation you were silent and it is uncomfortable for two people to sit together without opening their lipsat least i think so one only feels uncomfortable said i in being silent when one happens to be thinking of the individual with whom one is in company to tell you the truth i was not thinking of my companion but of certain company with whom i had been at the publichouse really young man said belle you are not over complimentary but who may this wonderful company have been some young and here belle stopped no said i there was no young personif person you were going to say there was a big portly landlord whom i dare say you have seen a noisy savage radical who wanted at first to fasten upon me a quarrel about america but who subsequently drew in his horns then there was a strange fellow a prowling priest i believe whom i have frequently heard of who at first seemed disposed to side with the radical against me and afterwards with me against the radical there you know my company and what took place was there no one else said belle you are mighty curious said i no none else except a poor simple mechanic and some common company who soon went away belle looked at me for a moment and then appeared to be lost in thought america said she musinglyamerica what of america said i i have heard that it is a mighty country i dare say it is said i i have heard my father say that the americans are firstrate marksmen i heard nothing about that said belle what i heard was that it is a great and goodly land where people can walk about without jostling and where the industrious can always find bread i have frequently thought of going thither well i said the radical in the publichouse will perhaps be glad of your company thither he is as great an admirer of america as yourself though i believe on different grounds i shall go by myself said belle unlessunless that should happen which is not likely i am not fond of radicals no more than i am of scoffers and mockersdo you mean to say that i am a scoffer and mocker i dont wish to say you are said belle but some of your words sound strangely like scoffing and mocking i have now one thing to beg which is that if you have anything to say against america you would speak it out boldly what should i have to say against america i never was there many people speak against america who never were there many people speak in praise of america who never were there but with respect to myself i have not spoken for or against america if you liked america you would speak in its praise by the same rule if i disliked america i should speak against it i cant speak with you said belle but i see you dislike the country the country well the peopledont you i do why do you dislike them why i have heard my father say that the american marksmen led on by a chap of the name of washington sent the english to the rightabout in doublequick time and that is your reason for disliking the americans yes said i that is my reason for disliking them will you take another cup of tea said belle i took another cup we were again silent it is rather uncomfortable said i at last for people to sit together without having anything to say were you thinking of your company said belle what company said i the present company the present company oh ahi remember that i said one only feels uncomfortable in being silent with a companion when one happens to be thinking of the companion well i had been thinking of you the last two or three minutes and had just come to the conclusion that to prevent us both feeling occasionally uncomfortably towards each other having nothing to say it would be as well to have a standing subject on which to employ our tongues belle i have determined to give you lessons in armenian what is armenian did you ever hear of ararat yes that was the place where the ark rested i have heard the chaplain in the great house talk of it besides i have read of it in the bible well armenian is the speech of people of that place and i should like to teach it you to prevent ay ay to prevent our occasionally feeling uncomfortable together your acquiring it besides might prove of ulterior advantage to us both for example suppose you and i were in promiscuous company at court for example and you had something to communicate to me which you did not wish any one else to be acquainted with how safely you might communicate it to me in armenianwould not the language of the roads do as well said belle in some places it would said i but not at court owing to its resemblance to thieves slang there is hebrew again which i was thinking of teaching you till the idea of being presented at court made me abandon it from the probability of our being understood in the event of our speaking it by at least half a dozen people in our vicinity there is latin it is true or greek which we might speak aloud at court with perfect confidence of safety but upon the whole i should prefer teaching you armenian not because it would be a safer language to hold communication with at court but because not being very well grounded in it myself i am apprehensive that its words and forms may escape from my recollection unless i have sometimes occasion to call them forth i am afraid we shall have to part company before i have learnt it said belle in the mean time if i wish to say anything to you in private somebody being by shall i speak in the language of the roads if no roadster is nigh you may said i and i will do my best to understand you belle i will now give you a lesson in armenian i suppose you mean no harm said belle not in the least i merely propose the thing to prevent our occasionally feeling uncomfortable together let us begin stop till i have removed the teathings said belle and getting up she removed them to her own encampment i am ready said belle returning and taking her former seat to join with you in anything which will serve to pass away the time agreeably provided there is no harm in it belle said i i have determined to commence the course of armenian lessons by teaching you the numerals but before i do that it will be as well to tell you that the armenian language is called haik i am sure that word will hang upon my memory said belle why hang upon it because the old women in the great house used to call so the chimneyhook on which they hung the kettle in like manner on the hake of my memory i will hang your hake good said i you will make an apt scholar but mind that i did not say hake but haik the words are however very much alike and as you observe upon your hake you may hang my haik we will now proceed to the numerals what are numerals said belle numbers i will say the haikan numbers up to ten there have you heard them yes well try and repeat them i only remember number one said belle and that because it is me i will repeat them again said i and pay great attention now try again me jergo earache i neither said jergo nor earache i said yergou and yerek belle i am afraid i shall have some difficulty with you as a scholar belle made no answer her eyes were turned in the direction of the winding path which led from the bottom of the hollow where we were seated to the plain above gorgio shunella a she said at length in a low voice pure rommany said i where i added in a whisper dovey odoy b said belle nodding with her head towards the path i will soon see who it is said i and starting up i rushed towards the pathway intending to lay violent hands on any one i might find lurking in its windings before however i had reached its commencement a man somewhat above the middle height advanced from it into the dingle in whom i recognised the man in black whom i had seen in the publichouse chapter ixlavengro receives a visit of ceremony from the man in black the man in black and myself stood opposite to each other for a minute or two in silence i will not say that we confronted each other that time for the man in black after a furtive glance did not look me in the face but kept his eyes fixed apparently on the leaves of a bunch of ground nuts which were growing at my feet at length looking round the dingle he exclaimed buona sera i hope i dont intrude you have as much right here said i as i or my companion but you had no right to stand listening to our conversation i was not listening said the man i was hesitating whether to advance or retire and if i heard some of your conversation the fault was not mine i do not see why you should have hesitated if your intentions were good said i i think the kind of place in which i found myself might excuse some hesitation said the man in black looking around moreover from what i have seen of your demeanour at the publichouse i was rather apprehensive that the reception i might experience at your hands might be more rough than agreeable and what may have been your motive for coming to this place said i per far visita à sua signoria ecco il motivo why do you speak to me in that gibberish said i do you think i understand it it is not armenian said the man in black but it might serve in a place like this for the breathing of a little secret communication were any common roadster near at hand it would not do at court it is true being the language of singing women and the like but we are not at courtwhen we are i can perhaps summon up a little indifferent latin if i have anything private to communicate to the learned professor and at the conclusion of this speech the man in black lifted up his head and for some moments looked me in the face the muscles of his own seemed to be slightly convulsed and his mouth opened in a singular manner i see said i that for some time you were standing near me and my companion in the mean act of listening not at all said the man in black i heard from the steep bank above that to which i have now alluded whilst i was puzzling myself to find the path which leads to your retreat i made indeed nearly the compass of the whole thicket before i found it and how did you know that i was here i demanded the landlord of the publichouse with whom i had some conversation concerning you informed me that he had no doubt i should find you in this place to which he gave me instructions not very clear but now i am here i crave permission to remain a little time in order that i may hold some communion with you well said i since you are come you are welcome please step this way thereupon i conducted the man in black to the fireplace where belle was standing who had risen from her stool on my springing up to go in quest of the stranger the man in black looked at her with evident curiosity then making her rather a graceful bow lovely virgin said he stretching out his hand allow me to salute your fingers i am not in the habit of shaking hands with strangers said belle i did not presume to request to shake hands with you said the man in black i merely wished to be permitted to salute with my lips the extremity of your two forefingers i never permit anything of the kind said belle i do not approve of such unmanly ways they are only befitting those who lurk in corners or behind trees listening to the conversation of people who would fain be private do you take me for a listener then said the man in black ay indeed i do said belle the young man may receive your excuses and put confidence in them if he please but for my part i neither admit them nor believe them and thereupon flinging her long hair back which was hanging over her cheeks she seated herself on her stoolcome belle said i i have bidden the gentleman welcome i beseech you therefore to make him welcome he is a stranger where we are at home therefore even did we wish him away we are bound to treat him kindly thats not english doctrine said the man in black i thought the english prided themselves on their hospitality said i they do so said the man in black they are proud of showing hospitality to people above them that is to those who do not want it but of the hospitality which you were now describing and which is arabian they know nothing no englishman will tolerate another in his house from whom he does not expect advantage of some kind and to those from whom he does he can be civil enough an englishman thinks that because he is in his own house he has a right to be boorish and brutal to any one who is disagreeable to him as all those are who are really in want of assistance should a hunted fugitive rush into an englishmans house beseeching protection and appealing to the masters feelings of hospitality the englishman would knock him down in the passage you are too general said i in your strictures lord aberdeen the unpopular tory minister was once chased through the streets of london by a mob and being in danger of his life took shelter in the shop of a whig linendraper declaring his own unpopular name and appealing to the linendrapers feelings of hospitality whereupon the linendraper utterly forgetful of all party rancour nobly responded to the appeal and telling his wife to conduct his lordship upstairs jumped over the counter with his ell in his hand and placing himself with half a dozen of his assistants at the door of his boutique manfully confronted the mob telling them that he would allow himself to be torn to a thousand pieces ere he would permit them to injure a hair of his lordships head what do you think of that he he he tittered the man in black well said i i am afraid your own practice is not very different from that which you have been just now describing you sided with the radical in the publichouse against me as long as you thought him the most powerful and then turned against him when you saw he was cowed what have you to say to that o when one is in rome i mean england one must do as they do in england i was merely conforming to the custom of the country he he but i beg your pardon here as i did in the publichouse i made a mistake well said i we will drop the matter but pray seat yourself on that stone and i will sit down on the grass near you the man in black after proffering two or three excuses for occupying what he supposed to be my seat sat down upon the stone and i squatted down gypsy fashion just opposite to him belle sitting on her stool at a slight distance on my right after a time i addressed him thus am i to reckon this a mere visit of ceremony should it prove so it will be i believe the first visit of the kind ever paid me will you permit me to ask said the man in blackthe weather is very warm said he interrupting himself and taking off his hat i now observed that he was partly bald his red hair having died away from the fore part of his crown his forehead was high his eyebrows scanty his eyes grey and sly with a downward tendency his nose was slightly aquiline his mouth rather largea kind of sneering smile played continually on his lips his complexion was somewhat rubicund a bad countenance said belle in the language of the roads observing that my eyes were fixed on his face does not my countenance please you fair damsel said the man in black resuming his hat and speaking in a peculiarly gentle voice how said i do you understand the language of the roads as little as i do armenian said the man in black but i understand look and tone so do i perhaps retorted belle and to tell you the truth i like your tone as little as your face for shame said i have you forgot what i was saying just now about the duties of hospitality you have not yet answered my question said i addressing myself to the man with respect to your visit will you permit me to ask who you are do you see the place where i live said ii do said the man in black looking around do you know the name of this place i was told it was mumpers or gypsies dingle said the man in black good said i and this forge and tent what do they look like like the forge and tent of a wandering zigan i have seen the like in italy good said i they belong to me are you then a gypsy said the man in black what else should i be but you seem to have been acquainted with various individuals with whom i have likewise had acquaintance and you have even alluded to matters and even words which have passed between me and them do you know how gypsies live said i by hammering old iron i believe and telling fortunes well said i theres my forge and yonder is some iron though not old and by your own confession i am a soothsayer but how did you come by your knowledge oh said i if you want me to reveal the secrets of my trade i have of course nothing further to say go to the scarlet dyer and ask him how he dyes cloth why scarlet said the man in black is it because gypsies blush like scarlet gypsies never blush said i but gypsies cloaks are scarlet i should almost take you for a gypsy said the man in black but for for what said i but for that same lesson in armenian and your general knowledge of languages as for your manners and appearance i will say nothing said the man in black with a titter and why should not a gypsy possess a knowledge of languages said i because the gypsy race is perfectly illiterate said the man in black they are possessed it is true of a knavish acuteness and are particularly noted for giving subtle and evasive answersand in your answers i confess you remind me of them but that one of the race should acquire a learned language like the armenian and have a general knowledge of literature is a thing che io non credo afatto what do you take me for said i why said the man in black i should consider you to be a philologist who for some purpose has taken up a gypsy life but i confess to you that your way of answering questions is far too acute for a philologist and why should not a philologist be able to answer questions acutely said i because the philological race is the most stupid under heaven said the man in black they are possessed it is true of a certain faculty for picking up words and a memory for retaining them but that any one of the sect should be able to give a rational answer to say nothing of an acute one on any subjecteven though the subject were philologyis a thing of which i have no idea but you found me giving a lesson in armenian to this handmaid i believe i did said the man in black and you heard me give what you are disposed to call acute answers to the questions you asked mei believe i did said the man in black and would any one but a philologist think of giving a lesson in armenian to a handmaid in a dingle i should think not said the man in black well then dont you see that it is possible for a philologist to give not only a rational but an acute answer i really dont know said the man in black whats the matter with you said i merely puzzled said the man in black puzzled yes really puzzled yes remain so well said the man in black rising puzzled or not i will no longer trespass upon your and this young ladys retirement only allow me before i go to apologise for my intrusion no apology is necessary said i will you please to take anything before you go i think this young lady at my request will contrive to make you a cup of tea tea said the man in blackhe he i dont drink tea i dont like itif indeed you had and here he stopped theres nothing like gin and water is there said i but i am sorry to say i have none gin and water said the man in blackhow do you know that i am fond of gin and water did i not see you drinking some at the publichouse you did said the man in black and i remember that when i called for some you repeated my words permit me to ask is gin and water an unusual drink in england it is not usually drunk cold and with a lump of sugar said i and did you know who i was by my calling for it so gypsies have various ways of obtaining information said i with all your knowledge said the man in black you do not appear to have known that i was coming to visit you gypsies do not pretend to know anything which relates to themselves said i but i advise you if you ever come again to come openly have i your permission to come again said the man in black come when you please this dingle is as free for you as me i will visit you again said the man in blacktill then addio belle said i after the man in black had departed we did not treat that man very hospitably he left us without having eaten or drunk at our expense you offered him some tea said belle which as it is mine i should have grudged him for i like him not our liking or disliking him had nothing to do with the matter he was our visitor and ought not to have been permitted to depart dry living as we do in this desert we ought always to be prepared to administer to the wants of our visitors belle do you know where to procure any good hollandsi think i do said belle but i will have no buts belle i expect that with as little delay as possible you procure at my expense the best hollands you can findchapter xhow isopel berners and the wordmaster passed their time in the dingle time passed on and belle and i lived in the dingle when i say lived the reader must not imagine that we were always there she went out upon her pursuits and i went out where inclination led me but my excursions were very short ones and hers occasionally occupied whole days and nights if i am asked how we passed the time when we were together in the dingle i would answer that we passed the time very tolerably all things considered we conversed together and when tired of conversing i would sometimes give belle a lesson in armenian her progress was not particularly brilliant but upon the whole satisfactory in about a fortnight she had hung up one hundred haikan numerals upon the hake of her memory i found her conversation highly entertaining she had seen much of england and wales and had been acquainted with some of the most remarkable characters who travelled the roads at that period and let me be permitted to say that many remarkable characters have travelled the roads of england of whom fame has never said a word i loved to hear her anecdotes of these people some of whom i found had occasionally attempted to lay violent hands either upon her person or effects and had invariably been humbled by her without the assistance of either justice or constable i could clearly see however that she was rather tired of england and wished for a change of scene she was particularly fond of talking of america to which country her aspirations chiefly tended she had heard much of america which had excited her imagination for at that time america was much talked of on roads and in homesteads at least so said belle who had good opportunities of knowing and most people allowed that it was a good country for adventurous english the people who chiefly spoke against it as she informed me were soldiers disbanded upon pensions the sextons of village churches and excisemen belle had a craving desire to visit that country and to wander with cart and little animal amongst its forests when i would occasionally object that she would be exposed to danger from strange and perverse customers she said that she had not wandered the roads of england so long and alone to be afraid of anything which might befal in america and that she hoped with gods favour to be able to take her own part and to give to perverse customers as good as they might bring she had a dauntless heart that same belle such was the staple of belles conversation as for mine i would endeavour to entertain her with strange dreams of adventure in which i figured in opaque forests strangling wild beasts or discovering and plundering the hoards of dragons and sometimes i would narrate to her other things far more genuinehow i had tamed savage mares wrestled with satan and had dealings with ferocious publishers belle had a kind heart and would weep at the accounts i gave her of my early wrestlings with the dark monarch she would sigh too as i recounted the many slights and degradations i had received at the hands of ferocious publishers but she had the curiosity of a woman and once when i talked to her of the triumphs which i had achieved over unbroken mares she lifted up her head and questioned me as to the secret of the virtue which i possessed over the aforesaid animals whereupon i sternly reprimanded and forthwith commanded her to repeat the armenian numerals and on her demurring i made use of words to escape which she was glad to comply saying the armenian numerals from one to a hundred which numerals as a punishment for her curiosity i made her repeat three times loading her with the bitterest reproaches whenever she committed the slightest error either in accent or pronunciation which reproaches she appeared to bear with the greatest patience and now i have given a fair account of the manner in which isopel berners and myself passed our time in the dinglechapter xiale give them ale and let it be stronga main of cockslavengro consoles the landlord who propounds a novel plan for the liquidation of debts amongst other excursions i went several times to the publichouse to which i introduced the reader in a former chapter i had experienced such beneficial effects from the ale i had drunk on that occasion that i had wished to put its virtue to a frequent test nor did the ale on subsequent trials belie the good opinion which i had at first formed of it after each visit which i made to the publichouse i found my frame stronger and my mind more cheerful than they had previously been the landlord appeared at all times glad to see me and insisted that i should sit within the bar where leaving his other guests to be attended to by a niece of his who officiated as his housekeeper he would sit beside me and talk of matters concerning the ring indulging himself with a cigar and a glass of sherry which he told me was his favourite wine whilst i drank my ale i loves the conversation of all you coves of the ring said he once which is natural seeing as how i have fought in a ring myself ah there is nothing like the ring i wish i was not rather too old to go again into it i often think i should like to have another rallyone more rally and thenbut theres a time for all thingsyouth will be served every dog has his day and mine has been a fine onelet me be content after beating tom of hopton there was not much more to be done in the way of reputation i have long sat in my bar the wonder and glory of this here neighbourhood im content as far as reputation goes i only wish money would come in a little faster however the next main of cocks will bring me in something handsomecomes off next wednesday at have ventured ten fivepound notesshouldnt say ventured eitherrun no risk at all because why i knows my birds about ten days after this harangue i called again at about three oclock one afternoon the landlord was seated on a bench by a table in the common room which was entirely empty he was neither smoking nor drinking but sat with his arms folded and his head hanging down over his breast at the sound of my step he looked up ah said he i am glad you are come i was just thinking about you thank you said i it was very kind of you especially at a time like this when your mind must be full of your good fortune allow me to congratulate you on the sums of money you won by the main of cocks at i hope you brought it all safe home safe home said the landlord i brought myself safe home and that was all came home without a shilling regularly done cleaned out i am sorry for that said i but after you had won the money you ought to have been satisfied and not risked it again how did you lose it i hope not by the pea and thimble pea and thimble said the landlordnot i those confounded cocks left me nothing to lose by the pea and thimble dear me said i i thought that you knew your birds well so i did said the landlord i knew the birds to be good birds and so they proved and would have won if better birds had not been brought against them of which i knew nothing and so do you see i am done regularly done well said i dont be cast down there is one thing of which the cocks by their misfortune cannot deprive youyour reputation make the most of that give up cockfighting and be content with the custom of your house of which you will always have plenty as long as you are the wonder and glory of the neighbourhood the landlord struck the table before him violently with his fist confound my reputation said he no reputation that i have will be satisfaction to my brewer for the seventy pounds i owe him reputation wont pass for the current coin of this here realm and let me tell you that if it ant backed by some of it it ant a bit better than rotten cabbage as i have found only three weeks since i was as i told you the wonder and glory of the neighbourhood and people used to come and look at me and worship me but as soon as it began to be whispered about that i owed money to the brewer they presently left off all that kind of thing and now during the last three days since the tale of my misfortune with the cocks has got wind almost everybody has left off coming to the house and the few who does merely comes to insult and flout me it was only last night that fellow hunter called me an old fool in my own kitchen here he wouldnt have called me a fool a fortnight agotwas i called him fool then and last night he called me old fool what do you think of that the man that beat tom of hopton to be called not only a fool but an old fool and i hadnt heart with one blow of this here fist into his face to send his head ringing against the wall for when a mans pocket is low do you see his heart ant much higher but it is no use talking something must be done i was thinking of you just as you came in for you are just the person that can help me if you mean said i to ask me to lend you the money which you want it will be to no purpose as i have very little of my own just enough for my own occasions it is true if you desired it i would be your intercessor with the person to whom you owe the money though i should hardly imagine that anything i could say you are right there said the landlord much the brewer would care for anything you could say on my behalfyour going would be the very way to do me up entirely a pretty opinion he would have of the state of my affairs if i were to send him such a cessor as you and as for your lending me money dont think i was ever fool enough to suppose either that you had any or if you had that you would be fool enough to lend me any no no the coves of the ring knows better i have been in the ring myself and knows what fighting a cove is and though i was fool enough to back those birds i was never quite fool enough to lend anybody money what i am about to propose is something very different from going to my landlord or lending any capital something which though it will put money into my pocket will likewise put something handsome into your own i want to get up a fight in this here neighbourhood which would be sure to bring plenty of people to my house for a week before and after it takes place and as people cant come without drinking i think i could during one fortnight get off forthe brewer all the sour and unsaleable liquids he now has which people wouldnt drink at any other time and by that means do you see liquidate my debt then by means of betting making first all right do you see i have no doubt that i could put something handsome into my pocket and yours for i should wish you to be the fighting man as i think i can depend upon you you really must excuse me said i i have no wish to figure as a pugilist besides there is such a difference in our ages you may be the stronger man of the two and perhaps the hardest hitter but i am in much better condition am more active on my legs so that i am almost sure i should have the advantage for as you very properly observed youth will be served oh i didnt mean to fight said the landlord i think i could beat you if i were to train a little but in the fight i propose i looks more to the main chance than anything else i question whether half so many people could be brought together if you were to fight with me as the person i have in view or whether there would be half such opportunities for betting for i am a man do you see the person i wants you to fight with is not a man but the young woman you keeps company with the young woman i keep company with said i pray what do you mean we will go into the bar and have something said the landlord getting up my niece is out and there is no one in the house so we can talk the matter over quietly thereupon i followed him into the bar where having drawn me a jug of ale helped himself as usual to a glass of sherry and lighted a cigar he proceeded to explain himself further what i wants is to get up a fight between a man and a woman there never has yet been such a thing in the ring and the mere noise of the matter would bring thousands of people together quite enough to drink out for the thing should be close to my house all the brewers stock of liquids both good and bad but said i you were the other day boasting of the respectability of your house do you think that a fight between a man and a woman close to your establishment would add to its respectability confound the respectability of my house said the landlord will the respectability of my house pay the brewer or keep the roof over my head no no when respectability wont keep a man do you see the best thing is to let it go and wander only let me have my own way and both the brewer myself and every one of us will be satisfied and then the betting what a deal we may make by the bettingand that we shall have all to ourselves you i and the young woman the brewer will have no hand in that i can manage to raise ten pounds and if by flashing that about i dont manage to make a hundred call me a horse but suppose said i the party should lose on whom you sport your money even as the birds did we must first make all right said the landlord as i told you before the birds were irrational beings and therefore couldnt come to an understanding with the others as you and the young woman can the birds fought fair but i intend you and the young woman should fight cross what do you mean by cross said i come come said the landlord dont attempt to gammon me you in the ring and pretend not to know what fighting cross is that wont do my fine fellow but as no one is near us i will speak out i intend that you and the young woman should understand one another and agree beforehand which should be beat and if you take my advice you will determine between you that the young woman shall be beat as i am sure that the odds will run high upon her her character as a fistwoman being spread far and wide so that all the flats who think it will be all right will back her as i myself would if i thought it would be a fair thing then said i you would not have us fight fair by no means said the landlord because why i conceives that a cross is a certainty to those who are in it whereas by the fair thing one may lose all he has but said i you said the other day that you liked the fair thing that was by way of gammon said the landlord just do you see as a parliament cove might say speechifying from a barrel to a set of flats whom he means to sell come what do you think of the plan its a very ingenious one said i ant it said the landlord the folks in this neighbourhood are beginning to call me old fool but if they dont call me something else when they sees me friends with the brewer and money in my pocket my name is not catchpole come drink your ale and go home to the young gentlewoman i am going said i rising from my seat after finishing the remainder of the ale do you think shell have any objection said the landlord to do what said i why to fight cross yes i do said i but you will do your best to persuade her no i will not said i are you fool enough to wish to fight fair no said i i am wise enough to wish not to fight at all and hows my brewer to be paid said the landlordi really dont know said i ill change my religion said the landlordchapter xiianother visit from the man in black his estimate of mezzofante one evening belle and myself received another visit from the man in black after a little conversation of not much importance i asked him whether he would not take some refreshment assuring him that i was now in possession of some very excellent hollands which with a glass a jug of water and a lump of sugar were heartily at his service he accepted my offer and belle going with a jug to the spring from which she was in the habit of procuring water for tea speedily returned with it full of the clear delicious water of which i have already spoken having placed the jug by the side of the man in black she brought him a glass and spoon and a teacup the latter containing various lumps of snowywhite sugar in the meantime i had produced a bottle of the stronger liquid the man in black helped himself to some water and likewise to some hollands the proportion of water being about twothirds then adding a lump of sugar he stirred the whole up tasted it and said that it was good this is one of the good things of life he added after a short pause what are the others i demanded there is malvoisia sack said the man in black and partridge and beccafico and what do you say to high mass said i high mass said the man in black however he continued after a pause i will be frank with you i came to be so i may have heard high mass on a time and said it too but as for any predilection for it i assure you i have no more than for a long high church sermon you speak à la margutte said i margutte said the man in black musingly margutte you have read pulci i suppose said i yes yes said the man in black laughing i remember he might be rendered into english said i something in this style to which margutte answered with a sneer i like the blue no better than the black my faith consists alone in savoury cheer in roasted capons and in potent sack but above all in famous gin and clear which often lays the briton on his back with lump of sugar and with lymph from well i drink it and defy the fiends of hell he he he said the man in black that is more than mezzofante could have done for a stanza of byron a clever man said i who said the man in black mezzofante di bologna he he he said the man in black now i know that you are not a gypsy at least a soothsayer no soothsayer would have said that why said i does he not understand fiveandtwenty tongues o yes said the man in black and fiveandtwenty added to them buthe he it was principally from him who is certainly the prince of philologists that i formed my opinion of the sect you ought to speak of him with more respect said i i have heard say that he has done good service to your see o yes said the man in black he has done good service to our see that is in his way when the neophytes of the propaganda are to be examined in the several tongues in which they are destined to preach he is appointed to questionthem the questions being first written down for him or else he he he of course you know napoleons estimate of mezzofante he sent for the linguist from motives of curiosity and after some discourse with him told him that he might depart then turning to some of his generals he observed nous avons eu ici un exemple quun homme peut avoir beaucoup de paroles avec bien peu desprit you are ungrateful to him said i well perhaps when he is dead and gone you will do him justice true said the man in black when he is dead and gone we intend to erect him a statue of wood on the lefthand side of the door of the vatican library of wood said i he was the son of a carpenter you know said the man in black the figure will be of wood for no other reason i assure you he he you should place another statue on the right perhaps we shall said the man in black but we know of no one amongst the philologists of italy nor indeed of the other countries inhabited by the faithful worthy to sit parallel in effigy with our illustrissimo when indeed we have conquered those regions of the perfidious by bringing the inhabitants thereof to the true faith i have no doubt that we shall be able to select one worthy to bear him company one whose statue shall be placed on the right hand of the library in testimony of our joy at his conversion for as you know there is more joy etc wood said i i hope not said the man in black no if i be consulted as to the material for the statue i should strongly recommend bronze and when the man in black had said this he emptied his second tumbler of its contents and prepared himself anotherchapter xiiithe man in black discusses the foibles of the englishhis schemes for winning over the aristocracy the middle class and the rabblehorseflesh and bitter ale so you hope to bring these regions again beneath the banner of the roman see said i after the man in black had prepared the beverage and tasted it hope said the man in black how can we fail is not the church of these regions going to lose its prerogative its prerogative yes those who should be the guardians of the religion of england are about to grant papists emancipation and to remove the disabilities from dissenters which will allow the holy father to play his own game in england on my inquiring how the holy father intended to play his game the man in black gave me to understand that he intended for the present to cover the land with temples in which the religion of protestants would be continually scoffed at and reviled on my observing that such behaviour would savour strongly of ingratitude the man in black gave me to understand that if i entertained the idea that the see of rome was ever influenced in its actions by any feeling of gratitude i was much mistaken assuring me that if the see of rome in any encounter should chance to be disarmed and its adversary from a feeling of magnanimity should restore the sword which had been knocked out of its hand the see of rome always endeavoured on the first opportunity to plunge the said sword into its adversarys bosomconduct which the man in black seemed to think was very wise and which he assured me had already enabled it to get rid of a great many troublesome adversaries and would he had no doubt enable it to get rid of a great many more on my attempting to argue against the propriety of such behaviour the man in black cut the matter short by saying that if one party was a fool he saw no reason why the other should imitate it in its folly after musing a little while i told him that emancipation had not yet passed through the legislature and that perhaps it never would reminding him that there was often many a slip between the cup and the lip to which observation the man in black agreed assuring me however that there was no doubt that emancipation would be carried inasmuch as there was a very loud cry at present in the land a cry of tolerance which had almost frightened the government out of its wits who to get rid of the cry was going to grant all that was asked in the way of toleration instead of telling the people to hold their nonsense and cutting them down provided they continued bawling longer i questioned the man in black with respect to the origin of this cry but he said to trace it to its origin would require a long history that at any rate such a cry was in existence the chief raisers of it being certain of the nobility called whigs who hoped by means of it to get into power and to turn out certain ancient adversaries of theirs called tories who were for letting things remain in statu quo that these whigs were backed by a party amongst the people called radicals a specimen of whom i had seen in the publichouse a set of fellows who were always in the habit of bawling against those in place and so he added by means of these parties and the hubbub which the papists and other smaller sects are making a general emancipation will be carried and the church of england humbled which is the principal thing which the see of rome cares for on my telling the man in black that i believed that even among the high dignitaries of the english church there were many who wished to grant perfect freedom to religions of all descriptions he said he was aware that such was the fact and that such a wish was anything but wise inasmuch as if they had any regard for the religion they professed they ought to stand by it through thick and thin proclaiming it to be the only true one and denouncing all others in an alliterative style as dangerous and damnable whereas by their present conduct they are bringing their religion into contempt with the people at large who would never continue long attached to a church the ministers of which did not stand up for it and likewise cause their own brethren who had a clearer notion of things to be ashamed of belonging to it i speak advisedly said he in continuation there is one platitude and i hope there is only one said i you surely would not adduce the likes and dislikes of that poor silly fellow as the criterions of the opinions of any party you know him said the man in black nay i heard you mention him in the publichouse the fellow is not very wise i admit but he has sense enough to know that unless a church can make people hold their tongues when it thinks fit it is scarcely deserving the name of a church no i think that the fellow is not such a very bad stick and that upon the whole he is or rather was an advantageous specimen of the high church english clergy who for the most part so far fromtroubling their heads about persecuting people only think of securing tithes eating their heavy dinners puffing out their cheeks with importance on country justice benches and occasionally exhibiting their conceited wives hoyden daughters and gawky sons at country balls whereas platitude stop said i you said in the publichouse that the church of england was a persecuting church and here in the dingle you have confessed that one section of it is willing to grant perfect freedom to the exercise of all religions and the other only thinks of leading an easy life saying a thing in the publichouse is a widely different thing from saying it in the dingle said the man in black had the church of england been a persecuting church it would not stand in the position in which it stands at present it might with its opportunities have spread itself over the greater part of the world i was about to observe that instead of practising the indolent habits of his high church brethren platitude would be working for his money preaching the proper use of fire and faggot or rather of the halter and the whippingpost encouraging mobs to attack the houses of dissenters employing spies to collect the scandal of neighbourhoods in order that he might use it for sacerdotal purposes and in fact endeavouring to turn an english parish into something like a jesuit benefice in the south of france he tried that game said i and the parish saidpooh pooh and for the most part went over to the dissenters very true said the man in black taking a sip at his glass but why were the dissenters allowed to preach why were they not beaten on the lips till they spat out blood with a dislodged tooth or two why but because the authority of the church of england has by its own fault become so circumscribed that mr platitude was not able to send a host of beadles and sbirri to their chapel to bring them to reason on which account mr platitude is very properly ashamed of his church and is thinking of uniting himself with one which possesses more vigour and authority it may have vigour and authority said i in foreign lands but in these kingdoms the day for practising its atrocities is gone by it is at present almost below contempt and is obliged to sue for grace in formâ pauperis very true said the man in black but let it once obtain emancipation and it will cast its slough put on its fine clothes and make converts by thousands what a fine church theyll say with what authority it speaksno doubts no hesitation no sticking at trifles what a contrast to the sleepy english church theyll go over to it by millions till it preponderates here over every other when it will of course be voted the dominant one and thenand then and here the man in black drank a considerable quantity of gin and water what then said i what then said the man in black why she will be true to herself let dissenters whether they be church of england as perhaps they may still call themselves methodist or presbyterian presume to grumble and there shall be bruising of lips in pulpits tying up to whippingposts cutting off ears and noseshe he the farce of king log has been acted long enough the time for queen storks tragedy is drawing nigh and the man in black sipped his gin and water in a very exulting manner and this is the church which according to your assertion in the publichouse never persecutes i have already given you an answer said the man in black with respect to the matter of the publichouse it is one of the happy privileges of those who belong to my church to deny in the publichouse what they admit in the dingle we have high warranty for such double speaking did not the foundationstone of our church st peter deny in the public house what he had previously professed in the valley and do you think said i that the people of england who have shown aversion to anything in the shape of intolerance will permit such barbarities as you have described let them become papists said the man in black only let the majority become papists and you will see they will never become so said i the good sense of the people of england will never permit them to commit such an absurdity the good sense of the people of england said the man in black filling himself another glass yes said i the good sense of not only the upper but the middle and lower classes and of what description of people are the upper class said the man in black putting a lump of sugar into his gin and water very fine people said i monstrously fine people so at least they are generally believed to behe he said the man in black only those think them so who dont know them the male part of the upper class are in youth a set of heartless profligates in old age a parcel of poor shaking nervous paillards the female part worthy to be the sisters and wives of such wretches unmarried full of cold vice kept under by vanity and ambition but which after marriage they seek not to restrain in old age abandoned to vapours and horrors do you think that such beings will afford any obstacle to the progress of the church in these regions as soon as her movements are unfettered i cannot give an opinion i know nothing of them except from a distance but what think you of the middle classes their chief characteristic said the man in black is a rage for grandeur and gentility and that same rage makes us quite sure of them in the long run every thing thats lofty meets their unqualified approbation whilst everything humble or as they call it low is scouted by them they begin to have a vague idea that the religion which they have hitherto professed is low at any rate that it is not the religion of the mighty ones of the earth of the great kings and emperors whose shoes they have a vast inclination to kiss nor was used by the grand personages of whom they have read in their novels and romances their ivanhoes their marmions and their ladies of the lake do you think that the writings of scott have had any influence in modifying their religious opinions most certainly i do said the man in black the writings of that man have made them greater fools than they were before all their conversation now is about gallant knights princesses and cavaliers with which his pages are stuffed all of whom were papists or very high church which is nearly the same thing and they are beginning to think that the religion of such nice sweetscented gentry must be something very superfine why i know at birmingham the daughter of an ironmonger who screeches to the piano the lady of the lakes hymn to the virgin mary always weeps when mary queen of scots is mentioned and fasts on the anniversary of the death of that very wise martyr charles the first why i would engage to convert such an idiot to popery in a week were it worth my trouble o cavaliere gualtiero avete fatto molto in favore della santa sede if he has said i he has done it unwittingly i never heard before that he was a favourer of the popish delusion only in theory said the man in black trust any of the clan macsycophant for interfering openly and boldly in favour of any cause on which the sun does not shine benignantly popery is at present as you say suing for grace in these regions in formâ pauperis but let royalty once take it up let old gouty george once patronize it and i would consent to drink puddlewater if the very next time the canny scot was admitted to the royal symposium he did not say by my faith yere majesty i have always thought at the bottom of my heart that popery as ill scrapit tongues ca it was a very grand religion i shall be proud to follow your majestys example in adopting it i doubt not said i that both gouty george and his devoted servant will be mouldering in their tombs long before royalty in england thinks about adopting popery we can wait said the man in black in these days of rampant gentility there will be no want of kings nor of scots about them but not walters said i our work has been already tolerably well done by one said the man in black but if we wanted literature we should never lack in these regions hosts of literary men of some kind or other to eulogise us provided our religion were in the fashion and our popish nobles choose and they always do our bidding to admit the canaille to their tables their kitchen tables as for literature in general said he the santa sede is not particularly partial to it it may be employed both ways in italy in particular it has discovered that literary men are not always disposed to be lickspittles for example dante said i yes said the man in black a dangerous personage that poem of his cuts both ways and then there was pulci that morgante of his cuts both ways or rather one way and that sheer against us and then there was aretino who dealt so hard with the poveri frati all writers at least italian ones are not lick spittles and then in spaintis true lope de vega and calderon were most inordinate lickspittles the principe constante of the last is a curiosity in its way and then the mary stuart of lope i think i shall recommend the perusal of that work to the birmingham ironmongers daughter she has been lately thinking of adding a slight knowledge of the magneeficent language of the peninsula to the rest of her accomplishments he he he but then there was cervantes starving but straight he deals us some hard knocks in that second part of his quixote then there were some of the writers of the picaresque novels no all literary men are not lickspittles whether in italy or spain or indeed upon the continent it is only in england that all come said i mind what you are about to say of english literary men why should i mind said the man in black there are no literary men here i have heard of literary men living in garretsbut not in dingles whatever philologists may do i may therefore speak out freely it is only in england that literary men are invariably lickspittles on which account perhaps they are so despised even by those who benefit by their dirty services look at your fashionable novel writers he he and above all at your newspaper editors ho ho you will of course except the editors of the from your censure of the last class said i them said the man in black why they might serve as models in the dirty trade to all the rest who practise it see how they bepraise their patrons the grand whig nobility who hope by raising the cry of liberalism and by putting themselves at the head of the populace to come into power shortly i dont wish to be hard at present upon those whigs he continued for they are playing our game but a time will come when not wanting them we will kick them to a considerable distance and then when toleration is no longer the cry and the whigs are no longer backed by the populace see whether the editors of the will stand by them they will prove themselves as expert lickspittles of despotism as of liberalism dont think they will always bespatter the tories and austria well said i i am sorry to find that you entertain so low an opinion of the spirit of english literary men we will now return if you please to the subject of the middle classes i think your strictures upon them in general are rather too sweepingthey are not altogether the foolish people you have described look for example at that very powerful and numerous body the dissenters the descendants of those sturdy patriots who hurled charles the simple from his throne there are some sturdy fellows amongst them i do not deny said the man in black especially amongst the preachers clever withaltwo or three of that class nearly drove mr platitude mad as perhaps you are aware but they are not very numerous and the old sturdy sort of preachers are fast dropping off and as we observe with pleasure are generally succeeded by frothy coxcombs whom it would not be very difficult to gain over but what we most rely upon as an instrument to bring the dissenters over to us is the mania for gentility which amongst them has of late become as great and more ridiculous than amongst the middle classes belonging to the church of england all the plain and simple fashions of their forefathers they are either about to abandon or have already done so look at the most part of their chapels no longer modest brick edifices situated in quiet and retired streets but lunaticlooking erections in what the simpletons call the modern gothic taste of portlandstone with a cross upon the top and the site generally the most conspicuous that can be found and look at the manner in which they educate their children i mean those that are wealthy they do not even wish them to be dissenters the sweet dears shall enjoy the advantages of good society of which their parents were debarred so the girls are sent to tiptop boarding schools where amongst other trash they read rokeby and are taught to sing snatches from that highflying ditty the cavalier would you match the base skippon and massey and brown with the barons of england who fight for the crown he he their own names whilst the lads are sent to those hotbeds of pride and follycolleges whence they return with a greater contempt for everything low and especially for their own pedigree than they went with i tell you friend the children of dissenters if not their parents are going over to the church as you call it and the church is going over to rome i do not see the justice of that latter assertion at all said i some of the dissenters children may be coming over to the church of england and yet the church of england be very far from going over to rome in the high road for it i assure you said the man in black part of it is going to abandon the rest to lose their prerogative and when a church no longer retains its prerogative it speedily loses its own respect and that of others well said i if the higher classes have all the vices and follies which you represent on which point i can say nothing as i have never mixed with them and even supposing the middle classes are the foolish beings you would fain make them and which i do not believe them as a body to be you would still find some resistance amongst the lower classes i have a considerable respect for their good sense and independence of character but pray let me hear your opinion of them as for the lower classes said the man in black i believe them to be the most brutal wretches in the world the most addicted to foul feeding foul language and foul vices of every kind wretches who have neither love for country religion nor anything save their own vile selves you surely do not think that they would oppose a change of religion why there is not one of them but would hurrah for the pope or mahomet for the sake of a hearty gorge and a drunken bout like those which they are treated with at election contests has your church any followers amongst them said i wherever there happens to be a romish family of considerable possessions said the man in black our church is sure to have followers of the lower class who have come over in the hope of getting something in the shape of dole or donation as however the romish is not yet the dominant religion and the clergy of the english establishment havesome patronage to bestow the churches are not quite deserted by the lower classes yet were the romish to become the established religion they would to a certainty all go over to it you can scarcely imagine what a selfinterested set they arefor example the landlord of that publichouse in which i first met you having lost a sum of money upon a cockfight and his affairs in consequence being in a bad condition is on the eve of coming over to us in the hope that two old popish females of property whom i confess will advance him a sum of money to set him up again in the world and what could have put such an idea into the poor fellows head said i oh he and i have had some conversation upon the state of his affairs said the man in black i think he might make a rather useful convert in these parts provided things take a certain turn as they doubtless will it is no bad thing to have a fighting fellow who keeps a publichouse belonging to ones religion he has been occasionally employed as a bully at elections by the tory party and he may serve us in the same capacity the fellow comes of a good stock i heard him say that his father headed the high church mob who sacked and burnt priestleys house at birmingham towards the end of the last century a disgraceful affair said i what do you mean by a disgraceful affair said the man in black i assure you that nothing has occurred for the last fifty years which has given the high church party so much credit in the eyes of rome as that we did not imagine that the fellows had so much energy had they followed up that affair by twenty others of a similar kind they would by this time have had everything in their own power but they did not and as a necessary consequence they are reduced to almost nothing i suppose said i that your church would have acted very differently in its place it has always done so said the man in black coolly sipping our church has always armed the brutepopulation against the genius and intellect of a country provided that same intellect and genius were not willing to become its instruments and eulogists and provided we once obtain a firm hold here again we would not fail to do so we would occasionally stuff the beastly rabble with horseflesh and bitter ale and then halloo them on against all those who were obnoxious to us horseflesh and bitter ale i replied yes said the man in black horseflesh and bitter ale the favourite delicacies of their saxon ancestors who were always ready to do our bidding after a liberal allowance of such cheer there is a tradition in our church that before the rabble of penda at the instigation of austin attacked and massacred the presbyterian monks of bangor they had been allowed a good gorge of horseflesh and bitter ale he he he continued the man in black what a fine spectacle to see such a mob headed by a fellow like our friend the landlord sack the house of another priestley then you dont deny that we have had a priestley said i and admit the possibility of our having another you were lately observing that all english literary men were sycophants lickspittles said the man in black yes i admit that you have had a priestley but he was a dissenter of the old sort you have had him and perhaps may have another perhaps we may said i but with respect to the lower classes have you mixed much with them i have mixed with all classes said the man in black and with the lower not less than the upper and middle they are much as i have described them and of the three the lower are the worst i never knew one of them that possessed the slightest principle i ought to know something of the english people he continued after a moments pause i have been many years amongst them labouring in the cause of the church your see must have had great confidence in your powers when it selected you to labour for it in these parts said i they chose me said the man in black principally because being of british extraction and education i could speak the english language and bear a glass of something strong it is the opinion of my see that it would hardly do to send a missionary into a country like this who is not well versed in englisha country where they think so far from understanding any language besides his own scarcely one individual in ten speaks his own intelligibly or an ascetic person where as they say high and low male and female are at some period of their lives fond of a renovating glass as it is styled in other words of tippling your see appears to entertain a very strange opinion of the english said inot altogether an unjust one said the man in black lifting the glass to his mouth well said i it is certainly very kind on its part to wish to bring back such a set of beings beneath its wing why as to the kindness of my see said the man in black i have not much to say my see has generally in what it does a tolerably good motive these heretics possess in plenty what my see has a great hankering for and can turn to a good accountmoney the founder of the christian religion cared nothing for money said i what have we to do with what the founder of the christian religion cared for said the man in black how could our temples be built and our priests supported without money but you are unwise to reproach us with a desire of obtaining money you forget that your own church if the church of england be your own church as i suppose it is from the willingness which you displayed in the publichouse to fight for it is equally avaricious look at your greedy bishops and your corpulent rectors do they imitate christ in his disregard for money go to you might as well tell me that they imitate christ in his meekness and humility well said i whatever their faults may be you cant say that they go to rome for money the man in black made no direct answer but appeared by the motion of his lips to be repeating something to himself i see your glass is again empty said i perhaps you will replenish it the man in black arose from his seat adjusted his habiliments which were rather in disorder and placed upon his head his hat which he had laid aside then looking at me who was still lying upon the ground he saidi might perhaps take another glass though i believe i have had quite as much as i can well bear but i do not wish to hear you utter anything more this evening after that last observation of yoursit is quite original i will meditate upon it on my pillow this night after having said an ave and a patergo to rome for money he then made belle a low bow slightly motioned to me with his hand as if bidding farewell and then left the dingle with rather uneven steps go to rome for money i heard him say as he ascended the winding path he he he go to rome for money ho ho hochapter xivlife in the dingleisopel is inoculated with tonguesa thunderstorm nearly three days elapsed without anything of particular moment occurring belle drove the little cart containing her merchandise about the neighbourhood returning to the dingle towards the evening as for myself i kept within my wooded retreat working during the periods of her absence leisurely at my forge having observed that the quadruped which my companion drove was as much in need of shoes as my own had been some time previously i had determined to provide it with a set and during the aforesaid periods occupied myself in preparing them as i was employed three mornings and afternoons about them i am sure that the reader will agree that i worked leisurely or rather lazily on the third day belle arrived somewhat later than usual i was lying on my back at the bottom of the dingle employed in tossing up the shoes which i had produced and catching them as they fell some being always in the air mounting or descending somewhat after the fashion of the waters of a fountain why have you been absent so long said i to belle it must be long past four by the day i have been almost killed by the heat said belle i was never out in a more sultry daythe poor donkey too could scarcely move along he shall have fresh shoes said i continuing my exercise here they are quite ready tomorrow i will tack them on and why are you playing with them in that manner said belle partly in triumph at having made them and partly to show that i can do something besides making them it is not every one who after having made a set of horseshoes can keep them going up and down in the air without letting one fall one has now fallen on your chin said belle and another on my cheek said i getting up it is time to discontinue the game for the last shoe drew blood belle went to her own little encampment and as for myself after having flung the donkeys shoes into my tent i put some fresh wood on the fire which was nearly out and hung the kettle over it i then issued forth from the dingle and strolled round the wood that surrounded it for a long time i was busied in meditation looking at the ground striking with my foot half unconsciously the tufts of grass and thistles that i met in my way after some time i lifted up my eyes to the sky at first vacantly and then with more attention turning my head in all directions for a minute or two after which i returned to the dingle isopel was seated near the fire over which the kettle was now hung she had changed her dressno signs of the dust and fatigue of her late excursion remained she had just added to the fire a small billet of wood two or three of which i had left beside it the fire cracked and a sweet odour filled the dingle i am fond of sitting by a wood fire said belle when abroad whether it be hot or cold i love to see the flames dart out of the wood but what kind is this and where did you get it it is ash said i green ash somewhat less than a week ago whilst i was wandering along the road by the side of a wood i came to a place where some peasants were engaged in cutting up and clearing away a confused mass of fallen timber a mightyaged oak had given way the night before and in its fall had shivered some smaller trees the upper part of the oak and the fragments of the rest lay across the road i purchased for a trifle a bundle or two and the wood on the fire is part of itash green ash that makes good the old rhyme said belle which i have heard sung by the old women in the great house ash when green is fire for a queen and on fairer form of queen ash fire never shone said i than on thine o beauteous queen of the dingle i am half disposed to be angry with you young man said belle and why not entirely said i belle made no reply shall i tell you i demanded you had no objection to the first part of the speech but you did not like being called queen of the dingle well if i had the power i would make you queen of something better than the dinglequeen of china come let us have teasomething less would content me said belle sighing as she rose to prepare our evening meal so we took tea together belle and i how delicious tea is after a hot summers day and a long walk said she i daresay it is most refreshing then said i but i have heard people say that they most enjoy it on a cold winters night when the kettle is hissing on the fire and their children playing on the hearth belle sighed where does tea come from she presently demanded from china said i i just now mentioned it and the mention of it put me in mind of tea what kind of country is china i know very little about it all i know is that it is a very large country far to the east but scarcely large enough to contain its inhabitants who are so numerous that though china does not cover oneninth part of the world its inhabitants amount to onethird of the population of the world and do they talk as we do o no i know nothing of their language but i have heard that it is quite different from all others and so difficult that none but the cleverest people amongst foreigners can master it on which account perhaps only the french pretend to know anything about it are the french so very clever then said belle they say there are no people like them at least in europe but talking of chinese reminds me that i have not for some time past given you a lesson in armenian the word for tea in armenian isbythebye what is the armenian word for tea thats your affair not mine said belle it seems hard that the master should ask the scholar well said i whatever the word may be in armenian it is a noun and as we have never yet declined an armenian noun together we may as well take this opportunity of declining one belle there are ten declensions in armenian whats a declension the way of declining a noun then in the civilest way imaginable i decline the noun is that a declension you should never play on words to do so is low vulgar smelling of the pothouse the workhouse belle i insist on your declining an armenian noun i have done so already said belle if you go on in this way said i i shall decline taking any more tea with you will you decline an armenian noun i dont like the language said belle if you must teach me languages why not teach me french or chinese i know nothing of chinese and as for french none but a frenchman is clever enough to speak itto say nothing of teaching no we will stick to armenian unless indeed you would prefer welsh welsh i have heard is vulgar said belle so if i must learn one of the two i will prefer armenian which i never heard of till you mentioned it to me though of the two i really think welsh sounds best the armenian noun said i which i propose for your declension this night is dyèr which signifieth lord or master it soundeth very like tyrant said belle i care not what it sounds like said i it is the word i chose though it is not of the first declension master with all its variations being the first noun the sound of which i would have you learn from my lips come let us begin a master dyer of a master dyèrn repeatthe word sounds very strange to me said belle however to oblige you i will do my best and thereupon belle declined master in armenian you have declined the noun very well said i that is in the singular number we will now go to the plural what is the plural said belle that which implies more than one for example masters you shall now go through masters in armenian never said belle never it is bad to have one master but more i would never bear whether in armenian or english you do not understand said i i merely want you to decline masters in armenian i do decline them i will have nothing to do with them nor with master either i was wrong towhat sound is that i did not hear it but i dare say it is thunder in armenian never mind what it is in armenian but why do you think it is thunder ere i returned from my stroll i looked up into the heavens and by their appearance i judged that a storm was nigh at hand and why did you not tell me so you never asked me about the state of the atmosphere and i am not in the habit of giving my opinion to people on any subject unless questioned but setting that aside can you blame me for not troubling you with forebodings about storm and tempest which might have prevented the pleasure you promised yourself in drinking tea or perhaps a lesson in armenian though you pretend to dislike the latter my dislike is not pretended said belle i hate the sound of it but i love my tea and it was kind of you not to wish to cast a cloud over my little pleasures the thunder came quite time enough to interrupt it without being anticipatedthere is another peali will clear away and see that my tent is in a condition to resist the storm and i think you had better bestir yourself isopel departed and i remained seated on my stone as nothing belonging to myself required any particular attention in about a quarter of an hour she returned and seated herself upon her stool how dark the place is become since i left you said she just as if night were just at hand look up at the sky said i and you will not wonder it is all of a deep olive the wind is beginning to rise hark how it moans among the branches and see how their tops are bendingit brings dust on its wingsi felt some fall on my face and what is this a drop of rain we shall have plenty anon said belle do you hear it already begins to hiss upon the embers that fire of ours will soon be extinguished it is not probable that we shall want it said i but we had better seek shelter let us go into my tent go in said belle but you go in alone as for me i will seek my own you are right said i to be afraid of me i have taught you to decline master in armenian you almost tempt me said belle to make you decline mistress in english to make matters short said i i decline a mistress what do you mean said belle angrily i have merely done what you wished me said i and in your own style there is no other way of declining anything in english for in english there are no declensions the rain is increasing said belle it is so said i i shall go to my tent you may come if you please i do assure you i am not afraid of you nor i of you said belle so i will come why should i be afraid i can take my own part that iswe went into the tent and sat down and now the rain began to pour with vehemence i hope we shall not be flooded in this hollow said i to belle there is no fear of that said belle the wandering people amongst other names call it the dry hollow i believe there is a passage somewhere or other by which the wet is carried off there must be a cloud right above us it is so dark oh what a flash and what a peal said i that is what the hebrews call koul adonaithe voice of the lord are you afraid no said belle i rather like to hear it you are right said i i am fond of the sound of thunder myself there is nothing like it koul adonai behadar the voice of the lord is a glorious voice as the prayerbook version hath it there is something awful in it said belle and then the lightning the whole dingle is now in a blaze the voice of the lord maketh the hinds to calve and discovereth the thick bushes as you say there is something awful in thunder there are all kinds of noises above us said belle surely i heard the crashing of a tree the voice of the lord breaketh the cedar trees said i but what you hear is caused by a convulsion of the air during a thunderstorm there are occasionally all kinds of aërial noises ab gwilym who next to king david has best described a thunderstorm speaks of these aërial noises in the following manner astonied now i stand at strains as of ten thousand clanking chains and once methought that overthrown the welkins oaks came whelming down upon my head upstarts my hair why hunt abroad the hounds of air what cursed hag is screeching high whilst crash goes all her crockery you would hardly believe belle that though i offered at least ten thousand lines nearly as good as those to the booksellers in london the simpletons were so blind to their interest as to refuse purchasing them i dont wonder at it said belle especially if such dreadful expressions frequently occur as that towards the end surely that was the crash of a tree ah said i there falls the cedar treei mean the sallow one of the tall trees on the outside of the dingle has been snapped short what a pity said belle that the fine old oak which you saw the peasants cutting up gave way the other night when scarcely a breath of air was stirring how much better to have fallen in a storm like this the fiercest i remember i dont think so said i after braving a thousand tempests it was meeter for it to fall of itself than to be vanquished at last but to return to ab gwilyms poetry he was above culling dainty words and spoke boldly his mind on all subjects enraged with the thunder for parting him and morfydd he says at the conclusion of his ode my curse o thunder cling to thee for parting my dear pearl and me you and i shall part that is i shall go to my tent if you persist in repeating from him the man must have been a savage a poor woodpigeon has fallen dead yes said i there he lies just outside the tent often have i listened to his note when alone in this wilderness so you do not like ab gwilym what say you to old göthe mist shrouds the night and rack hear in the woods what an awful crack wildly the owls are flitting hark to the pillars splitting of palaces verdant ever the branches quiver and severthe mighty stems are creaking the poor roots breaking and shrieking in wild mixt ruin down dashing oer one another theyre crashing whilst midst the rocks so hoary whirlwinds hurry and worry hearst not sister hark said belle hark hearst not sister a chorus of voices no said belle but i hear a voicechapter xvfirst aid to a postchaise and a postillion more hospitality i listened attentively but i could hear nothing but the loud clashing of branches the pattering of rain and the muttered growl of thunder i was about to tell belle that she must have been mistaken when i heard a shout indistinct it is true owing to the noises aforesaid from some part of the field above the dingle i will soon see whats the matter said i to belle starting up i will go too said the girl stay where you are said i if i need you i will call and without waiting for an answer i hurried to the mouth of the dingle i was about a few yards only from the top of the ascent when i beheld a blaze of light from whence i knew not the next moment there was a loud crash and i appeared involved in a cloud of sulphurous smoke lord have mercy upon us i heard a voice say and methought i heard the plunging and struggling of horses i had stopped short on hearing the crash for i was half stunned but i now hurried forward and in a moment stood upon the plain here i was instantly aware of the cause of the crash and the smoke one of those balls generally called fireballs had fallen from the clouds and was burning on the plain at a short distance and the voice which i had heard and the plunging were as easily accounted for near the lefthand corner of the grove which surrounded the dingle and about ten yards from the fireball i perceived a chaise with a postillion on the box who was making efforts apparently useless to control his horses which were kicking and plunging in the highest degree of excitement i instantly ran towards the chaise in order to offer what help was in my power help me said the poor fellow as i drew nigh but before i could reach the horses they had turned rapidly round one of the forewheels flew from its axletree the chaise was overset and the postillion flung violently from his seat upon the field the horses now became more furious than before kicking desperately and endeavouring to disengage themselves from the fallen chaise as i was hesitating whether to run to the assistance of the postillion or endeavour to disengage the animals i heard the voice of belle exclaiming see to the horses i will look after the man she had it seems been alarmed by the crash which accompanied the firebolt and had hurried up to learn the cause i forthwith seized the horses by the heads and used all the means i possessed to soothe and pacify them employing every gentle modulation of which my voice was capable belle in the meantime had raised up the man who was much stunned by his fall but presently recovering his recollection to a certain degree he came limping to me holding his hand to his right thigh the first thing that must now be done said i is to free these horses from the traces can you undertake to do so i think i can said the man looking at me somewhat stupidly i will help said belle and without loss of time laid hold of one of the traces the man after a short pause also set to work and in a few minutes the horses were extricated now said i to the man what is next to be done i dont know said he indeed i scarcely know anything i have been so frightened by this horrible storm and so shaken by my fall i think said i that the storm is passing away so cast your fears away too and as for your fall you must bear it as lightly as you can i will tie the horses amongst those trees and then we will all betake us to the hollow below and whats to become of my chaise said the postillion looking ruefully on the fallen vehicle let us leave the chaise for the present said i we can be of no use to it i dont like to leave my chaise lying on the ground in this weather said the man i love my chaise and him whom it belongs to you are quite right to be fond of yourself said i on which account i advise you to seek shelter from the rain as soon as possible i was not talking of myself said the man but my master to whom the chaise belongs i thought you called the chaise yours said i thats my way of speaking said the man but the chaise is my masters and a better master does not live dont you think we could manage to raise up the chaise and what is to become of the horses said i i love my horses well enough said the man but they will take less harm than the chaise we two can never lift up that chaise but we three can said belle at least i think so and i know where to find two poles which will assist us you had better go to the tent said i you will be wet through i care not for a little wetting said belle moreover i have more gowns than onesee you after the horses thereupon i led the horses past the mouth of the dingle to a place where a gap in the hedge afforded admission to the copse or plantation on the southern side forcing them through the gap i led them to a spot amidst the trees which i deemed would afford them the most convenient place for standing then darting down into the dingle i brought up a rope and also the halter of my own nag and with these fastened them each to a separate tree in the best manner i could this done i returned to the chaise and the postillion in a minute or two belle arrived with two poles which it seems had long been lying overgrown with brushwood in a ditch or hollow behind the plantation with these both she and i set to work in endeavouring to raise the fallen chaise from the ground we experienced considerable difficulty in this undertaking at length with the assistance of the postillion we saw our efforts crowned with successthe chaise was lifted up and stood upright on three wheels we may leave it here in safety said i for it will hardly move away on three wheels even supposing it could run by itself i am afraid there is work here for a wheelwright in which case i cannot assist you if you were in need of a blacksmith it would be other wise i dont think either the wheel or the axle is hurt said the postillion who had been handling both it is only the linchpin having dropped out that caused the wheel to fly off if i could but find the linchpin though perhaps it fell out a mile away very likely said i but never mind the linchpin i can make you one or something that will serve but i cant stay here any longer i am going to my place below with this young gentlewoman and you had better follow us i am ready said the man and after lifting up the wheel and propping it against the chaise he went with us slightly limping and with his hand pressed to his thighas we were descending the narrow path belle leading the way and myself the last of the party the postillion suddenly stopped short and looked about him why do you stop said i i dont wish to offend you said the man but this seems to be a strange place you are leading me into i hope you and the young gentlewoman as you call her dont mean me any harmyou seemed in a great hurry to bring me here we wished to get you out of the rain said i and ourselves too that is if we can which i rather doubt for the canvas of a tent is slight shelter in such a rain but what harm should we wish to do you you may think i have money said the man and i have some but only thirty shillings and for a sum like that it would be hardly worth while to would it not said i thirty shillings after all are thirty shillings and for what i know half a dozen throats may have been cut in this place for that sum at the rate of five shillings each moreover there are horses which would serve to establish this young gentlewoman and myself in housekeeping provided we were thinking of such a thing then i suppose i have fallen into pretty hands said the man putting himself in a posture of defence but ill show no craven heart and if you attempt to lay hands on me ill try to pay you in your own coin im rather lamed in the leg but i can still use my fists so come on both of you man and woman if woman this be though she looks more like a grenadier let me hear no more of this nonsense said belle if you are afraid you can go back to your chaisewe only seek to do you a kindness why he was just now talking about cutting throats said the man you brought it on yourself said belle you suspected us and he wished to pass a joke upon you he would not hurt a hair of your head were your coach laden with gold nor would i well said the man i was wrongheres my hand to both of you shaking us by the hands ill go with you where you please but i thought this a strange lonesome place though i ought not much to mind strange lonesome places having been in plenty of such when i was a servant in italy without coming to any harmcome let us move on for tis a shame to keep you two in the rain so we descended the path which led into the depths of the dingle at the bottom i conducted the postillion to my tent which though the rain dripped and trickled through it afforded some shelter there i bade him sit down on the log of wood while i placed myself as usual on my stone belle in the meantime had repaired to her own place of abode after a little time i produced a bottle of the cordial of which i have previously had occasion to speak and made my guest take a considerable draught i then offered him some bread and cheese which he accepted with thanks in about an hour the rain had much abated what do you now propose to do said i i scarcely know said the man i suppose i must endeavour to put on the wheel with your help how far are you from your home i demanded upwards of thirty miles said the man my master keeps an inn on the great north road and from thence i started early this morning with a family which i conveyed across the country to a hall at some distance from here on my return i was beset by the thunderstorm which frightened the horses who dragged the chaise off the road into the field above and overset it as you saw i had proposed to pass the night at an inn about twelve miles from here on my way back though how i am to get there tonight i scarcely know even if we can put on the wheel for to tell you the truth i am shaken by my fall and the smoulder and smoke of that fireball have rather bewildered my head i am moreover not much acquainted with the way the best thing you can do said i is to pass the night here i will presently light a fire and endeavour to make you comfortablein the morning we will see to your wheel well said the man i shall be glad to pass the night here provided i do not intrude but i must see to the horses thereupon i conducted the man to the place where the horses were tied the trees drip rather upon them said the man and it will not do for them to remain here all night they will be better out in the field picking the grass but first of all they must have a good feed of corn thereupon he went to his chaise from which he presently brought two small bags partly filled with corninto them he inserted the mouths of the horses tying them over their heads here we will leave them for a time said the man when i think they have had enough i will come back tie their forelegs and let them pick aboutchapter xvithe newcomer takes kindly to the dingle and its occupants about whom he forms his own opinions it might be about ten oclock at night belle the postillion and myself sat just within the tent by a fire of charcoal which i had kindled in the chafingpan the man had removed the harness from his horses and after tethering their legs had left them for the night in the field above to regale themselves on what grass they could find the rain had long since entirely ceased and the moon and stars shone bright in the firmament up to which putting aside the canvas i occasionally looked from the depths of the dingle large drops of water however falling now and then upon the tent from the neighbouring trees would have served could we have forgotten it to remind us of the recent storm and also a certain chilliness in the atmosphere unusual to the season proceeding from the moisture with which the ground was saturated yet these circumstances only served to make our party enjoy the charcoal fire the more there we sat bending over it belle with her long beautiful hair streaming over her magnificent shoulders the postillion smoking his pipe in his shirtsleeves and waistcoat having flung aside his great coat which had sustained a thorough wetting and i without my waggoners slop of which it being in the same plight i had also divested myself the newcomer was a wellmade fellow of about thirty with an open and agreeable countenance i found him very well informed for a man in his station and with some pretensions to humour after we had discoursed for some time on indifferent subjects the postillion who had exhausted his pipe took it from his mouth and knocking out the ashes upon the ground exclaimed i little thought when i got up in the morning that i should spend the night in such agreeable company and after such a fright well said i i am glad that your opinion of us has improved it is not long since you seemed to hold us in rather a suspicious light and no wonder said the man seeing the place you were taking me to i was not a little but very much afraid of ye both and so i continued for some time though not to show a craven heart i pretended to be quite satisfied but i see i was altogether mistaken about ye i thought you vagrant gypsy folks and trampers but now vagrant gypsy folks and trampers said i and what are we but people of that stamp oh said the postillion if you wish to be thought such i am far too civil a person to contradict you especially after your kindness to me but but said i what do you mean by but i would have you to know that i am proud of being a travelling blacksmith look at these donkeyshoes i finished them this day the postillion took the shoes and examined them so you made these shoes he cried at last to be sure i did do you doubt it not in the least said the man ah ah said i i thought i should bring you back to your original opinion i am then a vagrant gypsy body a tramper a wandering blacksmith not a blacksmith whatever else you may be said the postillion laughing then how do you account for my making those shoes by your not being a blacksmith said the postillion no blacksmith would have made shoes in that manner besides what did you mean just now by saying you had finished these shoes today a real blacksmith would have flung off halfadozen sets of donkey shoes in one morning but you i will be sworn have been hammering at these for days and they do you credit but why because you are no blacksmith no friend your shoes may do for this young gentlewomans animal but i shouldnt like to have my horses shod by you unless at a great pinch indeed then said i for what do you take me why for some runaway young gentleman said the postillion no offence i hope none at all no one is offended at being taken or mistaken for a young gentleman whether runaway or not but from whence do you suppose i have run away why from college said the man no offencenone whatever and what induced me to run away from college a love affair ill be sworn said the postillion you had become acquainted with this young gentle woman so she and you mind how you get on friend said belle in a deep serious tone pray proceed said i i dare say you mean no offence none in the world said the postillion all i was going to say was that you agreed to run away together you from college and she from boardingschool well theres nothing to be ashamed of in a matter like that such things are done every day by young folks in high life are you offended said i to belle belle made no answer but placing her elbows on her knees buried her face in her hands so we ran away together said i ay ay said the postillion to gretna green though i cant say that i drove ye though i have driven many a pair and from gretna green we came here ill be bound you did said the man till you could arrange matters at home and the horseshoes said i the donkeyshoes you mean answered the postillion why i suppose you persuaded the blacksmith who married you to give you before you left a few lessons in his trade and we intend to stay here till we have arranged matters at home ay ay said the postillion till the old people are pacified and they send you letters directed to the next post town to be left till called for beginning with dear children and enclosing you each a cheque for one hundred pounds when you will leave this place and go home in a coach like gentlefolks to visit your governors i should like nothing better than to have the driving of you and then there will be a grand meeting of the two families and after a few reproaches the old people will agree to do something handsome for the poor thoughtless things so you will have a genteel house taken for you and an annuity allowed you you wont get much the first year five hundred at the most in order that the old folks may let you feel that they are not altogether satisfied with you and that you are yet entirely in their power but the second if you dont get a cool thousand may i catch cold especially should young madam here present a son and heir for the old people to fondle destined one day to become sole heir of the two illustrious houses and then all the grand folks in the neighbourhood who have bless their prudent hearts kept rather aloof from you till then for fear you should want anything from themi say all the carriage people in the neighbourhood when they see how swimmingly matters are going on will come in shoals to visit you really said i you are getting on swimmingly oh said the postillion i was not a gentlemans servant nine years without learning the ways of gentry and being able to know gentry when i see them and what do you say to all this i demanded of belle stop a moment interposed the postillion i have one more word to say and when you are surrounded by your comforts keeping your nice little barouche and pair your coachman and livery servant and visited by all the carriage people in the neighbourhoodto say nothing of the time when you come to the family estates on the death of the old peoplei shouldnt wonder if now and then you look back with longing and regret to the days when you lived in the damp dripping dingle had no better equipage than a pony or donkeycart and saw no better company than a tramper or gypsy except once when a poor postillion was glad to seat himself at your charcoal fire pray said i did you ever take lessons in elocution not directly said the postillion but my old master who was in parliament did and so did his son who was intended to be an orator a great professor used to come and give them lessons and i used to stand and listen by which means i picked up a considerable quantity of what is called rhetoric in what i last said i was aiming at what i have heard him frequently endeavouring to teach my governors as a thing indispensably necessary in all oratory a graceful perepereperegrination peroration perhaps just so said the postillion and now im sure i am not mistaken about you you have taken lessons yourself at first hand in the college vacations and a promising pupil you were i make no doubt well your friends will be all the happier to get you back has your governor much borough interest i ask you once more said i addressing myself to belle what you think of the history which this good man has made for us what should i think of it said belle still keeping her face buried in her hands but that it is mere nonsense nonsense said the postillion yes said the girl and you know it may my leg always ache if i do said the postillion patting his leg with his hand will you persuade me that this young man has never been at college i have never been at college but ay ay said the postillion but i have been to the best schools in britain to say nothing of a celebrated one in ireland well then it comes to the same thing said the postillion or perhaps you know more than if you had been at college and your governor my governor as you call him said i is dead and his borough interest my father had no borough interest said i had he possessed any he would perhaps not have died as he did honourably poor no no said the postillion if he had had borough interest he wouldnt have been poor nor honourable though perhaps a right honourable however with your grand education and genteel manners you made all right at last by persuading this noble young gentlewoman to run away from boardingschool with you i was never at a boardingschool said belle unless you call ay ay said the postillion boardingschool is vulgar i know i beg your pardon i ought to have called it academy or by some other much finer nameyou were in something much greater than a boardingschool there you are right said belle lifting up her head and looking the postillion full in the face by the light of the charcoal fire for i was bred in the workhouse wooh said the postillion it is true that i am of good ay ay said the postillion let us hear of good blood continued belle my name is berners isopel berners though my parents were unfortunate indeed with respect to blood i believe i am of better blood than the young man there you are mistaken said i by my fathers side i am of cornish blood and by my mothers of brave french protestant extraction now with respect to the blood of my fatherand to be descended well on the fathers side is the principal thingit is the best blood in the world for the cornish blood as the proverb says i dont care what the proverb says said belle i say my blood is the bestmy name is berners isopel bernersit was my mothers name and is better i am sure than any you bear whatever that may be and though you say that the descent on the fathers side is the principal thingand i know why you say so she added with some excitementi say that descent on the mothers side is of most account because the motherjust come from gretna green and already quarrelling said the postillion we do not come from gretna green said belle ah i had forgot said the postillion none but great people go to gretna green well then from church and already quarrelling about family just like two great people we have never been to church said belle and to prevent any more guessing on your part it will be as well for me to tell you friend that i am nothing to the young man and he of course nothing to me i am a poor travelling girl born in a workhouse journeying on my occasions with certain companions i came to this hollow where my company quarrelled with the young man who had settled down here as he had a right to do if he pleased and not been able to drive him out they went away after quarrelling with me too for not choosing to side with them so i stayed here along with the young man there being room for us both and the place being as free to me as to him and in order that you may be no longer puzzled with respect to myself said i i will give you a brief outline of my history i am the son of honourable parents who gave me a firstrate education as far as literature and languages went with which education i endeavoured on the death of my father to advance myself to wealth and reputation in the big city but failing in the attempt i conceived a disgust for the busy world and determined to retire from it after wandering about for some time and meeting with various adventures in one of which i contrived to obtain a pony cart and certain tools used by smiths and tinkers i came to this place where i amused myself with making horseshoes or rather ponyshoes having acquired the art of wielding the hammer and tongs from a strange kind of smithnot him of gretna greenwhom i knew in my childhood and here i lived doing harm to no one quite lonely and solitary till one fine morning the premises were visited by this young gentlewoman and her companions she did herself anything but justice when she said that her companions quarrelled with her because she would not side with them against me they quarrelled with her because she came most heroically to my assistance as i was on the point of being murdered and she forgot to tell you that after they had abandoned her she stood by me in the dark hour comforting and cheering me when unspeakable dread to which i am occasionally subject took possession of my mind she says she is nothing to me even as i am nothing to her i am of course nothing to her but she is mistaken in thinking she is nothing to me i entertain the highest regard and admiration for her being convinced that i might search the whole world in vain for a nature more heroic and devoted and for my part said belle with a sob a more quiet agreeable partner in a place like this i would not wish to have it is true he has strange ways and frequently puts words into my mouth very difficult to utter butbut and here she buried her face once more in her hands well said the postillion i have been mistaken about you that is not altogether but in part you are not rich folks it seems but you are not common people and that i could have sworn what i call a shame is that some people i have known are not in your place and you in theirsyou with their estates and borough interest they in this dingle with these carts and animals but there is no help for these things were i the great mumbo jumbo above i would endeavour to manage matters better but being a simple postillion glad to earn three shillings a day i cant be expected to do much here the postillion tells his story after they have heard it lavengro isopel and the narrator roll themselves in their several blankets and bid one another good nightchapter xviithe making of the linchpinthe sound sleeperbreakfastthe postillions departure i awoke at the first break of day and leaving the postillion fast asleep stepped out of the tent the dingle was dank and dripping i lighted a fire of coals and got my forge in readiness i then ascended to the field where the chaise was standing as we had left it on the previous evening after looking at the cloudstone near it now cold and split into three pieces i set about prying narrowly into the condition of the wheel and axletreethe latter had sustained no damage of any consequence and the wheel as far as i was able to judge was sound being only slightly injured in the box the only thing requisite to set the chaise in a travelling condition appeared to be a linchpin which i determined to make going to the companion wheel i took out the linchpin which i carried down with me to the dingle to serve me as a model i found belle by this time dressed and seated near the forge with a slight nod to her like that which a person gives who happens to see an acquaintance when his mind is occupied with important business i forthwith set about my work selecting a piece of iron which i thought would serve my purpose i placed it in the fire and plying the bellows in a furious manner soon made it hot then seizing it with the tongs i laid it on my anvil and began to beat it with my hammer according to the rules of my art the dingle resounded with my strokes belle sat still and occasionally smiled but suddenly started up and retreated towards her encampment on a spark which i purposely sent in her direction alighting on her knee i found the making of a linchpin no easy matter it was however less difficult than the fabrication of a ponyshoe my work indeed was much facilitated by my having another pin to look at in about threequarters of an hour i had succeeded tolerably well and had produced a linchpin which i thought would serve during all this time notwithstanding the noise which i was making the postillion never showed his face his nonappearance at first alarmed me i was afraid he might be dead but on looking into the tent i found him still buried in the soundest sleep he must surely be descended from one of the seven sleepers said i as i turned away and resumed my work my work finished i took a little oil leather and sand and polished the pin as well as i could then summoning belle we both went to the chaise where with her assistance i put on the wheel the linchpin which i had made fitted its place very well and having replaced the other i gazed at the chaise for some time with my heart full of that satisfaction which results from the consciousness of having achieved a great action then after looking at belle in the hope of obtaining a compliment from her lips which did not come i returned to the dingle without saying a word followed by her belle set about making preparations for breakfast and i taking the kettle went and filled it at the spring having hung it over the fire i went to the tent in which the postillion was still sleeping and called upon him to arise he awoke with a start and stared around him at first with the utmost surprise not unmixed i could observe with a certain degree of fear at last looking in my face he appeared to recollect himself i had quite forgot said he as he got up where i was and all that happened yesterday however i remember now the whole affair thunderstorm thunderbolt frightened horses and all your kindness come i must see after my coach and horses i hope we shall be able to repair the damage the damage is already quite repaired said i as you will see if you come to the field above you dont say so said the postillion coming out of the tent well i am mightily beholden to you good morning young gentlewoman said he addressing belle who having finished her preparations was seated near the fire good morning young man said belle i suppose you would be glad of some breakfast however you must wait a little the kettle does not boil come and look at your chaise said i but tell me how it happened that the noise which i have been making did not awake you for threequarters of an hour at least i was hammering close at your ear i heard you all the time said the postillion but your hammering made me sleep all the sounder i am used to hear hammering in my morning sleep theres a forge close by the room where i sleep when im at home at my inn for we have all kinds of conveniences at my innforge carpenters shop and wheelwrightsso that when i heard you hammering i thought no doubt that it was the old noise and that i was comfortable in my bed at my own inn we now ascended to the field where i showed the postillion his chaise he looked at the pin attentively rubbed his hands and gave a loud laugh is it not well done said i it will do till i get home he replied and that is all you have to say i demanded and thats a good deal said he considering who made it but dont be offended he added i shall prize it all the more for its being made by a gentleman and no blacksmith and so will my governor when i show it to him i shant let it remain where it is but will keep it as a remembrance of you as long as i live he then again rubbed his hands with great glee and said i will now go and see after my horses and then to breakfast partner if you please suddenly however looking at his hands he said before sitting down to breakfast i am in the habit of washing my hands and face i suppose you could not furnish me with a little soap and water as much water as you please said i but if you want soap i must go and trouble the young gentlewoman for some by no means said the postillion water will do at a pinch follow me said i and leading him to the pond of the frogs and newts i said this is my ewer you are welcome to part of itthe water is so soft that it is scarcely necessary to add soap to it then lying down on the bank i plunged my head into the water then scrubbed my hands and face and afterwards wiped them with some long grass which grew on the margin of the pond bravo said the postillion i see you know how to make a shift he then followed my example declared he never felt more refreshed in his life and giving a bound said he would go and look after his horses we then went to look after the horses which we found not much the worse for having spent the night in the open air mycompanion again inserted their heads in the cornbags and leaving the animals to discuss their corn returned with me to the dingle where we found the kettle boiling we sat down and belle made tea and did the honours of the meal the postillion was in high spirits ate heartily and to belles evident satisfaction declared that he had never drank better tea in his life or indeed any half so good breakfast over he said that he must now go and harness his horses as it was high time for him to return to his inn belle gave him her hand and wished him farewell the postillion shook her hand warmly and was advancing close up to herfor what purpose i cannot saywhereupon belle withdrawing her hand drew herself up with an air which caused the postillion to retreat a step or two with an exceedingly sheepish look recovering himself however he made a low bow and proceeded up the path i attended him and helped to harness his horses and put them to the vehicle he then shook me by the hand and taking the reins and whip mounted to his seat ere he drove away he thus addressed me if ever i forget your kindness and that of the young woman below dash my buttons if ever either of you should enter my inn you may depend upon a warm welcome the best that can be set before you and no expense to either for i will give both of you the best of characters to the governor who is the very best fellow upon all the road as for your linchpin i trust it will serve till i get home when i will take it out and keep it in remembrance of you all the days of my life then giving the horses a jerk with his reins he cracked his whip and drove off i returned to the dingle belle had removed the breakfast things and was busy in her own encampment nothing occurred worthy of being related for two hours at the end of which time belle departed on a short expedition and i again found myself alone in the dinglechapter xviiithe man in blackthe emperor of germany nepotismdonna olympiaomnipotencecamillo astalli the five propositions in the evening i received another visit from the man in black i had been taking a stroll in the neighbourhood and was sitting in the dingle in rather a listless manner scarcely knowing how to employ myself his coming therefore was by no means disagreeable to me i produced the hollands and glass from my tent where isopel berners had requested me to deposit them and also some lump sugar then taking the gotch i fetched water from the spring and sitting down begged the man in black to help himself he was not slow in complying with my desire and prepared for himself a glass of hollands and water with a lump of sugar in it after he had taken two or three sips with evident satisfaction i remembering his chuckling exclamation of go to rome for money when he last left the dingle took the liberty after a little conversation of reminding him of it whereupon with a he he he he replied your idea was not quite so original as i supposed after leaving you the other night i remembered having read of an emperor of germany who conceived the idea of applying to rome for money and actually put it into practice urban the eighth then occupied the papal chair of the family of the barberini nicknamed the mosche or flies from the circumstance of bees being their armorial bearing the emperor having exhausted all his money in endeavouring to defend the church against gustavus adolphus the great king of sweden who was bent on its destruction applied in his necessity to the pope for a loan of money the pope however and his relations whose cellars were at that time full of the money of the church which they had been plundering for years refused to lend him a scudo whereupon a pasquinade picture was stuck up at rome representing the church lying on a bed gashed with dreadful wounds and beset all over with flies which were sucking her whilst the emperor of germany was kneeling before her with a miserable face requesting a little money towards carrying on the war against the heretics to which the poor church was made to say how can i assist you o my champion do you not see that the flies have sucked me to the very bones which story said he shows that the idea of going to rome for money was not quite so original as i imagined the other night though utterly preposterous this affair said he occurred in what were called the days of nepotism certain popes who wished to make themselves in some degree independent of the cardinals surrounded themselves with their nephews and the rest of their family who sucked the church and christendom as much as they could none doing so more effectually than the relations of urban the eighth at whose death according to the book called the nipotismo di roma there were in the barberini family two hundred and twentyseven governments abbeys and high dignities and so much hard cash in their possession that threescore and ten mules were scarcely sufficient to convey the plunder of one of them to palestrina he added however that it was probable that christendom fared better whilst the popes were thus independent as it was less sucked whereas before and after that period it was sucked by hundreds instead of tens by the cardinals and all their relations instead of by the pope and his nephews only then after drinking rather copiously of his hollands he said that it was certainly no bad idea of the popes to surround themselves with nephews on whom they bestowed great church dignities as by so doing they were tolerably safe from poison whereas a pope if abandoned to the cardinals might at any time be made away with by them provided they thought that he lived too long or that he seemed disposed to do anything which they disliked adding that ganganelli would never have been poisoned provided he had had nephews about him to take care of his life and to see that nothing unholy was put into his food or a bustling stirring brothers wife like donna olympia he then with a he he he asked me if i had ever read the book called the nipotismo di roma and on my replying in the negative he told me that it was a very curious and entertaining book which he occasionally looked at in an idle hour and proceeded to relate to me anecdotes out of the nipotismo di roma about the successor of urban innocent the tenth and donna olympia showing how fond he was of her and how she cooked his food and kept the cardinals away from it and how she and her creatures plundered christendom with the sanction of the pope until christendom becoming enraged insisted that he should put her away which he did for a time putting a nephewone camillo astalliin her place in which however he did not continue long for the pope conceiving a pique against him banished him from his sight and recalled donna olympia who took care of his food and plundered christendom until pope innocent died i said that i only wondered that between pope and cardinals the whole system of rome had not long fallen to the ground and was told in reply that its not having fallen was the strongest proof of its vital power and the absolute necessity for the existence of the system that the system notwithstanding its occasional disorders went on popes and cardinals might prey upon its bowels and sell its interests but the system survived the cutting off of this or that member was not able to cause rome any vital loss for as soon as she lost a member the loss was supplied by her own inherent vitality though her popes had been poisoned by cardinals and her cardinals by popes and though priests occasionally poisoned popes cardinals and each other after all that had been and might be she had still and would ever have her priests cardinals and popefinding the man in black so communicative and reasonable i determined to make the best of my opportunity and learn from him all i could with respect to the papal system and told him that he would particularly oblige me by telling me who the pope of rome was and received for answer that he was an old man elected by a majority of cardinals to the papal chair who immediately after his election became omnipotent and equal to god on earth on my begging him not to talk such nonsense and asking him how a person could be omnipotent who could not always preserve himself from poison even when fenced round by nephews or protected by a bustling woman he after taking a long sip of hollands and water told me that i must not expect too much from omnipotence for example that as it would be unreasonable to expect that one above could annihilate the pastfor instance the seven years war or the french revolutionthough any one who believed in him would acknowledge him to be omnipotent so would it be unreasonable for the faithful to expect that the pope could always guard himself from poison then after looking at me for a moment steadfastly and taking another sip he told me that popes had frequently done impossibilities for example innocent the tenth had created a nephew for not liking particularly any of his real nephews he had created the said camillo astalli his nephew asking me with a he he what but omnipotence could make a young man nephew to a person to whom he was not in the slightest degree related on my observing that of course no one believed that the young fellow was really the popes nephew though the pope might have adopted him as such the man in black replied that the reality of the nephewship of camillo astalli had hitherto never become a point of faith let however the present pope or any other pope proclaim that it is necessary to believe in the reality of the nephewship of camillo astalli and see whether the faithful would not believe in it who can doubt that he added seeing that they believe in the reality of the five propositions of jansenius the jesuits wishing to ruin the jansenists induced a pope to declare that such and such damnable opinions which they called five propositions were to be found in a book written by jansen though in reality no such propositions were to be found there whereupon the existence of these propositions became forthwith a point of faith to the faithful do you then think he demanded that there is one of the faithful who would not swallow if called upon the nephewship of camillo astalli as easily as the five propositions of jansenius surely then said i the faithful must be a pretty pack of simpletons whereupon the man in black exclaimed what a protestant and an infringer of the rights of faith heres a fellow who would feel himself insulted if any one were to ask him how he could believe in the miraculous conception calling people simpletons who swallow the five propositions of jansenius and are disposed if called upon to swallow the reality of the nephewship of camillo astalli i was about to speak when i was interrupted by the arrival of belle after unharnessing her donkey and adjusting her person a little she came and sat down by us in the meantime i had helped my companion to some more hollands and water and had plunged with him into yet deeper discoursechapter xixnecessity of religionthe great indian one image worshipshakespearethe pat answerkrishna amen having told the man in black that i should like to know all the truth with regard to the pope and his system he assured me he should be delighted to give me all the information in his power that he had come to the dingle not so much for the sake of the good cheer which i was in the habit of giving him as in the hope of inducing me to enlist under the banners of rome and to fight in her cause and that he had no doubt that by speaking out frankly to me he ran the best chance of winning me over he then proceeded to tell me that the experience of countless ages had proved the necessity of religion the necessity he would admit was only for simpletons but as ninetenths of the dwellers upon this earth were simpletons it would never do for sensible people to run counter to their folly but on the contrary it was the wisest course to encourage them in it always provided that by so doing sensible people could derive advantage that the truly sensible people of this world were the priests who without caring a straw for religion for its own sake made use of it as a cord by which to draw the simpletons after them that there were many religions in this world all of which had been turned to excellent account by the priesthood but that the one the best adapted for the purposes of priestcraft was the popish which he said was the oldest in the world and the best calculated to endure on my inquiring what he meant by saying the popish religion was the oldest in the world whereas there could be no doubt that the greek and roman religion had existed long before it to say nothing of the old indian religion still in existence and vigour he said with a nod after taking a sip at his glass that between me and him the popish religion that of greece and rome and the old indian system were in reality one and the same you told me that you intended to be frank said i but however frank you may be i think you are rather wild we priests of rome said the man in black even those amongst us who do not go much abroad know a great deal about church matters of which you heretics have very little idea those of our brethren of the propaganda on their return home from distant missions not unfrequently tell us very strange things relating to our dear mother for example our first missionaries to the east were not slow in discovering and telling to their brethren that our religion and the great indian one were identical no more difference between them than between ram and rome priests convents beads prayers processions fastings penances all the same not forgetting anchorites and vermin he he the pope they found under the title of the grand lama a sucking child surrounded by an immense number of priests our good brethren some two hundred years ago had a hearty laugh which their successors have often reechoed they said that helpless suckling and its priests put them so much in mind of their own old man surrounded by his cardinals he he old age is second childhood did they find christ said i they found him too said the man in black that is they saw his image he is considered in india as a pure kind of being and on that account perhaps is kept there rather in the background even as he is here all this is very mysterious to me said i very likely said the man in black but of this i am tolerably sure and so are most of those of rome that modern rome had its religion from ancient rome which had its religion from the east but how i demanded it was brought about i believe by the wanderings of nations said the man in black a brother of the propaganda a very learned man once told mei do not mean mezzofante who has not five ideasthis brother once told me that all we of the old world from calcutta to dublin are of the same stock and were originally of the same language and all of one religion i put in all of one religion said the mad in black and now follow different modifications of the same religion we christians are not imageworshippers said i you heretics are not you mean said the man in black but you will be put down just as you have always been though others may rise up after you the true religion is imageworship people may strive against it but they will only work themselves to an oil how did it fare with that greek emperor the iconoclast what was his name leon the isaurian did not his imagebreaking cost him italy the fairest province of his empire and did not ten fresh images start up at home forevery one which he demolished oh you little know the craving which the soul sometimes feels after a good bodily image i have indeed no conception of it said i i have an abhorrence of idolatrythe idea of bowing before a graven figure the idea indeed said belle who had now joined us did you never bow before that of shakespeare said the man in black addressing himself to me after a low bow to belle i dont remember that i ever did said i but even suppose i did suppose you did said the man in black shame on you mr hater of idolatry why the very supposition brings you to the ground you must make figures of shakespeare must you then why not of st antonio or ignacio or of a greater personage still i know what you are going to say he cried interrupting me as i was about to speak you dont make his image in order to pay it divine honours but only to look at it and think of shakespeare but this looking at a thing in order to think of a person is the very basis of idolatry shakespeares works are not sufficient for you no more are the bible or the legend of saint antony or saint ignacio for us that is for those of us who believe in them i tell you zingaro that no religion can exist long which rejects a good bodily image do you think said i that shakespeares works would not exist without his image i believe said the man in black that shakespeares image is looked at more than his works and will be looked at and perhaps adored when they are forgotten i am surprised that they have not been forgotten long ago i am no admirer of them but i cant imagine said i how you will put aside the authority of moses if moses strove against imageworship should not his doing so be conclusive as to the impropriety of the practice what higher authority can you have than that of moses the practice of the great majority of the human race said the man in black and the recurrence to imageworship where imageworship has been abolished do you know that moses is considered by the church as no better than a heretic and though for particular reasons it has been obliged to adopt his writings the adoption was merely a sham one as it never paid the slightest attention to them no no the church was never led by moses nor by one mightier than he whose doctrine it has equally nullifiedi allude to krishna in his second avatar the church it is true governs in his name but not unfrequently gives him the lie if he happens to have said anything which it dislikes did you never hear the reply which padre paolo segani made to the french protestant jean anthoine guerin who had asked him whether it was easier for christ to have been mistaken in his gospel than for the pope to be mistaken in his decrees i never heard their names before said i the answer was pat said the man in black though he who made it was confessedly the most ignorant fellow of the very ignorant order to which he belonged the augustine christ might err as a man said he but the pope can never err being god the whole story is related in the nipotismo i wonder you should ever have troubled yourselves with christ at all said i what was to be done said the man in black the power of that name suddenly came over europe like the power of a mighty wind it was said to have come from judæa and from judæa it probably came when it first began to agitate minds in these parts but it seems to have been known in the remote east more or less for thousands of years previously it filled peoples minds with madness it was followed by books which were never much regarded as they contained little of insanity but the name what fury that breathed into people the books were about peace and gentleness but the name was the most horrible of warcriesthose who wished to uphold old names at first strove to oppose it but their efforts were feeble and they had no good warcry what was mars as a warcry compared with the name of it was said that they persecuted terribly but who said so the christians the christians could have given them a lesson in the art of persecution and eventually did so none but christians have ever been good persecutors well the old religion succumbed christianity prevailed for the ferocious is sure to prevail over the gentle i thought said i you stated a little time ago that the popish religion and the ancient roman are the same in every point but that name that krishna and the fury and love of persecution which it inspired said the man in black a hot blast came from the east sounding krishna it absolutely maddened peoples minds and the people would call themselves his children we will not belong to jupiter any longer we will belong to krishna and they did belong to krishna that is in name but in nothing else for who ever cared for krishna in the christian world or who ever regarded the words attributed to him or put them in practicewhy we protestants regard his words and endeavour to practise what they enjoin as much as possible but you reject his image said the man in black better reject his words than his image no religion can exist long which rejects a good bodily image why the very negro barbarians of high barbary could give you a lesson on that point they have their fetish images to which they look for help in their afflictions they have likewise a high priest whom they call mumbo jumbo said i i know all about him already how came you to know anything about him said the man in black with a look of some surprise some of us poor protestant tinkers said i though we live in dingles as also acquainted with a thing or two i really believe you are said the man in black staring at me but in connection with this mumbo jumbo i could relate to you a comical story about a fellow an english servant i once met at rome it would be quite unnecessary said i i would much sooner hear you talk about krishna his words and image spoken like a true heretic said the man in black one of the faithful would have placed his image before his words for what are all the words in the world compared with a good bodily image i believe you occasionally quote his words said i he he said the man in black occasionally for example said i upon this rock i will found my church he he said the man in black you must really become one of us yet you must have had some difficulty in getting the rock to rome none whatever said the man in black faith can remove mountains to say nothing of rocksho ho but i cannot imagine said i what advantage you could derive from perverting those words of scripture in which the saviour talks about eating his body i do not know indeed why we troubled our heads about the matter at all said the man in black but when you talk about perverting the meaning of the text you speak ignorantly mr tinker when he whom you call the saviour gave his followers the sop and bade them eat it telling them it was his body he delicately alluded to what it was incumbent upon them to do after his death namely to eat his body you do not mean to say that he intended they should actually eat his body then you suppose ignorantly said the man in black eating the bodies of the dead was a heathenish custom practised by the heirs and legatees of people who left property and this custom is alluded to in the text but what has the new testament to do with heathen customs said i except to destroy them more than you suppose said the man in black we priests of rome who have long lived at rome know much better what the new testament is made of than the heretics and their theologians not forgetting their tinkers though i confess some of the latter have occasionally surprised usfor example bunyan the new testament is crowded with allusions to heathen customs and with words connected with pagan sorcery now with respect to words i would fain have you who pretend to be a philologist tell me the meaning of amen i made no answer we of rome said the man in black know two or three things of which the heretics are quite ignorant for example there are those amongst usthose too who do not pretend to be philologistswho know what amen is and moreover how we got it we got it from our ancestors the priests of ancient rome and they got the word from their ancestors of the east the priests of buddh and brahma and what is the meaning of the word i demanded amen said the man in black is a modification of the old hindoo formula omani batsikhom by the almost ceaseless repetition of which the indians hope to be received finally to the rest or state of forgetfulness of buddh or brahma a foolish practice you will say but are you heretics much wiser who are continually sticking amen to the end of yourprayers little knowing when you do so that you are consigning yourselves to the repose of buddh oh what hearty laughs our missionaries have had when comparing the eternally sounding eastern gibberish of omani batsikhom and the ave maria and amen jesus of our own idiotical devotees i have nothing to say about the ave marias and amens of your superstitious devotees said i i daresay that they use them nonsensically enough but in putting amen to the end of a prayer we merely intend to express so let it be it means nothing of the kind said the man in black and the hindoos might just as well put your national oath at the end of their prayers as perhaps they will after a great many thousand years when english is forgotten and only a few words of it remembered by dim tradition without being understood how strange if after the lapse of four thousand years the hindoos should damn themselves to the blindness so dear to their present masters even as their masters at present consign themselves to the forgetfulness so dear to the hindoos but my glass has been empty for a considerable time perhaps bellissima biondina said he addressing belle you will deign to replenish it i shall do no such thing said belle you have drank quite enough and talked more than enough and to tell you the truth i wish you would leave us alone shame on you belle said i consider the obligations of hospitality i am sick of that word said belle you are so frequently misusing it were this place not mumpers dingle and consequently as free to the fellow as ourselves i would lead him out of it pray be quiet belle said i you had better help yourself said i addressing myself to the man in black the lady is angry with you i am sorry for it said the man in black if she is angry with me i am not so with her and shall always be proud to wait upon her in the meantime i will wait upon myselfchapter xxthe proposalthe scotch novellatitude miraclespestilent hereticsold fraserwonderful text no armenian the man in black having helped himself to some more of his favourite beverage and tasted it i thus addressed him the evening is getting rather advanced and i can see that this lady pointing to belle is anxious for her tea which she prefers to take cosily and comfortably with me in the dingle the place it is true is as free to you as to ourselves nevertheless as we are located here by necessity whilst you merely come as a visitor i must take the liberty of telling you that we shall be glad to be alone as soon as you have said what you have to say and have finished the glass of refreshment at present in your hand i think you said some time ago that one of your motives for coming hither was to induce me to enlist under the banner of rome i wish to know whether that was really the case decidedly so said the man in black i come here principally in the hope of enlisting you in our regiment in which i have no doubt you could do us excellent service would you enlist my companion as well i demanded we should be only too proud to have her among us whether she comes with you or alone said the man in black with a polite bow to belle before we give you an answer i replied i would fain know more about you perhaps you will declare your name that i will never do said the man in black no one in england knows it but myself and i will not declare it even in a dingle as for the rest sono un prete cattolica appostolicothat is all that many a one of us can say for himself and it assuredly means a great deal we will now proceed to business said i you must be aware that we english are generally considered a selfinterested people and with considerable justice said the man in black drinking well you are a person of acute perception and i will presently make it evident to you that it would be to your interest to join with us you are at present evidently in very needy circumstances and are lost not only to yourself but the world but should you enlist with us i could find you an occupation not only agreeable but one in which your talents would have free scope i would introduce you in the various grand houses here in england to which i have myself admission as a surprising young gentleman of infinite learning who by dint of study has discovered that the roman is the only true faith i tell you confidently that our popish females would make a saint nay a god of you they are fools enough for anything there is one person in particular with whom i should wish to make you acquainted in the hope that you would be able to help me to perform good service to the holy see he is a gouty old fellow of some learning residing in an old hall near the great western seaport and is one of the very few amongst the english catholics possessing a grain of sense i think you could help us to govern him for he is not unfrequently disposed to be restive asks us strange questionsoccasionally threatens us with his crutch and behaves so that we are often afraid that we shall lose him or rather his property which he has bequeathed to us and which is enormous i am sure that you could help us to deal with him sometimes with your humour sometimes with your learning and perhaps occasionally with your fists and in what manner would you provide for my companion said i we would place her at once said the man in black in the house of two highly respectable catholic ladies in this neighbourhood where she would be treated with every care and consideration till her conversion should be accomplished in a regular manner we would then remove her to a female monastic establishment where after undergoing a years probation during which time she would be instructed in every elegant accomplishment she should take the veil her advancement would speedily follow for with such a face and figure she would make a capital lady abbess especially in italy to which country she would probably be sent ladies of her hair and complexionto say nothing of her heightbeing a curiosity in the south with a little care and management she could soon obtain a vast reputation for sanctity and who knows but after her death she might become a glorified sainthe he sister maria theresa for that is the name i propose you should bear holy mother maria theresaglorified and celestial saint i have the honour of drinking to your health and the man in black drank well belle said i what have you to say to the gentlemans proposal that if he goes on in this way i will break his glass against his mouth you have heard the ladys answer said ii have said the man in black and shall not press the matter i cant help however repeating that she would make a capital lady abbess she would keep the nuns in order i warrant her no easy matter break the glass against my mouth he he how she would send the holy utensils flying at the nuns heads occasionally and just the person to wring the nose of satan should he venture to appear one night in her cell in the shape of a handsome black man no offence madam no offence pray retain your seat said he observing that belle had started up i mean no offence well if you will not consent to be an abbess perhaps you will consent to follow this young zingaro and to cooperate with him and us i am a priest madam and can join you both in an instant connubio stabili as i suppose the knot has not been tied already hold your mumping gibberish said belle and leave the dingle this moment for though tis free to every one you have no right to insult me in it pray be pacified said i to belle getting up and placing myself between her and the man in black he will presently leave take my word for itthere sit down again said i as i led her to her seat then resuming my own i said to the man in black i advise you to leave the dingle as soon as possible i should wish to have your answer to my proposal first said he well then here you shall have it i will not entertain your proposal i detest your schemes they are both wicked and foolish wicked said the man in black have they nothe hethe furtherance of religion in view a religion said i in which you yourself do not believe and which you contemn whether i believe in it or not said the man in black it is adapted for the generality of the human race so i will forward it and advise you to do the same it was nearly extirpated in these regions but it is springing up again owing to circumstances radicalism is a good friend to us all the liberals laud up our system out of hatred to the established church though our system is ten times less liberal than the church of england some of them have really come over to us i myself confess a baronet sir charles wolesley who presided over the first radical meeting ever held in england he was an atheist when he came over to us in the hope of mortifying his own churchbut he is nowho hoa real catholic devoteequite afraid of my threats i made him frequently scourge himself before me well radicalism does us good service especially amongst the lower classes for radicalism chiefly flourishes amongst them for though a baronet or two may be found amongst the radicals and perhaps as many lordsfellows who have been discarded by their own order for clownishness or something they have doneit incontestably flourishes best among the lower orders then the love of what is foreign is a great friend to us this love is chiefly confined to the middle and upper classes some admire the french and imitate them others must needs be spaniards dress themselves up in a zamarra stick a cigar in their mouths and say carajo others would pass for germans he he the idea of any one wishing to pass for a german but what has done us more service than anything else in these regionsi mean amidst the middle classes has been the novel the scotch novel the good folks since they have read the novels have become jacobites and because all the jacobs were papists the good folks must become papists also or at least papistically inclined the very scotch presbyterians since they have read the novels are become all but papists i speak advisedly having lately been amongst them theres a trumpery bit of a half papist sect called the scotch episcopalian church which lay dormant and nearly forgotten for upwards of a hundred years which has of late got wonderfully into fashion in scotland because forsooth some of the longhaired gentry of the novels were said to belong to it such as montrose and dundee and to this the presbyterians are going over in throngs traducing and vilifying their own forefathers or denying them altogether and calling themselves descendants ofho ho hoscottish cavaliers i have heard them myself repeating snatches of jacobite ditties about bonnie dundee and come fill up my cup and fill up my can and saddle my horse and call up my man theres stuff for you not that i object to the first part of the ditty it is natural enough that a scotchman should cry come fill up my cup more especially if hes drinking at another persons expenseall scotchmen being fond of liquor at free cost but saddle his horsefor what purpose i would ask where is the use of saddling a horse unless you can ride him and where was there ever a scotchman who could ride of course you have not a drop of scotch blood in your veins said i otherwise you would never have uttered that last sentence dont be too sure of that said the man in black you know little of popery if you imagine that it cannot extinguish love of country even in a scotchman a thoroughgoing papistand who more thoroughgoing than myselfcares nothing for his country and why should he he belongs to a system and not to a countryone thing said i connected with you i cannot understand you call yourself a thoroughgoing papist yet are continually saying the most pungent things against popery and turning to unbounded ridicule those who show any inclination to embrace it rome is a very sensible old body said the man in black and little cares what her children say provided they do her bidding she knows several things and amongst others that no servants work so hard and faithfully as those who curse their masters at every stroke they do she was not fool enough to be angry with the miquelets of alba who renounced her and called her puta all the time they were cutting the throats of the netherlanders now if she allowed her faithful soldiers the latitude of renouncing her and calling her puta in the marketplace think not she is so unreasonable as to object to her faithful priests occasionally calling her puta in the dingle but said i suppose some one were to tell the world some of the disorderly things which her priests say in the dingle he would have the fate of cassandra said the man in black no one would believe himyes the priests would but they would make no sign of belief they believe in the alcoran des cordeliers that is those who have read it but they make no sign a pretty system said i which extinguishes love of country and of everything noble and brings the minds of its ministers to a parity with those of devils who delight in nothing but mischief the system said the man in black is a grand one with unbounded vitality compare it with your protestantism and you will see the difference popery is ever at work whilst protestantism is supine a pretty church indeed the protestant why it cant even work a miracle can your church work miracles i demanded that was the very question said the man in black which the ancient british clergy asked of austin monk after they had been fools enough to acknowledge their own inability we dont pretend to work miracles do you oh dear me yes said austin we find no difficulty in the matter we can raise the dead we can make the blind see and to convince you i will give sight to the blind here is this blind saxon whom you cannot cure but on whose eyes i will manifest my power in order to show the difference between the true and the false church and forthwith with the assistance of a handkerchief and a little hot water he opened the eyes of the barbarian so we manage matters a pretty church that old british church which could not work miraclesquite as helpless as the modern one the fools was birdlime so scarce a thing amongst themand were the properties of warm water so unknown to them that they could not close a pair of eyes and open them its a pity said i that the british clergy at that interview with austin did not bring forward a blind welshman and ask the monk to operate upon him clearly said the man in black thats what they ought to have done but they were fools without a single resource here he took a sip at his glass but they did not believe in the miracle said i and what did their not believing avail them said the man in black austin remained master of the field and they went away holding their heads down and muttering to themselves what a fine subject for a painting would be austins opening the eyes of the saxon barbarian and the discomfiture of the british clergy i wonder it has not been painted he he i suppose your church still pet forms miracles occasionally said i it does said the man in black the rev has lately been performing miracles in ireland destroying devils that had got possession of people he has been eminently successful in two instances he not only destroyed the devils but the lives of the people possessedhe he oh there is so much energy in our system we are always at work whilst protestantism is supine you must not imagine said i that all protestants are supine some of them appear to be filled with unbounded zeal they deal it is true not in lying miracles but they propagate gods word i remember only a few months ago having occasion for a bible going to an establishment the object of which was to send bibles all over the world the supporters of that establishment could have no selfinterested views for i was supplied by them with a noblesized bible at a price so small as to preclude the idea that it could bring any profit to the vendors the countenance of the man in black slightly fell i know the people to whom you allude said he indeed unknown to them i have frequently been to see them and observed their ways i tell you frankly that there is not a set of people in this kingdom who have caused our church so much trouble and uneasiness i should rather say that they alone cause usany for as for the rest what with their drowsiness their plethora their folly and their vanity they are doing us anything but mischief these fellows are a pestilent set of heretics whom we would gladly see burnt they are with the most untiring perseverance and in spite of divers minatory declarations of the holy father scattering their books abroad through all europe and have caused many people in catholic countries to think that hitherto their priesthood have endeavoured as much as possible to keep them blinded there is one fellow amongst them for whom we entertain a particular aversion a big burly parson with the face of a lion the voice of a buffalo and a fist like a sledgehammer the last time i was there i observed that his eye was upon me and i did not like the glance he gave me at all i observed him clench his fist and i took my departure as fast as i conveniently could whether he suspected who i was i know not but i did not like his look at all and do not intend to go again well then said i you confess that you have redoubtable enemies to your plans in these regions and that even amongst the ecclesiastics there are some widely different from those of the plethoric and platitude schools it is but too true said the man in black and if the rest of your church were like them we should quickly bid adieu to all hope of converting these regions but we are thankful to be able to say that such folks are not numerous there are moreover causes at work quite sufficient to undermine even their zeal their sons return at the vacations from oxford and cambridge puppies full of the nonsense which they have imbibed from platitude professors and this nonsense they retail at home where it fails not to make some impression whilst the daughters screami beg their pardons warble about scotlands montrose and bonny dundee and all the jacobs so we have no doubt that their papas zeal about the propagation of such a vulgar book as the bible will in a very little time be terribly diminished old rome will win so you had better join her and the man in black drained the last drop in his glass never said i will i become the slave of rome she will allow you latitude said the man in black do but serve her and she will allow you to call her puta at a decent time and place her popes occasionally call her puta a pope has been known to start from his bed at midnight and rush out into the corridor and call out puta three times in a voice which pierced the vatican that pope was alexander the sixth i dare say said i the greatest monster that ever existed though the worthiest head which the popish system ever hadso his conscience was not always still i thought it had been seared with a brand of iron i did not allude to him but to a much more modern pope said the man in black it is true he brought the word which is spanish from spain his native country to rome he was very fond of calling the church by that name and other popes have taken it up she will allow you to call her by it if you belong to her i shall call her so said i without belonging to her or asking her permission she will allow you to treat her as such if you belong to her said the man in black there is a chapel in rome where there is a wondrously fair statuethe son of a cardinali mean his nephewonce well she did not cut off his head but slightly boxed his cheek and bade him go i have read all about that in keyslers travels said i do you tell her that i would not touch her with a pair of tongs unless to seize her nose she is fond of lucre said the man in black but does not grudge a faithful priest a little private perquisite and he took out a very handsome gold repeater are you not afraid said i to flash that watch before the eyes of a poor tinker in a dingle not before the eyes of one like you said the man in black it is getting late said i i care not for perquisites so you will not join us said the man in black you have had my answer said i if i belong to rome said the man in black why should not you i may be a poor tinker said i but i may never have undergone what you have you remember perhaps the fable of the fox who had lost his tail the man in black winced but almost immediately recovering himself he said well we can do without you we are sureof winning it is not the part of wise people said i to make sure of the battle before it is fought theres the landlord of the publichouse who made sure that his cocks would win yet the cocks lost the main and the landlord is little better than a bankrupt people very different from the landlord said the man in black both in intellect and station think we shall surely win there are clever machinators among us who have no doubt of our success well said i i will set the landlord aside and will adduce one who was in every point a very different person from the landlord both in understanding and station he was very fond of laying schemes and indeed many of them turned out successful his last and darling one however miscarried notwithstanding that by his calculations he had persuaded himself that there was no possibility of its failingthe person that i allude to was old fraser who said the man in black giving a start and letting his glass fall old fraser of lovat said i the prince of all conspirators and machinators he made sure of placing the pretender on the throne of these realms i can bring into the field so many men said he my soninlaw cluny so many and likewise my cousin and my good friend then speaking of those on whom the government reckoned for support he would say soandso is lukewarm this person is ruled by his wife who is with us the clergy are anything but hostile to us and as for the soldiers and sailors half are disaffected to king george and the rest cowards yet when things came to a trial this person whom he had calculated upon to join the pretender did not stir from his home another joined the hostile ranks the presumed cowards turned out heroes and those whom he thought heroes ran away like lusty fellows at culloden in a word he found himself utterly mistaken and in nothing more than himself he thought he was a hero and proved himself nothing more than an old fox he got up a hollow tree didnt he just like a fox l opere sue non furon leonine ma di volpe the man in black sat silent for a considerable time and at length answered in rather a faltering voice i was not prepared for this you have frequently surprised me by your knowledge of things which i should never have expected any person of your appearance to be acquainted with but that you should be aware of my name is a circumstance utterly incomprehensible to me i had imagined that no person in england was acquainted with it indeed i dont see how any person should be i have revealed it to no one not being particularly proud of it yes i acknowledge that my name is fraser and that i am of the blood of that family or clan of which the rector of our college once said that he was firmly of opinion that every individual member was either rogue or fool i was born at madrid of pure oimè fraser blood my parents at an early age took me to rome where they shortly died not however before they had placed me in the service of a cardinal with whom i continued some years and who when he had no further occasion for me sent me to the college in the lefthand cloister of which as you enter rest the bones of sir john dereham there in studying logic and humane letters i lost whatever of humanity i had retained when discarded by the cardinal let me not however forget two pointsi am a fraser it is true but not a flannagan i may bear the vilest name of britain but not of ireland i was bred up at the english house and there is at rome a house for the education of bogtrotters i was not bred up at that beneath the lowest gulf there is one yet lower whatever my blood may be it is at least not irish whatever my education may have been i was not bred at the irish seminaryon those accounts i am thankfulyes per dio i am thankful after some years at collegebut why should i tell you my history you know it already perfectly well probably much better than myself i am now a missionary priest labouring in heretic england like parsons and garnet of old save and except that unlike them i run no danger for the times are changed as i told you before i shall cleave to romei must no hay remedio as they say at madrid and i will do my best to further her holy planshe hebut i confess i begin to doubt of their being successful hereyou put me out old fraser of lovat i have heard my father talk of him he had a goldheaded cane with which he once knocked my grandfather downhe was an astute one but as you say mistaken particularly in himself i have read his life by arbuthnot a it is in the library of our college farewell i shall come no more to this dingleto come would be of no utility i shall go and labour elsewhere though how you came to know my name is a fact quite inexplicablefarewell to you both he then arose and without further salutation departed from the dingle in which i never saw him again b how in the name of wonder came you to know that mans name said belle after he had been gone some time i belle i knew nothing of the fellows name i assure you but you mentioned his name if i did it was merely casually by way of illustration i was saying how frequently cunning people were mistaken in their calculations and i adduced the case of old fraser of lovat as one in point i brought forward his name because i was wellacquainted with his history from having compiled and inserted it in a wonderful work which i edited some monthsago entitled newgate lives and trials but without the slightest idea that it was the name of him who was sitting with us he however thought that i was aware of his name belle belle for a long time i doubted the truth of scripture owing to certain conceited individuals but now i begin to believe firmly what wonderful texts are in scripture belle the wicked trembleth wherewhere they were afraid where no fear was thou hast put them to confusion because god hath despised them said belle i have frequently read it before the clergyman in the great house of long melford but if you did not know the mans name why let him go away supposing that you did oh if he was fool enough to make such a mistake i was not going to undeceive himno no let the enemies of old england make the most of all their blunders and mistakes they will have no help from me but enough of the fellow belle let us now have tea and after that no armenian said belle but i want to ask a question pray are all people of that mans name either rogues or fools it is impossible for me to say belle this person being the only one of the name i have ever personally known i suppose there are good and bad clever and foolish amongst them as amongst all large bodies of people however after the tribe had been governed for upwards of thirty years by such a person as old fraser it were no wonder if the greater part had become either rogues or fools he was a ruthless tyrant belle over his own people and by his cruelty and rapaciousness must either have stunned them into an apathy approaching to idiocy or made them artful knaves in their own defence the qualities of parents are generally transmitted to their descendantsthe progeny of trained pointers are almost sure to point even without being taught if therefore all frasers are either rogues or fools as this person seems to insinuate it is little to be wondered at their parents or grandparents having been in the trainingschool of old fraser but enough of the old tyrant and his slaves belle prepare tea this moment or dread my anger i have not a goldheaded cane like old fraser of lovat but i have what some people would dread much more an armenian runestick chapter xxifresh arrivalspitching the tent certificated wifehighflying notions on the following morning as i was about to leave my tent i heard the voice of belle at the door exclaiming sleepest thou or wakest thou i was never more awake in my life said i going out what is the matter he of the horseshoe said she jasper of whom i have heard you talk is above there on the field with all his people i went about a quarter of an hour ago to fill the kettle at the spring and saw them arriving it is well said i have you any objection to asking him and his wife to breakfast you can do as you please said she i have cups enough and have no objection to their company we are the first occupiers of the ground said i and being so should consider ourselves in the light of hosts and do our best to practise the duties of hospitality how fond you are of using that word said belle if you wish to invite the man and his wife do so without more ado remember however that i have not cups enough nor indeed tea enough for the whole company thereupon hurrying up the ascent i presently found myself outside the dingle it was as usual a brilliant morning the dewy blades of the ryegrass which covered the plain sparkled brightly in the beams of the sun which had probably been about two hours above the horizon a rather numerous body of my ancient friends and allies occupied the ground in the vicinity of the mouth of the dingle about five yards on the right i perceived mr petulengro busily employed in erecting his tent he held in his hand an iron bar sharp at the bottom with a kind of arm projecting from the top for the purpose of supporting a kettle or cauldron over the fire and which is called in the romanian language kekauviskoe saster with the sharp end of this mr petulengro was making holes in the earth at about twenty inches distance from each other into which he inserted certain long rods with a considerable bend towards the top which constituted no less than the timbers of the tent and the supporters of the canvas mrs petulengro and a female with a crutch in her hand whom i recognised as mrs chikno sat near him on the ground whilst two or three children from six to ten years old who composed the young family of mr and mrs petulengro were playing about here we are brother said mr petulengro as he drove the sharp end of the bar into the ground here we are and plenty of usbute dosta romany chals i am glad to see you all said i and particularly you madam said i making a bow to mrs petulengro and you also madam taking off my hat to mrs chikno good day to you sir said mrs petulengro you look as usual charmingly and speak so too you have not forgot your manners it is not all gold that glitters said mrs chikno however goodmorrow to you young rye i do not see tawno said i looking around where is he where indeed said mrs chikno i dont know he who countenances him in the roving line can best answer he will be here anon said mr petulengro he has merely ridden down a byroad to show a farmer a twoyearold colt she heard me give him directions but she cant be satisfied i cant indeed said mrs chikno and why not sister because i place no confidence in your words brother as i said before you countenances him well said i i know nothing of your private concerns i am come on an errand isopel berners down in the dell there requests the pleasure of mr and mrs petulengros company at breakfast she will be happy also to see you madam said i addressing mrs chikno is that young female your wife young man said mrs chikno my wife said i yes young man your wife your lawful certificated wife no said i she is not my wife then i will not visit with her said mrs chikno i countenance nothing in the roving line what do you mean by the roving line i demanded what do i mean by the roving line why by it i mean such conduct as is no ttatcheno a when ryes and rawniesb lives together in dingles without being certificated i calls such behaviour being tolerably deep in the roving line everything savouring of which i am determined not to sanctify i have suffered too much by my own certificated husbands outbreaks in that line to afford anything of the kind the slightest shadow of countenance it is hard that people may not live in dingles together without being suspected of doing wrong said i so it is said mrs petulengro interposing and to tell you the truth i am altogether surprised at the illiberality of my sisters remarks i have often heard say that is in good companyand i have kept good company in my timethat suspicion is kings evidence of a narrow and uncultivated mind on which account i am suspicious of nobody not even of my own husband whom some people would think i have a right to be suspicious of seeing that on his account i once refused a lord but ask him whether i am suspicious of him and whether i seek to keep him close tied to my apronstring he will tell you nothing of the kind but that on the contrary i always allows him an agreeable latitude permitting him to go where he pleases and to converse with any one to whose manner of speaking he may take a fancy but i have had the advantage of keeping good company and therefore meklis c said mrs chikno pray drop all that sister i believe i have kept as good company as yourself and with respect to that offer with which you frequently fatigue those who keeps company with you i believe after all it was something in the roving and uncertificated line in whatever line it was said mrs petulengro the offer was a good one the young dukefor he was not only a lord but a duke toooffered to keep me a fine carriage and to make me his second wife for it is true that he had another who was old and stout though mighty rich and highly goodnatured so much so indeed that the young lord assured me that she would have no manner of objection to the arrangement more especially if i would consent to live in the same house with her being fond of young and cheerful society so you see yes yes said mrs chikno i see what i before thought that it was altogether in the uncertificated line meklis said mrs petulengro i use your own word madam which is romany for my own part i am not fond of using romany words unless i can hope to pass them off for french which i cannot in the present company i heartily wish that there was no such language and do my best to keep it away from my children lest the frequent use of it should altogether confirm them in low and vulgar habits i have four children madam but i suppose by talking of your four children you wish to check me for having none said mrs chikno bursting into tears if i have no children sister it is no fault of mine it isbut why do i call you sister said she angrily you are no sister of mine you are a grasni a regular marea pretty sister indeed ashamed of your own language i remember well that by your highflying notions you drove your own mother we will drop it said mrs petulengro i do not wish to raise my voice and to make myself ridiculous young gentleman said she pray present my compliments to miss isopel berners and inform her that i am very sorry that i cannot accept her polite invitation i am just arrived and have some slight domestic matters to see to amongst others to wash my childrens faces but that in the course of the forenoon when i have attended to what i have to do and have dressed myself i hope to do myself the honour of paying her a regular visit you will tell her that with my compliments with respect to my husband he can answer for himself as i not being of a jealous disposition never interferes with his matters and tell miss berners said mr petulengro that i shall be happy to wait upon her in company with my wife as soon as we are regularly settled at present i have much on my hands having not only to pitch my own tent but this here jealous womans whose husband is absent on my business thereupon i returned to the dingle and without saying anything about mrs chiknos observations communicated to isopel the messages of mr and mrs petulengro isopel made no other reply than by replacing in her coffer two additional cups and saucers which in expectation of company she had placed upon the board the kettle was by this time boiling we sat down and as we breakfasted i gave isopel berners another lesson in the armenian languagechapter xxiithe promised visitroman fashionwizard and witchcatching at wordsthe two femalesdressing of hairthe new roadsbelles altered appearance herself again about midday mr and mrs petulengro came to the dingle to pay the promised visit belle at the time of their arrival was in her tent but i was at the fireplace engaged in hammering part of the outertire or defence which had come off from one of the wheels of my vehicle on perceiving them i forthwith went to receive them mr petulengro was dressed in roman fashion with a somewhat smartlycut sportingcoat the buttons of which were halfcrownsand a waistcoat scarlet and black the buttons of which were spaded halfguineas his breeches were of a stuff half velveteen half corduroy the cords exceedingly broad he had leggings of buff cloth furred at the bottom and upon his feet were highlows under his left arm was a long black whalebone ridingwhip with a red lash and an immense silver knob upon his head was a hat with a high peak somewhat of the kind which the spaniards call calané so much in favour with the bravos of seville and madrid now when i have added that mr petulengro had on a very fine white holland shirt i think i have described his array mrs petulengroi beg pardon for not having spoken of her firstwas also arrayed very much in the roman fashion her hair which was exceedingly black and lustrous fell in braids on either side of her head in her ears were rings with long drops of gold round her neck was a string of what seemed very much like very large pearls somewhat tarnished however and apparently of considerable antiquity here we are brother said mr petulengro here we are come to see youwizard and witch witch and wizard theres a chovahanee and a chovahano a the nav se len is petulengro hold your tongue sir said mrs petulengro you make me ashamed of you with your vulgar ditties we are come avisiting now and everything low should be left behind true said mr petulengro why bring whats low to the dingle which is low enough already what are you a catcher at words said i i thought that catching at words had been confined to the pothouse farmers and village witty bodies all fools said mrs petulengro catch at words and very naturally as by so doing they hope to prevent the possibility of rational conversation catching at words confined to pothouse farmers and village witty bodies no nor to jasper petulengro listen for an hour or two to the discourse of a set they call newspaper editors and if you dont go out and eat grass as a dog does when he is sick i am no female woman the young lord whose hand i refused when i took up with wise jasper once brought two of them to my mothers tan b when hankering after my company they did nothing but carp at each others words and a pretty hand they made of it illfavoured dogs they were and their attempt at what they called wit almost as unfortunate as their countenances well said i madam we will drop all catchings and carpings for the present pray take your seat on this stool whilst i go and announce to miss isopel berners your arrival thereupon i went to belles habitation and informed her that mr and mrs petulengro had paid us a visit of ceremony and were awaiting her at the fireplace pray go and tell them that i am busy said belle who was engaged with her needle i do not feel disposed to take part in any such nonsense i shall do no such thing said i and i insist upon your coming forthwith and showing proper courtesy to your visitors if you do not their feelings will be hurt and you are aware that i cannot bear that peoples feelings should be outraged come this moment or or what said belle half smiling i was about to say something in armenian said i well said belle laying down her work i will come stay said i your hair is hanging about your ears and your dress is in disorder you had better stay a minute or two to prepare yourself to appear before your visitors who have come in their very best attire no said belle i will make no alteration in my appearance you told me to come this moment and you shall be obeyed so belle and i advanced towards our guests as we drew nigh mr petulengro took off his hat and made a profound obeisance to belle whilst mrs petulengro rose from the stool and made a profound curtsey belle who had flung her hair back over her shoulders returned their salutations by bending her head and after slightly glancing at mr petulengro fixed her large blue eyes full upon his wife both these females were very handsomebut how unlike belle fair with blue eyes and flaxen hair mrs petulengro with olive complexion eyes black and hair darkas dark as could be belle in demeanour calm and proud the gypsy graceful but full of movement and agitation and then how different were those two in stature the head of the romany rawnie scarcely ascended to the breast of isopel berners i could see that mrs petulengro gazed on belle with unmixed admiration so did her husband well said the latter one thing i will say which is that there is only one on earth worthy to stand up in front of this she and that is the beauty of theworld as far as man flesh is concerned tawno chikno what a pity he did not come down tawno chikno said mrs petulengro flaring up a pretty fellow he to stand up in front of this gentlewoman a pity he didnt come quotha not at all the fellow is a sneak afraid of his wife he stand up against this rawnie why the look she has given me would knock the fellow down it is easier to knock him down with a look than with a fist said mr petulengro that is if the look comes from a woman not that i am disposed to doubt that this female gentlewoman is able to knock him down either one way or the other i have heard of her often enough and have seen her once or twice though not so near as now well maam my wife and i are come to pay our respects to you we are both glad to find that you have left off keeping company with flaming bosville and have taken up with my pal he is not very handsome but a better i take up with your pal as you call him you had better mind what you say said isopel berners i take up with nobody i merely mean taking up your quarters with him said mr petulengro and i was only about to say a better fellowlodger you cannot have or a more instructive especially if you have a desire to be inoculated with tongues as he calls them i wonder whether you and he have had any tonguework already have you and your wife anything particular to say if you have nothing but this kind of conversation i must leave you as i am going to make a journey this afternoon and should be getting ready you must excuse my husband madam said mrs petulengro he is not overburdened with understanding and has said but one word of sense since he has been here which was that we came to pay our respects to you we have dressed ourselves in our best roman way in order to do honour to you perhaps you do not like it if so i am sorry i have no french clothes madam if i had any madam i would have come in them in order to do you more honour i like to see you much better as you are said belle people should keep to their own fashions and yours is very pretty i am glad you are pleased to think it so madam it has been admired in the great city it created what they call a sensation and some of the great ladies the court ladies imitated it else i should not appear in it so often as i am accustomed for i am not very fond of what is roman having an imagination that what is roman is ungenteel in fact i once heard the wife of a rich citizen say that gypsies were vulgar creatures i should have taken her saying very much to heart but for her improper pronunciation she could not pronounce her words madam which we gypsies as they call us usually can so i thought she was no very high purchase you are very beautiful madam though you are not dressed as i could wish to see you and your hair is hanging down in sad confusion allow me to assist you in arranging your hair madam i will dress it for you in our fashion i would fain see how your hair would look in our poor gypsy fashion pray allow me madam and she took belle by the hand i really can do no such thing said belle withdrawing her hand i thank you for coming to see me but do allow me to officiate upon your hair madam said mrs petulengro i should esteem your allowing me a great mark of condescension you are very beautiful madam and i think you doubly so because you are so fair i have a great esteem for persons with fair complexions and hair i have a less regard for people with dark hair and complexions madam then why did you turn off the lord and take up with me said mr petulengro that same lord was fair enough all about him people do when they are young and silly what they sometimes repent of when they are of riper years and understandings i sometimes think that had i not been something of a simpleton i might at this time be a great court lady now madam said she again taking belle by the hand do oblige me by allowing me to plait your hair a little i have really a good mind to be angry with you said belle giving mrs petulengro a peculiar glance do allow her to arrange your hair said i she means no harm and wishes to do you honour do oblige her and me too for i should like to see how your hair would look dressed in her fashion you hear what the young rye says said mrs petulengro i am sure you will oblige the young rye if not myself many people would be willing to oblige the young rye if he would but ask them but he is not in the habit of asking favours he has a nose of his own which he keeps tolerably exalted he does not think smallbeer of himself madam and all the time i have been with him i never heard him ask a favour before therefore madam i am sure you will oblige him my sister ursula would be very willing to oblige him in many things but he will not ask for anything except for such a favour as a word which is a poor favour after all i dont mean for her word perhaps he will some day ask you for your word if so why here you are after railing at me for catching at words catching at a word yourself said mr petulengro hold your tongue sir said mrs petulengro dont interrupt me in my discourse if i caught at a word now i am not in the habit of doing so i am no conceited body no newspaper neddy no pothouse witty person i was about to say madam that if the young rye asks you at any time for your word you will do as you deem convenient but i am sure you will oblige him by allowing me to braid your hair i shall not do it to oblige him said belle the young rye as you call him is nothing to me well then to oblige me said mrs petulengro do allow me to become your poor tirewoman it is great nonsense said belle reddening however as you came to see me and ask the matter as a particular favour to yourself thank you madam said mrs petulengro leading belle to the stool please to sit down here thank you your hair is very beautiful madam she continued as she proceeded to braid belles hair so is your countenance should you ever go to the great city among the grand folks you would make a sensation madam i have made one myself who am dark the chi she is kauley which last word signifies black which i am not though rather dark theres no colour like white madam its so lasting so genteel gentility will carry the day madam even with the young rye he will ask words of the black lass but beg the word of the fair in the meantime mr petulengro and myself entered into conversation any news stirring mr petulengro said i have you heard anything of the great religious movements plenty said mr petulengro all the religious people more especially the evangelicalsthose that go about distributing tractsare very angry about the fight between gentleman cooper and whiteheaded bob which they say ought not to have been permitted to take place and then they are trying all they can to prevent the fight between the lion and the dogs which they say is a disgrace to a christian country now i cant say that i have any quarrel with the religious party and the evangelicals they are always civil to me and mine and frequently give us tracts as they call them which neither i nor mine can read but i cannot say that i approve of any movements religious or not which have in aim to put down all life and manly sport in this here country anything else said i people are becoming vastly sharp said mr petulengro and i am told that all the oldfashioned goodtempered constables are going to be set aside and a paid body of men to be established who are not to permit a tramper or vagabond on the roads of englandand talking of roads puts me in mind of a strange story i heard two nights ago whilst drinking some beer at a publichouse in company with my cousin sylvester i had asked tawno to go but his wife would not let him just opposite me smoking their pipes were a couple of men something like engineers and they were talking of a wonderful invention which was to make a wonderful alteration in england inasmuch as it would set aside all the old roads which in a little time would be ploughed up and sowed with corn and cause all england to be laid down with iron roads on which people would go thundering along in vehicles pushed forward by fire and smoke now brother when i heard this i did not feel very comfortable for i thought to myself what a queer place such a road would be to pitch ones tent upon and how impossible it would be for ones cattle to find a bite of grass upon it and i thought likewise of the danger to which ones family would be exposed of being run over and severely scorched by these same flying fiery vehicles so i made bold to say that i hoped such an invention would never be countenanced because it was likely to do a great deal of harm whereupon one of the men giving me a glance said without taking the pipe out of his mouth that for his part he sincerely hoped that it would take effect and if it did no other good than stopping the rambles of gypsies and other like scamps it ought to be encouraged well brother feeling myself insulted i put my hand into my pocket in order to pull out money intending to challenge him to fight for a fiveshilling stake but merely found sixpence having left all my other money at the tent which sixpence was just sufficient to pay for the beer which sylvester and myself were drinking of whom i couldnt hope to borrow anythingpoor as sylvester being a byword amongst us so not being able to back myself i held my peace and let the gorgio have it all his own way who after turning up his nose at me went on discoursing about the said invention saying what a fund of profit it would be to those who knew how to make use of it and should have the laying down of the new roads and the shoeing of england with iron and after he had said this and much more of the same kind which i cannot remember he and his companion got up and walked away and presently i and sylvester got up and walked to our camp and there i lay down in my tent by the side of my wife where i had an ugly dream of having camped upon an iron road my tent being overturned by a flying vehicle my wifes leg injured and all my affairs put into great confusion now madam said mrs petulengro i have braided your hair in our fashion you look very beautiful madam more beautiful if possible than before belle now rose and came forward with her tirewoman mr petulengro was loud in his applause but i said nothing for i did not think belle was improved in appearance by having submitted to the ministry ofmrs petulengros hand nature never intended belle to appear as a gypsy she had made her too proud and serious a more proper part for her was that of a heroine a queenly heroinethat of theresa of hungary for example or better still that of brynhilda the valkyrie the beloved of sigurd the serpentkiller who incurred the curse of odin because in the tumult of spears she sided with the young king and doomed the old warrior to die to whom odin had promised victory belle looked at me for a moment in silence then turning to mrs petulengro she said you have had your will with me are you satisfied quite so madam said mrs petulengro and i hope you will be so too as soon as you have looked in the glass i have looked in one already said belle and the glass does not flatter you mean the face of the young rye said mrs petulengro never mind him madam the young rye though he knows a thing or two is not a university nor a person of universal wisdom i assure you that you never looked so well before and i hope that from this moment you will wear your hair in this way and who is to braid it in this way said belle smiling i madam said mrs petulengro i will braid it for you every morning if you will but be persuaded to join us do so madam and i think if you did the young rye would do so too the young rye is nothing to me nor i to him said belle we have stayed some time together but our paths will soon be apart now farewell for i am about to take a journey and you will go out with your hair as i have braided it said mrs petulengro if you do everybody will be in love with you no said belle hitherto i have allowed you to do what you please but henceforth i shall have my own way come come said she observing that the gypsy was about to speak we have had enough of nonsense whenever i leave this hollow it will be wearing my hair in my own fashion come wife said mr petulengro we will no longer intrude upon the rye and rawnie there is such a thing as being troublesome thereupon mr petulengro and his wife took their leave with many salutations then you are going said i when belle and i were left alone yes said belle i am going on a journey my affairs compel me but you will return again said i yes said belle i shall return once more once more said i what do you mean by once more the petulengros will soon be gone and will you abandon me in this place you were alone here said belle before i came and i suppose found it agreeable or you would not have stayed in it yes said i that was before i knew you but having lived with you here i should be very loth to live here without you indeed said belle i did not know that i was of so much consequence to you well the day is wearing awayi must go and harness traveller to the cart i will do that said i or anything else you may wish me go and prepare yourself i will see after traveller and the cart belle departed to her tent and i set about performing the task i had undertaken in about halfanhour belle again made her appearanceshe was dressed neatly and plainly her hair was no longer in the roman fashion in which pakomovna had plaited it but was secured by a comb she held a bonnet in her hand is there anything else i can do for you i demanded there are two or three bundles by my tent which you can put into the cart said belle i put the bundles into the cart and then led traveller and the cart up the winding path to the mouth of the dingle near which was mr petulengros encampment belle followed at the top i delivered the reins into her hands we looked at each other steadfastly for some time belle then departed and i returned to the dingle where seating myself on my stone i remained for upwards of an hour in thoughtchapter xxiiithe festivalthe gypsy songpiramus of romethe scotchmangypsy names on the following day there was much feasting amongst the romany chals of mr petulengros party throughout the forenoon the romany chies did scarcely anything but cook flesh and the flesh which they cooked was swines flesh about two oclock the chals and chies dividing themselves into various parties sat down and partook of the fare which was partly roasted partly sodden i dined that day with mr petulengro and his wife and family ursula mr and mrs chikno and sylvester and his two children sylvester it will be as well to say was a widower and had consequently no one to cook his victuals for him supposing he had any which was not always the case sylvesters affairs being seldom in a prosperous state he was noted for his bad success in trafficking notwithstanding the many hints which he received from jasper under whose protection he had placed himself even as tawno chikno had done who himself as the reader has heard on a former occasion was anything but a wealthy subject though he was at all times better off than sylvester the lazarus of the romany tribe all our party ate with a good appetite except myself who feeling rather melancholy that day had little desire to eat i did not like the others partake of the pork but got my dinner entirely off the body of a squirrel which had been shot the day before by a chal of the name of piramus who besides being a good shot was celebrated for his skill in playing on the fiddle during the dinner a horn filled with ale passed frequently around i drank of it more than once and felt inspirited by the draughts the repast concluded sylvester and his children departed to their tent and mr petulengro tawno and myself getting up went and lay down under a shady hedge where mr petulengro lighting his pipe began to smoke and where tawno presently fell asleep i was about to fall asleep also when i heard the sound of music and song piramus was playing on the fiddle whilst mrs chikno who had a voice of her own was singing in tones sharp enough but of great power a gypsy song poisoning the porker by mrs chikno to mande shoon ye romany chals who besh in the pus about the yag

and i will tell how we poison the porker i will tell how we poison the porker we go to the house of the poison monger ie the apothecary where we buy three pennies worth of bane and when we return to our people we say we will poison the porker we will try and poison the porker we then make up the poison and then we take our way to the house of the farmer as if to beg a bit of victuals a little broken victuals we see a jolly porker and then we say in roman language fling the bane yonder amongst the dirt and the porker soon will find it the porker soon will find it early on the morrow we will return to the farmhouse and beg the dead porker the body of the dead porker and so we do even so we do the porker dieth during the night on the morrow we beg the porker and carry to the tent the porker and then we wash the inside well till all the inside is perfectly clean till theres no bane within it not a poison grain within it and then we roast the body well send for ale to the alehouse and have a merry banquet a merry roman banquet the fellow with the fiddle plays he plays the little lassie sings she sings an ancient roman ditty now hear the roman ditty song of the broken chastity

gorgikie rat to be cambri theres some kernel in those songs brother said mr petulengro when the songs and music were over yes said i they are certainly very remarkable songs i say jasper i hope you have not been drabbing baulor lately and suppose we have brother what then why it is a very dangerous practice to say nothing of the wickedness of itnecessity has no law brother that is true said i i have always said so but you are not necessitous and should not drab baulor and who told you we had been drabbing baulor why you have had a banquet of pork and after the banquet mrs chikno sang a song about drabbing baulor so i naturally thought you might have lately been engaged in such a thing brother you occasionally utter a word or two of common sense it was natural for you to suppose after seeing that dinner of pork and hearing that song that we had been drabbing baulor i will now tell you that we have not been doing so what have you to say to that that i am very glad of it had you tasted that pork brother you would have found that it was sweet and tasty which balluva that is drabbed can hardly be expected to be we have no reason to drab baulor at present we have money and credit but necessity has no law our forefathers occasionally drabbed baulor some of our people may still do such a thing but only from compulsion i see said i and at your merry meetings you sing songs upon the compulsatory deeds of your people alias their villainous actions and after all what would the stirring poetry of any nation be but for its compulsatory deeds look at the poetry of scotland the heroic part founded almost entirely on the villainous deeds of the scotch nation cowstealing for example which is very little better than drabbing baulor whilst the softer part is mostly about the slips of its females among the broom so that no upholder of scotch poetry could censure ursulas song as indelicate even if he understood it what do you think jasper i think brother as i before said that occasionally you utter a word of common sense you were talking of the scotch brother what do you think of a scotchman finding fault with romany a scotchman finding fault with romany jasper oh dear but you joke the thing could never be yes and at piramuss fiddle what do you think of a scotchman turning up his nose at piramuss fiddle a scotchman turning up his nose at piramuss fiddle nonsense jasper do you know what i most dislike brother i do not unless it be the constable jasper it is not the constable its a beggar on horseback brother what do you mean by a beggar on horseback why a scamp brother raised above his proper place who takes every opportunity of giving himself fine airs about a week ago my people and myself camped on a green by a plantation in the neighbourhood of a great house in the evening we were making merry the girls were dancing while piramus was playing on the fiddle a tune of his own composing to which he has given his own name piramus of rome and which is much celebrated amongst our people and from which i have been told that one of the grand gorgio composers who once heard it has taken several hints so as we were making merry a great many grand people lords and ladies i believe came from the great house and looked on as the girls danced to the tune of piramus of rome and seemed much pleased and when the girls had left off dancing and piramus playing the ladies wanted to have their fortunes told so i bade mikailia chikno who can tell a fortune when she pleases better than any one else tell them a fortune and she being in a good mind told them a fortune which pleased them very much so after they had heard their fortunes one of them asked if any of our women could sing and i told them several could more particularly leviathanyou know leviathan she is not here now but some miles distant she is our best singer ursula coming next so the lady said she should like to hear leviathan sing whereupon leviathan sang the gudlo pesham a and piramus played the tune of the same name which as you know means the honeycomb the song and the tune being well entitled to the name being wonderfully sweet well everybody present seemed mighty well pleased with the song and music with the exception of one person a carrotyhaired scotch body how he came there i dont know but there he was and coming forward he began in scotch as broad as a barndoor to find fault with the music and the song saying that he had never heard viler stuff than either well brother out of consideration for the civil gentry with whom the fellow had come i held my peace for a long time and in order to get the subject changed i said to mikailia in romany you have told the ladies their fortunes now tell the gentlemen theirs quick quickpen lende dukkerin b well brother the scotchman i suppose thinking i wasspeaking ill of him fell into a greater passion than before and catching hold of the word dukkerindukkerin said he whats dukkerin dukkerin said i is fortune a man or womans destiny dont you like the word word dye ca that a word a bonnie word said he perhaps youll tell us what it is in scotch said i in order that we may improve our language by a scotch word a pal of mine has told me that we have taken a great many words from foreign lingos why then if that be the case fellow i will tell you it is een spaeing said he very seriously well then said i ill keep my own word which is much the prettiestspaeing spaeing why i should be ashamed to make use of the word it sounds so much like a certain other word and then i made a face as if i were unwell perhaps its scotch also for that what do you mean by speaking in that guise to a gentleman said he you insolent vagabond without a name or a country there you are mistaken said i my country is egypt but we gyptians like you scotch are rather fond of travelling and as for namemy name is jasper petulengro perhaps you have a better what is it sandy macraw at that brother the gentlemen burst into a roar of laughter and all the ladies tittered you were rather severe on the scotchman jasper not at all brother and suppose i were he began first i am the civilest man in the world and never interfere with anybody who lets me and mine alone he finds fault with romany forsooth why ld amighty whats scotch he doesnt like our songs what are his own i understand them as little as he mine i have heard one or two of them and pretty rubbish they seemed but the best of the joke is the fellows finding fault with piramuss fiddlea chap from the land of bagpipes finding fault with piramuss fiddle why ill back that fiddle against all the bagpipes in scotland and piramus against all the bagpipers for though piramus weighs but ten stone he shall flog a scotchman of twenty scotchmen are never so fat as that said i unless indeed they have been a long time pensioners of england i say jasper what remarkable names your people have and what pretty names brother theres my own for example jasper then theres ambrose and sylvester then theres culvato which signifies claude then theres piramus thats a nice name brother then theres your wifes name pakomovna then theres ursula and morella then brother theres ercilla ercilla the name of the great poet of spain how wonderful then leviathan the name of a ship brother leviathan was named after a ship so dont make a wonder out of her but theres sanpriel and synfye ay and clementina and lavinia camillia and lydia curlanda and orlanda wherever did they get those names where did my wife get her necklace brother she knows best jasper i hope come no hoping she got it from her grandmother who died at the age of a hundred and three and sleeps in coggeshall churchyard she got it from her mother who also died very old and could give no other account of it than that it had been in the family time out of mind whence could they have got it why perhaps where they got their names brother a gentleman who had travelled much once told me that he had seen the sister of it about the neck of an indian queen some of your names jasper appear to be church names your own for example and ambrose and sylvester perhaps you got them from the papists in the times of popery but where did you get such a name as piramus a name of grecian romance then some of them appear to be slavonian for example mikailia and pakomovna i dont know much of slavonian but what is slavonian brother the family name of certain nations the principal of which is the russian and from which the word slave is originally derived you have heard of the russians jasper yes brother and seen some i saw their crallis at the time of the peace he was not a badlooking man for a russian bythebye jasper im half inclined to think that crallis is a slavish word i saw something like it in a lil called voltaires life of charles xii how you should have come by such names and words is to me incomprehensibleyou seem posed brother i really know very little about you jasper very little indeed brother we know very little about ourselves and you know nothing save what we have told you and we have now and then told you things about us which are not exactly true simply to make a fool of you brother you will say that was wrong perhaps it was well sunday will be here in a day or two when we will go to church where possibly we shall hear a sermon on the disastrous consequences of lyingchapter xxivthe churchthe aristocratical pewdays of yorethe clergymanin what would a man be profited when two days had passed sunday came i breakfasted by myself in the solitary dingle and then having set things a little to rights i ascended to mr petulengros encampment i could hear churchbells ringing around in the distance appearing to say come to church come to church as clearly as it was possible for churchbells to say i found mr petulengro seated by the door of his tent smoking his pipe in rather an ungenteel undress well jasper said i are you ready to go to church for if you are i am ready to accompany you i am not ready brother said mr petulengro nor is my wife the church too to which we shall go is three miles off so it is of no use to think of going there this morning as the service would be threequarters over before we got there if however you are disposed to go in the afternoon we are your people thereupon i returned to my dingle where i passed several hours in conning the welsh bible which the preacher peter williams had given me at last i gave over reading took a slight refreshment and was about to emerge from the dingle when i heard the voice of mr petulengro calling me i went up again to the encampment where i found mr petulengro his wife and tawno chikno ready to proceed to church mr and mrs petulengro were dressed in roman fashion though not in the fullblown manner in which they had paid their visit to isopel and myself tawno had on a clean white slop with a nearly new black beaver with very broad rims and the nap exceedingly long as for myself i was dressed in much the same manner as that in which i departed from london having on in honour of the day a shirt perfectly clean having washed one on purpose for the occasion with my own hands the day before in the pond of tepid water in which the newts and efts were in the habit of taking their pleasure we proceeded for upwards of a mile by footpaths through meadows and cornfields we crossed various stiles at last passing over one we found ourselves in a road wending along which for a considerable distance we at last came in sight of a church the bells of which had been tolling distinctly in our ears for some time before however we reached the churchyard the bells had ceased their melody it was surrounded by lofty beechtrees of brilliant green foliage we entered the gate mrs petulengro leading the way and proceeded to a small door near the east end of the church as we advanced the sound of singing within the church rose upon our ears arrived at the small door mrs petulengro opened it and entered followed by tawno chikno i myself went last of all following mr petulengro who before i entered turned round and with a significant nod advised me to take care how i behaved the part of the church which we had entered was the chancel on one side stood a number of venerable old menprobably the neighbouring poorand on the other a number of poor girls belonging to the village school dressed in white gowns and straw bonnets whom two elegant but simply dressed young women were superintending every voice seemed to be united in singing a certain anthem which notwithstanding it was written neither by tate nor brady contains some of the sublimest words which were ever put together not the worst of which are those which burst on our ears as we entered every eye shall now behold him robed in dreadful majesty those who set at nought and sold him pierced and nailed him to the tree deeply wailing shall the true messiah see still following mrs petulengro we proceeded down the chancel and along the aisle notwithstanding the singing i could distinctly hear as we passed many a voice whispering here come the gypsies here come the gypsies i felt rather embarrassed with a somewhat awkward doubt as to where we were to sit none of the occupiers of the pews who appeared to consist almost entirely of farmers with their wives sons and daughters opened a door to admit us mrs petulengro however appeared to feel not the least embarrassment but tripped along the aisle with the greatest nonchalance we passed under the pulpit in which stood the clergyman in his white surplice and reached the middle of the church where we were confronted by the sexton dressed in a long blue coat and holding in his hand a wand this functionary motioned towards the lower end of the church where were certain benches partly occupied by poor people and boys mrs petulengro however with a toss of her head directed her course to a magnificent pew which was unoccupied which she opened and entered followed closely by tawno chikno mr petulengro and myself the sexton did not appear by any means to approve of the arrangement and as i stood next the door laid his finger on my arm as if to intimate that myself and companions must quit our aristocratical location i said nothing but directed my eyes to the clergyman who uttered a short and expressive cough the sexton looked at him for a moment and then bowing his head closed the doorin a moment more the music ceased i took up a prayerbook on which was engraved an earls coronet the clergyman uttered i will arise and go to my father englands sublime liturgy had commenced oh what feelings came over me on finding myself again in an edifice devoted to the religion of my country i had not been in such a place i cannot tell how longcertainly not for years and now i had found my way there again it appearedas if i had fallen asleep in the pew of the old church of pretty dereham i had occasionally done so when a child and had suddenly woke up yes surely i had been asleep and had woken up but no alas no i had not been asleepat least not in the old churchif i had been asleep i had been walking in my sleep struggling striving learning and unlearning in my sleep years had rolled away whilst i had been asleepripe fruit had fallen green fruit had come on whilst i had been asleephow circumstances had altered and above all myself whilst i had been asleep no i had not been asleep in the old church i was in a pew it is true but not the pew of black leather in which i sometimes fell asleep in days of yore but in a strange pew and then my companions they were no longer those of days of yore i was no longer with my respectable father and mother and my dear brother but with the gypsy cral and his wife and the gigantic tawno the antinous of the dusky people and what was i myself no longer an innocent child but a moody man bearing in my face as i knew well the marks of my strivings and strugglings of what i had learned and unlearned nevertheless the general aspect of things brought to my mind what i had felt and seen of yore there was difference enough it is true but still there was a similarityat least i thought sothe church the clergyman and the clerk differing in many respects from those of pretty d put me strangely in mind of them and then the wordsbythebye was it not the magic of the words which brought the dear enchanting past so powerfully before the mind of lavengro for the words were the same sonorous words of high import which had first made an impression on his childish ear in the old church of pretty dereham the liturgy was now over during the reading of which my companions behaved in a most unexceptional manner sitting down and rising up when other people sat down and rose and holding in their hands prayerbooks which they found in the pew into which they stared intently though i observed that with the exception of mrs petulengro who knew how to read a little they held the books by the top and not the bottom as is the usual way the clergyman now ascended the pulpit arrayed in his black gown the congregation composed themselves to attention as did also my companions who fixed their eyes upon the clergyman with a certain strange immovable stare which i believe to be peculiar to their race the clergyman gave out his text and began to preach he was a tall gentlemanly man seemingly between fifty and sixty with greyish hair his features were very handsome but with a somewhat melancholy cast the tones of his voice were rich and noble but also with somewhat of melancholy in them the text which he gave out was the following one in what would a man be profited provided he gained the whole world and lost his own soul and on this text the clergyman preached long and well he did not read his sermon but spoke it extempore his doing so rather surprised and offended me at first i was not used to such a style of preaching in a church devoted to the religion of my country i compared it within my mind with the style of preaching used by the highchurch rector in the old church of pretty d and i thought to myself it was very different and being very different i did not like it and i thought to myself how scandalised the people of d would have been had they heard it and i figured to myself how indignant the highchurch clerk would have been had any clergyman got up in the church of d and preached in such a manner did it not savour strongly of dissent methodism and similar low stuff surely it did why the methodist i had heard preach on the heath above the old city preached in the same mannerat least he preached extempore ay and something like the present clergyman for the methodist spoke very zealously and with great feeling and so did the present clergyman so i of course felt rather offended with the clergyman for speaking with zeal and feeling however long before the sermon was over i forgot the offence which i had taken and listened to the sermon with much admiration for the eloquence and powerful reasoning with which it abounded oh how eloquent he was when he talked on the inestimable value of a mans soul which he said endured for ever whilst his body as every one knew lasted at most for a very contemptible period of time and how forcibly he reasoned on the folly of a man who for the sake of gaining the whole worlda thing he said which provided he gained he could only possess for a part of the time during which his perishable body existedshould lose his soul that is cause that precious deathless portion of him to suffer indescribable misery time without end there was one part of his sermon which struck me in a very particular manner he said that there were some people who gained something in return for their souls if they did not get the whole world they got a part of itlands wealth honour or renown mere trifles he allowed in comparison with the value of a mans soul which is destined either to enjoy delight or suffer tribulation time without end but which in the eyes of the worldly had a certain value and which afforded a certain pleasure and satisfaction but there were also others who lost their souls and got nothing for them neither lands wealth renown nor consideration who were poor outcasts and despised by everybody my friends he added if the man is a fool who barters his soul for the whole world what a fool he must be who barters his soul for nothing the eyes of the clergyman as he uttered these words wandered around the whole congregation and when he had concluded them the eyes of the whole congregation were turned upon my companions and myselfchapter xxvreturn from churchthe cuckoo and gypsy spiritual discourse the service over my companions and myself returned towards the encampment by the way we came some of the humble part of the congregation laughed and joked at us as we passed mr petulengro and his wife however returned their laughs and jokes with interest as for tawno and myself we said nothing tawno like most handsome fellows having very little to say for himself at any time and myself though not handsome not being particularly skilful at repartee some boys followed us for a considerable time making all kinds of observations about gypsies but as we walked at a great pace we gradually left them behind and at last lost sight of them mrs petulengro and tawno chikno walked together even as they had come whilst mr petulengro and myself followed at a little distance that was a very fine preacher we heard said i to mr petulengro after we had crossed the stile into the fields very fine indeed brother said mr petulengro he is talked of far and wide for his sermons folks say that there is scarcely another like him in the whole of england he looks rather melancholy jasper he lost his wife several years ago who they say was one of the most beautiful women ever seen they say that it was grief for her loss that made him come out mighty strong as a preacher for though he was a clergyman he was never heard of in the pulpit before he lost his wife since then the whole country has rung with the preaching of the clergyman of m as they call him those two nice young gentlewomen whom you saw with the female childer are his daughters you seem to know all about him jasper did you ever hear him preach before never brother but he has frequently been to our tent and his daughters too and given us tracts for he is one of the people they call evangelicals who give folks tracts which they cannot read you should learn to read jasper we have no time brother are you not frequently idle never brother when we are not engaged in our traffic we are engaged in taking our relaxation so we have no time to learn you really should make an effort if you were disposed to learn to read i would endeavour to assist you you would be all the better for knowing how to read in what way brother why you could read the scriptures and by so doing learn your duty towards your fellowcreatures we know that already brother the constables and justices have contrived to knock that tolerably into our heads yet you frequently break the laws so i believe do now and then those who know how to read brother very true jasper but you really ought to learn to read as by so doing you might learn your duty towards yourselves and your chief duty is to take care of your own souls did not the preacher say in what is a man profited provided he gain the whole world we have not much of the world brother very little indeed jasper did you not observe how the eyes of the whole congregation were turned towards our pew when the preacher said there are some people who lose their souls and get nothing in exchange who are outcast despised and miserable now was not what he said quite applicable to the gypsies we are not miserable brother well then you ought to be jasper have you an inch of ground of your own are you of the least use are you notspoken ill of by everybody whats a gypsy whats the bird noising yonder brother the bird oh thats the cuckoo tolling but what has the cuckoo to do with the matter well see brother whats the cuckoo what is it you know as much about it as myself jasper isnt it a kind of roguish chaffing bird brother i believe it is jasper nobody knows whence it comes brother i believe not jasper very poor brother not a nest of its own so they say jasper with every persons bad word brother yes jasper every person is mocking it tolerably merry brother yes tolerably merry jasper of no use at all brother none whatever jasper you would be glad to get rid of the cuckoos brother why not exactly jasper the cuckoo is a pleasant funny bird and its presence and voice give a great charm to the green trees and fields no i cant say i wish exactly to get rid of the cuckoo well brother whats a romany chal you must answer that question yourself jasper a roguish chaffing fellow ant he brother ay ay jasper of no use at all brother just so jasper i see something very much like a cuckoo brother i see what you are after jasper you would like to get rid of us wouldnt you why no not exactly we are no ornament to the green lanes in spring and summer time are we brother and the voices of our chies with their cukkerin and dukkerin dont help to make them pleasant i see what you are at jasper you would wish to turn the cuckoos into barndoor fowls wouldnt you cant say i should jasper whatever some people might wishand the chals and chies into radical weavers and factory wenches hey brother cant say that i should jasper you are certainly a picturesque people and in many respects an ornament both to town and country painting and lil writing too are under great obligations to you what pretty pictures are made out of your campings and groupings and what pretty books have been written in which gypsies or at least creatures intended to represent gypsies have been the principal figures i think if we were without you we should begin to miss you just as you would the cuckoos if they were all converted into barndoor fowls i tell you what brother frequently as i have sat under a hedge in spring or summer time and heard the cuckoo i have thought that we chals and cuckoos are alike in many respects but especially in character everybody speaks ill of us both and everybody is glad to see both of us again yes jasper but there is some difference between men and cuckoos men have souls jasper and why not cuckoos brother you should not talk so jasper what you say is little short of blasphemy how should a bird have a soul and how should a man oh we know very well that a man has a soul how do you know it we know very well would you take your oath of it brotheryour bodily oath why i think i might jasper did you ever see the soul brother no i never saw it then how could you swear to it a pretty figure you would make in a court of justice to swear to a thing which you never saw hold up your head fellow when and where did you see it now upon your oath fellow do you mean to say that this roman stole the donkeys foal oh theres no one for crossquestioning like counsellor p our people when they are in a hobble always like to employ him though he is somewhat dear now brother how can you get over the upon your oath fellow will you say that you have a soul well we will take no oath on the subject but you yourself believe in the soul i have heard you say that you believe in dukkerin now what is dukkerin but the soul science when did i say that i believed in it why after that fight when you pointed to the bloody mark in the cloud whilst he you wot of was galloping in the barouche to the old town amidst the raincataracts the thunder and flame of heaven i have some kind of remembrance of it brother then again i heard you say that the dook of abershaw rode every night on horseback down the wooded hill i say brother what a wonderful memory you have i wish i had not jasper but i cant help it it is my misfortune misfortune well perhaps it is at any rate it is very ungenteel to have such a memory i have heard my wife say that to show you have a long memory looks very vulgar and that you cant give a greater proof of gentility than by forgetting a thing as soon as possiblemore especially a promise or an acquaintance when he happens to be shabby well brother i dont deny that i may have said that i believe in dukkerin and in abershaws dook which you say is his soul but what i believe one moment or say i believe dont be certain that i shall believe the next or say i do indeed jasper i heard you say on a previous occasion on quoting a piece of song that when a man dies he is cast into the earth and theres an end of himi did did i lor what a memory you have brother but you are not sure that i hold that opinion now certainly not jasper indeed after such a sermon as we have been hearing i should be very shocked if you held such an opinion however brother dont be sure i do not however shocking such an opinion may be to you what an incomprehensible people you are jasper we are rather so brother indeed we have posed wiser heads than yours before now you seem to care for so little and yet you rove about a distinct race i say brother yes jasper what do you think of our women they have certainly very singular names jasper names lavengro but brother if you had been as fond of things as of names you would never have been a pal of ours what do you mean jasper ant they rum animals they have tongues of their own jasper did you ever feel their teeth and nails brother never jasper save mrs hernes i have always been very civil to them so they let you alone i say brother some part of the secret is in them they seem rather flighty jasper ay ay brother rather fond of loose discourse rather so brother can you always trust them jasper we never watch them brother can they always trust you not quite so well as we can them however we get on very well together except mikailia and her husband but mikailia is a cripple and is married to the beauty of the world so she may be expected to be jealousthough he would not part with her for a duchess no more than i would part with my rawnie nor any other chal with his ay but would not the chi part with the chal for a duke jasper my pakomovna gave up the duke for me brother but she occasionally talks of him jasper yes brother but pakomovna was born on a common not far from the sign of the gammon gammon of bacon i suppose yes brother but gammon likewise means i know it does jasper it means fun ridicule jest it is an ancient norse word and is found in the eddalor brother how learned in lils you are many words of norse are to be found in our vulgar sayings jasper for examplein that particularly vulgar saying of ours your mother is up theres a noble norse word mother there meaning not the female who bore us but rage and choler as i discovered by reading the sagas jasper lor brother how booklearned you be indifferently so jasper then you think you might trust your wife with the duke i think i could brother or even with yourself myself jasper oh i never troubled my head about your wife but i suppose there have been love affairs between gorgios and romany chies why novels are stuffed with such matters and then even one of your own songs says sothe song which ursula was singing the other afternoon that is somewhat of an old song brother and is sung by the chies as a warning at our solemn festivals well but theres your sisterinlaw ursula herself jasper ursula herself brother you were talking of my having her jasper well brother why didnt you have her would she have had me of course brother you are so much of a roman and speak romany so remarkably well poor thing she looks very innocent remarkably so brother however though not born on the same common with my wife she knows a thing or two of roman matters i should like to ask her a question or two jasper in connection with that song you can do no better brother here we are at the camp after tea take ursula under a hedge and ask her a question or two in connection with that songchapter xxvisunday eveningursulaaction at law meridiana married already i took tea that evening with mr and mrs petulengro and ursula outside of their tent tawno was not present being engaged with his wife in his own tabernacle sylvester was there however lolling listlessly upon the ground as i looked upon this man i thought him one of the most disagreeable fellows i had ever seen his features were ugly and moreover as dark as pepper and besides being dark his skin was dirty as for his dress it was torn and sordid his chest was broad and his arms seemed powerful but upon the whole he looked a very caitiff i am sorry that man has lost his wife thought i for i am sure he will never get another what surprises me is that he ever found a woman disposed to unite her lot with his after tea i got up and strolled about the field my thoughts were upon isopel berners i wondered where she was and how long she would stay away at length becoming tired and listless i determined to return to the dingle and resume the reading of the bible at the place where i had left off what better could i do methought on a sunday evening i was then near the wood which surrounded the dingle but at that side which was farthest from the encampment which stood near the entrance suddenly on turning round the southern corner of the copse which surrounded the dingle i perceived ursula seated under a thornbush i thought i never saw her look prettier than then dressed as she was in her sundays best good evening ursula said i i little thought to have the pleasure of seeing you here nor would you brother said ursula had not jasper told me that you had been talking about me and wanted to speak to me under a hedge so hearing that i watched your motions and came here and sat down i was thinking of going to my quarters in the dingle to read the bible ursula but oh pray then go to your quarters brother and read the miduveleskoe lil you can speak to me under a hedge some other time i think i will sit down with you ursula for after all reading godly books in dingles at eve is rather sombre work yes i think i will sit down with you and i sat down by her side well brother now you have sat down with me under the hedge what have you to say to me why i hardly know ursula not know brother a pretty fellow you to ask young women to come and sit with you under hedges and when they come not know what to say to them oh ah i remember do you know ursula that i take a great interest in you thank ye brother kind of you at any rate you must be exposed to a great many temptations ursula a great many indeed brother it is hard to see fine things such as shawls gold watches and chains in the shops behind the big glasses and to know that they are not intended for one manys the time i have been tempted to make a dash at them but i bethought myself that by so doing i should cut my hands besides being almost certain of being grabbed and sent across the gulls bath to the foreign country then you think gold and fine things temptations ursula of course brother very great temptations dont you think them so cant say i do ursula then more fool you brother but have the kindness to tell me what you would call a temptation why for example the hope of honour and renown ursula the hope of honour and renown very good brother but i tell you one thing that unless you have money in your pocket and good broadcloth on your back you are not likely to obtain much honour andwhat do you call it amongst the gorgios to say nothing of the romany chalsi should have thought ursula that the romany chals roaming about the world as they do free and independent were above being led by such trifles then you know nothing of the gypsies brother no people on earth are fonder of those trifles as you call them than the romany chals or more disposed to respect those who have them then money and fine clothes would induce you to do anything ursula ay ay brother anything to chore a ursula like enough brother gypsies have been transported before now for choring to hokkawar b ay ay i was telling dukkerin only yesterday brother in fact to break the law in everything who knows brother who knows as i said before gold and fine clothes are great temptations well ursula i am sorry for it i should never have thought you so depraved indeed brother to think that i am seated by one who is willing toto go on brother to play the thief go on brother the liar go on brother thethe go on brother thethe lubbeny c the what brother said ursula starting from her seat why the lubbeny dont you i tell you what brother said ursula looking somewhat pale and speaking very low if i had only something in my hand i would do you a mischief why what is the matter ursula said i how have i offended you how have you offended me why didnt you insinivate just now that i was ready to play thethe go on ursula thethe ill not say it but i only wish i had something in my hand if i have offended ursula i am very sorry for it any offence i may have given you was from want of understanding you come pray be seated i have much to question you aboutto talk to you about seated not i it was only just now that you gave me to understand that you was ashamed to be seated by me a thief a liar well did you not almost give me to understand that you were both ursulai dont much care being called a thief and a liar said ursula a person may be a liar and a thief and yet a very honest woman but well ursula i tell you what brother if you ever sinivate again that i could be the third thing so help me duvel ill do you a mischief by my god i will well ursula i assure you that i shall sinivate as you call it nothing of the kind about you i have no doubt from what you have said that you are a very paragon of virtuea perfect lucretia but my name is ursula brother and not lucretia lucretia is not of our family but one of the bucklands she travels about oxfordshire yet i am as good as she any day lucretia how odd where could she have got that name well i make no doubt ursula that you are quite as good as she and she of her namesake of ancient rome but there is a mystery in this same virtue ursula which i cannot fathom how a thief and a liar should be able or indeed willing to preserve her virtue is what i dont understand you confess that you are very fond of gold now how is it that you dont barter your virtue for gold sometimes i am a philosopher ursula and like to know everything you must be every now and then exposed to great temptation ursula for you are of a beauty calculated to captivate all hearts come sit down and tell me how you are enabled to resist such temptation as gold and fine clothes well brother said ursula as you say you mean no harm i will sit down beside you and enter into discourse with you but i will uphold that you are the coolest hand that i ever came nigh and say the coolest things and thereupon ursula sat down by my side well ursula we will if you please discourse on the subject of your temptations i suppose that you travel very much about and show yourself in all kinds of places in all kinds brother i travels as you say very much attends fairs and races and enters booths and publichouses where i tells fortunes and sometimes dances and sings and do not people often address you in a very free manner frequently brother and i give them tolerably free answers do people ever offer to make you presents i mean presents of value such as silk handkerchiefs shawls and trinkets very frequently brother and what do you do ursula i take what people offers me brother and stows it away as soon as i can well but dont people expect something for their presents i dont mean dukkerin dancing and the like but such a moderate and innocent thing as a choomer ursula innocent thing do you call it brother the world calls it so ursula well do the people who give you the fine things never expect a choomer in return very frequently brother and do you ever grant it never brother how do you avoid it i gets away as soon as possible brother if they follows me i tries to baffle them by means of jests and laughter and if they persist i uses bad and terrible language of which i have plenty in store but if your terrible language has no effect then i screams for the constable and if he comes not i uses my teeth and nailsand are they always sufficient i have only had to use them twice brother but then i found them sufficient but suppose the person who followed you was highly agreeable ursula a handsome young officer of local militia for example all dressed in lincoln green would you still refuse him the choomer we makes no difference brother the daughters of the gypsyfather makes no difference and whats more sees none well ursula the world will hardly give you credit for such indifference what cares we for the world brother we are not of the world but your fathers brothers and uncles give you credit i suppose ursula ay ay brother our fathers brothers and cokos a gives us all manner of credit for example i am telling lies and dukkerin in a publichouse where my batu b or cokoperhaps bothare playing on the fiddle well my batu and my coko beholds me amongst the publichouse crew talking nonsense and hearing nonsense but they are under no apprehension and presently they sees the goodlooking officer of militia in his greens and lincolns get up and give me a wink and i go out with him abroad into the dark night perhaps well my batu and coko goes on fiddling just as if i were six miles off asleep in the tent and not out in the dark street with the local officer with his lincolns and his greens they know they can trust you ursula ay ay brother and whats more i knows i can trust myself so you would merely go out to make a fool of him ursula merely go out to make a fool of him brother i assure you but such proceedings really have an odd look ursula amongst gorgios very so brother well it must be rather unpleasant to lose ones character even amongst gorgios ursula and suppose the officer out of revenge for being tricked and duped by you were to say of you the thing that is not were to meet you on the racecourse the next day and boast of receiving favours which he never had amidst a knot of jeering militiamen how would you proceed ursula would you not be abashed by no means brother i should bring my action of law against him your action at law ursula yes brother i should give a whistle whereupon all ones cokos and batus and all my near and distant relations would leave their fiddling dukkerin and horsedealing and come flocking about me whats the matter ursula says my coko nothing at all i replies save and except that gorgio in his greens and his lincolns says that i have played the with him oho he does ursula says my coko try your action of law against him my lamb and he puts something privily into my hands whereupon i goes close up to the grinning gorgio and staring him in the face with my head pushed forward i cries out you say i did what was wrong with you last night when i was out with you abroad yes says the local officer i says you did looking down all the time you are a liar says i and forthwith i breaks his head with the stick which i holds behind me and which my coko has conveyed privily into my hand and this is your action at law ursula yes brother this is my action at clublaw and would your breaking the fellows head quite clear you of all suspicion in the eyes of your batus cokos and what not they would never suspect me at all brother because they would know that i would never condescend to be over intimate with a gorgio the breaking the head would be merely intended to justify ursula in the eyes of the gorgios and would it clear you in their eyes would it not brother when they saw the blood running down from the fellows cracked poll on his greens and lincolnsthey would be quite satisfied why the fellow would not be able to show his face at fair or merrymaking for a year and three quarters did you ever try it ursula cant say i ever did brother but it would do and how did you ever learn such a method of proceeding why tis advised by gypsy liri a brother its part of our way of settling difficulties amongst ourselves for example if a young roman were to say the thing which is not respecting ursula and himself ursula would call a great meeting of the people who would all sit down in a ring the young fellow amongst them a coko would then put a stick in ursulas hand who would then get up and go to the young fellow and say did i play the with you and were he to say yes she would crack his head before the eyes of all well said i ursula i was bred an apprentice to gorgio law and of course ought to stand up for it whenever i conscientiously can but i must say the gypsy manner of bringing an action for defamation is much less tedious and far more satisfactory than the gorgiko one i wish you now to clear up a certain point which is rather mysterious to me you say that for a romany chi to do what is unseemly with a gorgio is quite out of the question yet only the other day i heard you singing a song in which a romany chi confesses herself to be cambri b by a grand gorgious gentleman a sad let down said ursula well said i sad or not theres the song that speaks of the thing which you give me to understand is not well if the thing ever was said ursula it was a long time ago and perhaps after all not true then why do you sing the song i tell you brother we sings the song now and then to be a warning to ourselves to have as little to do as possible in the way of acquaintance with the gorgios and a warning it is you see how the young woman in the song was driven out of her tent by her mother with all kinds of disgrace and bad language but you dont know that she was afterwards buried alive by her cokos and pals in an uninhabited place the song doesnt say it but the story says it for there is a story about it though as i said before it was a long time ago and perhaps after all wasnt true but if such a thing were to happen at present would the cokos and pals bury the girl alive i cant say what they would do said ursula i suppose they are not so strict as they were long ago at any rate she would be driven from the tan and avoided by all her family and relations as a gorgios acquaintance so that perhaps at last she would be glad if they would bury her alive well i can conceive that there would be an objection on the part of the cokos and batus that a romany chi should form an improper acquaintance with a gorgio but i should think that the batus and cokos could hardly object to the chis entering into the honourable estate of wedlock with a gorgio ursula was silent marriage is an honourable estate ursula well brother suppose it be i dont see why a romany chi should object to enter into the honourable estate of wedlock with a gorgio you dont brother dont you no said i and moreover i am aware notwithstanding your evasion ursula that marriages and connections now and then occur between gorgios and romany chies the result of which is the mixed breed called halfandhalf which is at present travelling about england and to which the flaming tinman belongs otherwise called anselo herne as for the halfandhalfs said ursula they are a bad set and there is not a worse blackguard in england than anselo herne all what you say may be very true ursula but you admit that there are halfandhalfs the mores the pity brotherpity or not you admit the fact but how do you account for it how do i account for it why i will tell you by the break up of a roman family brotherthe father of a small family dies and perhaps the mother and the poor children are left behind sometimes they are gathered up by their relations and sometimes if they have none by charitable romans who bring them up in the observance of gypsy law but sometimes they are not so lucky and falls into the company of gorgios trampers and basketmakers who live in caravans with whom they take up and so i hate to talk of the matter brother but so comes this race of the halfandhalfs then you mean to say ursula that no romany chi unless compelled by hard necessity would have anything to do with a gorgio we are not over fond of gorgios brother and we hates basketmakers and folks that live in caravans well said i suppose a gorgio who is not a basketmaker a fine handsome gorgious gentleman who lives in a fine house we are not fond of houses brother i never slept in a house in my life but would not plenty of money induce you i hate houses brother and those who live in them well suppose such a person were willing to resign his fine house and for love of you to adopt gypsy law speak romany and live in a tan would you have nothing to say to him bringing plenty of money with him brother well bringing plenty of money with him ursula well brother suppose you produce your man where is he i was merely supposing such a person ursula then you dont know of such a person brother why no ursula why do you ask because brother i was almost beginning to think that you meant yourself myself ursula i have no fine house to resign nor have i money moreover ursula though i have a great regard for you and though i consider you very handsome quite as handsome indeed as meridiana in meridiana where did you meet with her said ursula with a toss of her head why in old pulcis at old fulchers thats not true brother meridiana is a borzlam and travels with her own people and not with old fulcher who is a gorgio and a basketmaker i was not speaking of old fulcher but pulci a great italian writer who lived many hundred years ago and who in his poem called the morgante maggiore speaks of meridiana the daughter of old carus borzlam said ursula but if the fellow you mention lived so many hundred years ago how in the name of wonder could he know anything of meridiana the wonder ursula is how your people could ever have got hold of that name and similar ones the meridiana of pulci was not the daughter of old carus borzlam but of caradoro a great pagan king of the east who being besieged in his capital by manfredonio another mighty pagan king who wished to obtain possession of his daughter who had refused him was relieved in his distress by certain paladins of charlemagne with one of whom oliver his daughter meridiana fell in love i see said ursula that it must have been altogether a different person for i am sure that meridiana borzlam would never have fallen in love with oliver oliver why that is the name of the curomengro who lost the fight near the chong gav the day of the great tempest when i got wet through no no meridiana borzlam would never have so far forgot her blood as to take up with tom oliveri was not talking of that oliver ursula but of oliver peer of france and paladin of charlemagne with whom meridiana daughter of caradore fell in love and for whose sake she renounced her religion and became a christian and finally ingravidata or cambri by him e nacquene un figliuol dice la storia che dette à carloman poi gran vittoria which means i dont want to know what it means said ursula no good im sure well if the meridiana of charless wains pal was no handsomer than meridiana borzlam she was no great catch brother for though i am by no means given to vanity i think myself better to look at than she though i will say she is no lubbeny and would scorn i make no doubt she would ursula and i make no doubt that you are much handsomer than she or even the meridiana of oliver what i was about to say before you interrupted me is this that though i have a great regard for you and highly admire you it is only in a brotherly way and and you had nothing better to say to me said ursula when you wanted to talk to me beneath a hedge than that you liked me in a brotherly way well i declare you seem disappointed ursula disappointed brother not i you were just now saying that you disliked gorgios so of course could only wish that i who am a gorgio should like you in a brotherly way i wished to have a conversation with you beneath a hedge but only with the view of procuring from you some information respecting the song which you sung the other day and the conduct of roman females which has always struck me as being highly unaccountable so if you thought anything else what else should i expect from a pickerup of old words brother bah i dislike a pickerup of old words worse than a pickerup of old rags dont be angry ursula i feel a great interest in you you are very handsome and very clever indeed with your beauty and cleverness i only wonder that you have not long since been married you do do you brother yes however keep up your spirits ursula you are not much past the prime of youth so not much past the prime of youth dont be uncivil brother i was only twentytwo last month dont be offended ursula but twentytwo is twentytwo or i should rather say that twentytwo in a woman is more than twentysix in a man you are still very beautiful but i advise you to accept the first offer thats made to you thank you brother but your advice comes rather late i accepted the first offer that was made me five years ago you married five years ago ursula is it possible quite possible brother i assure you and how came i to know nothing about it how comes it that you dont know many thousand things about the romans brother do you think they tell you all their affairs married ursula married well i declare you seem disappointed brother disappointed oh no not at all but jasper only a few weeks ago told me that you were not married and indeed almost gave me to understand that you would be very glad to get a husband and you believed him ill tell you brother for your instruction that there is not in the whole world a greater liar than jasper petulengroi am sorry to hear it ursula but with respect to him you marriedwho might he be a gorgio or a romany chal gorgio or romany chal do you think i would ever condescend to a gorgio it was a camomescro brother a lovell a distant relation of my own and where is he and what became of him have you any family dont think i am going to tell you all my history brother and to tell you the truth i am tired of sitting under hedges with you talking nonsense i shall go to my house do sit a little longer sister ursula i most heartily congratulate you on your marriage but where is this same lovell i have never seen him i should wish to congratulate him too you are quite as handsome as the meridiana of pulci ursula ay or the despina of ricciardetto ricciardetto ursula is a poem written by one fortiguerra about ninety years ago in imitation of the morgante of pulci it treats of the wars of charlemagne and his paladins with various barbarous nations who came to besiege paris despina was the daughter and heiress of scricca king of cafria she was the beloved of ricciardetto and was beautiful as an angel but i make no doubt you are quite as handsome as she brother said ursulabut the reply of ursula i reserve for another chapter the present having attained to rather an uncommon length for which however the importance of the matter discussed is a sufficient apologychapter xxviiursulas talethe patteranthe deep watersecond husband brother said ursula plucking a dandelion which grew at her feet i have always said that a more civil and pleasantspoken person than yourself cant be found i have a great regard for you and your learning and am willing to do you any pleasure in the way of words or conversation mine is not a very happy story but as you wish to hear it it is quite at your service launcelot lovell made me an offer as you call it and we were married in roman fashion that is we gave each other our right hands and promised to be true to each other we lived together two years travelling sometimes by ourselves sometimes with our relations i bore him two children both of which were stillborn partly i believe from the fatigue i underwent in running about the country telling dukkerin when i was not exactly in a state to do so and partly from the kicks and blows which my husband launcelot was in the habit of giving me every night provided i came home with less than five shillings which it is sometimes impossible to make in the country provided no fair or merrymaking is going on at the end of two years my husband launcelot whistled a horse from a farmers field and sold it for forty pounds and for that horse he was taken put in prison tried and condemned to be sent to the other country for life two days before he was to be sent away i got leave to see him in the prison and in the presence of the turnkey i gave him a thin cake of gingerbread in which there was a dainty saw which could cut through iron i then took on wonderfully turned my eyes inside out fell down in a seeming fit and was carried out of the prison that same night my husband sawed his irons off cut through the bars of his window and dropping down a height of fifty feet lighted on his legs and came and joined me on a heath where i was camped alone we were just getting things ready to be off when we heard people coming and sure enough they were runners after my husband launcelot lovell for his escape had been discovered within a quarter of an hour after he had got away my husband without bidding me farewell set off at full speed and they after him but they could not take him and so they came back and took me and shook me and threatened me and had me before the poknees who shook his head at me and threatened me in order to make me discover where my husband was but i said i did not know which was true enough not that i would have told him if i had so at last the poknees and the runners not being able to make anything out of me were obliged to let me go and i went in search of my husband i wandered about with my cart for several days in the direction in which i saw him run off with my eyes bent on the ground but could see no marks of him at last coming to four cross roads i saw my husbands patteran you saw your husbands patteran yes brother do you know what patteran means of course ursula the gypsy trail the handful of grass which the gypsies strew in the roads as they travel to give information to any of their companions who may be behind as to the route they have taken the gypsy patteran has always had a strange interest for me ursula like enough brother but what does patteran mean why the gypsy trail formed as i told you before and you know nothing more about patteran brother nothing at all ursula do you whats the name for the leaf of a tree brother i dont know said i its odd enough that i have asked that question of a dozen romany chals and chies and they always told me that they did not know no more they did brother theres only one person in england that knows and thats myselfthe name for a leaf is patteran now there are two that knows itthe other is yourself dear me ursula how very strange i am much obliged to you i think i never saw you look so pretty as you do now but who told you my mother mrs herne told it me one day brother when she was in a good humour which she very seldom was and no one has a better right to know than yourself as she hated you mortally it was one day when you had been asking our company what was the word for a leaf and nobody could tell you that she took me aside and told me for she was in a good humour and triumphed in seeing you balked she told me the word for leaf was patteran which our people use now for trail having forgotten the true meaning she said that the trail was called patteran because the gypsies of old were in the habit of making the marks with the leaves and branches of trees placed in a certain manner she said that nobody knew it but herself who was one of the old sort and begged me never to tell the word to any one but him i should marry and to be particularly cautious never to let you know it whom she hated well brother perhaps i havedone wrong to tell you but as i said before i likes you and am always ready to do your pleasure in words and conversation my mother moreover is dead and gone and poor thing will never know anything about the matter so when i married i told my husband about the patteran and we were in the habit of making our private trail with leaves and branches of trees which none of the other gypsy people did so when i saw my husbands patteran i knew it at once and i followed it upwards of two hundred miles towards the north and then i came to a deep awfullooking water with an overhanging bank and on the bank i found the patteran which directed me to proceed along the bank towards the east and i followed my husbands patteran towards the east and before i had gone half a mile i came to a place where i saw the bank had given way and fallen into the deep water without paying much heed i passed on and presently came to a publichouse not far from the water and i entered the publichouse to get a little beer and perhaps to tell a dukkerin for i saw a great many people about the door and when i entered i found there was what they calls an inquest being held upon a body in that house and the jury had just risen to go and look at the body and being a woman and having a curiosity i thought i would go with them and so i did and no sooner did i see the body than i knew it to be my husbands it was much swelled and altered but i knew it partly by the clothes and partly by a mark on the forehead and i cried out it is my husbands body and i fell down in a fit and the fit that time brother was not a seeming one dear me i how terrible but tell me ursula how did your husband come by his death the bank overhanging the deep water gave way under him brother and he was drowned for like most of our people he could not swim or only a little the body after it had been in the water a long time came up of itself and was found floating well brother when the people of the neighbourhood found that i was the wife of the drowned man they were very kind to me and made a subscription for me with which after having seen my husband buried i returned the way i had come till i met jasper and his people and with them i have travelled ever since i was very melancholy for a long time i assure you brother for the death of my husband preyed very much upon my mind his death was certainly a very shocking one ursula but really if he had died a natural one you could scarcely have regretted it for he appears to have treated you barbarously women must bear brother and barring that he kicked and beat me and drove me out to tell dukkerin when i could scarcely stand he was not a bad husband a man by gypsy law brother is allowed to kick and beat his wife and to bury her alive if he thinks proper i am a gypsy and have nothing to say against the law but what has mikailia chikno to say about it she is a cripple brother the only cripple amongst the roman people so she is allowed to do and say as she pleases moreover her husband does not think fit to kick or beat her though it is my opinion she would like him all the better if he were occasionally to do so and threaten to bury her alive at any rate she would treat him better and respect him more your sister does not seem to stand much in awe of jasper petulengro ursula let the matters of my sister and jasper petulengro alone brother you must travel in their company some time before you can understand them they are a strange two up to all kind of chaffing but two more regular romans dont breathe and ill tell you for your instruction that there isnt a better marebreaker in england that jasper petulengro if you can manage miss isopel berners as well as isopel berners said i how came you to think of her how should i but think of her brother living as she does with you in mumpers dingle and travelling about with you you will have brother more difficulty to manage her than jasper has to manage my sister pakomovna i should have mentioned her before only i wanted to know what you had to say to me and when we got into discourse i forgot her i say brother let me tell you your dukkerin with respect to her you will never i want to hear no dukkerin ursula do let me tell you your dukkerin brother you will never manage i want to hear no dukkerin ursula in connection with isopel berners moreover it is sunday we will change the subject it is surprising to me that after all you have undergone you should still look so beautiful i suppose you do not think of marrying again ursula no brother one husband at a time is quite enough for any reasonable mort especially such a good husband as i have got such a good husband why i thought you told me your husband was drowned yes brother my first husband wasand have you a second to be sure brother and who is he in the name of wonder who is he why sylvester to be sure i do assure you ursula that i feel disposed to be angry with you such a handsome young woman as yourself to take up with such a nasty pepperfaced goodfornothing i wont hear my husband abused brother so you had better say no more why is he not the lazarus of the gypsies has he a penny of his own ursula then the more his want brother of a clever chi like me to take care of him and his childer i tell you what brother i will chore if necessary and tell dukkerin for sylvester if even so heavy as scarcely to be able to stand you call him lazy you would not think him lazy if you were in a ring with him he is a proper man with his hands jasper is going to back him for twenty pounds against slammocks of the chong gav the brother of roarer and bellmetal he says he has no doubt that he will win well if you like him i of course can have no objection have you been long married about a fortnight brother that dinner the other day when i sang the song was given in celebration of the wedding were you married in a church ursula we were not brother none but gorgios cripples and lubbenys are ever married in a church we took each others words brother i have been with you near three hours beneath this hedge i will go to my husband does he know that you are here he does brother and is he satisfied satisfied of course lor you gorgios brother i go to my husband and my house and thereupon ursula rose and departed after waiting a little time i also arose it was now dark and i thought i could do no better than betake myself to the dingle at the entrance of it i found mr petulengro well brother said he what kind of conversation have you and ursula had beneath the hedge if you wished to hear what we were talking about you should have come and sat down beside us you knew where we were well brother i did much the same for i went and sat down behind you behind the hedge jasper behind the hedge brother and heard all our conversation every word brother and a rum conversation it was tis an old saying jasper that listeners never hear any good of themselves perhaps you heard the epithet that ursula bestowed upon you if by epitaph you mean that she called me a liar i did brother and she was not much wrong for i certainly do not always stick exactly to truth you however have not much to complain of me you deceived me about ursula giving me to understand she was not married she was not married when i told you so brother that is not to sylvester nor was i aware that she was going to marryhim i once thought you had a kind of regard for her and i am sure she had as much for you as a romany chi can have for a gorgio i half expected to have heard you make love to her behind the hedge but i begin to think you care for nothing in this world but old words and strange stories lor to take a young woman under a hedge and talk to her as you did to ursula and yet you got everything out of her that you wanted with your gammon about old fulcher and meridiana you are a cunning one brother there you are mistaken jasper i am not cunning if people think i am it is because being made up of art themselves simplicity of character is a puzzle to them your women are certainly extraordinary creatures jasper didnt i say they were rum animals brother we romans shall always stick together as long as they stick fast to us do you think they always will jasper cant say brother nothing lasts for ever romany chies are romany chies still though not exactly what they were sixty years ago my wife though a rum one is not mrs herne brother i think she is rather fond of frenchmen and french discourse i tell you what brother if ever gypsyism breaks up it will be owing to our chies having been bitten by that mad puppy they calls gentilitychapter xxviiithe dingle at nightthe two sides of the questionroman femalesfilling the kettlethe dream the tall figure i descended to the bottom of the dingle it was nearly involved in obscurity to dissipate the feeling of melancholy which came over my mind i resolved to kindle a fire and having heaped dry sticks upon my hearth and added a billet or two i struck a light and soon produced a blaze sitting down i fixed my eyes upon the blaze and soon fell into a deep meditation i thought of the events of the day the scene at church and what i had heard at church the danger of losing ones soul the doubts of jasper petulengro as to whether one had a soul i thought over the various arguments which i had either heard or which had come spontaneously to my mind for or against the probability of a state of future existence they appeared to me to be tolerably evenly balanced i then thought that it was at all events taking the safest part to conclude that there was a soul it would be a terrible thing after having passed ones life in the disbelief of the existence of a soul to wake up after death a soul and to find ones self a lost soul yes methought i would come to the conclusion that one has a soul choosing the safe side however appeared to me to be playing rather a dastardly part i had never been an admirer of people who chose the safe side in everything indeed i had always entertained a thorough contempt for them surely it would be showing more manhood to adopt the dangerous side that of disbelief i almost resolved to do sobut yet in a question of so much importance i ought not to be guided by vanity the question was not which was the safe but the true side yet how was i to know which was the true side then i thought of the bible which i had been reading in the morningthat spoke of the soul and a future state but was the bible true i had heard learned and moral men say that it was true but i had also heard learned and moral men say that it was not how was i to decide still that balance of probabilities if i could but see the way of truth i would follow it if necessary upon hands and knees on that i was determined but i could not see it feeling my brain begin to turn round i resolved to think of something else and forthwith began to think of what had passed between ursula and myself in our discourse beneath the hedge i mused deeply on what she had told me as to the virtue of the females of her race how singular that virtue must be which was kept pure and immaculate by the possessor whilst indulging in habits of falsehood and dishonesty i had always thought the gypsy females extraordinary beings i had often wondered at them their dress their manner of speaking and not least at their names but until the present day i had been unacquainted with the most extraordinary point connected with them how came they possessed of this extraordinary virtue was it because they were thievish i remembered that an ancient thieftaker who had retired from his useful calling and who frequently visited the office of my master at law the respectable s who had the management of his propertyi remembered to have heard this worthy with whom i occasionally held discourse philosophic and profound when he and i chanced to be alone together in the office say that all firstrate thieves were sober and of wellregulated morals their bodily passions being kept in abeyance by their love of gain but this axiom could scarcely hold good with respect to these womenhowever thievish they might be they did care for something besides gain they cared for their husbands if they did thieve they merely thieved for their husbands and though perhaps some of them were vain they merely prized their beauty because it gave them favour in the eyes of their husbands whatever the husbands wereand jasper had almost insinuated that the males occasionally allowed themselves some latitudethey appeared to be as faithful to their husbands as the ancient roman matrons were to theirs roman matrons and after all might not these be in reality roman matrons they called themselves romans might not they be the descendants of the old roman matrons might not they be of the same blood as lucretia and were not many of their strange nameslucretia amongst the resthanded down to them from old rome it is true their language was not that of old rome it was not however altogether different from it after all the ancient romans might be a tribe of these people who settled down and founded a village with the tilts of carts which by degrees and the influx of other people became the grand city of the world i liked the idea of the grand city of the world owing its origin to a people who had been in the habit of carrying their houses in their carts why after all should not the romans of history be a branch of these romans there were several points of similarity between them if roman matrons were chaste both men and women were thieves old rome was the thief of the world yet still there were difficulties to be removed before i could persuade myself that the old romans and my romans were identical and in trying to remove these difficulties i felt my brain once more beginning to turn and in haste took up another subject of meditation and that was the patteran and what ursula had told me about it i had always entertained a strange interest for that sign by which in their wanderings the romanese gave to those of their people who came behind intimation as to the direction which they took but it now inspired me with greater interest than evernow that i had learned that the proper meaning of it was the leaves of trees i had as i had said in my dialogue with ursula been very eager to learn the word for leaf in the romanian language but had never learned it till this day so patteran signified leaf the leaf of a tree and no one at present knew that but myself and ursula who had learned it from mrs herne the last it was said of the old stock and then i thought what strange people the gypsies must have been in the old time they were sufficiently strange at present but they must have been far stranger of old they must have been a more peculiar peopletheir language must have been more perfectand they must have had a greater stock of strange secrets i almost wished that i had lived some two or three hundred years ago that i might haveobserved these people when they were yet stranger than at present i wondered whether i could have introduced myself to their company at that period whether i should have been so fortunate as to meet such a strange halfmalicious half goodhumoured being as jasper who would have instructed me in the language then more deserving of note than at present what might i not have done with that language had i known it in its purity why i might have written books in it yet those who spoke it would hardly have admitted me to their society at that period when they kept more to themselves yet i thought that i might possibly have gained their confidence and have wandered about with them and learned their language and all their strange ways and thenand thenand a sigh rose from the depth of my breast for i began to think supposing i had accomplished all this what would have been the profit of it and in what would all this wild gypsy dream have terminated then rose another sigh yet more profound for i began to think what was likely to be the profit of my present way of life the living in dingles making pony and donkey shoes conversing with gypsywomen under hedges and extracting from them their odd secrets what was likely to be the profit of such a kind of life even should it continue for a length of timea supposition not very probable for i was earning nothing to support me and the funds with which i had entered upon this life were gradually disappearing i was living it is true not unpleasantly enjoying the healthy air of heaven but upon the whole was i not sadly misspending my time surely i was and as i looked back it appeared to me that i had always been doing so what had been the profit of the tongues which i had learned had they ever assisted me in the day of hunger no no it appeared to me that i had always misspent my time save in one instance when by a desperate effort i had collected all the powers of my imagination and written the life of joseph sell but even when i wrote the life of sell was i not in a false position provided i had not misspent my time would it have been necessary to make that effort which after all had only enabled me to leave london and wander about the country for a time but could i taking all circumstances into consideration have done better than i had with my peculiar temperament and ideas could i have pursued with advantage the profession to which my respectable parents had endeavoured to bring me up it appeared to me that i could not and that the hand of necessity had guided me from my earliest years until the present night in which i found myself seated in the dingle staring on the brands of the fire but ceasing to think of the past which as irrecoverably gone it was useless to regret even were there cause to regret it what should i do in future should i write another book like the life of joseph sell take it to london and offer it to a publisher but when i reflected on the grisly sufferings which i had undergone whilst engaged in writing the life of sell i shrank from the idea of a similar attempt moreover i doubted whether i possessed the power to write a similar work whether the materials for the life of another sell lurked within the recesses of my brain had i not better become in reality what i had hitherto been merely playing ata tinker or a gypsy but i soon saw that i was not fitted to become either in reality it was much more agreeable to play the gypsy or the tinker than to become either in reality i had seen enough of gypsying and tinkering to be convinced of that all of a sudden the idea of tilling the soil came into my head tilling the soil was a healthful and noble pursuit but my idea of tilling the soil had no connection with britain for i could only expect to till the soil in britain as a serf i thought of tilling it in america in which it was said there was plenty of wild unclaimed land of which any one who chose to clear it of its trees might take possession i figured myself in america in an immense forest clearing the land destined by my exertions to become a fruitful and smiling plain methought i heard the crash of the huge trees as they fell beneath my axe and then i bethought me that a man was intended to marryi ought to marry and if i married where was i likely to be more happy as a husband and a father than in america engaged in tilling the ground i fancied myself in america engaged in tilling the ground assisted by an enormous progeny well why not marry and go and till the ground in america i was young and youth was the time to marry in and to labour in i had the use of all my faculties my eyes it is true were rather dull from early study and from writing the life of joseph sell but i could see tolerably well with them and they were not bleared i felt my arms and thighs and teeththey were strong and sound enough so now was the time to labour to marry eat strong flesh and beget strong childrenthe power of doing all this would pass away with youth which was terribly transitory i bethought me that a time would come when my eyes would be bleared and perhaps sightless my arms and thighs strengthless and sapless when my teeth would shake in my jaws even supposing they did not drop out no going a wooing thenno labouringno eating strong flesh and begetting lusty children then and i bethought me how when all this should be should bewail the days of my youth as misspent provided i had not in them founded for myself a home and begotten strong children to take care of me in the days when i could not take care of myself and thinking of these things i became sadder and sadder and stared vacantly upon the fire till my eyes closed in a doze i continued dozing over the fire until rousing myself i perceived that the brands were nearly consumed and i thought of retiring for the night i arose and was about to enter my tent when a thought struck me suppose thought i that isopel berners should return in the midst of the night how dark and dreary would the dingle appear without a fire truly i will keep up the fire and i will do more i have no board to spread for her but i will fill the kettle and heat it so that if she comes i may be able to welcome her with a cup of tea for i know she loves tea thereupon i piled more wood upon the fire and soon succeeded in producing a better blaze than before then taking the kettle i set out for the spring on arriving at the mouth of the dingle which fronted the east i perceived that charless wain was nearly opposite to it high above in the heavens by which i knew that the night was tolerably well advanced the gypsy encampment lay before me all was hushed and still within it and its inmates appeared to be locked in slumber as i advanced however the dogs which were fastened outside the tents growled and barked but presently recognising me they were again silent some of them wagging their tails as i drew near a particular tent i heard a female voice saysome one is comingand as i was about to pass it the cloth which formed the door was suddenly lifted up and a black head and part of a huge naked body protruded it was the head and upper part of the giant tawno who according to the fashion of gypsy men lay next the door wrapped in his blanket the blanket had however fallen off and the starlight shone clear on his athletic tawny body and was reflected from his large staring eyes it is only i tawno said i going to fill the kettle as it is possible that miss berners may arrive this night kosko drawled out tawno and replaced the curtain good do you call it said the sharp voice of his wife there is no good in the matter if that young chap were not living with the rawnee in the illegal and uncertificated line he would not be getting up in the middle of the night to fill her kettles passing on i proceeded to the spring where i filled the kettle and then returned to the dingle placing the kettle upon the fire i watched it till it began to boil then removing it from the top of the brands i placed it close beside the fire and leaving it simmering i retired to my tent where having taken off my shoes and a few of my garments i lay down on my palliasse and was not long in falling asleep i believe i slept soundly for some time thinking and dreaming of nothing suddenly however my sleep became disturbed and the subject of the patterans began to occupy my brain i imagined that i saw ursula tracing her husband launcelot lovell by means of his patterans i imagined that she had considerable difficulty in doing so that she was occasionally interrupted by parish beadles and constables who asked her whither she was travelling to whom she gave various answers presently methought that as she was passing by a farmyard two fierce and savage dogs flew at her i was in great trouble i remember and wished to assist her but could not for though i seemed to see her i was still at a distance and now it appeared that she had escaped from the dogs and was proceeding with her cart along a gravelly path which traversed a wild moor i could hear the wheels grating amidst sand and gravel the next moment i was awake and found myself sitting up in my tent there was a glimmer of light through the canvas caused by the fire a feeling of dread came over me which was perhaps natural on starting suddenly from ones sleep in that wild lone place i half imagined that some one was nigh the tent the idea made me rather uncomfortable and to dissipate it i lifted up the canvas of the door and peeped out and lo i had an indistinct view of a tall figure standing by the tent who is that said i whilst i felt my blood rush to my heart it is i said the voice of isopel berners you little expected me i dare say well sleep on i do not wish to disturb you but i was expecting you said i recovering myself as you may see by the fire and the kettle i will be with you in a moment putting on in haste the articles of dress which i had flung off i came out of the tent and addressing myself to isopel who was standing beside her cart i saidjust as i was about to retire to rest i thought it possible that you might come tonight and got everything in readiness for you now sit down by the fire whilst i lead the donkey and cart to the place where you stay i will unharness the animal and presently come and join you i need not trouble you said isopel i will go myself and see after my things we will go together said i and then return and have some tea isopel made no objection and in about halfanhour we had arranged everything at her quarters i then hastened and prepared tea presently isopel rejoined me bringing her stool she had divested herself of her bonnet and her hair fell over her shoulders she sat down and i poured out the beverage handing her a cup have you made a long journey tonight said i a very long one replied belle i have come nearly twenty miles since six oclock i believe i heard you coming in my sleep said i did the dogs above bark at you yes said isopel very violently did you think of me in your sleep no said i i was thinking of ursula and something she had told me when and where was that said isopel yesterday evening said i beneath the dingle hedge then you were talking with her beneath the hedge i was said i but only upon gypsy matters do you know belle that she has just been married to sylvester so you need not think that she and i she and you are quite at liberty to sit where you please said isopel however young man she continued dropping her tone which she had slightly raised i believe what you said that you were merely talking about gypsy matters and also what you were going to say if it was as i suppose that she and you had no particular acquaintance isopel was now silent for some time what are you thinking of said i i was thinking said belle how exceedingly kind it was of you to get everything in readiness for me though you did not know that i should come i had a presentiment that you would come said i but you forget that i have prepared the kettle for you before though it was true i was then certain that you would come i had not forgotten your doing so young man said belle but i was beginning to think that you were utterly selfish caring for nothing but the gratification of your own strange whims i am very fond of having my own way said i but utterly selfish i am not as i dare say i shall frequently prove to you you will often find the kettle boiling when you come home not heated by you said isopel with a sigh by whom else said i surely you are not thinking of driving me away you have as much right here as myself said isopel as i have told you before but i must be going myself well said i we can go together to tell you the truth i am rather tired of this place our paths must be separate said belle separate said i what do you mean i shant let you go alone i shall go with you and you know the road is as free to me as to you besides you cant think of parting company with me considering how much you would lose by doing so remember that you scarcely know anything of the armenian language now to learn armenian from me would take you twenty years belle faintly smiled come said i take another cup of tea belle took another cup of tea and yet another we had some indifferent conversation after which i arose and gave her donkey a considerable feed of corn belle thanked me shook me by the hand and then went to her own tabernacle and i returned to minechapter xxixvisit to the landlordhis mortifications hunter and his clanresolution on the following morning after breakfasting with belle who was silent and melancholy i left her in the dingle and took a stroll amongst the neighbouring lanes after some time i thought i would pay a visit to the landlord of the publichouse whom i had not seen since the day when he communicated to me his intention of changing his religion i therefore directed my steps to the house and on entering it found the landlord standing in the kitchen just then two meanlooking fellows who had been drinking at one of the tables and who appeared to be the only customers in the house got up brushed past the landlord and saying in a surly tone we shall pay you some time or other took their departure thats the way they serve me now said the landlord with a sigh do you know those fellows i demanded since you let them go away in your debt i know nothing about them said the landlord save that they are a couple of scamps then why did you let them go away without paying you said i i had not the heart to stop them said the landlord and to tell you the truth everybody serves me so now and i suppose they are right for a child could flog me nonsense said i behave more like a man and with respect to those two fellows run after them i will go with you and if they refuse to pay the reckoning i will help you to shake some money out of their clothes thank you said the landlord but as they are gone let them go on what they have drank is not of much consequence what is the matter with you said i staring at the landlord who appeared strangely altered his features were wild and haggard his formerly bluff cheeks were considerably sunken in and his figure had lost much of its plumpness have you changed your religion already and has the fellow in black commanded you to fast i have not changed my religion yet said the landlord with a kind of shudder i am to change it publicly this day fortnight and the idea of doing soi do not mind telling youpreys much upon my mind moreover the noise of the thing has got abroad and everybody is laughing at me and whats more coming and drinking my beer and going away without paying for it whilst i feel myself like one bewitched wishing but not daring to take my own part confound the fellow in black i wish i had never seen him yet what can i do without him the brewer swears that unless i pay him fifty pounds within a fortnight hell send a distress warrant into the house and take all i have my poor niece is crying in the room above and i am thinking of going into the stable and hanging myself and perhaps its the best thing i can do for its better to hang myself before selling my soul than afterwards as im sure i should like judas iscariot whom my poor niece who is somewhat religiously inclined has been talking to me about i wish i could assist you said i with money but that is quite out of my power however i can give you a piece of advice dont change your religion by any means you cant hope to prosper if you do and if the brewer chooses to deal hardly with you let him everybody would respect you ten times more provided you allowed yourself to be turned into the roads rather than change your religion than if you got fifty pounds for renouncing it i am half inclined to take your advice said the landlord only to tell you the truth i feel quite low without any heart in me come into the bar said i and let us have something togetheryou need not be afraid of my not paying for what i order we went into the barroom where the landlord and i discussed between us two bottles of strong ale which he said were part of the last six which he had in his possession at first he wished to drink sherry but i begged him to do no such thing telling him that the sherry would do him no good under the present circumstances nor indeed to the best of my belief under any it being of all wines the one for which i entertained the most contempt the landlord allowed himself to be dissuaded and after a glass or two of ale confessed that sherry was a sickly disagreeable drink and that he had merely been in the habit of taking it from an idea he had that it was genteel whilst quaffing our beverage he gave me an account of the various mortifications to which he had of late been subject dwelling with particular bitterness on the conduct of hunter who he said came every night and mouthed him and afterwards went away without paying for what he had drank or smoked in which conduct he was closely imitated by a clan of fellows who constantly attended him after spending several hours at the publichouse i departed not forgetting to pay for the two bottles of ale the landlord before i went shaking me by the hand declared that he had now made up his mind to stick to his religion at all hazards the more especially as he was convinced he should derive no good by giving it up chapter xxxpreparations for the fairthe last lesson the verb siriel it might be about five in the evening when i reached the gypsy encampment here i found mr petulengro tawno chikno sylvester and others in a great bustle clipping and trimming certain ponies and old horses which they had brought with them on inquiring of jasper the reason of their being so engaged he informed me that they were getting the horses ready for a fair which was to be held on the morrow at a place some miles distant at which they should endeavour to dispose of them addingperhaps brother you will go with us provided you have nothing better to do not having any particular engagement i assured him that i should have great pleasure in being of the party it was agreed that we should start early on the following morning thereupon i descended into the dingle belle was sitting before the fire at which the kettle was boiling were you waiting for me i inquired yes said belle i thought that you would come and i waited for you that was very kind said i not half so kind said she as it was of you to get everything ready for me in the dead of last night when there was scarcely a chance of my coming the teathings were brought forward and we sat down have you been far said belle merely to that publichouse said i to which you directed me on the second day of our acquaintance young men should not make a habit of visiting publichouses said belle they are bad places they may be so to some people said i but i do not think the worst publichouse in england could do me any harm perhaps you are so bad already said belle with a smile that it would be impossible to spoil you how dare you catch at my words said i come i will make you pay for doing soyou shall have this evening the longest lesson in armenian which i have yet inflicted upon you you may well say inflicted said belle but pray spare me i do not wish to hear anything about armenian especially this evening why this evening said i belle made no answer i will not spare you said i this evening i intend to make you conjugate an armenian verb well be it so said belle for this evening you shall command to command is hramahyel said i ram her ill indeed said belle i do not wish to begin with that no said i as we have come to the verbs we will begin regularly hramahyel is a verb of the second conjugation we will begin with the first first of all tell me said belle what a verb is a part of speech said i which according to the dictionary signifies some action or passion for example i command you or i hate you i have given you no cause to hate me said belle looking me sorrowfully in the face i was merely giving two examples said i and neither was directed at you in those examples to command and hate are verbs belle in armenian there are four conjugations of verbs the first end in al the second in yel the third in oul and the fourth in il now have you understood me i am afraid indeed it will all end ill said belle hold your tongue said i or you will make me lose my patience you have already made me nearly lose mine said belle let us have no unprofitable interruptions said i the conjugations of the armenian verbs are neither so numerous nor so difficult as the declensions of the nouns hear that and rejoice come we will begin with the verb hntal a verb of the first conjugation which signifies to rejoice come along hntam i rejoice hntas thou rejoicest why dont you follow belle i am sure i dont rejoice whatever you may do said belle the chief difficulty belle said i that i find in teaching you the armenian grammar proceeds from your applying to yourself and me every example i give rejoice in this instance is merely an example of an armenian verb of the first conjugation and has no more to do with your rejoicing than lal which is also a verb of the first conjugation and which signifies to weep would have to do with your weeping provided i made you conjugate it come along hntam i rejoice hntas thou rejoicest hntà he rejoices hntamk we rejoice now repeat those words i cant said belle they sound more like the language of horses than of human beings do you take me for for what said i belle was silent were you going to say mare said i mare mare bythebye do you know belle that mare in old english stands for woman and that when we call a female an evil mare the strict meaning of the term is merely bad woman so if i were to call you mare without prefixing bad you must not be offended but i should though said belle i was merely attempting to make you acquainted with a philological fact said i if mare which in old english and likewise in vulgar english signifies a woman sounds the same as mare which in modern and polite english signifies a female horse i cant help it there is no such confusion of sounds in armenian not at least in the same instance belle in armenian woman is ghin the same word bythebye as our queen whereas mare is madagh tzi which signifies a female horse and perhaps you will permit me to add that a hardmouthed jade is in armenian madagh tzi hsdierah i cant bear this much longer said belle keep yourself quiet said i i wish to be gentle with you and to convince you we will skip hntal and also for the present verbs of the first conjugation and proceed to the second belle i will now select for you to conjugate the prettiest verb in armenian not only of the second but also of all the four conjugations that verb is siriel here is the present tensesiriem siries sirè siriemk sirèk sirien you observe that it runs on just in the same manner as hntal save and except that e is substituted for a and it will be as well to tell you that almost the only difference between the second third and fourth conjugations and the first is the substituting in the present preterite and other tenses e or ou or i for a so you see that the armenian verbs are by no means difficult come on belle andsay siriem belle hesitated pray oblige me belle by saying siriem belle still appeared to hesitate you must admit belle that it is much softer than hntam it is so said belle and to oblige you i will say siriem very well indeed belle said i no vartabied or doctor could have pronounced it better and now to show you how verbs act upon pronouns in armenian i will say siriem zkiez please to repeat siriem zkiez siriem zkiez said belle that last word is very hard to say sorry that you think so belle said i now please to say siriá zis belle did so exceedingly well said i now say yerani thè sirèir zis yerani thè sirèir zis said belle capital said i you have now said i love you love meah would that you would love me and i have said all these things said belle yes said i you have said them in armenian i would have said them in no language that i understood said belle and it was very wrong of you to take advantage of my ignorance and make me say such things why so said i if you said them i said them too you did so said belle but i believe you were merely bantering and jeering as i told you before belle said i the chief difficulty which i find in teaching you armenian proceeds from your persisting in applying to yourself and me every example i give then you meant nothing after all said belle raising her voice let us proceed said i sirietsi i loved you never loved any one but yourself said belle and whats more sirietsits i will love said i sirietsies thou wilt love never one so thoroughly heartless said belle i tell you what belle you are becoming intolerable but we will change the verb or rather i will now proceed to tell you here that some of the armenian conjugations have their anomalies one species of these i wish to bring before your notice as old villotte saysfrom whose work i first contrived to pick up the rudiments of armenianest verborum transitivorum quorum infinitivus but i forgot you dont understand latin he says there are certain transitive verbs whose infinitive is in outsaniel the preterite in outsi the imperative in oue for exampleparghatsoutsaniem i irritate you do you do said belle and it will be better for both of us if you leave off doing so you would hardly believe belle said i that the armenian is in some respects closely connected with the irish but so it is for example that word parghatsoutsaniem is evidently derived from the same root as feargaim which in irish is as much as to say i vex you do indeed said belle sobbing but how do you account for it o man man said belle bursting into tears for what purpose do you ask a poor ignorant girl such a question unless it be to vex and irritate her if you wish to display your learning do so to the wise and instructed and not to me who can scarcely read or write oh leave off your nonsense yet i know you will not do so for it is the breath of your nostrils i could have wished we should have parted in kindness but you will not permit it i have deserved better at your hands than such treatment the whole time we have kept company together in this place i have scarcely had one kind word from you but the strangest and here the voice of belle was drowned in her sobs i am sorry to see you take on so dear belle said i i really have given you no cause to be so unhappy surely teaching you a little armenian was a very innocent kind of diversion yes but you went on so long and in such a strange way and made me repeat such strange examples as you call them that i could not bear it why to tell you the truth belle its my way and i have dealt with you just as i would with a hardmouthed jade said belle and you practising your horsewitchery upon her i have been of an unsubdued spirit i acknowledge but i was always kind to you and if you have made me cry its a poor thing to boast of boast of said i a pretty thing indeed to boast of i had no idea of making you cry come i beg your pardon what more can i do come cheer up belle you were talking of parting dont let us part but depart and that together our ways lie different said belle i dont see why they should said i come let us be off to america together to america together said belle looking full at me yes said i where we will settle down in some forest and conjugate the verb siriel conjugally conjugally said belle yes said i as man and wife in america air yew ghinyou are jesting as usual said belle not i indeed come belle make up your mind and let us be off to america and leave priests humbug learning and languages behind us i dont think you arc jesting said belle but i can hardly entertain your offers however young man i thank you you had better make up your mind at once said i and let us be off i shant make a bad husband i assure you perhaps you think i am not worthy of you to convince you belle that i am i am ready to try a fall with you this moment upon the grass brynhilda the valkyrie swore that no one should marry her who could not fling her down perhaps you have done the same the man who eventually married her got a friend of his who was called sigurd the serpentkiller to wrestle with her disguising him in his own armour sigurd flung her down and won her for his friend though he loved her himself i shall not use a similar deceit nor employ jasper petulengro to personate meso get up belle and i will do my best to fling you down i require no such thing of you or anybody said belle you are beginning to look rather wild i every now and then do said i come belle what do you say i will say nothing at present on the subject said belle i must have time to consider just as you please said i tomorrow i go to a fair with mr petulengro perhaps you will consider whilst i am away come belle let us have some more tea i wonder whether we shall be able to procure tea as good as this in the american forestchapter xxxithe dawn of daythe last farewell departure for the fairthe fine horsereturn to the dingleno isopel it was about the dawn of day when i was awakened by the voice of mr petulengro shouting from the top of the dingle and bidding me get up i arose instantly and dressed myself for the expedition to the fair on leaving my tent i was surprised to observe belle entirely dressed standing close to her own little encampment dear me said i i little expected to find you up so early i suppose jaspers call awakened you as it did me i merely lay down in my things said belle and have not slept during the night and why did you not take off your things and go to sleep said i i did not undress said belle because i wished to be in readiness to bid you farewell when you departed and as for sleeping i could not well god bless you said i taking belle by the hand belle made no answer and i observed that her hand was very cold what is the matter with you said i looking her in the face belle looked at me for a moment in the eyes and then cast down her ownher features were very pale you are really unwell said i i had better not go to the fair but stay here and take care of you no said belle pray go i am not unwell then go to your tent said i and do not endanger your health by standing abroad in the raw morning air god bless you belle i shall be home tonight by which time i expect you will have made up your mind if not another lesson in armenian however late the hour be i then wrung belles hand and ascended to the plain above i found the romany party waiting for me and everything in readiness for departing mr petulengro and tawno chikno were mounted on two old horses the rest who intended to go to the fair amongst whom were two or three women were on foot on arriving at the extremity of the plain i looked towards the dingle isopel berners stood at the mouth the beams of the early morning sun shone full on her noble face and figure i waved my hand towards her she slowly lifted up her right arm i turned away and never saw isopel berners again my companions and myself proceeded on our way in about two hours we reached the place where the fair was to be held after breakfasting on bread and cheese and ale behind a broken stone wall we drove our animals to the fair the fair was a common cattle and horse fair there was little merriment going on but there was no lack of business by about two oclock in the afternoon mr petulengro and his people had disposed of their animals at what they conceived very fair pricesthey were all in high spirits and jasper proposed to adjourn to a publichouse as we were proceeding to one a very fine horse led by a jockey made its appearance on the ground mr petulengro stopped short and looked at it steadfastly fino covar dove odoy sas miroa fine thing were that if it were but mine he exclaimed if you covet it said i why do you not purchase it we low gyptians never buy animals of that description if we did we could never sell them and most likely should be had up as horsestealers then why did you say just now it were a fine thing if it were but yours said i we gyptians always say so when we see anything that we admire an animal like that is not intended for a little hare like me but for some grand gentleman like yourself i say brother do you buy that horse how should i buy the horse you foolish person said i buy the horse brother said mr petulengro if you have not the money i can lend it you though i be of lower egypt you talk nonsense said i however i wish you would ask the man the price of it mr petulengro going up to the jockey inquired the price of the horsethe man looking at him scornfully made no reply young man said i going up to the jockey do me the favour to tell me the price of that horse as i suppose it is to sell the jockey who was a surlylooking man of about fifty looked at me for a moment then after some hesitation said laconically seventy thank you said i and turned away buy that horse said mr petulengro coming after me the dook tells me that in less than three months he will be sold for twice seventy i will have nothing to do with him said i besides jasper i dont like his tail did you observe what a mean scrubby tail he has what a fool you are brother said mr petulengro that very tail of his shows his breeding no good bred horse ever yet carried a fine tailtis your scrubbytailed horses that are your outandouters did you ever hear of syntax brother that tail of his puts me in mind of syntax well i say nothing more have your own wayall i wonder at is that a horse like him was ever brought to such a fair of dog cattle as this we then made the best of our way to a publichouse where we had some refreshment i then proposed returning to the encampment but mr petulengro declined and remained drinking with his companions till about six oclock in the evening when various jockeys from the fair come in after some conversation a jockey proposed a game of cards and in a little time mr petulengro and another gypsy sat down to play a game of cards with two of the jockeys though not much acquainted with cards i soon conceived a suspicion that the jockeys were cheating mr petulengro and his companion i therefore called mr petulengro aside and gave him a hint to that effect mr petulengro however instead of thanking me told me to mind my own bread and butter and forthwith returned to his game i continued watching the players for some hours the gypsies lost considerably and i saw clearly that the jockeys were cheating them most confoundedly i therefore once more called mr petulengro aside and told him that the jockeys were cheating him conjuring him to return to the encampment mr petulengro who was by this time somewhat the worse for liquor now fell into a passion swore several oaths and asking me who had made me a moses over him and his brethren told me to return to the encampment by myself incensed at the unworthy return which my wellmeant words had received iforthwith left the house and having purchased a few articles of provision i set out for the dingle alone it was dark night when i reached it and descending i saw the glimmer of a fire from the depths of the dingle my heart beat with fond anticipation of a welcome isopel berners is waiting for me said i and the first word that i shall hear from her lips is that she has made up her mind we shall go to america and be so happy together on reaching the bottom of the dingle however i saw seated near the fire beside which stood the kettle simmering not isopel berners but a gypsy girl who told me that miss berners when she went away had charged her to keep up the fire and have the kettle boiling against my arrival startled at these words i inquired at what hour isopel had left and whither she was gone and was told that she had left the dingle with her cart about two hours after i departed but where she was gone the girl did not know i then asked whether she had left no message and the girl replied that she had left none but had merely given directions about the kettle and fire putting at the same time sixpence into her hand very strange thought i then dismissing the gypsy girl i sat down by the fire i had no wish for tea but sat looking on the embers wondering what could be the motive of the sudden departure of isopel does she mean to return thought i to myself surely she means to return hope replied or she would not have gone away without leaving any messageand yet she could scarcely mean to return muttered foreboding or she would assuredly have left some message with the girl i then thought to myself what a hard thing it would be if after having made up my mind to assume the yoke of matrimony i should be disappointed of the woman of my choice well after all thought i i can scarcely be disappointed if such an ugly scoundrel as sylvester had no difficulty in getting such a nice wife as ursula surely i who am not a tenth part so ugly cannot fail to obtain the hand of isopel berners uncommonly fine damsel though she be husbands do not grow upon hedgerows she is merely gone after a little business and will return tomorrow comforted in some degree by these hopeful imaginings i retired to my tent and went to sleepchapter xxxiigloomy forebodingsthe postmans mother a valedictory letter from isopel with a lock of her hair the end of a chapter in the life of the romany ryeand of the book of isopel berners nothing occurred to me of any particular moment during the following day isopel berners did not return but mr petulengro and his companions came home from the fair early in the morning when i saw him which was about midday i found him with his face bruised and swelled it appeared that some time after i had left him he himself perceived that the jockeys with whom he was playing cards were cheating him and his companion a quarrel ensued which terminated in a fight between mr petulengro and one of the jockeys which lasted some time and in which mr petulengro though he eventually came off victor was considerably beaten his bruises in conjunction with his pecuniary loss which amounted to about seven pounds were the cause of his being much out of humour before night however he had returned to his usual philosophic frame of mind and coming up to me as i was walking about apologised for his behaviour on the preceding day and assured me that he was determined from that time forward never to quarrel with a friend for giving him good advice two more days passed and still isopel berners did not return gloomy thoughts and forebodings filled my mind during the day i wandered about the neighbouring roads in the hopes of catching an early glimpse of her and her returning vehicle and at night lay awake tossing about on my hard couch listening to the rustle of every leaf and occasionally thinking that i heard the sound of her wheels upon the distant road once at midnight just as i was about to fall into unconsciousness i suddenly started up for i was convinced that i heard the sound of wheels i listened most anxiously and the sound of wheels striking against stones was certainly plain enough she comes at last thought i and for a few moments i felt as if a mountain had been removed from my breasthere she comes at last now how shall i receive her oh thought i i will receive her rather coolly just as if i was not particularly anxious about herthats the way to manage these women the next moment the sound became very loud rather too loud i thought to proceed from her wheels and then by degrees became fainter rushing out of my tent i hurried up the path to the top of the dingle where i heard the sound distinctly enough but it was going from me and evidently proceeded from something much larger than the cart of isopel i could moreover hear the stamping of a horses hoofs at a lumbering trot those only whose hopes have been wrought up to a high pitch and then suddenly dashed down can imagine what i felt at that moment and yet when i returned to my lonely tent and lay down on my hard pallet the voice of conscience told me that the misery i was then undergoing i had fully merited from the unkind manner in which i had intended to receive her when for a brief moment i supposed that she had returned it was on the morning after this affair and the fourth if i forget not from the time of isopels departure that as i was seated on my stone at the bottom of the dingle getting my breakfast i heard an unknown voice from the path above apparently that of a person descendingexclaim heres a strange place to bring a letter to and presently an old woman with a belt round her middle to which was attached a leathern bag made her appearance and stood before me well if i ever said she as she looked about her my good gentlewoman said i pray what may you please to want gentlewoman said the old dame please to wantwell i call that speaking civilly at any rate it is true civil words cost nothing nevertheless we do not always get them what i please to want is to deliver a letter to a young man in this place perhaps you be he whats the name on the letter said i getting up and going to her there is no name upon it said she taking a letter out of her scrip and looking at it it is directed to the young man in mumpers dingle then it is for me i make no doubt said i stretching out my hand to take it please to pay me ninepence first said the old woman however said she after a moments thought civility is civility and being rather a scarce article should meet with some return heres the letter young man and i hope you will pay for it for if you do not i must pay the postage myself you are the postwoman i suppose said i as i took the letter i am the postmans mother said the old woman but as he has a wide beat i help him as much as i can and i generally carry letters to places like this to which he is afraid to come himself you say the postage is ninepence said i heres a shilling well i call that honourable said the old woman taking the shilling and putting it into her pocketheres your change young man said she offering me threepence pray keep that for yourself said i you deserve it for your trouble well i call that genteel said the old woman and as one good turn deserves another since you look as if you couldnt read i will read your letter for you lets see it its from some young woman or other i dare say thank you said i but i can read all the better for you said the old woman your being able to read will frequently save you a penny for thats the charge i generally make for reading letters though as you behaved so genteelly to me i should have charged you nothing well if you can read why dont you open the letter instead of keeping it hanging between your finger and thumb i am in no hurry to open it said i with a sigh the old woman looked at me for a momentwell young man said she there are some especially those who can readwho dont like to open their letters when anybody is by more especially when they come from young women well i wont intrude upon you but leave you alone with your letter i wish it may contain something pleasant god bless you and with these words she departedi sat down on my stone with my letter in my hand i knew perfectly well that it could have come from no other person than isopel berners but what did the letter contain i guessed tolerably well what its purport wasan eternal farewell yet i was afraid to open the letter lest my expectation should be confirmed there i sat with the letter putting off the evil moment as long as possible at length i glanced at the direction which was written in a fine bold hand and was directed as the old woman had said to the young man in mumpers dingle with the addition near in the county of suddenly the idea occurred to me that after all the letter might not contain an eternal farewell and that isopel might have written requesting me to join her could it be so alas no presently said foreboding at last i became ashamed of my weakness the letter must be opened sooner or later why not at once so as the bather who for a considerable time has stood shivering on the bank afraid to take the decisive plunge suddenly takes it i tore open the letter almost before i was aware i had no sooner done so than a paper fell out i examined it it contained a lock of bright flaxen hair this is no good sign said i as i thrust the lock and paper into my bosom and proceeded to read the letter which ran as follows to the young man in mumpers dingle siri send these lines with the hope and trust that they will find you well even as i am myself at this moment and in much better spirits for my own are not such as i could wish they were being sometimes rather hysterical and vapourish and at other times and most often very low i am at a seaport and am just going on shipboard and when you get these i shall be on the salt waters on my way to a distant country and leaving my own behind me which i do not expect ever to see again and now young man i will in the first place say something about the manner in which i quitted you it must have seemed somewhat singular to you that i went away without taking any leave or giving you the slightest hint that i was going but i did not do so without considerable reflection i was afraid that i should not be able to support a leavetaking and as you had said that you were determined to go wherever i did i thought it best not to tell you at all for i did not think it advisable that you should go with me and i wished to have no dispute in the second place i wish to say something about an offer of wedlock which you made me perhaps young man had you made it at the first period of our acquaintance i should have accepted it but you did not and kept putting off and putting off and behaving in a very grange manner till i could stand your conduct no longer but determined upon leaving you and old england which last step i had been long thinking about so when you made your offer at last everything was arrangedmy cart and donkey engaged to be soldand the greater part of my things disposed of however young man when you did make it i frankly tell you that i had half a mind to accept it at last however after very much consideration i thought it best to leave you for ever because for some time past i had become almost convinced that though with a wonderful deal of learning and exceedingly shrewd in some things you were pray dont be offendedat the root mad and though mad people i have been told sometimes make very good husbands i was unwilling that your friends if you had any should say that belle berners the workhouse girl took advantage of your infirmity for there is no concealing that i was born and bred up in a workhouse notwithstanding that my blood is better than your own and as good as the best you having yourself told me that my name is a noble name and once if i mistake not that it was the same word as baron which is the same thing as bear and that to be called in old times a bear was considered a great complimentthe bear being a mighty strong animal on which account our forefathers called all their great fightingmen barons which is the same as bears however setting matters of blood and family entirely aside many thanks to you young man from poor belle for the honour you did her in making that same offer for after all it is an honour to receive an honourable offer which she could see clearly yours was with no floriness nor chaff in it but on the contrary entire sincerity she assures you that she shall always bear it and yourself in mind whether on land or water and as a proof of the goodwill she bears to you she sends you a lock of the hair which she wears on her head which you were often looking at and were pleased to call flax which word she supposes you meant as a compliment even as the old people meant to pass a compliment to their great folks when they called them bears though she cannot help thinking that they might have found an animal as strong as a bear and somewhat less uncouth to call their great folks after even as she thinks yourself amongst your great store of words might have found something a little more genteel to call her hair after than flax which though strong and useful is rather a coarse and common kind of article and as another proof of the goodwill she bears to you she sends you along with the lock a piece of advice which is worth all the hair in the world to say nothing of the flax fear god and take your own part theres bible in that young man see how moses feared god and how he took his own part against everybody who meddled with him and see how david feared god and took his own part against all the bloody enemies which surrounded himso fear god young man and never give in the world can bully and is fond provided it sees a man in a kind of difficulty of getting about him calling him coarse names and even going so far as to hustle him but the world like all bullies carries a white feather in its tail and no sooner sees the man taking off his coat and offering to fight his best than it scatters here and there and is always civil to himafterwards so when folks are disposed to illtreat you young man say lord have mercy upon me and then tip them long melford to which as the saying goes there is nothing comparable for shortness all the world over and these last words young man are the last you will ever have from her who is nevertheless your affectionate female servant isopel berners after reading the letter i sat for some time motionless holding it in my hand the daydream in which i had been a little time before indulging of marrying isopel berners of going with her to america and having by her a large progeny who were to assist me in felling trees cultivating the soil and who would take care of me when i was old was now thoroughly dispelled isopel had deserted me and was gone to america by herself where perhaps she would marry some other person and would bear him a progeny who would do for him what in my dream i had hoped my progeny by her would do for me then the thought came into my head that though she was gone i might follow her to america but then i thought that if i did i might not find her america was a very large place and i did not know the port to which she was bound but i could follow her to the port from which she had sailed and there possibly discover the port to which she was bound but then i did not even know the port from which she had set out for isopel had not dated her letter from any place suddenly it occurred to me that the postmark on the letter would tell me from whence it came so i forthwith looked at the back of the letter and in the postmark read the name of a wellknown and not very distant seaport i then knew with tolerable certainty the port where she had embarked and i almost determined to follow her but i almost instantly determined to do no such thing isopel berners had abandoned me and i would not follow her perhaps whispered pride if i overtook her she would only despise me for running after her and it also told me pretty roundly that provided i ran after her whether i overtook her or not i should heartily despise myself so i determined not to follow isopel berners i took her lock of hair and looked at it then put it in her letter which i folded up and carefully stowed away resolved to keep both for ever but i determined not to follow her two or three times however during the day i wavered in my determination and was again and again almost tempted to follow her but every succeeding time the temptation was fainter in the evening i left the dingle and sat down with mr petulengro and his family by the door of his tent mr petulengro soon began talking of the letter which i had received in the morning is it not from miss berners brother said he i told him it was is she coming back brother never said i she is gone to america and has deserted me i always knew that you two were never destined for each other said he how did you know that i inquired the dook told me so brother you are born to be a great traveller well said i if i had gone with her to america as i was thinking of doing i should have been a great traveller you are to travel in another direction brother said he i wish you would tell me all about my future wanderings said i i cant brother said mr petulengro theres a power of clouds before my eye you are a poor seer after all said i and getting up i retired to my dingle and my tent where i betook myself to my bed and there knowing the worst and being no longer agitated by apprehension

good example cited by alfred russel wallace in the case of a flemish planter of ceram near amboyna named captain van der beck when quite a youth he had accompanied a government official who was sent to report on the trade and commerce of the mediterranean and had acquired the colloquial language of every place they stayed a few weeks at he had afterwards made voyages to st petersburg and to other parts of europe including a few weeks in london and had then come out to the east where he had been for some years trading and speculating in the various islands he now spoke dutch french malay and javanese all equally well english with a very slight accent but with perfect fluency and a most complete knowledge of idiom in which i often tried to puzzle him in vain german and italian were also quite familiar to him and his acquaintance with european languages included modern greek turkish russian and colloquial hebrew and latin as a test of his power i may mention that he had made a voyage to the outoftheway island of salibaboo and had stayed there trading a few weeks as i was collecting vocabularies he told me he thought he could remember some words and dictated a considerable number some time after i met with a short list of words taken down in those islands and in every case they agreed with those he had given me he used to sing a hebrew drinkingsong which he had learned from some jews with whom he had once travelled and astonished by joining in their conversation borrows colloquial gift was to all appearance closely allied to that of this polyglot fleming wallace the

the gipsies in his chapter on les careurs vidocq calls them a species characterised and depicted with so little truth by the first romancewriter of our time but borrow certainly had a far deeper reason for his dislike of scott under the specious pretence of deference for antiquity and respect for primitive models he imagined that scott was sapping the foundations of protestantism newman from the opposite camp saw only the beneficial effect of scotts influence in turning mens minds in the direction of the middle ages see his article in the british critic for april and apologia chap iii as

story of his concern at a dinnerparty upon a prospect of an altercation between borrow and whewell with both omniscience was a foible both were powerful men and both of them if report were true had

about them that is repulsive borrow it is true was ready enough to condone the offences of those who sought dupes among the welltodo public but he preferred the honester members of the vagrant class and it is plain that they reciprocated the preference for they regarded the romany rye with an almost superstitious reverence on account of his truth honour bright and fair speech borrow had a passion for depicting the class that hurtado de mendoza had first caught for literature in his lazarillo that namely of the old tricksters of the highway who still retained many traits noble and ignoble from the primeval savage for the characteristically mean and squalid one must go up higher in the scale of civilisation of all the reviews of lavengro extraordinary as many now appear it was left for the month of july in the year of grace to produce the most delightfully amazing we subjoin it verbatim from the catholic times of july th lavengro the scholar the gypsy the priest by george burrow with an introduction by theodore wattsdunton london ward lock and co ltd s we suppose the publishers find that this sort of literary rubbish suffused with antediluvian bigotry of the most benighted character pays otherwise no doubt they would not have issued it as a volume of their new minerva library it consists of a twaddling introduction by mr theodore wattsdunton who tells us he has been brought into personal relations with many men of genius and so on ad nauseam and of a sort of novel by mr burrow in a palpable imitation of the style of de foe without a spark of de foes ability the only thing for which this mr burrow is distinguished is his crass anticatholic bigotry and the terms in which in one part of the book at least he refers to the blessed virgin are an outrage not merely on the religious feelings of catholics but also on ordinary propriety catholics unless they deserve to be treated scornfully will take note of the fact that such a work as this has been issued by messrs ward and lock to get an idea of the semper eadem of catholic criticism the reader should compare with the above the dublin review for may in which the author of the bible in spain is described as a missionary sent out by a gang of conspirators against christianity who denominate themselves the bible society the popularity of lavengro has been rapidly on the increase during the past ten years if we may judge by the number of editions it was printed in the minerva series in and reprinted a version of large portions of the work by duclos appeared in macmillans published an edition in newnes in it was included in the oxford library an illustrated edition an edition produced under the supervision of dr knapp a miniature edition of dents and the reprint of the minerva edition already referred

only the appendix a delightful resumé of grievances brooded over in solitude cruelly stigmatised by professor knapp as certain posterior interpolations the ground base of the theme is the wickedness of popery and when argument gives out borrow is ready with all the boyish inconsequence of a charles kingsley to throw up his cap and shout go it our side down with the pope borrows personal appearance as we know from the later portrait by his most intimate friend dr thomas gordon hake must have been sufficiently striking at any period of his life his figure was tall and his bearing very noble he had a finely moulded head and thick white hairwhite from his youth his brown eyes were soft yet piercing his mouth had a generous curvehis nose was somewhat of the semitic type which gave his face the cast of a young memnon this is confirmed by the assurance in lavengro that a famous heroic painter was extremely anxious to secure don jorge as a model for the face and figure of pharaoh i am

the main characters in lavengro are three the scholar borrow himself the gypsy mr petulengro and the priest or popish propagandist this last is the man in black the wordmaster has in the course of his travels heard a good deal about this man and he is able to identify him almost at once by his predilection for gin and water cold with a lump of sugar in it he hears of him first from his london friend francis ardry then from an armenian merchant whom he met in london and then again from a brotherauthor who describes a silly and intrusive anglican parson calledplatitude as a puppet in the hands of the man in black the latter he characterises as a sharking priest who has come over from italy to proselytize and plunder he has some powers of conversation and some learning but he carries the countenance of an archvillain platitude is evidently his tool when borrow lavengro that is was in london his friend francis ardry warned him against a certain papistical propagandist a strange fellowa half italian half english priest he is fond of a glass of gin and waterand over a glass of gin and water cold with a lump of sugar in it he has been more communicative perhaps than was altogether prudent were i my own master i would kick him politics and religious movements to a considerable distance during his travels after his abandonment of grub street lavengro frequently came upon the traces of the man in black while sojourning for one night with a hospitable though superstitious acquaintance whom he met after leaving salisbury lavengro heard the story of the rev mr platitude a sacerdotalist of weak intellects who had been cajoled from his lawful allegiance to the good quiet church of england by the wiles of a sharking priest come over from italy to proselytize and to plunder from what he then heard of the sharking priest by putting two and two together lavengro was now able to identify him with the man in black subsequently he heard of the efforts of the same clever dialectician to overcome the methodist preacher peter williamsefforts which collapsed upon the appearance of the preachers wife winifred wife wife muttered the disconcerted priest if the fool has a wife he will never do for us in the course of his wanderings this nineteenthcentury s augustine often gave himself out to be a teacher of elocution the man in black was completely mystified by the knowledge of his own past life which this remark revealed see chap ix infra there were as have been seen a variety of threads connecting the man in black with definite scenes in the memory of lavengro though the latter did not happen to have seen the prowling priest in the flesh before this occasion while in london lavengro frequently met a certain armenian merchant who much resented the pretensions of the roman papa that he the papa had more to say in heaven than the armenian patriarch and that the hillocks of rome were higher than the ridges of ararat the papa of rome said the armenian to lavengro has at present many emissaries in this country in order to seduce the people from their own quiet religion to the savage heresy of rome this fellow describing the man in black came to me partly in the hope of converting me but principally to extort money for the purpose of furthering the designs of rome in this country i humoured the fellow at first keeping him in play for nearly a month deceiving and laughing at him at last he discovered that he could make nothing of me and departed with the scowl of caiaphas whilst i cried after him the roots of ararat are deeper than those of rome this same armenian subsequently offered lavengro a desk in his office opposite his deaf moldavian clerk having surmised that he would make an excellent merchant because he squinted like a true armenian unhappily for the flaming tinman and for isopel berners the wordmaster refused this singular offer a passado at belles avowed weakness for that beverage a a strange listens b up yonder the catholic controversy was just at its height in and the catholic emancipation bill received the royal assent in april the doctrine of economy in a nutshell for borrows final verdict on sir walter scott it is only fair to cite his romano lavolil a book on the english gypsy language corresponding to his book on the zincali or spanish gypsies but published more than forty years later namely in here he relates how he once trudged to dryburgh to pay my respects at the tomb of sir walter scott a man with whose principles i have no sympathy but for whose genius i have always entertained the most intense admiration the story of mumbo jumbo and the english servant in rome is that narrated at great length by the postillion in the last chapter of lavengro see the third appendix to romany rye

lavengro chaps v and liv the etymology is thus explained by borrow petulengro a compound of the modern greek πεταλον and the sanscrit kara the literal meaning being lord of the horseshoe ie maker it is one of the private cognominations of the smiths an english gypsy clan engro is apparently akin to the english suffix monger and with it may be compared the anglosaxon suffix smith in such words as loresmith or warsmith warrior thus we have sapengro lavengro and sherengro head man of the gypsy tribes in england borrow in his zincali ed introd has the following the principal gypsy tribes at present in existence are the stanleys whose grand haunt is the new forest the lovells who are fond of london and its vicinity the coopers who call windsor castle their home the hernes to whom the north country more especially yorkshire belongeth and lastly my brethren the smiths to whom east anglia appears to have been allotted from the beginning all these families have gypsy names which seem however to be little more than attempts at translation of the english ones thus the stanleys are called barengres which means stony fellows the coopers wardoengres or wheelwrights the lovells camomescres or amorous fellows the hernes german haaren balors hairs or hairy fellows while the smiths are called petulengres that is horseshoefellows or blacksmiths besides the abovenamed gypsy clans there are other smaller ones some of which do not comprise more than a dozen individuals children included for example the bosviles the browns the chilcotts the grays lees taylors and whites of these

spain see especially chap vii the gypsies says borrow arc almost entirely ignorant of the grand points of morality but on one point they are in general wiser than those who have had far better opportunities than such unfortunate outcasts of regulating their steps and distinguishing good from evil they know that chastity is a jewel of high price and that conjugal fidelity is capable of occasionally flinging a sunshine even over the dreary hours of a life passed in the contempt of almost all laws whether human or divine there is a word in the gypsy language to which those who speak it attach ideas of peculiar reverence far superior to that connected with the name of the supreme being the creator of themselves and the universe this word is lácha which with them is the corporeal chastity of the females we say corporeal chastity for no other do they hold in the slightest esteem it is lawful among them nay praiseworthy to be obscene in look gesture and discourse to be accessories to vice and to stand by and laugh at the worst abominations of the busné gorgios or gentiles provided their lácha ye trupos or corporeal chastity remains unblemished the gypsy child from her earliest years is told by her strange mother that a good calli need only dread one thing in this world and that is the loss of her lácha in comparison with which that of life is of little consequence as in such an event she will be provided for but what provision is there for a gypsy who has lost her lácha bear this in mind my child she will say and now eat this bread and go forth and

not known to bibliography but the incident is nevertheless probably drawn from borrows own career good the next time the compassionate wordmaster visited the landlord he found him a down pin no longer but the centre of an adulatory crowd the way in which he surmounted the sea of troubles that beset him is described with much humour in the romany rye chap xvii the main factors in his relief were strong ale taken by the advice of lavengro which leads to catchpole knocking down the radical hunter and winning back the admiration of the taproom a loan from the parson of willenhall who wished to save a muscular fellowprotestant from the clutches of the man in black the brewer now became very civil a coach was appointed to stop at the inn and in short catchpole is left by lavengro riding upon the summit of the wave of popularity and good fortune jacobus villotte his dictionarium latinoarmenium rome and this alas is the last glimpse we are to have of isopel berners a heroine whose like we shall scarce encounter again in the whole wide world of romance charles kingsley says of her indeed that she is far too good not to be true the likeness is undoubtedly a masterpiece yet though borrow has drawn the outline firmly he leaves much for the imagination to fill in languid indeed must be the imagination that can fail to be stimulated by borrows outline of his brynhilda cast in the mould of britannia queen however not of the waves but of the woodland poor yet noble and innocent of every mean ambition of gentility faithful valiant and proudas she stands pale and commanding in the sunshine at the dingles mouth in all her virginal dignity is she not a figure worthy to rank with the queens of beauty and romance with dido with a willow in her hand with the deeplyloving rebecca as with a calm and tender dignity she bids for ever adieu to the land of wilfred of ivanhoe after the receipt of this letter three nights elapsed and then the wordmaster himself left the dingle for the last time the third night he spent alone in his encampment in a very melancholy manner with little or no sleep thinking of isopel berners and in the morning when i quitted the place i shed several tears as i reflected that i should probably never again see the spot where i had passed so many hours in her company
