mainstay of literature today and the recognized creator of the modern genres of horror and mystery fiction spent much of his life chasing the public and literary acclaim he craved born to david and elizabeth poe young edgar knew hardship from an early age his father abandoned the family a year after edgars birth and his mother died of consumption one year later taken in but never legally adopted by john and frances allan edgar traveled with his new family to england in then continued on alone to study in irvine scotland for a short time afterward he studied in chelsea then a suburb of london until he returned to virginia in and in he enrolled in the newly founded university of virginia to study languages during his college years he became estranged from his foster father claiming that john allan didnt send him enough money to live on but the reality was that poe was losing the money on gambling in edgar enlisted in the us army at age eighteen claiming he was twentytwo years old it was during this time that he began publishing his poems including an early collection tamerlane and other poems printed under the byline a bostonian he attained the rank of sergeant major of artillery and expressed a desire to attend west point for officer training once accepted to the academy however he was dismissed for not attending classes and formations after the death of his brother henry in edgar decided to try making a living as an author he was the first wellknown american to make such an attempt but because of the lack of an international copyright law and the economic effects of the panic of he was often forced to ask for the monies owed him and compelled to seek other assistance after winning a literary prize for his story manuscript found in a bottle he was hired as the assistant editor of the southern literary messenger but he was fired several weeks later for repeated drunkenness this pattern of dissipation would haunt poe for the rest of his life after marrying his cousin virginia clemm in poe returned to the messenger where he worked for the next two years seeing its circulation rise to copies from his only fulllength novel the narrative of arthur gordon pym of nantucket was published in to wide review and acclaim although once again poe received little profit from his work the year after saw the publication of his first short story collection tales of the grotesque and arabesque which received mixed reviews and sold poorly he left the messenger and worked at burtons gentlemans magazine and grahams magazine before announcing that he would start his own literary publication the penn later to be titled the stylus tragically it never came to print virginia first showed signs of tuberculosis in and her gradual decline over the next five years caused edgar to drink even more heavily the one bright spot in this time was the publication in of one of his most famous works the raven which brought him widespread acclaim unfortunately he was paid only nine dollars for the poem itself shortly afterward the poes moved to a cottage in the fordham section of the bronx new york where virginia died in increasingly unstable edgar tried to secure a position in government unsuccessfully courted the poet sarah helen whitman and eventually returned to richmond virginia to rekindle a relationship with sarah royster a childhood sweetheart the circumstances surrounding poes death remain shrouded in mystery found on the streets of baltimore maryland delirious and dressed in clothes that werent his poe was taken to washington college hospital where he died on october it was reported that his last words were lord help my poor soul but this cannot be proven as all records surrounding his death have been lost edgar allan poes death has been attributed to various causes including delirium tremens heart disease epilepsy or meningeal inflammation he was buried in a baltimore cemetery where a mysterious figure has toasted poe on the anniversary of his birth since by leaving cognac and three roses at his headstone recognized primarily as a literary critic during his lifetime poes work became popular in europe after his death owing mainly to the translations of his stories and poems by charles baudelaire sir arthur conan doyle cited him as the creator of the mystery short story with his c auguste dupin stories saying where was the detective story until poe breathed the breath of life into it poes work also inspired later authors of science fiction and fantasy including jules verne and h g wells today he is recognized as a literary master who both created new genres and reinvigorated old ones with a unique combination of story and style about the mystery writers of americas edgar award in when the mystery writers of america was just being formed the founders of the organization decided to give an award for the best first american mystery novel as well as awards for the best and worst mystery reviews of the year initially they were going to call it the edmund wilson memorial award partly in revenge for wilson s disdain for the genre but calmer heads prevailed although it is unknown exactly who came up with the idea of naming the award for the father of the detective story it was an immediate success and the edgar was created the first edgar award was bestowed in on julian fast for his debut novel watchful at night and in the more than fifty years since the stylized ceramic bust of the great author has become one of the top prizes in the field of mystery fiction the award categories in addition to best first novel have been expanded over time to include best novel best short story best paperback original best young adult novel best juvenile novel best fact crime best criticalbiographical best play best television episode and best motion picture the edgar has been won by many noted authors in the field including stuart kaminsky michael connelly t jefferson parker jan burke lisa

harris dick francis ruth rendell lawrence block elmore leonard ken follett frederick forsyth harlan ellison and many many others about the illustrator harry clarke was a renowned stainedglass artist of the early twentieth century and several examples of his work still exist today most notably at the honan chapel in cork ireland it was during his education at dublin art school that he developed an interest in book illustration after winning the gold medal in the stainedglass category at the board of education national competition he traveled to london to find work as an illustrator his first commissionillustrating a trade and deluxe edition of fairy tales by hans christian andersencame from george harrap in for the next six years he worked at the same time on illustrating the edgar allan poe collection tales of mystery and imagination clarke used the techniques he learned from working in stained glass on his macabre illustrations of poes dark stories the resulting work poes dark vision brought to stunning life by clarkes detailed imagery created a sensation when the first edition was published in october other books that clarke illustrated include the years at the spring fairy tales by charles perrault goethes faust and selected poems of algernon charles swinburne he also created more than stainedglass windows one of which the baptism of st patrick was selected for exhibition at the louvre in paris unfortunately the unceasing grueling pace of his work perhaps along with the toxic chemicals used in the stainedglass process cut his life short in at the age of fortyone harry clarke died in switzerland while trying to recover from tuberculosis what poe hath wrought by michael connelly happy birthday edgar allan poe seems strange using that name and that word happy in the same sentence a tragic and morose figure in his short life poe is celebrated today two hundred years after his birth as the mad genius who started it all rolling in the genre of mystery fiction his influence in other genres and fields of entertainmentfrom poetry to music to filmis incalculable to put it simply edgar allan poes work has echoed loudly across two centuries and will undoubtedly echo for at least two more he walked across a field of pristine grass not a single blade broken today that path has been worn down to a deep trench that crosses the imagination of the whole world if you look at bestseller lists movie charts and television ratings they are simply dominated by the mystery genre and its many offshoots the tendrils of imagination behind these contemporary works can be traced all the way back to poe this collection is presented to you by the mystery writers of america since day one this organization has held edgar allan poe as its symbol of excellence the annual award bestowed by the mwa on the authors of books television shows and films of merit is a bust of edgar allan poe it is a caricature and what is most notable about it is that the figures head is oversized to the point of being as wide as his shoulders having the honor of guestediting this collection of stories and essays i now realize why edgars head is so big im not going to get analytical about poes life or work here i leave that to his disciples gathered here with his most notable works are the long and short thoughts of those who follow poethe writers who directly or not so directly have taken inspiration from him these are edgar winners bestselling authors and practitioners of the short story from stephen king who writes so eloquently of his connection to poe to sue grafton who lovingly grudgingly gives poe his due to the late edward hoch who penned over nine hundred seventyfive short stories these writers are the modern masters of the world poe created the idea here is simple this is a birthday party the twenty guests invited here by the mystery writers of america have come to honor edgar allan poe on his two hundredth birthday we celebrate his work and we celebrate all that his work has wrought i wonder what poe would think of this my guess is that it would give him a big head a descent into the maelström the ways of god in nature as in providence are not as our ways nor are the models that we frame any way commensurate to the vastness profundity and unsearchableness of his works which have a depth in them greater than the well of democritus joseph glanvill we had now reached the summit of the loftiest crag for some minutes the old man seemed too much exhausted to speak not long ago said he at length and i could have guided you on this route as well as the youngest of my sons but about three years past there happened to me an event such as never happened before to mortal manor at least such as no man ever survived to tell ofand the six hours of deadly terror which i then endured have broken me up body and soul you suppose me a very old manbut i am not it took less than a single day to change these hairs from a jetty black to white to weaken my limbs and to unstring my nerves so that i tremble at the least exertion and am frightened at a shadow do you know i can scarcely look over this little cliff without getting giddy the little cliff upon whose edge he had so carelessly thrown himself down to rest that the weightier portion of his body hung over it while he was only kept from falling by the tenure of his elbow on its extreme and slippery edgethis little cliff arose a sheer unobstructed precipice of black shining rock some fifteen or sixteen hundred feet from the world of crags beneath us nothing would have tempted me to be within half a dozen yards of its brink in truth so deeply was i excited by the perilous position of my companion that i fell at full length upon the ground clung to the shrubs around me and dared not even glance upward at the skywhile i struggled in vain to divest myself of the idea that the very foundations of the mountain were in danger from the fury of the winds it was long before i could reason myself into sufficient courage to sit up and look out into the distance you must get over these fancies said the guide for i have brought you here that you might have the best possible view of the scene of that event i mentionedand to tell you the whole story with the spot just under your eye we are now he continued in that particularizing manner which distinguished himwe are now close upon the norwegian coastin the sixtyeighth degree of latitudein the great province of nordlandand in the dreary district of lofoden the mountain upon whose top we sit is helseggen the cloudy now raise yourself up a little higherhold on to the grass if you feel giddysoand look out beyond the belt of vapor beneath us into the sea i looked dizzily and beheld a wide expanse of ocean whose waters wore so inky a hue as to bring at once to my mind the nubian geographers account of the mare tenebrarum a panorama more deplorably desolate no human imagination can conceive to the right and left as far as the eye could reach there lay outstretched like ramparts of the world lines of horridly black and beetling cliff whose character of gloom was but the more forcibly illustrated by the surf which reared high up against its white and ghastly crest howling and shrieking for ever just opposite the promontory upon whose apex we were placed and at a distance of some five or six miles out at sea there was visible a small bleaklooking island or more properly its position was discernible through the wilderness of surge in which it was enveloped about two miles nearer the land arose another of smaller size hideously craggy and barren and encompassed at various intervals by a cluster of dark rocks the appearance of the ocean in the space between the more distant island and the shore had something very unusual about it although at the time so strong a gale was blowing landward that a brig in the remote offing lay to under a doublereefed trysail and constantly plunged her whole hull out of sight still there was here nothing like a regular swell but only a short quick angry cross dashing of water in every directionas well in the teeth of the wind as otherwise of foam there was little except in the immediate vicinity of the rocks the island in the distance resumed the old man is called by the norwegians vurrgh the one midway is moskoe that a mile to the northward is ambaaren yonder are islesen hotholm keildhelm suarven and buckholm farther offbetween moskoe and vurrghare otterholm flimen sandflesen and stockholm these are the true names of the placesbut why it has been thought necessary to name them at all is more than either you or i can understand do you hear any thing do you see any change in the water we had now been about ten minutes upon the top of helseggen to which we had ascended from the interior of lofoden so that we had caught no glimpse of the sea until it had burst upon us from the summit as the old man spoke i became aware of a loud and gradually increasing sound like the moaning of a vast herd of buffaloes upon an american prairie and at the same moment i perceived that what seamen term the chopping character of the ocean beneath us was rapidly changing into a current which set to the eastward even while i gazed this current acquired a monstrous velocity each moment added to its speedto its headlong impetuosity in five minutes the whole sea as far as vurrgh was lashed into ungovernable fury but it was between moskoe and the coast that the main uproar held its sway here the vast bed of the waters seamed and scarred into a thousand conflicting channels burst suddenly into phrensied convulsionheaving boiling hissinggyrating in gigantic and innumerable vortices and all whirling and plunging on to the eastward with a rapidity which water never elsewhere assumes except in precipitous descents in a few minutes more there came over the scene another radical alteration the general surface grew somewhat more smooth and the whirlpools one by one disappeared while prodigious streaks of foam became apparent where none had been seen before these streaks at length spreading out to a great distance and entering into combination took unto themselves the gyratory motion of the subsided vortices and seemed to form the germ of another more vast suddenlyvery suddenlythis assumed a distinct and definite existence in a circle of more than a mile in diameter the edge of the whirl was represented by a broad belt of gleaming spray but no particle of this slipped into the mouth of the terrific funnel whose interior as far as the eye could fathom it was a smooth shining and jetblack wall of water inclined to the horizon at an angle of some fortyfive degrees speeding dizzily round and round with a swaying and sweltering motion and sending forth to the winds an appalling voice half shriek half roar such as not even the mighty cataract of niagara ever lifts up in its agony to heaven the mountain trembled to its very base and the rock rocked i threw myself upon my face and clung to the scant herbage in an excess of nervous agitation this said i at length to the old man this can be nothing else than the great whirlpool of the maelström so it is sometimes termed said he we norwegians call it the moskoeström from the island of moskoe in the midway the ordinary account of this vortex had by no means prepared me for what i saw that of jonas ramus which is perhaps the most circumstantial of any cannot impart the faintest conception either of the magnificence or of the horror of the sceneor of the wild bewildering sense of the novel which confounds the beholder i am not sure from what point of view the writer in question surveyed it nor at what time but it could neither have been from the summit of helseggen nor during a storm there are some passages of his description nevertheless which may be quoted for their details although their effect is exceedingly feeble in conveying an impression of the spectacle between lofoden and moskoe he says the depth of the water is between thirtysix and forty fathoms but on the other side toward ver vurrgh this depth decreases so as not to afford a convenient passage for a vessel without the risk of splitting on the rocks which happens even in the calmest weather when it is flood the stream runs up the country between lofoden and moskoe with a boisterous rapidity but the roar of its impetuous ebb to the sea is scarce equalled by the loudest and most dreadful cataracts the noise being heard several leagues off and the vortices or pits are of such an extent and depth that if a ship comes within its attraction it is inevitably absorbed and carried down to the bottom and there beat to pieces against the rocks and when the water relaxes the fragments thereof are thrown up again but these intervals of tranquility are only at the turn of the ebb and flood and in calm weather and last but a quarter of an hour its violence gradually returning when the stream is most boisterous and its fury heightened by a storm it is dangerous to come within a norway mile of it boats yachts and ships have been carried away by not guarding against it before they were within its reach it likewise happens frequently that whales come too near the stream and are overpowered by its violence and then it is impossible to describe their howlings and bellowings in their fruitless struggles to disengage themselves a bear once attempting to swim from lofoden to moskoe was caught by the stream and borne down while he roared terribly so as to be heard on shore large stocks of firs and pine trees after being absorbed by the current rise again broken and torn to such a degree as if bristles grew upon them this plainly shows the bottom to consist of craggy rocks among which they are whirled to and fro this stream is regulated by the flux and reflux of the seait being constantly high and low water every six hours in the year early in the morning of sexagesima sunday it raged with such noise and impetuosity that the very stones of the houses on the coast fell to the ground in regard to the depth of the water i could not see how this could have been ascertained at all in the immediate vicinity of the vortex the forty fathoms must have reference only to portions of the channel close upon the shore either of moskoe or lofoden the depth in the centre of the moskoeström must be unmeasurably greater and no better proof of this fact is necessary than can be obtained from even the sidelong glance into the abyss of the whirl which may be had from the highest crag of helseggen looking down from this pinnacle upon the howling phlegethon below i could not help smiling at the simplicity with which the honest jonas ramus records as a matter difficult of belief the anecdotes of the whales and the bears for it appeared to me in fact a selfevident thing that the largest ship of the line in existence coming within the influence of that deadly attraction could resist it as little as a feather the hurricane and must disappear bodily and at once the attempts to account for the phenomenonsome of which i remember seemed to me sufficiently plausible in perusalnow wore a very different and unsatisfactory aspect the idea generally received is that this as well as three smaller vortices among the ferroe islands have no other cause than the collision of waves rising and falling at flux and reflux against a ridge of rocks and shelves which confines the water so that it precipitates itself like a cataract and thus the higher the flood rises the deeper must the fall be and the natural result of all is a whirlpool or vortex the prodigious suction of which is sufficiently known by lesser experimentsthese are the words of the encyclopaedia britannica kircher and others imagine that in the centre of the channel of the maelström is an abyss penetrating the globe and issuing in some very remote partthe gulf of bothnia being somewhat decidedly named in one instance this opinion idle in itself was the one to which as i gazed my imagination most readily assented and mentioning it to the guide i was rather surprised to hear him say that although it was the view almost universally entertained of the subject by the norwegians it nevertheless was not his own as to the former notion he confessed his inability to comprehend it and here i agreed with himfor however conclusive on paper it becomes altogether unintelligible and even absurd amid the thunder of the abyss you have had a good look at the whirl now said the old man and if you will creep round this crag so as to get in its lee and deaden the roar of the water i will tell you a story that will convince you i ought to know something of the moskoeström i placed myself as desired and he proceeded myself and my two brothers once owned a schoonerrigged smack of about seventy tons burthen with which we were in the habit of fishing among the islands beyond moskoe nearly to vurrgh in all violent eddies at sea there is good fishing at proper opportunities if one has only the courage to attempt it but among the whole of the lofoden coastmen we three were the only ones who made a regular business of going out to the islands as i tell you the usual grounds are a great way lower down to the southward there fish can be got at all hours without much risk and therefore these places are preferred the choice spots over here among the rocks however not only yield the finest variety but in far greater abundance so that we often got in a single day what the more timid of the craft could not scrape together in a week in fact we made it a matter of desperate speculationthe risk of life standing instead of labor and courage answering for capital we kept the smack in a cove about five miles higher up the coast than this and it was our practice in fine weather to take advantage of the fifteen minutes slack to push across the main channel of the moskoeström far above the pool and then drop down upon anchorage somewhere near otterholm or sandflesen where the eddies are not so violent as elsewhere here we used to remain until nearly time for slackwater again when we weighed and made for home we never set out upon this expedition without a steady side wind for going and comingone that we felt sure would not fail us before our returnand we seldom made a miscalculation upon this point twice during six years we were forced to stay all night at anchor on account of a dead calm which is a rare thing indeed just about here and once we had to remain on the grounds nearly a week starving to death owing to a gale which blew up shortly after our arrival and made the channel too boisterous to be thought of upon this occasion we should have been driven out to sea in spite of everything for the whirlpools threw us round and round so violently that at length we fouled our anchor and dragged it if it had not been that we drifted into one of the innumerable cross currentshere today and gone tomorrowwhich drove us under the lee of flimen where by good luck we brought up i could not tell you the twentieth part of the difficulties we encountered on the groundsit is a bad spot to be in even in good weatherbut we make shift always to run the gauntlet of the moskoeström itself without accident although at times my heart has been in my mouth when we happened to be a minute or so behind or before the slack the wind sometimes was not as strong as we thought it at starting and then we made rather less way than we could wish while the current rendered the smack unmanageable my eldest brother had a son eighteen years old and i had two stout boys of my own these would have been of great assistance at such times in using the sweeps as well as afterward in fishingbut somehow although we ran the risk ourselves we had not the heart to let the young ones get into the dangerfor after all is said and done it was a horrible danger and that is the truth it is now within a few days of three years since what i am going to tell you occurred it was on the tenth day of july a day which the people of this part of the world will never forgetfor it was one in which blew the most terrible hurricane that ever came out of the heavens and yet all the morning and indeed until late in the afternoon there was a gentle and steady breeze from the southwest while the sun shone brightly so that the oldest seaman among us could not have foreseen what was to follow the three of usmy two brothers and myselfhad crossed over to the islands about two oclock p m and soon nearly loaded the smack with fine fish which we all remarked were more plenty that day than we had ever known them it was just seven by my watch when we weighed and started for home so as to make the worst of the ström at slack water which we knew would be at eight we set out with a fresh wind on our starboard quarter and for some time spanked along at a great rate never dreaming of danger for indeed we saw not the slightest reason to apprehend it all at once we were taken aback by a breeze from over helseggen this was most unusualsomething that had never happened to us beforeand i began to feel a little uneasy without exactly knowing why we put the boat on the wind but could make no headway at all for the eddies and i was upon the point of proposing to return to the anchorage when looking astern we saw the whole horizon covered with a singular coppercolored cloud that rose with the most amazing velocity in the meantime the breeze that had headed us off fell away and we were dead becalmed drifting about in every direction this state of things however did not last long enough to give us time to think about it in less than a minute the storm was upon usin less than two the sky was entirely overcastand what with this and the driving spray it became suddenly so dark that we could not see each other in the smack such a hurricane as then blew it is folly to attempt describing the oldest seaman in norway never experienced any thing like it we had let our sails go by the run before it cleverly took us but at the first puff both our masts went by the board as if they had been sawed offthe mainmast taking with it my youngest brother who had lashed himself to it for safety our boat was the lightest feather of a thing that ever sat upon water it had a complete flush deck with only a small hatch near the bow and this hatch it had always been our custom to batten down when about to cross the ström by way of precaution against the chopping seas but for this circumstance we should have foundered at oncefor we lay entirely buried for some moments how my elder brother escaped destruction i cannot say for i never had an opportunity of ascertaining for my part as soon as i had let the foresail run i threw myself flat on deck with my feet against the narrow gunwale of the bow and with my hands grasping a ringbolt near the foot of the foremast it was mere instinct that prompted me to do thiswhich was undoubtedly the very best thing i could have donefor i was too much flurried to think for some moments we were completely deluged as i say and all this time i held my breath and clung to the bolt when i could stand it no longer i raised myself upon my knees still keeping hold with my hands and thus got my head clear presently our little boat gave herself a shake just as a dog does in coming out of the water and thus rid herself in some measure of the seas i was now trying to get the better of the stupor that had come over me and to collect my senses so as to see what was to be done when i felt somebody grasp my arm it was my elder brother and my heart leaped for joy for i had made sure that he was overboardbut the next moment all this joy was turned into horrorfor he put his mouth close to my ear and screamed out the word moskoeström no one ever will know what my feelings were at that moment i shook from head to foot as if i had had the most violent fit of the ague i knew what he meant by that one word well enoughi knew what he wished to make me understand with the wind that now drove us on we were bound for the whirl of the ström and nothing could save us you perceive that in crossing the ström channel we always went a long way up above the whirl even in the calmest weather and then had to wait and watch carefully for the slackbut now we were driving right upon the pool itself and in such a hurricane as this to be sure i thought we shall get there just about the slackthere is some little hope in thatbut in the next moment i cursed myself for being so great a fool as to dream of hope at all i knew very well that we were doomed had we been ten times a ninetygun ship by this time the first fury of the tempest had spent itself or perhaps we did not feel it so much as we scudded before it but at all events the seas which at first had been kept down by the wind and lay flat and frothing now got up into absolute mountains a singular change too had come over the heavens around in every direction it was still as black as pitch but nearly overhead there burst out all at once a circular rift of clear skyas clear as i ever sawand of a deep bright blueand through it there blazed forth the full moon with a lustre that i never before knew her to wear she lit up every thing about us with the greatest distinctnessbut oh god what a scene it was to light up i now made one or two attempts to speak to my brotherbut in some manner which i could not understand the din had so increased that i could not make him hear a single word although i screamed at the top of my voice in his ear presently he shook his head looking as pale as death and held up one of his fingers as if to say listen at first i could not make out what he meantbut soon a hideous thought flashed upon me i dragged my watch from its fob it was not going i glanced at its face by the moonlight and then burst into tears as i flung it far away into the ocean it had run down at seven oclock we were behind the time of the slack and the whirl of the ström was in full fury when a boat is well built properly trimmed and not deep laden the waves in a strong gale when she is going large seem always to slip from beneath herwhich appears very strange to a landsman and this is what is called riding in sea phrase well so far we had ridden the swells very cleverly but presently a gigantic sea happened to take us right under the counter and bore us with it as it roseupupas if into the sky i would not have believed that any wave could rise so high and then down we came with a sweep a slide and a plunge that made me feel sick and dizzy as if i was falling from some lofty mountaintop in a dream but while we were up i had thrown a quick glance aroundand that one glance was allsufficient i saw our exact position in an instant the moskoeström whirlpool was about a quarter of a mile dead aheadbut no more like the everyday moskoeström than the whirl as you now see it is like a millrace if i had not known where we were and what we had to expect i should not have recognized the place at all as it was i involuntarily closed my eyes in horror the lids clenched themselves together as if in a spasm it could not have been more than two minutes afterwards until we suddenly felt the waves subside and were enveloped in foam the boat made a sharp half turn to larboard and then shot off in its new direction like a thunderbolt at the same moment the roaring noise of the water was completely drowned in a kind of shrill shriek such a sound as you might imagine given out by the wastepipes of many thousand steamvessels letting off their steam all together we were now in the belt of surf that always surrounds the whirl and i thought of course that another moment would plunge us into the abyss down which we could only see indistinctly on account of the amazing velocity with which we were borne along the boat did not seem to sink into the water at all but to skim like an airbubble upon the surface of the surge her starboard side was next the whirl and on the larboard arose the world of ocean we had left it stood like a huge writhing wall between us and the horizon it may appear strange but now when we were in the very jaws of the gulf i felt more composed than when we were only approaching it having made up my mind to hope no more i got rid of a great deal of that terror which unmanned me at first i suppose it was despair that strung my nerves it may look like boastingbut what i tell you is truthi began to reflect how magnificent a thing it was to die in such a manner and how foolish it was in me to think of so paltry a consideration as my own individual life in view of so wonderful a manifestation of gods power i do believe that i blushed with shame when this idea crossed my mind after a little while i became possessed with the keenest curiosity about the whirl itself i positively felt a wish to explore its depths even at the sacrifice i was going to make and my principal grief was that i should never be able to tell my old companions on shore about the mysteries i should see these no doubt were singular fancies to occupy a mans mind in such extremityand i have often thought since that the revolutions of the boat around the pool might have rendered me a little lightheaded there was another circumstance which tended to restore my selfpossession and this was the cessation of the wind which could not reach us in our present situationfor as you saw yourself the belt of surf is considerably lower than the general bed of the ocean and this latter now towered above us a high black mountainous ridge if you have never been at sea in a heavy gale you can form no idea of the confusion of mind occasioned by the wind and spray together they blind deafen and strangle you and take away all power of action or reflection but we were now in a great measure rid of these annoyancesjust as deathcondemned felons in prison are allowed petty indulgences forbidden them while their doom is yet uncertain how often we made the circuit of the belt it is impossible to say we careered round and round for perhaps an hour flying rather than floating getting gradually more and more into the middle of the surge and then nearer and nearer to its horrible inner edge all this time i had never let go of the ringbolt my brother was at the stern holding on to a small empty watercask which had been securely lashed under the coop of the counter and was the only thing on deck that had not been swept overboard when the gale first took us as we approached the brink of the pit he let go his hold upon this and made for the ring from which in the agony of his terror he endeavored to force my hands as it was not large enough to afford us both a secure grasp i never felt deeper grief than when i saw him attempt this actalthough i knew he was a madman when he did ita raving maniac through sheer fright i did not care however to contest the point with him i knew it could make no difference whether either of us held on at all so i let him have the bolt and went astern to the cask this there was no great difficulty in doing for the smack flew round steadily enough and upon an even keelonly swaying to and fro with the immense sweeps and swelters of the whirl scarcely had i secured myself in my new position when we gave a wild lurch to starboard and rushed headlong into the abyss i muttered a hurried prayer to god and thought all was over as i felt the sickening sweep of the descent i had instinctively tightened my hold upon the barrel and closed my eyes for some seconds i dared not open themwhile i expected instant destruction and wondered that i was not already in my deathstruggles with the water but moment after moment elapsed i still lived the sense of falling had ceased and the motion of the vessel seemed much as it had been before while in the belt of foam with the exception that she now lay more along i took courage and looked once again upon the scene never shall i forget the sensations of awe horror and admiration with which i gazed about me the boat appeared to be hanging as if by magic midway down upon the interior surface of a funnel vast in circumference prodigious in depth and whose perfectly smooth sides might have been mistaken for ebony but for the bewildering rapidity with which they spun around and for the gleaming and ghastly radiance they shot forth as the rays of the full moon from that circular rift amid the clouds which i have already described streamed in a flood of golden glory along the black walls and far away down into the inmost recesses of the abyss at first i was too much confused to observe anything accurately the general burst of terrific grandeur was all that i beheld when i recovered myself a little however my gaze fell instinctively downward in this direction i was able to obtain an unobstructed view from the manner in which the smack hung on the inclined surface of the pool she was quite upon an even keelthat is to say her deck lay in a plane parallel with that of the waterbut this latter sloped at an angle of more than fortyfive degrees so that we seemed to be lying upon our beamends i could not help observing nevertheless that i had scarcely more difficulty in maintaining my hold and footing in this situation than if we had been upon a dead level and this i suppose was owing to the speed at which we revolved the rays of the moon seemed to search the very bottom of the profound gulf but still i could make out nothing distinctly on account of a thick mist in which everything there was enveloped and over which there hung a magnificent rainbow like that narrow and tottering bridge which mussulmen say is the only pathway between time and eternity this mist or spray was no doubt occasioned by the clashing of the great walls of the funnel as they all met together at the bottombut the yell that went up to the heavens from out of that mist i dare not attempt to describe our first slide into the abyss itself from the belt of foam above had carried us a great distance down the slope but our farther descent was by no means proportionate round and round we swept not with any uniform movementbut in dizzying swings and jerks that sent us sometimes only a few hundred yardssometimes nearly the complete circuit of the whirl our progress downward at each revolution was slow but very perceptible looking about me upon the wide waste of liquid ebony on which we were thus borne i perceived that our boat was not the only object in the embrace of the whirl both above and below us were visible fragments of vessels large masses of buildingtimber and trunks of trees with many smaller articles such as pieces of house furniture broken boxes barrels and staves i have already described the unnatural curiosity which had taken the place of my original terrors it appeared to grow upon me as i drew nearer and nearer to my dreadful doom i now began to watch with a strange interest the numerous things that floated in our company i must have been delirious for i even sought amusement in speculating upon the relative velocities of their several descents toward the foam below this fir tree i found myself at one time saying will certainly be the next thing that takes the awful plunge and disappearsand then i was disappointed to find that the wreck of a dutch merchant ship overtook it and went down before at length after making several guesses of this nature and being deceived in allthis factthe fact of my invariable miscalculation set me upon a train of reflection that made my limbs again tremble and my heart beat heavily once more it was not a new terror that thus affected me but the dawn of a more exciting hope this hope arose partly from memory and partly from present observation i called to mind the great variety of buoyant matter that strewed the coast of lofoden having been absorbed and then thrown forth by the moskoeström by far the greater number of the articles were shattered in the most extraordinary wayso chafed and roughened as to have the appearance of being stuck full of splintersbut then i distinctly recollected that there were some of them which were not disfigured at all now i could not account for this difference except by supposing that the roughened fragments were the only ones which had been completely absorbedthat the others had entered the whirl at so late a period of the tide or from some reason had descended so slowly after entering that they did not reach the bottom before the turn of the flood came or of the ebb as the case might be i conceived it possible in either instance that they might thus be whirled up again to the level of the ocean without undergoing the fate of those which had been drawn in more early or absorbed more rapidly i made also three important observations the first was that as a general rule the larger the bodies were the more rapid their descentthe second that between two masses of equal extent the one spherical and the other of any other shape the superiority in speed of descent was with the spherethe third that between two masses of equal size the one cylindrical and the other of any other shape the cylinder was absorbed the more slowly since my escape i have had several conversations on this subject with an old schoolmaster of the district and it was from him that i learned the use of the words cylinder and sphere he explained to mealthough i have forgotten the explanationhow what i observed was in fact the natural consequence of the forms of the floating fragmentsand showed me how it happened that a cylinder swimming in a vortex offered more resistance to its suction and was drawn in with greater difficulty than an equally bulky body of any form whatever there was one startling circumstance which went a great way in enforcing these observations and rendering me anxious to turn them to account and this was that at every revolution we passed something like a barrel or else the yard or the mast of a vessel while many of these things which had been on our level when i first opened my eyes upon the wonders of the whirlpool were now high up above us and seemed to have moved but little from their original station i no longer hesitated what to do i resolved to lash myself securely to the watercask upon which i now held to cut it loose from the counter and to throw myself with it into the water i attracted my brothers attention by signs pointed to the floating barrels that came near us and did every thing in my power to make him understand what i was about to do i thought at length that he comprehended my designbut whether this was the case or not he shook his head despairingly and refused to move from his station by the ringbolt it was impossible to reach him the emergency admitted of no delay and so with a bitter struggle i resigned him to his fate fastened myself to the cask by means of the lashings which secured it to the counter and precipitated myself with it into the sea without another moments hesitation the result was precisely what i had hoped it might be as it is myself who now tell you this taleas you see that i did escapeand as you are already in possession of the mode in which this escape was effected and must therefore anticipate all that i have farther to sayi will bring my story quickly to conclusion it might have been an hour or thereabout after my quitting the smack when having descended to a vast distance beneath me it made three or four wild gyrations in rapid succession and bearing my loved brother with it plunged headlong at once and forever into the chaos of foam below the barrel to which i was attached sunk very little farther than half the distance between the bottom of the gulf and the spot at which i leaped overboard before a great change took place in the character of the whirlpool the slope of the sides of the vast funnel became momently less and less steep the gyrations of the whirl grew gradually less and less violent by degrees the froth and the rainbow disappeared and the bottom of the gulf seemed slowly to uprise the sky was clear the winds had gone down and the full moon was setting radiantly in the west when i found myself on the surface of the ocean in full view of the shores of lofoden and above the spot where the pool of the moskoeström had been it was the hour of the slackbut the sea still heaved in mountainous waves from the effects of the hurricane i was borne violently into the channel of the ström and in a few minutes was hurried down the coast into the grounds of the fishermen a boat picked me upexhausted from fatigueand now that the danger was removed speechless from the memory of its horror those who drew me on board were my old mates and daily companionsbut they knew me no more than they would have known a traveller from the spiritland my hair which had been ravenblack the day before was as white as you see it now they say too that the whole expression of my countenance had changed i told them my storythey did not believe it i now tell it to youand i can scarcely expect you to put more faith in it than did the merry fishermen of lofoden on edgar allan poe by t jefferson parker picture my suburban living room in orange county california an orange carpet pale turquoise walls white naugahyde furniture white acoustic ceiling a rabbiteared blackandwhite tv and a walltowall bookshelf six feet high and stuffed with books the bookcase was filled mostly with nonfictionhistory and politics and outdoors adventure and travel but we had robert louis stevenson and we had jack london and we had edgar allan poe mom why do we have poe i asked her as a sixthgrader he understood the guilty conscience read the telltale heart and youll see what i mean so one evening a school night after my homework was done and my halfhour on the tv was over i turned on the reading lamp and settled into the white naugahyde recliner and opened complete stories of edgar allan poe i read the telltale heart and saw that mom was right i suspected that mr poe also understood some things about insanity and murderhow else could he write in the voice of a madman who remembers to use a tub to catch the blood and gore when he cuts off the head and the arms and the legs of the old man he has murdered and places the parts beneath the floorboards i was intrigued i was exploring a foreign mind i was transfixed the next night i read the black cat and the night after that the cask of amontillado where i was confronted with what i still think is the best opening line ive ever read the thousand injuries of fortunato i had borne as i best could but when he ventured upon insult i vowed revenge i read all of those stories over the next six months some i loved and some unsettled me and some went far over my young head but i took them all into my young heart what they taught me was this there is darkness in the hearts of men there are consequences of that darkness those consequences will crash down upon us here in this life they taught me that words can be beautiful and mysterious and full of truth these are the things i learned from poe as i sat in the white recliner in my orange county living room as a twelveyearold and these are the things i write about today that volume sits beside me now there are still small red dots beside the stories i read that first month ligeia a descent into the maelström the masque of the red death when i open it i can see that room of forty years ago and i can remember my rising sense of foreboding and excitement when i read the first line of the fall of the house of usher i still read those stories i still love them and they still unsettle me and some of them still go over my nolongeryoung head t jefferson parker was born in la and grew up in orange

have received two edgar awards for best mystery he is also the proud owner of a brick salvaged from edgar allan poes last new york apartment which occupies a place of honor on the parker family room hearth the cask of amontillado the thousand injuries of fortunato i had borne as i best could but when he ventured upon insult i vowed revenge you who so well know the nature of my soul will not suppose however that i gave utterance to a threat at length i would be avenged this was a point definitively settledbut the very definitiveness with which it was resolved precluded the idea of risk i must not only punish but punish with impunity a wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser it is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong it must be understood that neither by word nor deed had i given fortunato cause to doubt my goodwill i continued as was my wont to smile in his face and he did not perceive that my smile now was at the thought of his immolation he had a weak pointthis fortunatoalthough in other regards he was a man to be respected and even feared he prided himself on his connoisseurship in wine few italians have the true virtuoso spirit for the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and opportunityto practise imposture upon the british and austrian millionaires in painting and gemmary fortunato like his countrymen was a quackbut in the matter of old wines he was sincere in this respect i did not differ from him materially i was skilful in the italian vintages myself and bought largely whenever i could it was about dusk one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival season that i encountered my friend he accosted me with excessive warmth for he had been drinking much the man wore motley he had on a tightfitting partistriped dress and his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells i was so pleased to see him that i thought i should never have done wringing his hand i said to him my dear fortunato you are luckily met how remarkably well you are looking today but i have received a pipe of what passes for amontillado and i have my doubts how said he amontillado a pipe impossible and in the middle of the carnival i have my doubts i replied and i was silly enough to pay the full amontillado price without consulting you in the matter you were not to be found and i was fearful of losing a bargain amontillado i have my doubts amontillado and i must satisfy them amontillado as you are engaged i am on my way to luchesi if any one has a critical turn it is he he will tell me luchesi cannot tell amontillado from sherry and yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for your own come let us go whither to your vaults my friend no i will not impose upon your good nature i perceive you have an engagement luchesi i have no engagement come my friend no it is not the engagement but the severe cold with which i perceive you are afflicted the vaults are insufferably damp they are encrusted with nitre let us go nevertheless the cold is merely nothing amontillado you have been imposed upon and as for luchesi he cannot distinguish sherry from amontillado thus speaking fortunato possessed himself of my arm putting on a mask of black silk and drawing a roquelaire closely about my person i suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo there were no attendants at home they had absconded to make merry in honor of the time i had told them that i should not return until the morning and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house these orders were sufficient i well knew to insure their immediate disappearance one and all as soon as my back was turned i took from their sconces two flambeaux and giving one to fortunato bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into the vaults i passed down a long and winding staircase requesting him to be cautious as he followed we came at length to the foot of the descent and stood together on the damp ground of the catacombs of the montresors the gait of my friend was unsteady and the bells upon his cap jingled as he strode the pipe said he it is farther on said i but observe the white webwork which gleams from these cavern walls he turned toward me and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs that distilled the rheum of intoxication nitre he asked at length nitre i replied how long have you had that cough ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh my poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes it is nothing he said at last come i said with decision we will go back your health is precious you are rich respected admired beloved you are happy as once i was you are a man to be missed for me it is no matter we will go back you will be ill and i cannot be responsible besides there is luchesi enough he said the cough is a mere nothing it will not kill me i shall not die of a cough truetrue i replied and indeed i had no intention of alarming you unnecessarily but you should use all proper caution a draught of this medoc will defend us from the damps here i knocked off the neck of a bottle which i drew from a long row of its fellows that lay upon the mould drink i said presenting him the wine he raised it to his lips with a leer he paused and nodded to me familiarly while his bells jingled i drink he said to the buried that repose around us and i to your long life he again took my arm and we proceeded these vaults he said are extensive the montresors i replied were a great and numerous family i forget your arms a huge human foot dor in a field azure the foot crushes a serpent rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel and the motto nemo me impune lacessit good he said the wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled my own fancy grew warm with the medoc we had passed through walls of piled bones with casks and puncheons intermingling into the inmost recesses of the catacombs i paused again and this time i made bold to seize fortunato by an arm above the elbow the nitre i said see it increases it hangs like moss upon the vaults we are below the rivers bed the drops of moisture trickle among the bones come we will go back ere it is too late your cough it is nothing he said let us go on but first another draught of the medoc i broke and reached him a flagon of de grâve he emptied it at a breath his eyes flashed with a fierce light he laughed and threw the bottle upwards with a gesticulation i did not understand i looked at him in surprise he repeated the movementa grotesque one you do not comprehend he said not i i replied then you are not of the brotherhood how you are not of the masons yes yes i said yes yes you impossible a mason a mason i replied a sign he said it is this i answered producing a trowel from beneath the folds of my roquelaire you jest he exclaimed recoiling a few paces but let us proceed to the amontillado be it so i said replacing the tool beneath the cloak and again offering him my arm he leaned upon it heavily we continued our route in search of the amontillado we passed through a range of low arches descended passed on and descending again arrived at a deep crypt in which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than flame at the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less spacious its walls had been lined with human remains piled to the vault overhead in the fashion of the great catacombs of paris three sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner from the fourth the bones had been thrown down and lay promiscuously upon the earth forming at one point a mound of some size within the wall thus exposed by the displacing of the bones we perceived a still interior recess in depth about four feet in width three in height six or seven it seemed to have been constructed for no especial use within itself but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal supports of the roof of the catacombs and was backed by one of their circumscribing walls of solid granite it was in vain that fortunato uplifting his dull torch endeavored to pry into the depths of the recess its termination the feeble light did not enable us to see proceed i said herein is the amontillado as for luchesi he is an ignoramus interrupted my friend as he stepped unsteadily forward while i followed immediately at his heels in an instant he had reached the extremity of the niche and finding his progress arrested by the rock stood stupidly bewildered a moment more and i had fettered him to the granite in its surface were two iron staples distant from each other about two feet horizontally from one of these depended a short chain from the other a padlock throwing the links about his waist it was but the work of a few seconds to secure it he was too much astounded to resist withdrawing the key i stepped back from the recess pass your hand i said over the wall you cannot help feeling the nitre indeed it is very damp once more let me implore you to return no then i must positively leave you but i must first render you all the little attentions in my power the amontillado ejaculated my friend not yet recovered from his astonishment true i replied the amontillado as i said these words i busied myself among the pile of bones of which i have before spoken throwing them aside i soon uncovered a quantity of building stone and mortar with these materials and with the aid of my trowel i began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche i had scarcely laid the first tier of my masonry when i discovered that the intoxication of fortunato had in a great measure worn off the earliest indication i had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth of the recess it was not the cry of a drunken man there was then a long and obstinate silence i laid the second tier and the third and the fourth and then i heard the furious vibrations of the chain the noise lasted for several minutes during which that i might hearken to it with the more satisfaction i ceased my labors and sat down upon the bones when at last the clanking subsided i resumed the trowel and finished without interruption the fifth the sixth and the seventh tier the wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast i again paused and holding the flambeaux over the masonwork threw a few feeble rays upon the figure within a succession of loud and shrill screams bursting suddenly from the throat of the chained form seemed to thrust me violently back for a brief moment i hesitatedi trembled unsheathing my rapier i began to grope with it about the recess but the thought of an instant reassured me i placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs and felt satisfied i reapproached the wall i replied to the yells of him who clamored i reechoedi aidedi surpassed them in volume and in strength i did this and the clamorer grew still it was now midnight and my task was drawing to a close i had completed the eighth the ninth and the tenth tier i had finished a portion of the last and the eleventh there remained but a single stone to be fitted and plastered in i struggled with its weight i placed it partially in its destined position but now there came from out the niche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head it was succeeded by a sad voice which i had difficulty in recognizing as that of the noble fortunato the voice said ha ha hahe hea very good joke indeedan excellent jest we will have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzohe he heover our winehe he he the amontillado i said he he hehe he heyes the amontillado but is it not getting late will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo the lady fortunato and the rest let us be gone yes i said let us be gone for the love of god montresor yes i said for the love of god but to these words i hearkened in vain for a reply i grew impatient i called aloud fortunato no answer i called again fortunato no answer still i thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and let it fall within there came forth in return only a jingling of the bells my heart grew sickon account of the dampness of the catacombs i hastened to make an end of my labor i forced the last stone into its position i plastered it up against the new masonry i reerected the old rampart of bones for the half of a century no mortal has disturbed them in pace requiescat under the covers with fortunato and montresor by jan burke some years ago i heard concern voiced over the fact that children seemed to adore a series of horror books written for that audience and recently a parent told me she feared harry potter was too intense for her fifthgrader im not a parent so i would never attempt to judge what a child of today could cope with but i do recall who scared the socks off me at the age of ten edgar allan poe upon hearing how much i had enjoyed being terrified by the telltale heart my father suggested i read the cask of amontillado it had been a while since he had read it but as he said the name of the story he gave a little shiver in reminiscence naturally i hurried to search out a copy of the story like many young booklovers i used to read with a flashlight under the bedcovers long after i was supposed to be asleep for reasons youll understand as you read the cask of amontillado those covers got tossed back when i read this one for some weeks after i read it i repaid my father the favor of his recommendation by refusing to sleep with the bedroom door closed every time ive reread the cask of amontillado as an adult ive found its still a tale guaranteed to incite claustrophobia now though i better appreciate how skillfully poe told this tale the cask of amontillado is a masters lesson in storytelling every elementthe voice of the narrator the setting the interplay between characters even the clothing of the victimcontributes to its mood its tension and its relentless drive to its conclusion consider how we are lured into a journey with a killer much as fortunato is lured into doing the same at first we feel sympathetic to montresor who among us has not known a fortunato and wished him his comeuppance a pompous connoisseur of fine wines he easily represents the knowitalls weve encountered in our own lives perhaps weve also known someone who has dealt us a thousand injuries or insults weve been forced to bear in smiling silence soon we realize though that montresor is a madman not to be trusted hes prone to exaggerating slights all out of proportion and hes bent on revenge we begin to fear for fortunato dressed as a fool and behaving like one we descend with this pair from the street where the carnival season is in full swing down into the catacombs beneath the montresor palazzo every step inexorably takes us away from the excesses and frivolity of the celebrations abovedown into a dark and chill place where even the bells on a fools cap become fuelfor nightmares we may have seen more graphically violent representations of the mind of a killer in fiction but montresor capable of mocking both his victims prayers and his screams is as heartless as any with the power of a conjurer poe knew exactly how to summon our fears read the cask of amontillado then feel free to sleep with the light on and the bedroom door open jan burke is the edgarwinning author of twelve novels including bones flight bloodlines and kidnapped her newest is a supernatural thriller the messenger she is currently at work on the next irene kelly novel the curse of amontillado by lawrence block i knew i wanted an edgar award back in when my good friend don westlake failed to win one hed just published the mercenaries and it was nominated for an edgar for best first mystery someone else took home the statuette for what was in fact a first mystery by a veteran sciencefiction writer which made it eligible under the letter if not the spirit of the rule and we all assured don that it was honor enough to be nominated and he pretended to believe us we dont need to feel sorry for the man though he has a whole shelf full of those porcelain busts now plus a sheaf of nominations anyway this isnt about him its about me i began publishing paperback original crime novels in and hardcovers a few years later and while i cant say i was obsessed with the idea of winning an edgar i had my hopes one book i published in the mids under a pen name chip harrison that was also the name of the books narrator was dedicated to barbara bonham newgate callendar john dickson carr and the edgar awards committee of the mystery writers of america barbara bonham was the chief fiction reviewer for publishers weekly newgate callendar was the pen name that music critic harold schonberg used for his crime column in the new york times book review and john dickson carr master of the locked room reviewed mysteries for ellery queens mystery magazine i was shameless and to no avail well not much avail anyway the book got a mention in the callendar column where its dedication was quoted and its literary merits overlooked carr and bonham paid no attention and when edgar time rolled around chip harrison was left out in the cold but a year or so later one of my matthew scudder novels time to murder and create picked up a nomination for best paperback original i went to the dinner somehow convinced i was going to win and i didnt someone else did i sat there stunned barely able to assure people that it was honor enough merely to be nominated a couple of years later i was nominated again this time for eight million ways to die shortlisted for best novel honor enough to be nominated i muttered and went home it took years for me to realize what was holding me back it was quite simply a curse the curse of amontillado i realized the precise dimensions of this curse only recently when charles ardai was editing an early pseudonymous book of mine for his hard case crime imprint he pointed out that id referred to the cask of amontillado as having been written by robert louis stevenson gently he asked if my attributing poes story to stevenson was deliberate indicating something subtle about the character whod made the error the mistake i replied was not the characters but my own and he should by all means correct it and not a moment too soon because it was clearly responsible for a long train of misfortunes this misattribution i must confess was not an isolated slipofthekeyboard confined to a single forgettable book while that may have been the only time i publicly handed poes classic tale to stevenson id been confused about its authorship ever since i read the story which if memory serves and you can already tell what ill service it tends to provide came about in the seventh grade some fiftyseven years ago one of our textbooks in english class was a small blue volume of short stories one of which was the cask of amontillado and one was something by stevenson i seem to recall the title of the stevenson story as the master of ballantrae but thats impossible because thats the title of a novel so i dont know what the stevenson story may have been and god forgive me i dont care either i dont know what else i may have retained from the seventh grade but one thing i held on to was that story the cask of amontillado for the love of god montresor yes i said for the love of god they dont write em like that anymore and i knew that even then but somehow i got it into my head that the authors initials were rls not eap now and then it would come up in conversation and someone would say i meant poe didnt i and id say yes of course and stand correctedbut not for long because my memory remained inexplicably loyal to stevenson well really where did i get off looking to win an edgar if the red sox could go that long without a world series win just because their cheapjack owner let go of babe ruth what did i expect and then of course everything changed because i started keeping company with a young woman named lynne wood and why you may ask should that serve to lift the curse of amontillado perhaps the answer will become clear when i tell you that the maiden name of ms woods mother emilie was poe she was not the first person id met with that surname back in the eighth grade a mere year after id read about montresor and the illnamed fortunato i had a classmate named william poe his family had just moved north from alabama and that made him an exotic creature indeed at ps in buffalo new york we teased him relentlessly about his accentand i wouldnt be surprised if that helped reinforce the curse now that i think about it i dont know that anyone asked if he was related to the poe but he very likely would have answered that he was because they all are the poes that is of course none of them are direct descendants of edgar allan because the poor fellow had no living issue but he has plenty of collateral descendants and one of them was named emilie and she had a daughter named lynne reader i married her and within the year my short story by the dawns early light was nominated for an edgar lynne and i attended what id come to term the alwaysabridesmaid dinner but this time i went home with a porcelain bust of my brides greatgreatgreatetcuncle it has i blush to admit been joined by others in the years that followed coincidence i dont think so lawrence block once read the bells at a new york parks department event at the poe house in the bronx and flying in the face of popular demand repeated the performance at a similar gala a year or two later as editor of akashics forthcoming anthology manhattan noir iithe classics he made a point of including the raven figuring you cant get a whole lot noirer than that his sole other connection to edgar allan poe is as he makes evident in his essay in this volume by marriage but he does collect busts of the great author and has five of them arrayed on a shelf where he can see them even as he types these lines the black cat for the most wild yet most homely narrative which i am about to pen i neither expect nor solicit belief mad indeed would i be to expect it in a case where my very senses reject their own evidence yet mad am i not and very surely do i not dream but tomorrow i die and today i would unburden my soul my immediate purpose is to place before the world plainly succinctly and without comment a series of mere household events in their consequences these events have terrifiedhave torturedhave destroyed me yet i will not attempt to expound them to me they have presented little but horrorto many they will seem less terrible than baroques hereafter perhaps some intellect may be found which will reduce my phantasm to the commonplacesome intellect more calm more logical and far less excitable than my own which will perceive in the circumstances i detail with awe nothing more than an ordinary succession of very natural causes and effects from my infancy i was noted for the docility and humanity of my disposition my tenderness of heart was even so conspicuous as to make me the jest of my companions i was especially fond of animals and was indulged by my parents with a great variety of pets with these i spent most of my time and never was so happy as when feeding and caressing them this peculiarity of character grew with my growth and in my manhood i derived from it one of my principal sources of pleasure to those who have cherished an affection for a faithful and sagacious dog i need hardly be at the trouble of explaining the nature or the intensity of the gratification thus derivable there is something in the unselfish and selfsacrificing love of a brute which goes directly to the heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere man i married early and was happy to find in my wife a disposition not uncongenial with my own observing my partiality for domestic pets she lost no opportunity of procuring those of the most agreeable kind we had birds goldfish a fine dog rabbits a small monkey and a cat this latter was a remarkably large and beautiful animal entirely black and sagacious to an astonishing degree in speaking of his intelligence my wife who at heart was not a little tinctured with superstition made frequent allusion to the ancient popular notion which regarded all black cats as witches in disguise not that she was ever serious upon this pointand i mention the matter at all for no better reason than that it happens just now to be remembered plutothis was the cats namewas my favorite pet and playmate i alone fed him and he attended me wherever i went about the house it was even with difficulty that i could prevent him from following me through the streets our friendship lasted in this manner for several years during which my general temperament and characterthrough the instrumentality of the fiend intemperancehad i blush to confess it experienced a radical alteration for the worse i grew day by day more moody more irritable more regardless of the feelings of others i suffered myself to use intemperate language to my wife at length i even offered her personal violence my pets of course were made to feel the change in my disposition i not only neglected but illused them for pluto however i still retained sufficient regard to restrain me from maltreating him as i made no scruple of maltreating the rabbits the monkey or even the dog when by accident or through affection they came in my way but my disease grew upon mefor what disease is like alcoholand at length even pluto who was now becoming old and consequently somewhat peevish even pluto began to experience the effects of my ill temper one night returning home much intoxicated from one of my haunts about town i fancied that the cat avoided my presence i seized him when in his fright at my violence he inflicted a slight wound upon my hand with his teeth the fury of a demon instantly possessed me i knew myself no longer my original soul seemed at once to take its flight from my body and a more than fiendish malevolence ginnurtured thrilled every fibre of my frame i took from my waistcoatpocket a penknife opened it grasped the poor beast by the throat and deliberately cut one of its eyes from the socket i blush i burn i shudder while i pen the damnable atrocity when reason returned with the morningwhen i had slept off the fumes of the nights debauchi experienced a sentiment half of horror half of remorse for the crime of which i had been guilty but it was at best a feeble and equivocal feeling and the soul remained untouched i again plunged into excess and soon drowned in wine all memory of the deed in the meantime the cat slowly recovered the socket of the lost eye presented it is true a frightful appearance but he no longer appeared to suffer any pain he went about the house as usual but as might be expected fled in extreme terror at my approach i had so much of my old heart left as to be at first grieved by this evident dislike on the part of a creature which had once so loved me but this feeling soon gave place to irritation and then came as if to my final and irrevocable overthrow the spirit of perverseness of this spirit philosophy takes no account yet i am not more sure that my soul lives than i am that perverseness is one of the primitive impulses of the human heartone of the indivisible primary faculties or sentiments which give direction to the character of man who has not a hundred times found himself committing a vile or a stupid action for no other reason than because he knows he should not have we not a perpetual inclination in the teeth of our best judgment to violate that which is law merely because we understand it to be such this spirit of perverseness i say came to my final overthrow it was this unfathomable longing of the soul to vex itself to offer violence to its own natureto do wrong for the wrongs sake onlythat urged me to continue and finally to consummate the injury i had inflicted upon the unoffending brute one morning in cool blood i slipped a noose about its neck and hung it to the limb of a treehung it with the tears streaming from my eyes and with the bitterest remorse at my hearthung it because i knew that it had loved me and because i felt it had given me no reason of offencehung it because i knew that in so doing i was committing a sina deadly sin that would so jeopardize my immortal soul as to place itif such a thing were possibleeven beyond the reach of the infinite mercy of the most merciful and most terrible god on the night of the day on which this most cruel deed was done i was aroused from sleep by the cry of fire the curtains of my bed were in flames the whole house was blazing it was with great difficulty that my wife a servant and myself made our escape from the conflagration the destruction was complete my entire worldly wealth was swallowed up and i resigned myself thenceforward to despair i am above the weakness of seeking to establish a sequence of cause and effect between the disaster and the atrocity but i am detailing a chain of factsand wish not to leave even a possible link imperfect on the day succeeding the fire i visited the ruins the walls with one exception had fallen in this exception was found in a compartment wall not very thick which stood about the middle of the house and against which had rested the head of my bed the plastering had here in great measure resisted the action of the firea fact which i attributed to its having been recently spread about this wall a dense crowd were collected and many persons seemed to be examining a particular portion of it with very minute and eager attention the words strange singular and other similar expressions excited my curiosity i approached and saw as if graven in bas relief upon the white surface the figure of a gigantic cat the impression was given with an accuracy truly marvellous there was a rope about the animals neck when i first beheld this apparitionfor i could scarcely regard it as lessmy wonder and my terror were extreme but at length reflection came to my aid the cat i remembered had been hung in a garden adjacent to the house upon the alarm of fire this garden had been immediately filled by the crowdby some one of whom the animal must have been cut from the tree and thrown through an open window into my chamber this had probably been done with the view of arousing me from sleep the falling of other walls had compressed the victim of my cruelty into the substance of the freshlyspread plaster the lime of which with the flames and the ammonia from the carcass had then accomplished the portraiture as i saw it although i thus readily accounted to my reason if not altogether to my conscience for the startling fact just detailed it did not the less fail to make a deep impression upon my fancy for months i could not rid myself of the phantasm of the cat and during this period there came back into my spirit a halfsentiment that seemed but was not remorse i went so far as to regret the loss of the animal and to look about me among the vile haunts which i now habitually frequented for another pet of the same species and of somewhat similar appearance with which to supply its place one night as i sat half stupefied in a den of more than infamy my attention was suddenly drawn to some black object reposing upon the head of one of the immense hogsheads of gin or of rum which constituted the chief furniture of the apartment i had been looking steadily at the top of this hogshead for some minutes and what now caused me surprise was the fact that i had not sooner perceived the object thereupon i approached it and touched it with my hand it was a black cata very large onefully as large as pluto and closely resembling him in every respect but one pluto had not a white hair upon any portion of his body but this cat had a large although indefinite splotch of white covering nearly the whole region of the breast upon my touching him he immediately arose purred loudly rubbed against my hand and appeared delighted with my notice this then was the very creature of which i was in search i at once offered to purchase it of the landlord but this person made no claim to itknew nothing of ithad never seen it before i continued my caresses and when i prepared to go home the animal evinced a disposition to accompany me i permitted it to do so occasionally stooping and patting it as i proceeded when it reached the house it domesticated itself at once and became immediately a great favorite with my wife for my own part i soon found a dislike to it arising within me this was just the reverse of what i had anticipated buti know not how or why it wasits evident fondness for myself rather disgusted and annoyed me by slow degrees these feelings of disgust and annoyance rose into the bitterness of hatred i avoided the creature a certain sense of shame and the remembrance of my former deed of cruelty preventing me from physically abusing it i did not for some weeks strike or otherwise violently ill use it but gradually very graduallyi came to look upon it with unutterable loathing and to flee silently from its odious presence as from the breath of a pestilence what added no doubt to my hatred of the beast was the discovery on the morning after i brought it home that like pluto it also had been deprived of one of its eyes this circumstance however only endeared it to my wife who as i have already said possessed in a high degree that humanity of feeling which had once been my distinguishing trait and the source of many of my simplest and purest pleasures with my aversion to this cat however its partiality for myself seemed to increase it followed my footsteps with a pertinacity which it would be difficult to make the reader comprehend whenever i sat it would crouch beneath my chair or spring upon my knees covering me with its loathsome caresses if i arose to walk it would get between my feet and thus nearly throw me down or fastening its long and sharp claws in my dress clamber in this manner to my breast at such times although i longed to destroy it with a blow i was yet withheld from so doing partly by a memory of my former crime but chieflylet me confess it at onceby absolute dread of the beast this dread was not exactly a dread of physical eviland yet i should be at a loss how otherwise to define it i am almost ashamed to ownyes even in this felons cell i am almost ashamed to own that the terror and horror with which the animal inspired me had been heightened by one of the merest chimeras it would be possible to conceive my wife had called my attention more than once to the character of the mark of white hair of which i have spoken and which constituted the sole visible difference between the strange beast and the one i had destroyed the reader will remember that this mark although large had been originally very indefinite but by slow degreesdegrees nearly imperceptible and which for a long time my reason struggled to reject as fancifulit had at length assumed a rigorous distinctness of outline it was now the representation of an object that i shudder to nameand for this above all i loathed and dreaded and would have rid myself of the monster had i daredit was now i say the image of a hideousof a ghastly thingof the gallowsoh mournful and terrible engine of horror and of crimeof agony and of death and now was i indeed wretched beyond the wretchedness of mere humanity and a brute beastwhose fellow i had contemptuously destroyeda brute beast to work out for mefor me a man fashioned in the image of the high godso much of insufferable woe alas neither by day nor by night knew i the blessing of rest any more during the former the creature left me no moment alone and in the latter i started hourly from dreams of unutterable fear to find the hot breath of the thing upon my face and its vast weightan incarnate nightmare that i had no power to shake offincumbent eternally upon my heart beneath the pressure of torments such as these the feeble remnant of the good within me succumbed evil thoughts became my sole intimatesthe darkest and most evil of thoughts the moodiness of my usual temper increased to hatred of all things and of all mankind while from the sudden frequent and ungovernable outbursts of a fury to which i now blindly abandoned myself my uncomplaining wife alas was the most usual and the most patient of sufferers one day she accompanied me upon some household errand into the cellar of the old building which our poverty compelled us to inhabit the cat followed me down the steep stairs and nearly throwing me headlong exasperated me to madness uplifting an axe and forgetting in my wrath the childish dread which had hitherto stayed my hand i aimed a blow at the animal which of course would have proved instantly fatal had it descended as i wished but this blow was arrested by the hand of my wife goaded by the interference into a rage more than demoniacal i withdrew my arm from her grasp and buried the axe in her brain she fell dead upon the spot without a groan this hideous murder accomplished i set myself forthwith and with entire deliberation to the task of concealing the body i knew that i could not remove it from the house either by day or by night without the risk of being observed by the neighbors many projects entered my mind at one period i thought of cutting the corpse into minute fragments and destroying them by fire at another i resolved to dig a grave for it in the floor of the cellar again i deliberated about casting it in the well in the yardabout packing it in a box as if merchandise with the usual arrangements and so getting a porter to take it from the house finally i hit upon what i considered a far better expedient than either of these i determined to wall it up in the cellar as the monks of the middle ages are recorded to have walled up their victims for a purpose such as this the cellar was well adapted its walls were loosely constructed and had lately been plastered throughout with a rough plaster which the dampness of the atmosphere had prevented from hardening moreover in one of the walls was a projection caused by a false chimney or fireplace that had been filled up and made to resemble the rest of the cellar i made no doubt that i could readily displace the bricks at this point insert the corpse and wall the whole up as before so that no eye could detect any thing suspicious and in this calculation i was not deceived by means of a crowbar i easily dislodged the bricks and having carefully deposited the body against the inner wall i propped it in that position while with little trouble i relaid the whole structure as it originally stood having procured mortar sand and hair with every possible precaution i prepared a plaster which could not be distinguished from the old and with this i very carefully went over the new brickwork when i had finished i felt satisfied that all was right the wall did not present the slightest appearance of having been disturbed the rubbish on the floor was picked up with the minutest care i looked around triumphantly and said to myself here at least then my labor has not been in vain my next step was to look for the beast which had been the cause of so much wretchedness for i had at length firmly resolved to put it to death had i been able to meet with it at the moment there could have been no doubt of its fate but it appeared that the crafty animal had been alarmed at the violence of my previous anger and forbore to present itself in my present mood it is impossible to describe or to imagine the deep the blissful sense of relief which the absence of the detested creature occasioned in my bosom it did not make its appearance during the night and thus for one night at least since its introduction into the house i soundly and tranquilly slept aye slept even with the burden of murder upon my soul the second and the third day passed and still my tormentor came not once again i breathed as a freeman the monster in terror had fled the premises for ever i should behold it no more my happiness was supreme the guilt of my dark deed disturbed me but little some few inquiries had been made but these had been readily answered even a search had been institutedbut of course nothing was to be discovered i looked upon my future felicity as secured upon the fourth day of the assassination a party of the police came very unexpectedly into the house and proceeded again to make rigorous investigation of the premises secure however in the inscrutability of my place of concealment i felt no embarrassment whatever the officers bade me accompany them in their search they left no nook or corner unexplored at length for the third or fourth time they descended into the cellar i quivered not in a muscle my heart beat calmly as that of one who slumbers in innocence i walked the cellar from end to end i folded my arms upon my bosom and roamed easily to and fro the police were thoroughly satisfied and prepared to depart the glee at my heart was too strong to be restrained i burned to say if but one word by way of triumph and to render doubly sure their assurance of my guiltlessness gentlemen i said at last as the party ascended the steps i delight to have allayed your suspicions i wish you all health and a little more courtesy by the bye gentlemen thisthis is a very wellconstructed house in the rabid desire to say something easily i scarcely knew what i uttered at alli may say an excellently wellconstructed house these wallsare you going gentlementhese walls are solidly put together and here through the mere phrenzy of bravado i rapped heavily with a cane which i held in my hand upon that very portion of the brickwork behind which stood the corpse of the wife of my bosom but may god shield and deliver me from the fangs of the archfiend no sooner had the reverberation of my blows sunk into silence than i was answered by a voice from within the tombby a cry at first muffled and broken like the sobbing of a child and then quickly swelling into one long loud and continuous scream utterly anomalous and inhumana howla wailing shriek half of horror and half of triumph such as might have arisen only out of hell conjointly from the throats of the damned in their agony and of the demons that exult in the damnation of my own thoughts it is folly to speak swooning i staggered to the opposite wall for one instant the party upon the stairs remained motionless through extremity of terror and of awe in the next a dozen stout arms were toiling at the wall it fell bodily the corpse already greatly decayed and clotted with gore stood erect before the eyes of the spectators upon its head with red extended mouth and solitary eye of fire sat the hideous beast whose craft had seduced me into murder and whose informing voice had consigned me to the hangman i had walled the monster up within the tomb plutos heritage by p j parrish the homeless man cornered us outside the supermarket i found this in the dumpster he said pointing to his dirty plaid shirt poking out of his pocket was a kittens head i got no place for it he said can you give it a home the tiny beast was wet with blood it was dying my husband took it and handed the man a twenty it was late on a saturday night but we drove to the emergency vet an hour and two hundred dollars later the vet sent us on our way with the kitten it was fine he said just starving and missing an eye cleaned up the kitten didnt look that bad it quickly grew fat and found its rank among our eight other cats what should we name it my husband asked pluto i said which is of course the name of the tortured feline in edgar allan poes the black cat not that i was any expert on poe then far from it like most people my first guide to poe was bdirector roger corman ray milland in premature burial drinking maggots from a wine goblet my next guide was professor schneider whose introduction to american literature course had me shoehorning the poe short stories in between twain and hawthorne i remember finding the black cat dense and difficult i had to look up a lot of words i couldnt figure out what was going on and what was the deal with this guy gouging out his cats eye and planting an ax in his wifes head after claiming he adored them both was he a liar confused drunk or just plain nuts like most critics of poes dayyeats called him vulgari was underwhelmed i didnt cross paths with the black cat for decades writing itand its creatoroff as archaic and lightweight it was only after i started writing fiction that i gave poe a second chance although i had published a handful of crime novels i was struggling with my first short story pluto was sitting on my lap at the computer one day as i stared at the blank screen he wasnt the one who googled the black cat but damn wouldnt that have made a great poe twist i was floored by the story and went on to read others poe hadnt gotten better i had just gotten older the saturdaymatinee poe who scared the jujubes out of me as a kid scared me in a completely different way as an adult now i could understand the thin line between promise and disappointment now i could imagine the terror of a mind unbalanced by demons or drink now i could see the rich mix of emotions the delicate dance between the romantic and the macabre the real and the supernatural and as a writer now i could appreciate the complex construction of poes puzzles and his use of what he called the vivid effect to grab the readers emotions what modern storyteller worth her salt doesnt strive to do that all writers todaycrime horror romance yes even literary owe him a debt my favorite author joyce carol oates asks in the afterword of her shortstory collection haunted who has not been influenced by poe oates herself wrote a poe paean called the plutos heritage white cat in which a husband becomes murderously jealous of his wifes persian cat writers can learn much from him still as for readers there is much to savor in this sly little tale first it is a very modern detective story but one in which you the reader must follow the breadcrumb trail of clues why did this man kill his wife you have to peel back the psychological layers of the killers behaviorshades of silence of the lambsto find meaning for a brutal murder when none seems to exist second it is a chilling study of domestic violence perversity and guilt compare it with its bookend story the telltale heart the other great example in this collection both narrators deny that they are insanebut are they third the black cat is one of the first stories to use the unreliable narrator this is when bias instability limited knowledge or deliberate deceit makes the storyteller suspect with one line i neither expect nor solicit beliefpoe paved the way for nick carraway in fitzgeralds the great gatsby the governess in henry jamess the turn of the screw dr sheppard in agatha christies the murder of roger ackroyd the cook in dean koontzs odd thomas and teddy daniels in dennis lehanes shutter island fourth the black cat is an early example of genrecrossing poe is known for horror but in this story he blurs the line between realism and the supernatural the paranormal reincarnation horror mysteryits all there and more and last well it is the first cat mystery which brings us back to pluto mine is still hale and hearty at fourteen the fictional pluto of course dies horribly which didnt really bother meuntil i started writing fiction see theres an axiom among mystery writers kill an animal and your readers will turn on you poe adored cats in real life his beloved tabby catarina even inspired him to write a scientific essay instinct vs reasona black cat still when he put pen to paper he wasnt afraid to kill the cat you have to admire a writer who takes big risks p j parrish aka kristy montee is the author with her sister kelly nichols of two series of crime novels featuring biracial private eye louis kincaid and female homicide detective joe frye their books are new york times bestsellers and have won awards from the private eye writers of america and international thriller writers their short stories have appeared in ellery queens mystery magazine in mystery writers of america s anthologies and in akashic books detroit noir like poe kris has a love of wine and cats an appreciation of all that is grotesque and depressing and a distrust of critics even though she once earned a

that spectre in my path chamberlains pharronida let me call myself for the present william wilson the fair page now lying before me need not be sullied with my real appellation this has been already too much an object for the scornfor the horrorfor the detestation of my race to the uttermost regions of the globe have not the indignant winds bruited its unparalleled infamy oh outcast of all outcasts most abandonedto the earth art thou not for ever dead to its honors to its flowers to its golden aspirationsand a cloud dense dismal and limitless does it not hang eternally between thy hopes and heaven i would not if i could here or today embody a record of my later years of unspeakable misery and unpardonable crime this epochthese later yearstook unto themselves a sudden elevation in turpitude whose origin alone it is my present purpose to assign men usually grow base by degrees from me in an instant all virtue dropped bodily as a mantle from comparatively trivial wickedness i passed with the stride of a giant into more than the enormities of an elahgabalus what chancewhat one event brought this evil thing to pass bear with me while i relate death approaches and the shadow which foreruns him has thrown a softening influence over my spirit i long in passing through the dim valley for the sympathyi had nearly said for the pityof my fellow men i would fain have them believe that i have been in some measure the slave of circumstances beyond human control i would wish them to seek out for me in the details i am about to give some little oasis of fatality amid a wilderness of error i would have them allowwhat they cannot refrain from allowingthat although temptation may have erewhile existed as great man was never thus at least tempted beforecertainly never thus fell and is it therefore that he has never thus suffered have i not indeed been living in a dream and am i not now dying a victim to the horror and the mystery of the wildest of all sublunary visions i am the descendant of a race whose imaginative and easily excitable temperament has at all times rendered them remarkable and in my earliest infancy i gave evidence of having fully inherited the family character as i advanced in years it was more strongly developed becoming for many reasons a cause of serious disquietude to my friends and of positive injury to myself i grew selfwilled addicted to the wildest caprices and a prey to the most ungovernable passions weakminded and beset with constitutional infirmities akin to my own my parents could do but little to check the evil propensities which distinguished me some feeble and illdirected efforts resulted in complete failure on their part and of course in total triumph on mine thenceforward my voice was a household law and at an age when few children have abandoned their leadingstrings i was left to the guidance of my own will and became in all but name the master of my own actions my earliest recollections of a schoollife are connected with a large rambling elizabethan house in a mistylooking village of england where were a vast number of gigantic and gnarled trees and where all the houses were excessively ancient in truth it was a dreamlike and spiritsoothing place that venerable old town at this moment in fancy i feel the refreshing chilliness of its deeplyshadowed avenues inhale the fragrance of its thousand shrubberies and thrill anew with undefinable delight at the deep hollow note of the churchbell breaking each hour with sullen and sudden roar upon the stillness of the dusky atmosphere in which the fretted gothic steeple lay imbedded and asleep it gives me perhaps as much of pleasure as i can now in any manner experience to dwell upon minute recollections of the school and its concerns steeped in misery as i ammisery alas only too reali shall be pardoned for seeking relief however slight and temporary in the weakness of a few rambling details these moreover utterly trivial and even ridiculous in themselves assume to my fancy adventitious importance as connected with a period and a locality when and where i recognize the first ambiguous monitions of the destiny which afterward so fully overshadowed me let me then remember the house i have said was old and irregular the grounds were extensive and a high and solid brick wall topped with a bed of mortar and broken glass encompassed the whole this prisonlike rampart formed the limit of our domain beyond it we saw but thrice a weekonce every saturday afternoon when attended by two ushers we were permitted to take brief walks in a body through some of the neighbouring fieldsand twice during sunday when we were paraded in the same formal manner to the morning and evening service in the one church of the village of this church the principal of our school was pastor with how deep a spirit of wonder and perplexity was i wont to regard him from our remote pew in the gallery as with step solemn and slow he ascended the pulpit this reverend man with countenance so demurely benign with robes so glossy and so clerically flowing with wig so minutely powdered so rigid and so vastcould this be he who of late with sour visage and in snuffy habiliments administered ferule in hand the draconian laws of the academy oh gigantic paradox too utterly monstrous for solution at an angle of the ponderous wall frowned a more ponderous gate it was riveted and studded with iron bolts and surmounted with jagged iron spikes what impressions of deep awe did it inspire it was never opened save for the three periodical egressions and ingressions already mentioned then in every creak of its mighty hinges we found a plenitude of mysterya world of matter for solemn remark or for more solemn meditation the extensive enclosure was irregular in form having many capacious recesses of these three or four of the largest constituted the playground it was level and covered with fine hard gravel i well remember it had no trees nor benches nor any thing similar within it of course it was in the rear of the house in front lay a small parterre planted with box and other shrubs but through this sacred division we passed only upon rare occasions indeedsuch as a first advent to school or final departure thence or perhaps when a parent or friend having called for us we joyfully took our way home for the christmas or midsummer holidays but the househow quaint an old building was thisto me how veritably a palace of enchantment there was really no end to its windingsto its incomprehensible subdivisions it was difficult at any given time to say with certainty upon which of its two stories one happened to be from each room to every other there were sure to be found three or four steps either in ascent or descent then the lateral branches were innumerableinconceivableand so returning in upon themselves that our most exact ideas in regard to the whole mansion were not very far different from those with which we pondered upon infinity during the five years of my residence here i was never able to ascertain with precision in what remote locality lay the little sleeping apartment assigned to myself and some eighteen or twenty other scholars the schoolroom was the largest in the housei could not help thinking in the world it was very long narrow and dismally low with pointed gothic windows and a ceiling of oak in a remote and terrorinspiring angle was a square enclosure of eight or ten feet comprising the sanctum during hours of our principal the reverend dr bransby it was a solid structure with massy door sooner than open which in the absence of the dominie we would all have willingly perished by the peine forte et dure in other angles were two other similar boxes far less reverenced indeed but still greatly matters of awe one of these was the pulpit of the classical usher one of the english and mathematical interspersed about the room crossing and recrossing in endless irregularity were innumerable benches and desks black ancient and timeworn piled desperately with much bethumbed books and so beseamed with initial letters names at full length grotesque figures and other multiplied efforts of the knife as to have entirely lost what little of original form might have been their portion in days long departed a huge bucket with water stood at one extremity of the room and a clock of stupendous dimensions at the other encompassed by the massy walls of this venerable academy i passed yet not in tedium or disgust the years of the third lustrum of my life the teeming brain of childhood requires no external world of incident to occupy or amuse it and the apparently dismal monotony of a school was replete with more intense excitement than my riper youth has derived from luxury or my full manhood from crime yet i must believe that my first mental development had in it much of the uncommoneven much of the outré upon mankind at large the events of very early existence rarely leave in mature age any definite impression all is gray shadowa weak and irregular remembrancean indistinct regathering of feeble pleasures and phantasmagoric pains with me this is not so in childhood i must have felt with the energy of a man what i now find stamped upon memory in lines as vivid as deep and as durable as the exergues of the carthaginian medals yet in factin the fact of the worlds viewhow little was there to remember the mornings awakening the nightly summons to bed the connings the recitations the periodical halfholidays and perambulations the playground with its broils its pastimes its intriguesthese by a mental sorcery long forgotten were made to involve a wilderness of sensation a world of rich incident an universe of varied emotion of excitement the most passionate and spiritstirring oh le bon temps que ce siècle de fer in truth the ardor the enthusiasm and the imperiousness of my disposition soon rendered me a marked character among my schoolmates and by slow but natural gradations gave me an ascendancy over all not greatly older than myselfover all with a single exception this exception was found in the person of a scholar who although no relation bore the same christian and surname as myselfa circumstance in fact little remarkable for notwithstanding a noble descent mine was one of those everyday appellations which seem by prescriptive right to have been time out of mind the common property of the mob in this narrative i have therefore designated myself as william wilsona fictitious title not very dissimilar to the real my namesake alone of those who in school phraseology constituted our set presumed to compete with me in the studies of the classin the sports and broils of the playgroundto refuse implicit belief in my assertions and submission to my willindeed to interfere with my arbitrary dictation in any respect whatsoever if there is on earth a supreme and unqualified despotism it is the despotism of a mastermind in boyhood over the less energetic spirits of its companions wilsons rebellion was to me a source of the greatest embarrassment the more so as in spite of the bravado with which in public i made a point of treating him and his pretensions i secretly felt that i feared him and could not help thinking the equality which he maintained so easily with myself a proof of his true superiority since not to be overcome cost me a perpetual struggle yet this superiority even this equalitywas in truth acknowledged by no one but myself our associates by some unaccountable blindness seemed not even to suspect it indeed his competition his resistance and especially his impertinent and dogged interference with my purposes were not more pointed than private he appeared to be destitute alike of the ambition which urged and of the passionate energy of mind which enabled me to excel in his rivalry he might have been supposed actuated solely by a whimsical desire to thwart astonish or mortify myself although there were times when i could not help observing with a feeling made up of wonder abasement and pique that he mingled with his injuries his insults or his contradictions a certain most inappropriate and assuredly most unwelcome affectionateness of manner i could only conceive this singular behavior to arise from a consummate selfconceit assuming the vulgar airs of patronage and protection perhaps it was this latter trait in wilsons conduct conjoined with our identity of name and the mere accident of our having entered the school upon the same day which set afloat the notion that we were brothers among the senior classes in the academy these do not usually inquire with much strictness into the affairs of their juniors i have before said or should have said that wilson was not in a most remote degree connected with my family but assuredly if we had been brothers we must have been twins for after leaving dr bransbys i casually learned that my namesake was born on the nineteenth of january and this is a somewhat remarkable coincidence for the day is precisely that of my own nativity it may seem strange that in spite of the continual anxiety occasioned me by the rivalry of wilson and his intolerable spirit of contradiction i could not bring myself to hate him altogether we had to be sure nearly every day a quarrel in which yielding me publicly the palm of victory he in some manner contrived to make me feel that it was he who had deserved it yet a sense of pride on my part and a veritable dignity on his own kept us always upon what are called speaking terms while there were many points of strong congeniality in our tempers operating to awake me in a sentiment which our position alone perhaps prevented from ripening into friendship it is difficult indeed to define or even to describe my real feelings towards him they formed a motley and heterogeneous admixturesome petulant animosity which was not yet hatred some esteem more respect much fear with a world of uneasy curiosity to the moralist it will be unnecessary to say in addition that wilson and myself were the most inseparable of companions it was no doubt the anomalous state of affairs existing between us which turned all my attacks upon him and there were many either open or covert into the channel of banter or practical joke giving pain while assuming the aspect of mere fun rather than into a more serious and determined hostility but my endeavours on this head were by no means uniformly successful even when my plans were the most wittily concocted for my namesake had much about him in character of that unassuming and quiet austerity which while enjoying the poignancy of its own jokes has no heel of achilles in itself and absolutely refuses to be laughed at i could find indeed but one vulnerable point and that lying in a personal peculiarity arising perhaps from constitutional disease would have been spared by any antagonist less at his wits end than myselfmy rival had a weakness in the faucial or guttural organs which precluded him from raising his voice at any time above a very low whisper of this defect i did not fail to take what poor advantage lay in my power wilson s retaliations in kind were many and there was one form of his practical wit that disturbed me beyond measure how his sagacity first discovered at all that so petty a thing would vex me is a question i never could solve but having discovered he habitually practised the annoyance i had always felt aversion to my uncourtly patronymic and its very common if not plebeian praenomen the words were venom in my ears and when upon the day of my arrival a second william wilson came also to the academy i felt angry with him for bearing the name and doubly disgusted with the name because a stranger bore it who would be the cause of its twofold repetition who would be constantly in my presence and whose concerns in the ordinary routine of the school business must inevitably on account of the detestable coincidence be often confounded with my own the feeling of vexation thus engendered grew stronger with every circumstance tending to show resemblance moral or physical between my rival and myself i had not then discovered the remarkable fact that we were of the same age but i saw that we were of the same height and i perceived that we were even singularly alike in general contour of person and outline of feature i was galled too by the rumor touching a relationship which had grown current in the upper forms in a word nothing could more seriously disturb me although i scrupulously concealed such disturbance than any allusion to a similarity of mind person or condition existing between us but in truth i had no reason to believe that with the exception of the matter of relationship and in the case of wilson himself this similarity had ever been made a subject of comment or even observed at all by our schoolfellows that he observed it in all its bearings and as fixedly as i was apparent but that he could discover in such circumstances so fruitful a field of annoyance can only be attributed as i said before to his more than ordinary penetration his cue which was to perfect an imitation of myself lay both in words and in actions and most admirably did he play his part my dress it was an easy matter to copy my gait and general manner were without difficulty appropriated in spite of his constitutional defect even my voice did not escape him my louder tones were of course unattempted but then the keyit was identical and his singular whisper it grew the very echo of my own how greatly this most exquisite portraiture harassed me for it could not justly be termed a caricature i will not now venture to describe i had but one consolationin the fact that the imitation apparently was noticed by myself alone and that i had to endure only the knowing and strangely sarcastic smiles of my namesake himself satisfied with having produced in my bosom the intended effect he seemed to chuckle in secret over the sting he had inflicted and was characteristically disregardful of the public applause which the success of his witty endeavours might have so easily elicited that the school indeed did not feel his design perceive its accomplishment and participate in his sneer was for many anxious months a riddle i could not resolve perhaps the gradation of his copy rendered it not so readily perceptible or more possibly i owed my security to the master air of the copyist who disdaining the letter which in a painting is all the obtuse can see gave but the full spirit of his original for my individual contemplation and chagrin i have already more than once spoken of the disgusting air of patronage which he assumed toward me and of his frequent officious interference with my will this interference often took the ungracious character of advice advice not openly given but hinted or insinuated i received it with a repugnance which gained strength as i grew in years yet at this distant day let me do him the simple justice to acknowledge that i can recall no occasion when the suggestions of my rival were on the side of those errors or follies so usual to his immature age and seeming inexperience that his moral sense at least if not his general talents and worldly wisdom was far keener than my own and that i might today have been a better and thus a happier man had i less frequently rejected the counsels embodied in those meaning whispers which i then but too cordially hated and too bitterly despised as it was i at length grew restive in the extreme under his distasteful supervision and daily resented more and more openly what i considered his intolerable arrogance i have said that in the first years of our connection as schoolmates my feelings in regard to him might have been easily ripened into friendship but in the latter months of my residence at the academy although the intrusion of his ordinary manner had beyond doubt in some measure abated my sentiments in nearly similar proportion partook very much of positive hatred upon one occasion he saw this i think and afterwards avoided or made a show of avoiding me it was about the same period if i remember aright that in an altercation of violence with him in which he was more than usually thrown off his guard and spoke and acted with an openness of demeanor rather foreign to his nature i discovered or fancied i discovered in his accent in his air and general appearance a something which first startled and then deeply interested me by bringing to mind dim visions of my earliest infancywild confused and thronging memories of a time when memory herself was yet unborn i cannot better describe the sensation which oppressed me than by saying that i could with difficulty shake off the belief of my having been acquainted with the being who stood before me at some epoch very long agosome point of the past even infinitely remote the delusion however faded as rapidly as it came and i mention it at all but to define the day of the last conversation i there held with my singular namesake the huge old house with its countless subdivisions had several large chambers communicating with each other where slept the greater number of the students there were however as must necessarily happen in a building so awkwardly planned many little nooks or recesses the odds and ends of the structure and these the economic ingenuity of dr bransby had also fitted up as dormitories although being the merest closets they were capable of accommodating but a single individual one of these small apartments was occupied by wilson one night about the close of my fifth year at the school and immediately after the altercation just mentioned finding every one wrapped in sleep i arose from bed and lamp in hand stole through a wilderness of narrow passages from my own bedroom to that of my rival i had long been plotting one of those illnatured pieces of practical wit at his expense in which i had hitherto been so uniformly unsuccessful it was my intention now to put my scheme in operation and i resolved to make him feel the whole extent of the malice with which i was imbued having reached his closet i noiselessly entered leaving the lamp with a shade over it on the outside i advanced a step and listened to the sound of his tranquil breathing assured of his being asleep i returned took the light and with it again approached the bed close curtains were around it which in the prosecution of my plan i slowly and quietly withdrew when the bright rays fell vividly upon the sleeper and my eyes at the same moment upon his countenance i lookedand a numbness an iciness of feeling instantly pervaded my frame my breast heaved my knees tottered my whole spirit became possessed with an objectless yet intolerable horror gasping for breath i lowered the lamp in still nearer proximity to the face were thesethese the lineaments of william wilson i saw indeed that they were his but i shook as if with a fit of the ague in fancying they were not what was there about them to confound me in this manner i gazed while my brain reeled with a multitude of incoherent thoughts not thus he appearedassuredly not thusin the vivacity of his waking hours the same name the same contour of person the same day of arrival at the academy and then his dogged and meaningless imitation of my gait my voice my habits and my manner was it in truth within the bounds of human possibility that what i now saw was the result merely of the habitual practice of this sarcastic imitation awestricken and with a creeping shudder i extinguished the lamp passed silently from the chamber and left at once the halls of that old academy never to enter them again after a lapse of some months spent at home in mere idleness i found myself a student at eton the brief interval had been sufficient to enfeeble my remembrance of the events at dr bransbys or at least to effect a material change in the nature of the feelings with which i remembered them the truththe tragedyof the drama was no more i could now find room to doubt the evidence of my senses and seldom called up the subject at all but with wonder at the extent of human credulity and a smile at the vivid force of the imagination which i hereditarily possessed neither was this species of skepticism likely to be diminished by the character of the life i led at eton the vortex of thoughtless folly into which i there so immediately and so recklessly plunged washed away all but the froth of my past hours ingulfed at once every solid or serious impression and left to memory only the veriest levities of a former existence i do not wish however to trace the course of my miserable profligacy herea profligacy which set at defiance the laws while it eluded the vigilance of the institution three years of folly passed without profit had but given me rooted habits of vice and added in a somewhat unusual degree to my bodily stature when after a week of soulless dissipation i invited a small party of the most dissolute students to a secret carousal in my chambers we met at a late hour of the night for our debaucheries were to be faithfully protracted until morning the wine flowed freely and there were not wanting other and perhaps more dangerous seductions so that the gray dawn had already faintly appeared in the east while our delirious extravagance was at its height madly flushed with cards and intoxication i was in the act of insisting upon a toast of more than wonted profanity when my attention was suddenly diverted by the violent although partial unclosing of the door of the apartment and by the eager voice of a servant from without he said that some person apparently in great haste demanded to speak with me in the hall wildly excited with wine the unexpected interruption rather delighted than surprised me i staggered forward at once and a few steps brought me to the vestibule of the building in this low and small room there hung no lamp and now no light at all was admitted save that of the exceedingly feeble dawn which made its way through the semicircular window as i put my foot over the threshold i became aware of the figure of a youth about my own height and habited in a white kerseymere morning frock cut in the novel fashion of the one i myself wore at the moment this the faint light enabled me to perceive but the features of his face i could not distinguish upon my entering he strode hurriedly up to me and seizing me by the arm with a gesture of petulant impatience whispered the words william wilson in my ear i grew perfectly sober in an instant there was that in the manner of the stranger and in the tremulous shake of his uplifted finger as he held it between my eyes and the light which filled me with unqualified amazement but it was not this which had so violently moved me it was the pregnancy of solemn admonition in the singular low hissing utterance and above all it was the character the tone the key of those few simple and familiar yet whispered syllables which came with a thousand thronging memories of bygone days and struck upon my soul with the shock of a galvanic battery ere i could recover the use of my senses he was gone although this event failed not of a vivid effect upon my disordered imagination yet was it evanescent as vivid for some weeks indeed i busied myself in earnest inquiry or was wrapped in a cloud of morbid speculation i did not pretend to disguise from my perception the identity of the singular individual who thus perseveringly interfered with my affairs and harassed me with his insinuated counsel but who and what was this wilsonand whence came he and what were his purposes upon neither of these points could i be satisfiedmerely ascertaining in regard to him that a sudden accident in his family had caused his removal from dr bransbys academy on the afternoon of the day in which i myself had eloped but in a brief period i ceased to think upon the subject my attention being all absorbed in a contemplated departure for oxford thither i soon went the uncalculating vanity of my parents furnishing me with an outfit and annual establishment which would enable me to indulge at will in the luxury already so dear to my heartto vie in profuseness of expenditure with the haughtiest heirs of the wealthiest earldoms in great britain excited by such appliances to vice my constitutional temperament broke forth with redoubled ardor and i spurned even the common restraints of decency in the mad infatuation of my revels but it were absurd to pause in the detail of my extravagance let it suffice that among spendthrifts i outheroded herod and that giving name to a multitude of novel follies i added no brief appendix to the long catalogue of vices then usual in the most dissolute university of europe it could hardly be credited however that i had even here so utterly fallen from the gentlemanly estate as to seek acquaintance with the vilest arts of the gambler by profession and having become an adept in his despicable science to practice it habitually as a means of increasing my already enormous income at the expense of the weakminded among my fellowcollegians such nevertheless was the fact and the very enormity of this offence against all manly and honorable sentiment proved beyond doubt the main if not the sole reason of the impunity with which it was committed who indeed among my most abandoned associates would not rather have disputed the clearest evidence of his senses than have suspected of such courses the gay the frank the generous william wilsonthe noblest and most commoner at oxfordhim whose follies said his parasites were but the follies of youth and unbridled fancywhose errors but inimitable whimwhose darkest vice but a careless and dashing extravagance i had been now two years successfully busied in this way when there came to the university a young parvenu nobleman glendinningrich said report as herodes atticushis riches too as easily acquired i soon found him of weak intellect and of course marked him as a fitting subject for my skill i frequently engaged him in play and contrived with the gamblers usual art to let him win considerable sums the more effectually to entangle him in my snares at length my schemes being ripe i met him with the full intention that this meeting should be final and decisive at the chambers of a fellowcommoner mr preston equally intimate with both but who to do him justice entertained not even a remote suspicion of my design to give to this a better coloring i had contrived to have assembled a party of some eight or ten and was solicitously careful that the introduction of cards should appear accidental and originate in the proposal of my contemplated dupe himself to be brief upon a vile topic none of the low finesse was omitted so customary upon similar occasions that it is a just matter for wonder how any are still found so besotted as to fall its victim we had protracted our sitting far into the night and i had at length effected the manoeuvre of getting glendinning as my sole antagonist the game too was my favorite écarté the rest of the company interested in the extent of our play had abandoned their own cards and were standing around us as spectators the parvenu who had been induced by my artifices in the early part of the evening to drink deeply now shuffled dealt or played with a wild nervousness of manner for which his intoxication i thought might partially but could not altogether account in a very short period he had become my debtor to a large amount when having taken a long draught of port he did precisely what i had been coolly anticipatinghe proposed to double our already extravagant stakes with a wellfeigned show of reluctance and not until after my repeated refusal had seduced him into some angry words which gave a color of pique to my compliance did i finally comply the result of course did but prove how entirely the prey was in my toils in less than an hour he had quadrupled his debt for some time his countenance had been losing the florid tinge lent it by the wine but now to my astonishment i perceived that it had grown to a pallor truly fearful i say to my astonishment glendinning had been represented to my eager inquiries as immeasurably wealthy and the sums which he had as yet lost although in themselves vast could not i supposed very seriously annoy much less so violently affect him that he was overcome by the wine just swallowed was the idea which most readily presented itself and rather with a view to the preservation of my own character in the eyes of my associates than from any less interested motive i was about to insist peremptorily upon a discontinuance of the play when some expressions at my elbow from among the company and an ejaculation evincing utter despair on the part of glendinning gave me to understand that i had effected his total ruin under circumstances which rendering him an object for the pity of all should have protected him from the ill offices even of a fiend what now might have been my conduct it is difficult to say the pitiable condition of my dupe had thrown an air of embarrassed gloom over all and for some moments a profound silence was maintained during which i could not help feeling my cheeks tingle with the many burning glances of scorn or reproach cast upon me by the less abandoned of the party i will even own that an intolerable weight of anxiety was for a brief instant lifted from my bosom by the sudden and extraordinary interruption which ensued the wide heavy folding doors of the apartment were all at once thrown open to their full extent with a vigorous and rushing impetuosity that extinguished as if by magic every candle in the room their light in dying enabled us just to perceive that a stranger had entered about my own height and closely muffled in a cloak the darkness however was now total and we could only feel that he was standing in our midst before any one of us could recover from the extreme astonishment into which this rudeness had thrown all we heard the voice of the intruder gentlemen he said in a low distinct and nevertobeforgotten whisper which thrilled to the very marrow of my bones gentlemen i make an apology for this behavior because in thus behaving i am fulfilling a duty you are beyond doubt uninformed of the true character of the person who has tonight won at écarté a large sum of money from lord glendinning i will therefore put you upon an expeditious and decisive plan of obtaining this very necessary information please to examine at your leisure the inner linings of the cuff of his left sleeve and the several little packages which may be found in the somewhat capacious pockets of his embroidered morning wrapper while he spoke so profound was the stillness that one might have heard a pin drop upon the floor in ceasing he departed at once and as abruptly as he had entered can ishall i describe my sensations must i say that i felt all the horrors of the damned most assuredly i had little time given for reflection many hands roughly seized me upon the spot and lights were immediately reprocured a search ensued in the lining of my sleeve were found all the court cards essential in écarté and in the pockets of my wrapper a number of packs facsimiles of those used at our sittings with the single exception that mine were of the species called technically arrondees the honors being slightly convex at the ends the lower cards slightly convex at the sides in this disposition the dupe who cuts as customary at the length of the pack will invariably find that he cuts his antagonist an honor while the gambler cutting at the breadth will as certainly cut nothing for his victim which may count in the records of the game any burst of indignation upon this discovery would have affected me less than the silent contempt or the sarcastic composure with which it was received mr wilson said our host stooping to remove from beneath his feet an exceedingly luxurious cloak of rare furs mr wilson this is your property the weather was cold and upon quitting my own room i had thrown a cloak over my dressing wrapper putting it off upon reaching the scene of play i presume it is supererogatory to seek here eyeing the folds of the garment with a bitter smile for any farther evidence of your skill indeed we have had enough you will see the necessity i hope of quitting oxford at all events of quitting instantly my chambers abased humbled to the dust as i then was it is probable that i should have resented this galling language by immediate personal violence had not my whole attention been at the moment arrested by a fact of the most startling character the cloak which i had worn was of a rare description of fur how rare how extravagantly costly i shall not venture to say its fashion too was of my own fantastic invention for i was fastidious to an absurd degree of coxcombry in matters of this frivolous nature when therefore mr preston reached me that which he had picked up upon the floor and near the folding doors of the apartment it was with an astonishment nearly bordering upon terror that i perceived my own already hanging on my arm where i had no doubt unwittingly placed it and that the one presented me was but its exact counterpart in every in even the minutest possible particular the singular being who had so disastrously exposed me had been muffled i remembered in a cloak and none had been worn at all by any of the members of our party with the exception of myself retaining some presence of mind i took the one offered me by preston placed it unnoticed over my own left the apartment with a resolute scowl of defiance and next morning ere dawn of day commenced a hurried journey from oxford to the continent in a perfect agony of horror and of shame i fled in vain my evil destiny pursued me as if in exultation and proved indeed that the exercise of its mysterious dominion had as yet only begun scarcely had i set foot in paris ere i had fresh evidence of the detestable interest taken by this wilson in my concerns years flew while i experienced no relief villainat rome with how untimely yet with how spectral an officiousness stepped he in between me and my ambition at vienna tooat berlin and at moscow where in truth had i not bitter cause to curse him within my heart from his inscrutable tyranny did i at length flee panicstricken as from a pestilence and to the very ends of the earth i fled in vain and again and again in secret communion with my own spirit would i demand the questions who is hewhence came he and what are his objects but no answer was there found and now i scrutinized with a minute scrutiny the forms and the methods and the leading traits of his impertinent supervision but even here there was very little upon which to base a conjecture it was noticeable indeed that in no one of the multiplied instances in which he had of late crossed my path had he so crossed it except to frustrate those schemes or to disturb those actions which if fully carried out might have resulted in bitter mischief poor justification this in truth for an authority so imperiously assumed poor indemnity for natural rights of selfagency so pertinaciously so insultingly denied i had also been forced to notice that my tormentor for a very long period of time while scrupulously and with miraculous dexterity maintaining his whim of an identity of apparel with myself had so contrived it in the execution of his varied interference with my will that i saw not at any moment the features of his face be wilson what he might this at least was but the veriest of affectation or of folly could he for an instant have supposed that in my admonisher at etonin the destroyer of my honor at oxfordin him who thwarted my ambition at rome my revenge at paris my passionate love at naples or what he falsely termed my avarice in egyptthat in this my archenemy and evil genius i could fail to recognize the william wilson of my schoolboy daysthe namesake the companion the rivalthe hated and dreaded rival at dr bransbys impossiblebut let me hasten to the last eventful scene of the drama thus far i had succumbed supinely to this imperious domination the sentiment of deep awe with which i habitually regarded the elevated character the majestic wisdom the apparent omnipresence and omnipotence of wilson added to a feeling of even terror with which certain other traits in his nature and assumptions inspired me had operated hitherto to impress me with an idea of my own utter weakness and helplessness and to suggest an implicit although bitterly reluctant submission to his arbitrary will but of late days i had given myself up entirely to wine and its maddening influence upon my hereditary temper rendered me more and more impatient of control i began to murmurto hesitateto resist and was it only fancy which induced me to believe that with the increase of my own firmness that of my tormentor underwent a proportional diminution be this as it may i now began to feel the inspiration of a burning hope and at length nurtured in my secret thoughts a stern and desperate resolution that i would submit no longer to be enslaved it was at rome during the carnival of that i attended a masquerade in the palazzo of the neapolitan duke di broglio i had indulged more freely than usual in the excesses of the winetable and now the suffocating atmosphere of the crowded rooms irritated me beyond endurance the difficulty too of forcing my way through the mazes of the company contributed not a little to the ruffling of my temper for i was anxiously seeking let me not say with what unworthy motive the young the gay the beautiful wife of the aged and doting di broglio with a too unscrupulous confidence she had previously communicated to me the secret of the costume in which she would be habited and now having caught a glimpse of her person i was hurrying to make my way into her presence at this moment i felt a light hand placed upon my shoulder and that everremembered low damnable whisper within my ear in an absolute frenzy of wrath i turned at once upon him who had thus interrupted me and seized him violently by the collar he was attired as i had expected in a costume altogether similar to my own wearing a spanish cloak of blue velvet begirt about the waist with a crimson belt sustaining a rapier a mask of black silk entirely covered his face scoundrel i said in a voice husky with rage while every syllable i uttered seemed as new fuel to my fury scoundrel impostor accursed villain you shall notyou shall not dog me unto death follow me or i stab you where you standand i broke my way from the ballroom into a small antechamber adjoiningdragging him unresistingly with me as i went upon entering i thrust him furiously from me he staggered against the wall while i closed the door with an oath and commanded him to draw he hesitated but for an instant then with a slight sigh drew in silence and put himself upon his defence the contest was brief indeed i was frantic with every species of wild excitement and felt within my single arm the energy and power of a multitude in a few seconds i forced him by sheer strength against the wainscotting and thus getting him at mercy plunged my sword with brute ferocity repeatedly through and through his bosom at that instant some person tried the latch of the door i hastened to prevent an intrusion and then immediately returned to my dying antagonist but what human language can adequately portray that astonishment that horror which possessed me at the spectacle then presented to view the brief moment in which i averted my eyes had been sufficient to produce apparently a material change in the arrangements at the upper or farther end of the room a large mirrorso at first it seemed to me in my confusionnow stood where none had been perceptible before and as i stepped up to it in extremity of terror mine own image but with features all pale and dabbled in blood advanced to meet me with a feeble and tottering gait thus it appeared i say but was not it was my antagonistit was wilson who then stood before me in the agonies of his dissolution his mask and cloak lay where he had thrown them upon the floor not a thread in all his raimentnot a line in all the marked and singular lineaments of his face which was not even in the most absolute identity mine own it was wilson but he spoke no longer in a whisper and i could have fancied that i myself was speaking while he said you have conquered and i yield yet henceforward art thou also dead dead to the world to heaven and to hope in me didst thou existand in my death see by this image which is thine own how utterly thou hast murdered thyself identity crisis by lisa scottoline edgar allan poe was presented to me in high school the way he was probably presented to you as broccoli you know what i mean its good for you so you have to eat it youre fifteen craving french fries and cheeseburgers but all they have in the english syllabus is broccoli then they make you read it and try to convince you that reading is fundamental no wonder it doesnt work unfortunately high school broccoli is the way that lots of great writing gets introduced to us and the sad thing is that there could be french fries in there somewhere but wed never know it we dont always give it a chance we wont even taste it unless theres a pop quiz teenagers are the picky eaters of literature add to that the rebelliousness of youth especially of a girl like me i didnt do drugs and i didnt drink i had braces until senior year was president of the latin club and should have been most likely to achieve sainthood the only way i could rebel was to skip poe so i did and i confess here in this classy anthology for an organization i love among the writers i admire the most that i didnt read poe until i was an adult until i finally grew up and after my divorce had no one left to rebel against and when i won an edgar i felt like an impostor for never having read him i couldnt take the secret shame another minute so i picked up a copy of his collected works and read a few of the stories they were terrific but the one that stayed with me was william wilson and ill tell you why its the story of a schoolboy and at the very outset his identity is uncertain in fact poe starts the story let me call myself for the present william wilson the fair page lying before me need not be sullied with my real appellation think call me ishmael but more intriguing poe reportedly had an obsession with the color white but we wont go into the parallels between him and melville here suffice it to say that what happens in william wilson is as epic a battle as with any white whale but in poes story the nemesis may be the hero himself let me explain in the story william wilson meets a classmate who looks exactly like him the other boy has the same name and even the same birthday actually william specifies their shared birthday is the nineteenth of january which is poes own birthday hes the same height too they even enter the school on the same day by mere accident the only difference between them is that the other boy has some defect in his throat that prevents him from raising his voice above a very low whisper bottom line the other boy is the double or twin of william wilson the boys start out as uneasy friends then the double does everything to make himself more like william wilson except that he cant copy his voice completely william says his cue which was to perfect an imitation of myself lay both in words and in actions and most admirably did he play his part my dress it was an easy matter to copy my gait and general manner were without difficulty appropriated in spite of his constitutional defect even my voice did not escape him my louder tones were of course unattempted but then the keyit was identical and his singular whisper it grew the very echo of my own its single white female only with boys and of course a great twist instead of the main character being the good one and the double being the bad one in william wilson the narrator is the bad one and the double is the good one its so much more interesting and bolder imagine goofus and gallant with goofus as the storyteller isnt he more fun to listen to than the goodygoody gallant patricia highsmith in the ripley series and jeff lindsay in the dexter series would make the same wise choice though the first to do so may have been john milton whom you remember from your college broccoli in paradise lost wasnt satan more interesting than youknowwho but to stay on point in william wilson the title character is witty naughty and an effete bully he drinks too much he uses profanity he cheats at cards his double is nicer kinder and more considerate in every respect in time william wilson comes to dislike then hate his double he leaves school to get away from him then time passes and he goes to eton where one day he invites a small party of the most dissolute students to his room for a secret carousal bam in walks his double to spoil the fun william wilson says i grew perfectly sober in an instant the double is the buzz kill of the century william flees to oxford his thoughts haunted by his doppelgänger he says again and again in secret communion with my own spirit would i demand the questions who is hewhence came heand what are his objects but no answer was there found at war with itself williams psyche begins to disintegrate he lapses into chronic gambling drinking and further debauchery until we see him at another card game with an aristocratic dupe whom william plies with liquor to cheat him more easily suddenly the double reappears and blows williams cover exposing his hidden cards when he says please to examine at your leisure the inner linings of the cuff of his left sleeve and the several little packages which may be found in the somewhat capacious pockets of his embroidered morning wrapper busted william hurries to paris then to rome decompensating further and during a ball at carnival his lecherous eye falls upon the beautiful wife of a duke out of the blue the double appears this time masked and caped to thwart our heros misdeed the two fall into a sword fight and well i cant give away the surprise ending youre probably thinking that you can predict the ending but its more ambiguous than it first appears i think i have a good guess about what happens but i wont ruin it for you and sometimes im not sure my guess is right anyway i checked online to read criticisms of the storys ending but all i found was a web site called wikianswerscom which devotes an entire page to the ending of william wilson but asks only what does the tale william wilson by edgar allan poe mean show us your smarts help us answer this question i declined to show my smarts elsewhere on the web are comments from people confused by the storys ending and my favorite is from misternoel yk of cardiff wales who posted for anyone who has read this story could they perhaps explain what this story was about because i wasnt sure whether or not the two william wilsons were the same person or not or whether it was a jekyll and hyde kind of story or whether or not the narrator was obsessed with william wilson httpwwwonlineliteraturecomforumsshowthreadphpt so why do i think this story is so great and how does it speak to why poe himself was so great i think its in the pull of its terrific premise the doubling between william wilson and his lookalike as our friend misternoel yk says while its unclear whether william and his double are two halves of the same whole or in fact two separate people the effect is the same his fragmented or broken identity terrifies us at a profound level and when its the protagonist whos having an identity crisis were placed squarely in his very shaky shoes so its impossible to read william wilson and not identify with william feeling his anguish and his evil both at once and the threat is so much greater when it comes from within as in this story of psychological horror than from without as in a conventional ghost story poe must have known that no monster is half as scary as the evil within us and its tempting to wonder if he wrote what he knew considering his own personal unhappiness and the fact that he assigned william wilson his own birthday read that way the story is poignant indeed plus poe may not have invented the evil twin but he certainly anticipated it as well as the spookiness that comes from the fragmenting or doubling of the self and the splintering of identity sigmund freud would later explain the psychology at work here in his essay the uncanny written in but theres no doubt that the concept gives william wilson its dramatic impact and the hold that doubling has on our collective psyche is underlined by more recent examples in popular culture from benign sitcoms like the patty duke show to the comicbook conflict of spider man and his evil flip side venom think too of invasion of the body snatchers where the man looks like your husband but hes not your husband or vice versa in the stepford wives when the terrified wife stumbles upon her own replica robert ludlums jason bourne novels trade on the doubling concept when our hero flashes back on a self he doesnt know remember or even recognize bournes confusion about his own identity and about whether he is fundamentally good or evil echoes william wilson and theres even a hint of identity duality or a split self in stephen kings classic the shining in which a frustrated writer takes a job as a hotel caretaker loses his mind and tries to kill his family not only is the caretaker a double of a previous caretaker who had followed the same deranged path but we see how easily good dad crosses the median to become evil dad when a hotel and a blank page drive him crazy the blank page i know well in fact i was thinking of william wilson when i wrote my novels mistaken identity and dead ringer the main character in those books bennie rosato is a strong independent and clever woman whose life gets turned upside down when shes summoned to prison to meet with a lookalike inmatewho claims to be her longlost twin sister i didnt get the idea from poe i got it from my own life when i learned i had a half sister i didnt know about that she looked uncannily like me down to the blue eyes we both got from our father at first unsettled me at the deepest level and by the time we got to know each other i knew i had to write about the experience you cant have this job and ignore something like that or you forfeit your advance i reread william wilson for the inspiration to turn my life into fiction and though my half sister is a lovely person i made her into an evil twin with her permission the psychological journey that bennie rosato takes in my novels was informed not only by my own confused feelings but by those of the entirely fictional william wilson and i like to think they gave those novels an emotional truth so i owe edgar allan poe quite a lot thank you sir and happy birthday and what is the lesson in all this eat your vegetables lisa scottoline will admit that she got interested in edgar allan poe only after he got interested in her which is the story of her social life in general and perhaps why she is twice divorced after she won an edgar she picked up poes stories and fell in love with william wilson a great tale of dual identity she has mined that theme for many of her fifteen bestselling novels which is a nice way of saying that she steals from the best she has served on the board of mwa and teaches justice and fiction at the university of pennsylvania law school her alma mater she also writes a weekly column for the philadelphia inquirer because nine hundred words comes a lot easier than ninety thousand she still lives in her hometown philadelphia the rightful home of edgar allan poe but lets not get into that manuscript found in a bottle qui na plus quun moment a vivre na plus rien a dissimuler quinault atys of my country and of my family i have little to say ill usage and length of years have driven me from the one and estranged me from the other hereditary wealth afforded me an education of no common order and a contemplative turn of mind enabled me to methodize the stores which early study very diligently garnered up beyond all things the works of the german moralists gave me great delight not from any illadvised admiration of their eloquent madness but from the ease with which my habits of rigid thought enabled me to detect their falsities i have often been reproached with the aridity of my genius a deficiency of imagination has been imputed to me as a crime and the pyrrhonism of my opinions has at all times rendered me notorious indeed a strong relish for physical philosophy has i fear tinctured my mind with a very common error of this agei mean the habit of referring occurrences even the least susceptible of such reference to the principles of that science upon the whole no person could be less liable than myself to be led away from the severe precincts of truth by the ignes fatui of superstition i have thought proper to premise thus much lest the incredible tale i have to tell should be considered rather the raving of a crude imagination than the positive experience of a mind to which the reveries of fancy have been a dead letter and a nullity after many years spent in foreign travel i sailed in the year from the port of batavia in the rich and populous island of java on a voyage to the archipelago islands i went as passengerhaving no other inducement than a kind of nervous restlessness which haunted me as a fiend our vessel was a beautiful ship of about four hundred tons copperfastened and built at bombay of malabar teak she was freighted with cottonwool and oil from the lachadive islands we had also on board coir jaggeree ghee cocoanuts and a few cases of opium the stowage was clumsily done and the vessel consequently crank we got under way with a mere breath of wind and for many days stood along the eastern coast of java without any other incident to beguile the monotony of our course than the occasional meeting with some of the small grabs of the archipelago to which we were bound one evening leaning over the taffrail i observed a very singular isolated cloud to the nw it was remarkable as well from its color as from its being the first we had seen since our departure from batavia i watched it attentively until sunset when it spread all at once to the eastward and westward girting in the horizon with a narrow strip of vapor and looking like a long line of low beach my notice was soon afterwards attracted by the duskyred appearance of the moon and the peculiar character of the sea the latter was undergoing a rapid change and the water seemed more than usually transparent although i could distinctly see the bottom yet heaving the lead i found the ship in fifteen fathoms the air now became intolerably hot and was loaded with spiral exhalations similar to those arising from heated iron as night came on every breath of wind died away and a more entire calm it is impossible to conceive the flame of a candle burned upon the poop without the least perceptible motion and a long hair held between the finger and thumb hung without the possibility of detecting a vibration however as the captain said he could perceive no indication of danger and as we were drifting in bodily to shore he ordered the sails to be furled and the anchor let go no watch was set and the crew consisting principally of malays stretched themselves deliberately upon deck i went belownot without a full presentiment of evil indeed every appearance warranted me in apprehending a simoom i told the captain my fears but he paid no attention to what i said and left me without deigning to give a reply my uneasiness however prevented me from sleeping and about midnight i went upon deck as i placed my foot upon the upper step of the companionladder i was startled by a loud humming noise like that occasioned by the rapid revolution of a millwheel and before i could ascertain its meaning i found the ship quivering to its centre in the next instant a wilderness of foam hurled us upon our beamends and rushing over us fore and aft swept the entire decks from stem to stern the extreme fury of the blast proved in a great measure the salvation of the ship although completely waterlogged yet as her masts had gone by the board she rose after a minute heavily from the sea and staggering awhile beneath the immense pressure of the tempest finally righted by what miracle i escaped destruction it is impossible to say stunned by the shock of the water i found myself upon recovery jammed in between the sternpost and rudder with great difficulty i gained my feet and looking dizzily around was at first struck with the idea of our being among breakers so terrific beyond the wildest imagination was the whirlpool of mountainous and foaming ocean within which we were engulfed after a while i heard the voice of an old swede who had shipped with us at the moment of our leaving port i hallooed to him with all my strength and presently he came reeling aft we soon discovered that we were the sole survivors of the accident all on deck with the exception of ourselves had been swept overboard the captain and mates must have perished as they slept for the cabins were deluged with water without assistance we could expect to do little for the security of the ship and our exertions were at first paralyzed by the momentary expectation of going down our cable had of course parted like packthread at the first breath of the hurricane or we should have been instantaneously overwhelmed we scudded with frightful velocity before the sea and the water made clear breaches over us the framework of our stern was shattered excessively and in almost every respect we had received considerable injury but to our extreme joy we found the pumps unchoked and that we had made no great shifting of our ballast the main fury of the blast had already blown over and we apprehended little danger from the violence of the wind but we looked forward to its total cessation with dismay well believing that in our shattered condition we should inevitably perish in the tremendous swell which would ensue but this very just apprehension seemed by no means likely to be soon verified for five entire days and nights during which our only subsistence was a small quantity of jaggeree procured with great difficulty from the forecastlethe hulk flew at a rate defying computation before rapidly succeeding flaws of wind which without equalling the first violence of the simoom were still more terrific than any tempest i had before encountered our course for the first four days was with trifling variations se and by s and we must have run down the coast of new holland in the fifth day the cold became extreme although the wind had hauled round a point more to the northward the sun arose with a sickly yellow lustre and clambered a very few degrees above the horizonemitting no decisive light there were no clouds apparent yet the wind was upon the increase and blew with a fitful and unsteady fury about noon as nearly as we could guess our attention was again arrested by the appearance of the sun it gave out no light properly so called but a dull and sullen glow without reflection as if all its rays were polarized just before sinking within the turgid sea its central fires suddenly went out as if hurriedly extinguished by some unaccountable power it was a dim silverlike rim alone as it rushed down the unfathomable ocean we waited in vain for the arrival of the sixth daythat day to me has not yet arrivedto the swede never did arrive thenceforward we were enshrouded in patchy darkness so that we could not have seen an object at twenty paces from the ship eternal night continued to envelop us all unrelieved by the phosphoric seabrilliancy to which we had been accustomed in the tropics we observed too that although the tempest continued to rage with unabated violence there was no longer to be discovered the usual appearance of surf or foam which had hitherto attended us all around were horror and thick gloom and a black sweltering desert of ebony superstitious terror crept by degrees into the spirit of the old swede and my own soul was wrapped up in silent wonder we neglected all care of the ship as worse than useless and securing ourselves as well as possible to the stump of the mizzenmast looked out bitterly into the world of ocean we had no means of calculating time nor could we form any guess of our situation we were however well aware of having made farther to the southward than any previous navigators and felt great amazement at not meeting with the usual impediments of ice in the meantime every moment threatened to be our lastevery mountainous billow hurried to overwhelm us the swell surpassed anything i had imagined possible and that we were not instantly buried is a miracle my companion spoke of the lightness of our cargo and reminded me of the excellent qualities of our ship but i could not help feeling the utter hopelessness of hope itself and prepared myself gloomily for that death which i thought nothing could defer beyond an hour as with every knot of way the ship made the swelling of the black stupendous seas became more dismally appalling at times we gasped for breath at an elevation beyond the albatrossat times became dizzy with the velocity of our descent into some watery hell where the air grew stagnant and no sound disturbed the slumbers of the kraken we were at the bottom of one of these abysses when a quick scream from my companion broke fearfully upon the night see see cried he shrieking in my ears almighty god see see as he spoke i became aware of a dull sullen glare of red light which streamed down the sides of the vast chasm where we lay and threw a fitful brilliancy upon our deck casting my eyes upwards i beheld a spectacle which froze the current of my blood at a terrific height directly above us and upon the very verge of the precipitous descent hovered a gigantic ship of perhaps four thousand tons although upreared upon the summit of a wave more than a hundred times her own altitude her apparent size exceeded that of any ship of the line or east indiaman in existence her huge hull was of a deep dingy black unrelieved by any of the customary carvings of a ship a single row of brass cannon protruded from her open ports and dashed from their polished surfaces the fires of innumerable battlelanterns which swung to and fro about her rigging but what mainly inspired us with horror and astonishment was that she bore up under a press of sail in the very teeth of that supernatural sea and of that ungovernable hurricane when we first discovered her her bows were alone to be seen as she rose slowly from the dim and horrible gulf beyond her for a moment of intense terror she paused upon the giddy pinnacle as if in contemplation of her own sublimity then trembled and tottered andcame down at this instant i know not what sudden selfpossession came over my spirit staggering as far aft as i could i awaited fearlessly the ruin that was to overwhelm our own vessel was at length ceasing from her struggles and sinking with her head to the sea the shock of the descending mass struck her consequently in that portion of her frame which was already under water and the inevitable result was to hurl me with irresistible violence upon the rigging of the stranger as i fell the ship hove in stays and went about and to the confusion ensuing i attributed my escape from the notice of the crew with little difficulty i made my way unperceived to the main hatchway which was partially open and soon found an opportunity of secreting myself in the hold why i did so i can hardly tell an indefinite sense of awe which at first sight of the navigators of the ship had taken hold of my mind was perhaps the principle of my concealment i was unwilling to trust myself with a race of people who had offered to the cursory glance i had taken so many points of vague novelty doubt and apprehension i therefore thought proper to contrive a hidingplace in the hold this i did by removing a small portion of the shiftingboards in such a manner as to afford me a convenient retreat between the huge timbers of the ship i had scarcely completed my work when a footstep in the hold forced me to make use of it a man passed by my place of concealment with a feeble and unsteady gait i could not see his face but had an opportunity of observing his general appearance there was about it an evidence of great age and infirmity his knees tottered beneath a load of years and his entire frame quivered under the burthen he muttered to himself in a low broken tone some words of a language which i could not understand and groped in a corner among a pile of singularlooking instruments and decayed charts of navigation his manner was a wild mixture of the peevishness of second childhood and the solemn dignity of a god he at length went on deck and i saw him no more a feeling for which i have no name has taken possession of my soula sensation which will admit of no analysis to which the lessons of bygone times are inadequate and for which i fear futurity itself will offer me no key to a mind constituted like my own the latter consideration is an evil i shall neveri know that i shall neverbe satisfied with regard to the nature of my conceptions yet it is not wonderful that these conceptions are indefinite since they have their origin in sources so utterly novel a new sensea new entity is added to my soul it is long since i first trod the deck of this terrible ship and the rays of my destiny are i think gathering to a focus incomprehensible men wrapped up in meditations of a kind which i cannot divine they pass me by unnoticed concealment is utter folly on my part for the people will not see it is but just now that i passed directly before the eyes of the mate it was no long while ago that i ventured into the captains own private cabin and took thence the materials with which i write and have written i shall from time to time continue this journal it is true that i may not find an opportunity of transmitting it to the world but i will not fail to make the endeavor at the last moment i will enclose the ms in a bottle and cast it within the sea an incident has occurred which has given me new room for meditation are such things the operation of ungoverned chance i had ventured upon deck and thrown myself down without attracting any notice among a pile of ratlinstuff and old sails in the bottom of the yawl while musing upon the singularity of my fate i unwittingly daubed with a tarbrush the edges of a neatlyfolded studdingsail which lay near me on a barrel the studdingsail is now bent upon the ship and the thoughtless touches of the brush are spread out into the word discovery i have made many observations lately upon the structure of the vessel although well armed she is not i think a ship of war her rigging build and general equipment all negative a supposition of this kind what she is not i can easily perceive what she is i fear it is impossible to say i know not how it is but in scrutinizing her strange model and singular cast of spars her huge size and overgrown suits of canvas her severely simple bow and antiquated stern there will occasionally flash across my mind a sensation of familiar things and there is always mixed up with such indistinct shadows of recollection an unaccountable memory of old foreign chronicles and ages long ago i have been looking at the timbers of the ship she is built of a material to which i am a stranger there is a peculiar character about the wood which strikes me as rendering it unfit for the purpose to which it has been applied i mean its extreme porousness considered independently by the wormeaten condition which is a consequence of navigation in these seas and apart from the rottenness attendant upon age it will appear perhaps an observation somewhat overcurious but this would have every characteristic of spanish oak if spanish oak were distended by any unnatural means in reading the above sentence a curious apothegm of an old weatherbeaten dutch navigator comes full upon my recollection it is as sure he was wont to say when any doubt was entertained of his veracity as sure as there is a sea where the ship itself will grow in bulk like the living body of the seaman about an hour ago i made bold to trust myself among a group of the crew they paid me no manner of attention and although i stood in the very midst of them all seemed utterly unconscious of my presence like the one i had at first seen in the hold they all bore about them the marks of a hoary old age their knees trembled with infirmity their shoulders were bent double with decrepitude their shrivelled skins rattled in the wind their voices were low tremulous and broken their eyes glistened with the rheum of years and their gray hairs streamed terribly in the tempest around them on every part of the deck lay scattered mathematical instruments of the most quaint and obsolete construction i mentioned some time ago the bending of a studdingsail from that period the ship being thrown dead off the wind has continued her terrific course due south with every rag of canvas packed upon her from her trucks to her lower studdingsail booms and rolling every moment her topgallant yardarms into the most appalling hell of water which it can enter into the mind of man to imagine i have just left the deck where i find it impossible to maintain a footing although the crew seem to experience little inconvenience it appears to me a miracle of miracles that our enormous bulk is not swallowed up at once and forever we are surely doomed to hover continually upon the brink of eternity without taking a final plunge into the abyss from billows a thousand times more stupendous than any i have ever seen we glide away with the facility of the arrowy seagull and the colossal waters rear their heads above us like demons of the deep but like demons confined to simple threats and forbidden to destroy i am led to attribute these frequent escapes to the only natural cause which can account for such effect i must suppose the ship to be within the influence of some strong current or impetuous undertow i have seen the captain face to face and in his own cabinbut as i expected he paid me no attention although in his appearance there is to a casual observer nothing which might bespeak him more or less than man still a feeling of irrepressible reverence and awe mingled with the sensation of wonder with which i regarded him in stature he is nearly my own height that is about five feet eight inches he is of a wellknit and compact frame of body neither robust nor remarkably otherwise but it is the singularity of the expression which reigns upon the faceit is the intense the wonderful the thrilling evidence of old age so utter so extreme which excites within my spirit a sensea sentiment ineffable his forehead although little wrinkled seems to bear upon it the stamp of a myriad of years his gray hairs are records of the past and his grayer eyes are sybils of the future the cabin floor was thickly strewn with strange ironclasped folios and mouldering instruments of science and obsolete longforgotten charts his head was bowed down upon his hands and he pored with a fiery unquiet eye over a paper which i took to be a commission and which at all events bore the signature of a monarch he muttered to himselfas did the first seaman whom i saw in the holdsome low peevish syllables of a foreign tongue and although the speaker was close at my elbow his voice seemed to reach my ears from the distance of a mile the ship and all in it are imbued with the spirit of eld the crew glide to and fro like the ghosts of buried centuries their eyes have an eager and uneasy meaning and when their fingers fall athwart my path in the wild glare of the battlelanterns i feel as i have never felt before although i have been all my life a dealer in antiquities and have imbibed the shadows of fallen columns at balbec and tadmor and persepolis until my very soul has become a ruin when i look around me i feel ashamed of my former apprehensions if i trembled at the blast which has hitherto attended us shall i not stand aghast at a warring of wind and ocean to convey any idea of which the words tornado and simoom are trivial and ineffective all in the immediate vicinity of the ship is the blackness of eternal night and a chaos of foamless water but about a league on either side of us may be seen indistinctly and at intervals stupendous ramparts of ice towering away into the desolate sky and looking like the walls of the universe as i imagined the ship proves to be in a currentif that appellation can properly be given to a tide which howling and shrieking by the white ice thunders on to the southward with a velocity like the headlong dashing of a cataract to conceive the horror of my sensations is i presume utterly impossible yet a curiosity to penetrate the mysteries of these awful regions predominates even over my despair and will reconcile me to the most hideous aspect of death it is evident that we are hurrying onwards to some exciting knowledgesome nevertobeimparted secret whose attainment is destruction perhaps this current leads us to the southern pole itself it must be confessed that a supposition apparently so wild has every probability in its favor the crew pace the deck with unquiet and tremulous step but there is upon their countenances an expression more of the eagerness of hope than of the apathy of despair in the meantime the wind is still in our poop and as we carry a crowd of canvas the ship is at times lifted bodily from out the sea oh horror upon horrorthe ice opens suddenly to the right and to the left and we are whirling dizzily in immense concentric circles round and round the borders of a gigantic amphitheatre the summit of whose walls is lost in the darkness and the distance but little time will be left me to ponder upon my destiny the circles rapidly grow smallwe are plunging madly within the grasp of the whirlpooland amid a roaring and bellowing and thundering of ocean and of tempest the ship is quivering oh god andgoing down in a strange city baltimore and the poe toaster by laura lippman lo death has reared itself a throne in a strange city lying alone edgar allan poe the city by the sea i admit the name is regrettable the poe toaster can anyone say it without first picturing that old screen saver the one with winged toasters shuttling through the cosmos only this time adorned with little mustaches and those famously melancholy eyes but the first thing you need to know is that the poe toaster is not an appliance but a person one charged with a sacred duty the annual visit to poes grave in the westminster burying ground admittedly many of baltimore s tributes to poe seem just a little off his original grave site was unmarked for years then we have the ravens the nfl team that my hometown stole from cleveland there is the longshuttered telltale hearth a decent pizza joint in its day and edgars club a billiards joint on the baltimore skywalk which is everything one might expect in a billiards joint on the baltimore skywalk there is the omnipresent squad car parked outside the poe house in case a tourist loses his way there are the poe homes a housing project where the tourists are on their own there is the fact that weve torn down the hospital where poe died failing to salvage a single item and then there is the memorial erected to poe in almost thirty years after his death on it the date of poes birthday is wrong off by a day the poe toaster does not come to this site thats the second thing you need to know the poe toaster visits the original grave at the rear of the old cemetery in downtown baltimore he arrives between midnight and a m on january for the poe toaster is not confused about the date of poes birthand leaves three red roses and a half bottle of cognac cognac a toast hence the poe toaster yet no one except the poe toaster knows why he does this the precise significance of those items or even how many people have assumed the mantle of poe toaster since the custom began in precisely one hundred years after poes mysterious death in baltimore a man in a nursing home came forward in the summer of claiming that he started the whole thing but his version of events was so full of holes and inconsistencies that it would have been more polite to ignore him entirely if only the local newspaper had shared that opinion this is what we know the visits started in a note was left in suggesting the torch had been passed at least once if not twice in another note was left but this one was silly exhorting the new york giants to a super bowl win over the ravens hmmm i have always found that one a little dubious but in i was there and i can describe very precisely what happened onlyi wont because that is part of the promise i made to jeff jerome the poe house curator who granted me entry to the annual watch party an invitation he controls because the church is now a concert hall owned by the university of maryland oh anyone can go to the corner of fayette and greene and wait in what is usually a frigid night for a glimpse of the visitor go ahead hang out on a corner in baltimore at a m i dare you if you do you will find that the sight lines from the street are compromised especially since the construction of a new building behind the graveyard you can see poes second grave easily enough from outside the gates but not the original one in i was the one who saw the poe toaster first thats the way i remember it but i bet everyone who was there that night thinks they had the first glimpse i was in the right location though a secondstory window that afforded a wideopen view of the graveyard it was a dreamlike moment watching him approach for he really did seem to appear out of thin air his clothing his aspect how he moved the route by which he lefti could probably share those things without breaking my promise to jerome again i wont they belong to me and the others who were there i suppose there are people who think it would be great sport to unmask the toaster just as there are probably people who think it would be fun to tell young children that there is no santa claus and by the way youre not going to grow up to be a fireman or a ballerina either all i can say is that ive never known of a true baltimoreanoutside of an elderly man in a nursing homewho wants to unmask the visitor the mystery is what makes it special every january i awake with a queasy sensation did he come is it over so far so good baltimore has a strange relationship with poe the city gave him an important leg up when in a panel of judges here granted the struggling young writer a prize for his story manuscript found in a bottle but he didnt write any of his bestknown works in the brief time he lived here on amity street instead baltimore s primary claim to poe is that he died here under mysterious circumstances the last time i checked there were more than twenty competing theories about poes death some have been knocked down definitively rabies others are more plausible but not provable coopingthe idea that poe was rewarded with drink for voting repeatedly in a baltimore election then beaten some are just preposterous sexual impotence only if a man can literally die of embarrassment then there is the theory of all theoriesthat poes body isnt even in his grave that it was carried off by corpseneedy medical students long before the memorial was built this idea too has been largely discredited but it comes back to life again and again a monster that cannot be slain in on the sesquicentennial weekend of poes death i traveled to a symposium in richmond a city that canand doesmake a good case for its ownership of poe everyone wants a piece of poe i scribbled in my reporters notebook the poe scholars are a contentious lot proudly so they agree to disagree about virtually everything almost a decade later much of what i learned that weekend has vanished from my poor porous memory the only impressions i retain are a lecture on the problem of translating the raven into italian the literal translation of nevermore was aurally inelegant requiring a substitute and my utter confusion at the vocabulary of literary criticism some of which sailed so far over my head that i sat through an entire lecture with only these notes to show for my attendance something about the xfiles and wittgenstein what but my ignorance does not void the fact that i too have my piece of poe a moonless night the view of a graveyard through the window of an old church a figure approaches how do you imagine him young old dressed in a cape or clad so as to attract no attention on a modern city street tall short thin fat male female how does he move stealthily or with a grand swagger is he capable of a quickness that suggests a younger man or does he move with the stiffness of age does he saunter out the front gates or make a more devious exit this much i will tell youyes laura lippman is the new york times bestselling author of thirteen novels and a shortstory collection she has been nominated for the edgar five times and won the award in for charm city a book in which one character fronts a band called poe white trash the fall of the house of usher son coeur est un luth suspendu sitôt quon le touché il résonne de béranger during the whole of a dull dark and soundless day in the autumn of the year when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens i had been passing alone on horseback through a singularly dreary tract of country and at length found myself as the shades of the evening drew on within view of the melancholy house of usher i know not how it wasbut with the first glimpse of the building a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit i say insufferable for the feeling was unrelieved by any of that halfpleasurable because poetic sentiment with which the mind usually receives even the sternest natural images of the desolate or terrible i looked upon the scene before meupon the mere house and the simple landscape features of the domain upon the bleak wallsupon the vacant eyelike windowsupon a few rank sedgesand upon a few white trunks of decayed trees with an utter depression of soul which i can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the afterdream of the reveller upon opiumthe bitter lapse into everyday lifethe hideous dropping off of the veil there was an iciness a sinking a sickening of the heartan unredeemed dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture into aught of the sublime what was iti paused to thinkwhat was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the house of usher it was a mystery all insoluble nor could i grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as i pondered i was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion that while beyond doubt there are combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus affecting us still the analysis of this power lies among considerations beyond our depth it was possible i reflected that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene of the details of the picture would be sufficient to modify or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression and acting upon this idea i reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling and gazed downbut with a shudder even more thrilling than before upon the remodelled and inverted images of the gray sedge and the ghastly treestems and the vacant and eyelike windows nevertheless in this mansion of gloom i now proposed to myself a sojourn of some weeks its proprietor roderick usher had been one of my boon companions in boyhood but many years had elapsed since our last meeting a letter however had lately reached me in a distant part of the countrya letter from himwhich in its wildly importunate nature had admitted of no other than a personal reply the ms gave evidence of nervous agitation the writer spoke of acute bodily illnessof a mental disorder which oppressed him and of an earnest desire to see me as his best and indeed his only personal friend with a view of attempting by the cheerfulness of my society some alleviation of his malady it was the manner in which all this and much more was saidit was the apparent heart that went with his requestwhich allowed me no room for hesitation and i accordingly obeyed forthwith what i still considered a very singular summons although as boys we had been even intimate associates yet i really knew little of my friend his reserve had been always excessive and habitual i was aware however that his very ancient family had been noted time out of mind for a peculiar sensibility of temperament displaying itself through long ages in many works of exalted art and manifested of late in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies perhaps even more than to the orthodox and easily recognizable beauties of musical science i had learned too the very remarkable fact that the stem of the usher race all timehonored as it was had put forth at no period any enduring branch in other words that the entire family lay in the direct line of descent and had always with very trifling and very temporary variation so lain it was this deficiency i considered while running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises with the accredited character of the people and while speculating upon the possible influence which the one in the long lapse of centuries might have exercised upon the otherit was this deficiency perhaps of collateral issue and the consequent undeviating transmission from sire to son of the patrimony with the name which had at length so identified the two as to merge the original title of the estate in the quaint and equivocal appellation of the house of usheran appellation which seemed to include in the minds of the peasantry who used it both the family and the family mansion i have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experimentthat of looking down within the tarnhad been to deepen the first singular impression there can be no doubt that the consciousness of the rapid increase of my superstitionfor why should i not so term itserved mainly to accelerate the increase itself such i have long known is the paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as a basis and it might have been for this reason only that when i again uplifted my eyes to the house itself from its image in the pool there grew in my mind a strange fancya fancy so ridiculous indeed that i but mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which oppressed me i had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that about the whole mansion and domain there hung an atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinityan atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven but which had reeked up from the decayed trees and the gray wall and the silent tarna pestilent and mystic vapor dull sluggish faintly discernible and leadenhued shaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream i scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building its principal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity the discoloration of ages had been great minute fungi overspread the whole exterior hanging in a fine tangled webwork from the eaves yet all this was apart from any extraordinary dilapidation no portion of the masonry had fallen and there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect adaptation of parts and the crumbling condition of the individual stones in this there was much that reminded me of the specious totality of old woodwork which has rotted for long years in some neglected vault with no disturbance from the breath of the external air beyond this indication of extensive decay however the fabric gave little token of instability perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might have discovered a barely perceptible fissure which extending from the roof of the building in front made its way down the wall in a zigzag direction until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn noticing these things i rode over a short causeway to the house a servant in waiting took my horse and i entered the gothic archway of the hall a valet of stealthy step thence conducted me in silence through many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the studio of his master much that i encountered on the way contributed i know not how to heighten the vague sentiments of which i have already spoken while the objects around mewhile the carvings of the ceilings the sombre tapestries of the walls the ebon blackness of the floors and the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as i strode were but matters to which or to such as which i had been accustomed from my infancywhile i hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was all thisi still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which ordinary images were stirring up on one of the staircases i met the physician of the family his countenance i thought wore a mingled expression of low cunning and perplexity he accosted me with trepidation and passed on the valet now threw open a door and ushered me into the presence of his master the room in which i found myself was very large and lofty the windows were long narrow and pointed and at so vast a distance from the black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within feeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their way through the trellissed panes and served to render sufficiently distinct the more prominent objects around the eye however struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of the chamber or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling dark draperies hung upon the walls the general furniture was profuse comfortless antique and tattered many books and musical instruments lay scattered about but failed to give any vitality to the scene i felt that i breathed an atmosphere of sorrow an air of stern deep and irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all upon my entrance usher arose from a sofa on which he had been lying at full length and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in it i at first thought of an overdone cordiality of the constrained effort of the ennuyé man of the world a glance however at his countenance convinced me of his perfect sincerity we sat down and for some moments while he spoke not i gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity half of awe surely man had never before so terribly altered in so brief a period as had roderick usher it was with difficulty that i could bring myself to admit the identity of the wan being before me with the companion of my early boyhood yet the character of his face had been at all times remarkable a cadaverousness of complexion an eye large liquid and luminous beyond comparison lips somewhat thin and very pallid but of a surpassingly beautiful curve a nose of a delicate hebrew model but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations a finely moulded chin speaking in its want of prominence of a want of moral energy hair of a more than weblike softness and tenuitythese features with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the temple made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten and now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character of these features and of the expression they were wont to convey lay so much of change that i doubted to whom i spoke the now ghastly pallor of the skin and the now miraculous lustre of the eye above all things startled and even awed me the silken hair too had been suffered to grow all unheeded and as in its wild gossamer texture it floated rather than fell about the face i could not even with effort connect its arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity in the manner of my friend i was at once struck with an incoherencean inconsistency and i soon found this to arise from a series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an habitual trepidancy an excessive nervous agitation for something of this nature i had indeed been prepared no less by his letter than by reminiscences of certain boyish traits and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical conformation and temperament his action was alternately vivacious and sullen his voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision when the animal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance to that species of energetic concisionthat abrupt weighty unhurried and hollowsounding enunciationthat leaden selfbalanced and perfectly modulated guttural utterance which may be observed in the lost drunkard or the irreclaimable eater of opium during the periods of his most intense excitement it was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit of his earnest desire to see me and of the solace he expected me to afford him he entered at some length into what he conceived to be the nature of his malady it was he said a constitutional and a family evil and one for which he despaired to find a remedya mere nervous affection he immediately added which would undoubtedly soon pass off it displayed itself in a host of unnatural sensations some of these as he detailed them interested and bewildered me although perhaps the terms and the general manner of the narration had their weight he suffered much from a morbid acuteness of the senses the most insipid food was alone endurable he could wear only garments of certain texture the odors of all flowers were oppressive his eyes were tortured by even a faint light and there were but peculiar sounds and these from stringed instruments which did not inspire him with horror to an anomalous species of terror i found him a bounden slave i shall perish said he i must perish in this deplorable folly thus thus and not otherwise shall i be lost i dread the events of the future not in themselves but in their results i shudder at the thought of any even the most trivial incident which may operate upon this intolerable agitation of soul i have indeed no abhorrence of danger except in its absolute effectin terror in this unnerved in this pitiable conditioni feel that the period will sooner or later arrive when i must abandon life and reason together in some struggle with the grim phantasm fear i learned moreover at intervals and through broken and equivocal hints another singular feature of his mental condition he was enchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the dwelling which he tenanted and whence for many years he had never ventured forthin regard to an influence whose supposititious force was conveyed in terms too shadowy here to be restatedan influence which some peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family mansion had by dint of long sufferance he said obtained over his spiritan effect which the physique of the gray walls and turrets and of the dim tarn into which they all looked down had at length brought about upon the morale of his existence he admitted however although with hesitation that much of the peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more natural and far more palpable originto the severe and longcontinued illnessindeed to the evidently approaching dissolution of a tenderly beloved sisterhis sole companion for long yearshis last and only relative on earth her decease he said with a bitterness which i can never forget would leave him him the hopeless and the frail the last of the ancient race of the ushers while he spoke the lady madeline for so was she called passed slowly through a remote portion of the apartment and without having noticed my presence disappeared i regarded her with an utter astonishment not unmingled with dreadand yet i found it impossible to account for such feelings a sensation of stupor oppressed me as my eyes followed her retreating steps when a door at length closed upon her my glance sought instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the brotherbut he had buried his face in his hands and i could only perceive that a far more than ordinary wanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many passionate tears the disease of the lady madeline had long baffled the skill of her physicians a settled apathy a gradual wasting away of the person and frequent although transient affections of a partially cataleptical character were the unusual diagnosis hitherto she had steadily borne up against the pressure of her malady and had not betaken herself finally to bed but on the closing in of the evening of my arrival at the house she succumbed as her brother told me at night with inexpressible agitation to the prostrating power of the destroyer and i learned that the glimpse i had obtained of her person would thus probably be the last i should obtainthat the lady at least while living would be seen by me no more for several days ensuing her name was unmentioned by either usher or myself and during this period i was busied in earnest endeavors to alleviate the melancholy of my friend we painted and read together or i listened as if in a dream to the wild improvisations of his speaking guitar and thus as a closer and still closer intimacy admitted me more unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit the more bitterly did i perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which darkness as if an inherent positive quality poured forth upon all objects of the moral and physical universe in one unceasing radiation of gloom i shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours i thus spent alone with the master of the house of usher yet i should fail in any attempt to convey an idea of the exact character of the studies or of the occupations in which he involved me or led me the way an excited and highly distempered ideality threw a sulphureous lustre over all his long improvised dirges will ring forever in my ears among other things i hold painfully in mind a certain singular perversion and amplification of the wild air of the last waltz of von weber from the paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded and which grew touch by touch into vaguenesses at which i shuddered the more thrillingly because i shuddered knowing not whyfrom these paintings vivid as their images now are before me i would in vain endeavor to educe more than a small portion which should lie within the compass of merely written words by the utter simplicity by the nakedness of his designs he arrested and overawed attention if ever mortal painted an idea that mortal was roderick usher for me at leastin the circumstances then surrounding methere arose out of the pure abstractions which the hypochondriac contrived to throw upon his canvas an intensity of intolerable awe no shadow of which felt i ever yet in the contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too concrete reveries of fuseli one of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend partaking not so rigidly of the spirit of abstraction may be shadowed forth although feebly in words a small picture presented the interior of an immensely long and rectangular vault or tunnel with low walls smooth white and without interruption or device certain accessory points of the design served well to convey the idea that this excavation lay at an exceeding depth below the surface of the earth no outlet was observed in any portion of its vast extent and no torch or other artificial source of light was discernible yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout and bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendor i have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve which rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer with the exception of certain effects of stringed instruments it was perhaps the narrow limits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar which gave birth in great measure to the fantastic character of his performances but the fervid facility of his impromptus could not be so accounted for they must have been and were in the notes as well as in the words of his wild fantasias for he not unfrequently accompanied himself with rhymed verbal improvisations the result of that intense mental collectedness and concentration to which i have previously alluded as observable only in particular moments of the highest artificial excitement the words of one of these rhapsodies i have easily remembered i was perhaps the more forcibly impressed with it as he gave it because in the under or mystic current of its meaning i fancied that i perceived and for the first time a full consciousness on the part of usher of the tottering of his lofty reason upon her throne the verses which were entitled the haunted palace ran very nearly if not accurately thus i in the greenest of our valleys by good angels tenanted once a fair and stately palace radiant palacereared its head in the monarch thoughts dominion it stood there never seraph spread a pinion over fabric half so fair ii banners yellow glorious golden on its roof did float and flow thisall thiswas in the olden time long ago and every gentle air that dallied in that sweet day along the ramparts plumed and pallid a winged odor went away iii wanderers in that happy valley through two luminous windows saw spirits moving musically to a lutes welltunéd law round about a throne where sitting porphyrogene in state his glory well befitting the ruler of the realm was seen iv and all with pearl and ruby glowing was the fair palace door through which came flowing flowing flowing and sparkling evermore a troop of echoes whose sweet duty was but to sing in voices of surpassing beauty the wit and wisdom of their king v but evil things in robes of sorrow assailed the monarchs high estate ah let us mourn for never morrow shall dawn upon him desolate and round about his home the glory that blushed and bloomed is but a dimremembered story of the old time entombed vi and travellers now within that valley through the redlitten windows see vast forms that move fantastically to a discordant melody while like a rapid ghastly river through the pale door a hideous throng rush out forever and laughbut smile no more i well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad led us into a train of thought wherein there became manifest an opinion of ushers which i mention not so much on account of its novelty for other men ftnref watson dr percival spallanzini and especially the bishop of landaffsee chemical essays vol v have thought thus as on account of the pertinacity with which he maintained it this opinion in its general form was that of the sentience of all vegetable things but in his disordered fancy the idea had assumed a more daring character and trespassed under certain conditions upon the kingdom of inorganization i lack words to express the full extent or the earnest abandon of his persuasion the belief however was connected as i have previously hinted with the gray stones of the home of his forefathers the conditions of the sentience had been here he imagined fulfilled in the method of collocation of these stonesin the order of their arrangement as well as in that of the many fungi which overspread them and of the decayed trees which stood aroundabove all in the long undisturbed endurance of this arrangement and in its reduplication in the still waters of the tarn its evidencethe evidence of the sentiencewas to be seen he said and i here started as he spoke in the gradual yet certain condensation of an atmosphere of their own about the waters and the walls the result was discoverable he added in that silent yet importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had moulded the destinies of his family and which made him what i now saw himwhat he was such opinions need no comment and i will make none our booksthe books which for years had formed no small portion of the mental existence of the invalidwere as might be supposed in strict keeping with this character of phantasm we pored together over such works as the ververt et chartreuse of gresset the belphegor of machiavelli the heaven and hell of swedenborg the subterranean voyage of nicholas klimm by holberg the chiromancy of robert flud of jean dindaginé and of de la chambre the journey into the blue distance of tieck and the city of the sun of campanella one favorite volume was a small octavo edition of the directorium inquisitorium by the dominican eymeric de gironne and there were passages in pomponius mela about the old african satyrs and oegipans over which usher would sit dreaming for hours his chief delight however was found in the perusal of an exceedingly rare and curious book in quarto gothicthe manual of a forgotten churchthe vigiliae mortuorum secundum chorum ecclesiae maguntinae i could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work and of its probable influence upon the hypochondriac when one evening having informed me abruptly that the lady madeline was no more he stated his intention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight previously to its final interment in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls of the building the worldly reason however assigned for this singular proceeding was one which i did not feel at liberty to dispute the brother had been led to his resolution so he told me by consideration of the unusual character of the malady of the deceased of certain obtrusive and eager inquiries on the part of her medical men and of the remote and exposed situation of the burialground of the family i will not deny that when i called to mind the sinister countenance of the person whom i met upon the staircase on the day of my arrival at the house i had no desire to oppose what i regarded as at best but a harmless and by no means an unnatural precaution at the request of usher i personally aided him in the arrangements for the temporary entombment the body having been encoffined we two alone bore it to its rest the vault in which we placed it and which had been so long unopened that our torches half smothered in its oppressive atmosphere gave us little opportunity for investigation was small damp and entirely without means of admission for light lying at great depth immediately beneath that portion of the building in which was my own sleeping apartment it had been used apparently in remote feudal times for the worst purposes of a donjonkeep and in later days as a place of deposit for powder or some other highly combustible substance as a portion of its floor and the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached it were carefully sheathed with copper the door of massive iron had been also similarly protected its immense weight caused an unusually sharp grating sound as it moved upon its hinges having deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this region of horror we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid of the coffin and looked upon the face of the tenant a striking similitude between the brother and sister now first arrested my attention and usher divining perhaps my thoughts murmured out some few words from which i learned that the deceased and himself had been twins and that sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between them our glances however rested not long upon the deadfor we could not regard her unawed the disease which had thus entombed the lady in the maturity of youth had left as usual in all maladies of a strictly cataleptical character the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and the face and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is so terrible in death we replaced and screwed down the lid and having secured the door of iron made our way with toil into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of the house and now some days of bitter grief having elapsed an observable change came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend his ordinary manner had vanished his ordinary occupations were neglected or forgotten he roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried unequal and objectless step the pallor of his countenance had assumed if possible a more ghastly huebut the luminousness of his eye had utterly gone out the once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more and a tremulous quaver as if of extreme terror habitually characterized his utterance there were times indeed when i thought his unceasingly agitated mind was laboring with some oppressive secret to divulge which he struggled for the necessary courage at times again i was obliged to resolve all into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness for i beheld him gazing upon vacancy for long hours in an attitude of the profoundest attention as if listening to some imaginary sound it was no wonder that his condition terrifiedthat it infected me i felt creeping upon me by slow yet certain degrees the wild influences of his own fantastic yet impressive superstitions it was especially upon retiring to bed late in the night of the seventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady madeline within the donjon that i experienced the full power of such feelings sleep came not near my couchwhile the hours waned and waned away i struggled to reason off the nervousness which had dominion over me i endeavored to believe that much if not all of what i felt was due to the bewildering influence of the gloomy furniture of the roomof the dark and tattered draperies which tortured into motion by the breath of a rising tempest swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls and rustled uneasily about the decorations of the bed but my efforts were fruitless an irrepressible tremor gradually pervaded my frame and at length there sat upon my very heart an incubus of utterly causeless alarm shaking this off with a gasp and a struggle i uplifted myself upon the pillows and peering earnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber harkenedi know not why except that an instinctive spirit prompted meto certain low and indefinite sounds which came through the pauses of the storm at long intervals i knew not whence overpowered by an intense sentiment of horror unaccountable yet unendurable i threw on my clothes with haste for i felt that i should sleep no more during the night and endeavored to arouse myself from the pitiable condition into which i had fallen by pacing rapidly to and fro through the apartment i had taken but few turns in this manner when a light step on an adjoining staircase arrested my attention i presently recognised it as that of usher in an instant afterward he rapped with a gentle touch at my door and entered bearing a lamp his countenance was as usual cadaverously wanbut moreover there was a species of mad hilarity in his eyesan evidently restrained hysteria in his whole demeanor his air appalled mebut anything was preferable to the solitude which i had so long endured and i even welcomed his presence as a relief and you have not seen it he said abruptly after having stared about him for some moments in silenceyou have not then seen itbut stay you shall thus speaking and having carefully shaded his lamp he hurried to one of the casements and threw it freely open to the storm the impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our feet it was indeed a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night and one wildly singular in its terror and its beauty a whirlwind had apparently collected its force in our vicinity for there were frequent and violent alterations in the direction of the wind and the exceeding density of the clouds which hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house did not prevent our perceiving the lifelike velocity with which they flew careering from all points against each other without passing away into the distance i say that even their exceeding density did not prevent our perceiving thisyet we had no glimpse of the moon or starsnor was there any flashing forth of the lightning but the under surfaces of the huge masses of agitated vapor as well as all terrestrial objects immediately around us were glowing in the unnatural light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible gaseous exhalation which hung about and enshrouded the mansion you must notyou shall not behold this said i shudderingly to usher as i led him with a gentle violence from the window to a seat these appearances which bewilder you are merely electrical phenomena not uncommonor it may be that they have their ghastly origin in the rank miasma of the tarn let us close this casement the air is chilling and dangerous to your frame here is one of your favorite romances i will read and you shall listenand so we will pass away this terrible night together the antique volume which i had taken up was the mad trist of sir launcelot canning but i had called it a favorite of ushers more in sad jest than in earnest for in truth there is little in its uncouth and unimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for the lofty and spiritual ideality of my friend it was however the only book immediately at hand and i indulged a vague hope that the excitement which now agitated the hypochondriac might find relief for the history of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies even in the extremeness of the folly which i should read could i have judged indeed by the wild overstrained air of vivacity with which he harkened or apparently harkened to the words of the tale i might well have congratulated myself upon the success of my design i had arrived at that wellknown portion of the story where ethelred the hero of the trist having sought in vain for peaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit proceeds to make good an entrance by force here it will be remembered the words of the narrative run thus and ethelred who was by nature of a doughty heart and who was now mighty withal on account of the powerfulness of the wine which he had drunken waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit who in sooth was of an obstinate and maliceful turn but feeling the rain upon his shoulders and fearing the rising of the tempest uplifted his mace outright and with blows made quickly room in the plankings of the door for his gauntleted hand and now pulling therewith sturdily he so cracked and ripped and tore all asunder that the noise of the dry and hollowsounding wood alarummed and reverberated throughout the forest at the termination of this sentence i started and for a moment paused for it appeared to me although i at once concluded that my excited fancy had deceived meit appeared to me that from some very remote portion of the mansion there came indistinctly to my ears what might have been in its exact similarity of character the echo but a stifled and dull one certainly of the very cracking and ripping sound which sir launcelot had so particularly described it was beyond doubt the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention for amid the rattling of the sashes of the casements and the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm the sound in itself had nothing surely which should have interested or disturbed me i continued the story but the good champion ethelred now entering within the door was sore enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the maliceful hermit but in the stead thereof a dragon of a scaly and prodigious demeanor and of a fiery tongue which sate in guard before a palace of gold with a floor of silver and upon the wall there hung a shield of shining brass with this legend enwritten who entereth herein a conqueror hath bin who slayeth the dragon the shield he shall win and ethelred uplifted his mace and struck upon the head of the dragon which fell before him and gave up his pesty breath with a shriek so horrid and harsh and withal so piercing that ethelred had fain to close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it the like whereof was never before heard here again i paused abruptly and now with a feeling of wild amazementfor there could be no doubt whatever that in this instance i did actually hear although from what direction it proceeded i found it impossible to say a low and apparently distant but harsh protracted and most unusual screaming or grating sound the exact counterpart of what my fancy had already conjured up for the dragons unnatural shriek as described by the romancer oppressed as i certainly was upon the occurrence of this second and most extraordinary coincidence by a thousand conflicting sensations in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant i still retained sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting by any observation the sensitive nervousness of my companion i was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds in question although assuredly a strange alteration had during the last few minutes taken place in his demeanor from a position fronting my own he had gradually brought round his chair so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber and thus i could but partially perceive his features although i saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly his head had dropped upon his breastyet i knew that he was not asleep from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as i caught a glance of it in profile the motion of his body too was at variance with this ideafor he rocked from side to side with a gentle yet constant and uniform sway having rapidly taken notice of all this i resumed the narrative of sir launcelot which thus proceeded and now the champion having escaped from the terrible fury of the dragon bethinking himself of the brazen shield and of the breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it removed the carcass from out of the way before him and approached valorously over the silver pavement of the castle to where the shield was upon the wall which in sooth tarried not for his full coming but fell down at his feet upon the silver floor with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound no sooner had these syllables passed my lips thanas if a shield of brass had indeed at the moment fallen heavily upon a floor of silveri became aware of a distinct hollow metallic and clangorous yet apparently muffled reverberation completely unnerved i leaped to my feet but the measured rocking movement of usher was undisturbed i rushed to the chair in which he sat his eyes were bent fixedly before him and throughout his whole countenance there reigned a stony rigidity but as i placed my hand upon his shoulder there came a strong shudder over his whole person a sickly smile quivered about his lips and i saw that he spoke in a low hurried and gibbering murmur as if unconscious of my presence bending closely over him i at length drank in the hideous import of his words not hear ityes i hear it and have heard it longlong longmany minutes many hours many days have i heard ityet i dared notoh pity me miserable wretch that i ami dared noti dared not speak we have put her living in the tomb said i not that my senses were acute i now tell you that i heard her first feeble movements in the hollow coffin i heard themmany many days agoyet i dared noti dared not speak and nowtonightethelredha hathe breaking of the hermits door and the deathcry of the dragon and the clangor of the shieldsay rather the rending of her coffin and the grating of the iron hinges of her prison and her struggles within the coppered archway of the vault oh whither shall i fly will she not be here anon is she not hurrying to upbraid me for my haste have i not heard her footstep on the stair do i not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart madmanhere he sprang furiously to his feet and shrieked out his syllables as if in the effort he were giving up his soulmadman i tell you that she now stands without the door as if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been found the potency of a spellthe huge antique pannels to which the speaker pointed threw slowly back upon the instant their ponderous and ebony jaws it was the work of the rushing gustbut then without those doors there did stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the lady madeline of usher there was blood upon her white robes and the evidence of some bitter struggle upon every portion of her emaciated frame for a moment she remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the thresholdthen with a low moaning cry fell heavily inward upon the person of her brother and in her violent and now final deathagonies bore him to the floor a corpse and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated from that chamber and from that mansion i fled aghast the storm was still abroad in all its wrath as i found myself crossing the old causeway suddenly there shot along the path a wild light and i turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued for the vast house and its shadows were alone behind me the radiance was that of the full setting and bloodred moon which now shone vividly through that once barelydiscernible fissure of which i have before spoken as extending from the roof of the building in a zigzag direction to the base while i gazed this fissure rapidly widened there came a fierce breath of the whirlwindthe entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon my sightmy brain reeled as i saw the mighty walls rushing asunderthere was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand watersand the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the house of usher once upon a midnight dreary by michael connelly the plan was simple i would write a book about a crosscountry killer who leaves obscure phrases from the work of edgar allan poe as his calling card i would borrow some of the gloomy menace of the master and infect my own book with it it would amount to a perfect crime a clever literary theft disguised as homage and i would get away with it i packed a suitcase for the road trip i would take to research the locations where the killer would strike and made sure to include a twovolume set of poes collected works as well by day i picked killing scenes for my novel phoenix denver chicago sarasota and baltimore by night i sat in hotel rooms and reimmersed myself in the collected works of edgar allan poe for the most part i had been a shortstory man when it came to poe i knew the poetry was well regarded and substantialwhat high school graduate was unfamiliar with the ravenbut i had never been much interested in rhyming i liked the blood and guts thrills of the stories but now on the road i was reading the poetry because the short tightly drawn lines steeped in metaphors for death and loneliness were what i needed for my book all these years later i remember one stanza by heart i dwelt alone in the land of moan and my soul was a stagnant tide has there ever been a more beautiful and concise summation of an existence at the bottom of the dark abyss could there possibly be a better line to selfdescribe a killer who roams the country in i didnt think so so i decided my killer would use the line my research travels took me to washington dc where i spent a day walking around government buildings and trying to talk my way into a tour of the fbi headquarters access denied late in the day i checked into the hilton near dupont circle i wanted to stay specifically in the hilton because the place had its own creep factorabout fifteen years earlier president ronald reagan stepped out of a side entrance after giving a speech and was shot by a wouldbe assassin seeking notoriety to feed his fixation on a movie star i planned to include a reference to this in my book i checked out the spot of the assassination attempt took some notes and then went up to my room to order dinner in and spend the rest of the evening reading poe after eating and calling home i stretched out on the bed and cracked open the volume containing the poetry the work was morose and haunting death lurks in almost every stanza that poe wrote to say i was spooking myself would be an understatement i kept all the lights on in the room and doublelocked the door as the night wore on i became aware of voices out in the hallway fellow travelers talking in a muffled cacophony as they headed to or from the elevator i could hear their footsteps as they trod past my door it was late and i was somewhere in that gray area between wakefulness and sleep but i read on and soon came across the poem the haunted palace the poem rang eerily familiar to me yet i knew i was not aware of any of poes poetry outside of the raven i checked the notes section and learned it was a ballad that had originally been contained in one of poes signature short stories the fall of the house of usher usher was a story i had read somewhere long before as a school assignment or during a voluntary immersion in poes work i now took up the first volume which contained the short stories and began to read it once again the story quickly enveloped me in its claustrophobic dread i think there is no story of poes or perhaps from any other writer that so forcefully and completely ensures the readers descent into the unexpected it is a story steeped in mystery and fear and the unexpected twist it is a story that rolls inexorably deeper into darkness from the very first word deeply submerged in the story of roderick usher and the haunting malady of his head and home i lost track of where i was until a loud shot rang out in the hallway i leaped up in my bed book flying to the floor and stifled a scream i stood stockstill and waited my ears waiting for any further report i then heard a peal of female laughter a murmur of conversation and the polite chime of an arriving elevator i sat back on the bed shaken but realizing i had heard no shot i had heard the slamming of the door across the hall i had simply fallen under the spell of edgar allan poe id let him take me to a world of dark imagination where common things become uncommon where the routine becomes the ghastly unexpected where a slamming door becomes a shot in the night i called my book the poet the name bestowed on my killer by the media when they attribute the lines left behind at the crime scenes to him rather than their true author poe i put the hilton hotel scene in the book i recreated it in as much detail as i could placing my fictitious alter ego in the bed where i had been its one of my favorite moments in one of my favorite books i am glad to have made a record of it but the truth is that it wasnt necessary for me there will be no forgetting that midnight dreary when edgar allan poe reached across nearly two centuries to seek justice for what i had thought would be a perfect literary crime michael connelly was born in philadelphia and has lived in various cities in california and florida a reformed journalist he is a past president of the mystery writers of america as well as a recipient of the edgar award for best first novel by an american author bestowed for his debut the black echo eighteen novels later he has received no further edgar awards with the completion of this collection he announces his retirement from editing anthologies the facts in the case of m valdemar of course i shall not pretend to consider it any matter for wonder that the extraordinary case of m valdemar has excited discussion it would have been a miracle had it not especially under the circumstances through the desire of all parties concerned to keep the affair from the public at least for the present or until we had further opportunities for investigationthrough our endeavors to effect thisa garbled or exaggerated account made its way into society and became the source of many unpleasant misrepresentations and very naturally of a great deal of disbelief it is now rendered necessary that i give the factsas far as i comprehend them myself they are succinctly these my attention for the last three years had been repeatedly drawn to the subject of mesmerism and about nine months ago it occurred to me quite suddenly that in the series of experiments made hitherto there had been a very remarkable and most unaccountable omissionno person had as yet been mesmerized in articulo mortis it remained to be seen first whether in such condition there existed in the patient any susceptibility to the magnetic influence secondly whether if any existed it was impaired or increased by the condition thirdly to what extent or for how long a period the encroachments of death might be arrested by the process there were other points to be ascertained but these most excited my curiositythe last in especial from the immensely important character of its consequences in looking around me for some subject by whose means i might test these particulars i was brought to think of my friend m ernest valdemar the wellknown compiler of the bibliotheca forensica and author under the nom de plume of issachar marx of the polish versions of wallenstein and gargantua m valdemar who has resided principally at harlem ny since the year is or was particularly noticeable for the extreme spareness of his personhis lower limbs much resembling those of john randolph and also for the whiteness of his whiskers in violent contrast to the blackness of his hairthe latter in consequence being very generally mistaken for a wig his temperament was markedly nervous and rendered him a good subject for mesmeric experiment on two or three occasions i had put him to sleep with little difficulty but was disappointed in other results which his peculiar constitution had naturally led me to anticipate his will was at no period positively or thoroughly under my control and in regard to clairvoyance i could accomplish with him nothing to be relied upon i always attributed my failure at these points to the disordered state of his health for some months previous to my becoming acquainted with him his physicians had declared him in a confirmed phthisis it was his custom indeed to speak calmly of his approaching dissolution as of a matter neither to be avoided nor regretted when the ideas to which i have alluded first occurred to me it was of course very natural that i should think of m valdemar i knew the steady philosophy of the man too well to apprehend any scruples from him and he had no relatives in america who would be likely to interfere i spoke to him frankly upon the subject and to my surprise his interest seemed vividly excited i say to my surprise for although he had always yielded his person freely to my experiments he had never before given me any tokens of sympathy with what i did his disease was of that character which would admit of exact calculation in respect to the epoch of its termination in death and it was finally arranged between us that he would send for me about twentyfour hours before the period announced by his physicians as that of his decease it is now rather more than seven months since i received from m valdemar himself the subjoined note my dear p you may as well come now d and f are agreed that i cannot hold out beyond tomorrow midnight and i think they have hit the time very nearly valdemar i received this note within half an hour after it was written and in fifteen minutes more i was in the dying mans chamber i had not seen him for ten days and was appalled by the fearful alteration which the brief interval had wrought in him his face wore a leaden hue the eyes were utterly lustreless and the emaciation was so extreme that the skin had been broken through by the cheekbones his expectoration was excessive the pulse was barely perceptible he retained nevertheless in a very remarkable manner both his mental power and a certain degree of physical strength he spoke with distinctnesstook some palliative medicines without aidand when i entered the room was occupied in penciling memoranda in a pocketbook he was propped up in the bed by pillows doctors d and f were in attendance after pressing valdemars hand i took these gentlemen aside and obtained from them a minute account of the patients condition the left lung had been for eighteen months in a semiosseous or cartilaginous state and was of course entirely useless for all purposes of vitality the right in its upper portion was also partially if not thoroughly ossified while the lower region was merely a mass of purulent tubercles running one into another several extensive perforations existed and at one point permanent adhesion to the ribs had taken place these appearances in the right lobe were of comparatively recent date the ossification had proceeded with very unusual rapidity no sign of it had been discovered a month before and the adhesion had only been observed during the three previous days independently of the phthisis the patient was suspected of aneurism of the aorta but on this point the osseous symptoms rendered an exact diagnosis impossible it was the opinion of both physicians that m valdemar would die about midnight on the morrow sunday it was then seven oclock on saturday evening on quitting the invalids bedside to hold conversation with myself doctors d and f had bidden him a final farewell it had not been their intention to return but at my request they agreed to look in upon the patient about ten the next night when they had gone i spoke freely with m valdemar on the subject of his approaching dissolution as well as more particularly of the experiment proposed he still professed himself quite willing and even anxious to have it made and urged me to commence it at once a male and a female nurse were in attendance but i did not feel myself altogether at liberty to engage in a task of this character with no more reliable witnesses than these people in case of sudden accident might prove i therefore postponed operations until about eight the next night when the arrival of a medical student with whom i had some acquaintance mr theodore ll relieved me from further embarrassment it had been my design originally to wait for the physicians but i was induced to proceed first by the urgent entreaties of m valdemar and secondly by my conviction that i had not a moment to lose as he was evidently sinking fast mr l l was so kind as to accede to my desire that he would take notes of all that occurred and it is from his memoranda that what i now have to relate is for the most part either condensed or copied verbatim it wanted about five minutes of eight when taking the patients hand i begged him to state as distinctly as he could to mr ll whether he m valdemar was entirely willing that i should make the experiment of mesmerizing him in his then condition he replied feebly yet quite audibly yes i wish to be mesmerizedadding immediately afterward i fear you have deferred it too long while he spoke thus i commenced the passes which i had already found most effectual in subduing him he was evidently influenced with the first lateral stroke of my hand across his forehead but although i exerted all my powers no further perceptible effect was induced until some minutes after ten oclock when doctors d and f called according to appointment i explained to them in a few words what i designed and as they opposed no objection saying that the patient was already in the death agony i proceeded without hesitationexchanging however the lateral passes for downward ones and directing my gaze entirely into the right eye of the sufferer by this time his pulse was imperceptible and his breathing was stertorous and at intervals of half a minute this condition was nearly unaltered for a quarter of an hour at the expiration of this period however a natural although a very deep sigh escaped from the bosom of the dying man and the stertorous breathing ceasedthat is to say its stertorousness was no longer apparent the intervals were undiminished the patients extremities were of an icy coldness at five minutes before eleven i perceived unequivocal signs of the mesmeric influence the glassy roll of the eye was changed for that expression of uneasy inward examination which is never seen except in cases of sleepwaking and which it is quite impossible to mistake with a few rapid lateral passes i made the lids quiver as in incipient sleep and with a few more i closed them altogether i was not satisfied however with this but continued the manipulations vigorously and with the fullest exertion of the will until i had completely stiffened the limbs of the slumberer after placing them in a seemingly easy position the legs were at full length the arms were nearly so and reposed on the bed at a moderate distance from the loins the head was very slightly elevated when i had accomplished this it was fully midnight and i requested the gentlemen present to examine m valdemars condition after a few experiments they admitted him to be in an unusually perfect state of mesmeric trance the curiosity of both the physicians was greatly excited dr d resolved at once to remain with the patient all night while dr f took leave with a promise to return at daybreak mr ll and the nurses remained we left m valdemar entirely undisturbed until about three oclock in the morning when i approached him and found him in precisely the same condition as when dr f went awaythat is to say he lay in the same position the pulse was imperceptible the breathing was gentle scarcely noticeable unless through the application of a mirror to the lips the eyes were closed naturally and the limbs were as rigid and as cold as marble still the general appearance was certainly not that of death as i approached m valdemar i made a kind of half effort to influence his right arm into pursuit of my own as i passed the latter gently to and fro above his person in such experiments with this patient i had never perfectly succeeded before and assuredly i had little thought of succeeding now but to my astonishment his arm very readily although feebly followed every direction i assigned it with mine i determined to hazard a few words of conversation m valdemar i said are you asleep he made no answer but i perceived a tremor about the lips and was thus induced to repeat the question again and again at its third repetition his whole frame was agitated by a very slight shivering the eyelids unclosed themselves so far as to display a white line of the ball the lips moved sluggishly and from between them in a barely audible whisper issued the words yesasleep now do not wake melet me die so i here felt the limbs and found them as rigid as ever the right arm as before obeyed the direction of my hand i questioned the sleepwaker again do you still feel pain in the breast m valdemar the answer now was immediate but even less audible than before no paini am dying i did not think it advisable to disturb him further just then and nothing more was said or done until the arrival of dr f who came a little before sunrise and expressed unbounded astonishment at finding the patient still alive after feeling the pulse and applying a mirror to the lips he requested me to speak to the sleepwaker again i did so saying m valdemar do you still sleep as before some minutes elapsed ere a reply was made and during the interval the dying man seemed to be collecting his energies to speak at my fourth repetition of the question he said very faintly almost inaudibly yes still asleepdying it was now the opinion or rather the wish of the physicians that m valdemar should be suffered to remain undisturbed in his present apparently tranquil condition until death should supervene and this it was generally agreed must now take place within a few minutes i concluded however to speak to him once more and merely repeated my previous question while i spoke there came a marked change over the countenance of the sleepwaker the eyes rolled themselves slowly open the pupils disappearing upwardly the skin generally assumed a cadaverous hue resembling not so much parchment as white paper and the circular hectic spots which hitherto had been strongly defined in the centre of each cheek went out at once i use this expression because the suddenness of their departure put me in mind of nothing so much as the extinguishment of a candle by a puff of the breath the upper lip at the same time writhed itself away from the teeth which it had previously covered completely while the lower jaw fell with an audible jerk leaving the mouth widely extended and disclosing in full view the swollen and blackened tongue i presume that no member of the party then present had been unaccustomed to deathbed horrors but so hideous beyond conception was the appearance of m valdemar at this moment that there was a general shrinking back from the region of the bed i now feel that i have reached a point of this narrative at which every reader will be startled into positive disbelief it is my business however simply to proceed there was no longer the faintest sign of vitality in m valdemar and concluding him to be dead we were consigning him to the charge of the nurses when a strong vibratory motion was observable in the tongue this continued for perhaps a minute at the expiration of this period there issued from the distended and motionless jaws a voicesuch as it would be madness in me to attempt describing there are indeed two or three epithets which might be considered as applicable to it in part i might say for example that the sound was harsh and broken and hollow but the hideous whole is indescribable for the simple reason that no similar sounds have ever jarred upon the ear of humanity there were two particulars nevertheless which i thought then and still think might fairly be stated as characteristic of the intonationas well adapted to convey some idea of its unearthly peculiarity in the first place the voice seemed to reach our earsat least minefrom a vast distance or from some deep cavern within the earth in the second place it impressed me i fear indeed that it will be impossible to make myself comprehended as gelatinous or glutinous matters impress the sense of touch i have spoken both of sound and of voice i mean to say that the sound was one of distinctof even wonderfully thrillingly distinctsyllabification m valdemar spokeobviously in reply to the question i had propounded to him a few minutes before i had asked him it will be remembered if he still slept he now said yesnoi have been sleepingand nownowi am dead no person present even affected to deny or attempted to repress the unutterable shuddering horror which these few words thus uttered were so well calculated to convey mr ll the student swooned the nurses immediately left the chamber and could not be induced to return my own impressions i would not pretend to render intelligible to the reader for nearly an hour we busied ourselves silentlywithout utterance of a wordin endeavors to revive mr ll when he came to himself we addressed ourselves again to an investigation of m valdemars condition it remained in all respects as i have last described it with the exception that the mirror no longer afforded evidence of respiration an attempt to draw blood from the arm failed i should mention too that this limb was no further subject to my will i endeavored in vain to make it follow the direction of my hand the only real indication indeed of the mesmeric influence was now found in the vibratory movement of the tongue whenever i addressed m valdemar a question he seemed to be making an effort to reply but had no longer sufficient volition to queries put to him by any other person than myself he seemed utterly insensiblealthough i endeavored to place each member of the company in mesmeric rapport with him i believe that i have now related all that is necessary to an understanding of the sleepwakers state at this epoch other nurses were procured and at ten oclock i left the house in company with the two physicians and mr ll in the afternoon we all called again to see the patient his condition remained precisely the same we had now some discussion as to the propriety and feasibility of awakening him but we had little difficulty in agreeing that no good purpose would be served by so doing it was evident that so far death or what is usually termed death had been arrested by the mesmeric process it seemed clear to us all that to awaken m valdemar would be merely to insure his instant or at least his speedy dissolution from this period until the close of last weekan interval of nearly seven monthswe continued to make daily calls at m valdemars house accompanied now and then by medical and other friends all this time the sleeperwaker remained exactly as i have last described him the nurses attentions were continual it was on friday last that we finally resolved to make the experiment of awakening or attempting to awaken him and it is the perhaps unfortunate result of this latter experiment which has given rise to so much discussion in private circlesto so much of what i cannot help thinking unwarranted popular feeling for the purpose of relieving m valdemar from the mesmeric trance i made use of the customary passes these for a time were unsuccessful the first indication of revival was afforded by a partial descent of the iris it was observed as especially remarkable that this lowering of the pupil was accompanied by the profuse outflowing of a yellowish ichor from beneath the lids of a pungent and highly offensive odor it was now suggested that i should attempt to influence the patients arm as heretofore i made the attempt and failed dr f then intimated a desire to have me put a question i did so as follows m valdemar can you explain to us what are your feelings or wishes now there was an instant return of the hectic circles on the cheeks the tongue quivered or rather rolled violently in the mouth although the jaws and lips remained rigid as before and at length the same hideous voice which i have already described broke forth for gods sakequickquickput me to sleepor quick waken mequicki say to you that i am dead i was thoroughly unnerved and for an instant remained undecided what to do at first i made an endeavor to recompose the patient but failing in this through total abeyance of the will i retraced my steps and as earnestly struggled to awaken him in this attempt i soon saw that i should be successfulor at least i soon fancied that my success would be completeand i am sure that all in the room were prepared to see the patient awaken for what really occurred however it is quite impossible that any human being could have been prepared as i rapidly made the mesmeric passes amid ejaculations of dead dead absolutely bursting from the tongue and not from the lips of the sufferer his whole frame at oncewithin the space of a single minute or less shrunkcrumbledabsolutely rotted away beneath my hands upon the bed before that whole company there lay a nearly liquid mass of loathsomeof detestable putrescence the thief by laurie r king it is a wellknown criticism of william shakespeare that despite being universally celebrated for his fresh originality the mans work is basically one cliché after another marching through his plays and poems one finds the most timeworn of expressions all the worlds a stage to be or not to be whats in a name a person really has to wonder why the bard of avon couldnt scrape together a more creative turn of phrase than shylocks bated breath the elbow room of king johns soul trinculos lament that misery brings strange bedfellowsfrom foul play to minds eye sorry sight to tower of strength the truth of the matter is william shakespeare was simply grinding out the same trite clichés that we lesser mortals still wrestle with he was just very lucky to be the first to get them into print thats all the same critique i fear must be leveled at our own edgar allan poe the man is credited with being the inventor of crime fiction but when you look more closely you find that poe is just reworking the same old tired ideas the rest of us depend on an example okay some years ago im writing a story about a young woman who isi freely admit thisa female version of sherlock holmes now holmes you may know is an extraordinarily clever analytical mind who solves peculiar crimes and discusses them with a partner who isnt quite so bright what does it matter that edgar allan poe also wrote in the murders in the rue morgue about an extraordinarily clever analytical mind who solves peculiar crimes and discusses them with a partner who isnt quite so bright i mean how else could you tell this kind of story really it doesnt mean arthur conan doyle was a plagiarist any more than i am so i tell myself this and keep writing my story and i come up with a solution to one aspect of the crime that revolves around an enigmatic cipher which is fineeven dorothy sayers has a cipher in one of her storiesexcept that when i later sit down to read the goldbug i see that it too contains an enigmatic cipher hmm then a few years later im working on another novel where the characters use hypnotism to solve a case and when i finish it im pleased with how clever those charactersand of course their authorare until i find that poe has used mesmerism as well in the facts in the case of m valdemar by now im starting to get a little sensitive about old eap i wonder if theres some kind of weird linkup between his brain and my laptop a century and a half apart it sure would explain a lot but no im just being paranoid its coincidence so i sit down to write a book about a noble family and their idiosyncratic manor house only to discover that sure enough poe has the same kind of setup in the fall of the house of usher but so what so damned what the mans a thief theres nothing i can do about it however i decide that no matter how hes doing it i can get around him by writing a book with an absolutely unique central character a person no one but laurie king would ever think of and to make matters really secure ill write it with a pen not on the laptop not that i think theres anything paranormal going on here dont be ridiculous but just in case so out trots brother erasmus a holy fool in a modern city who is surely one of the most quirky unlikely singular characters in fiction nobody will ever duplicate him and then i turn the pages of the cask of amontillado and findoh bugger the sneaky bastards done it again the man wore motley i tell you edgar allan poe is a blatant and unscrupulous thief of all the best ideas if he wasnt dead we mystery writers would have to band together and start legal proceedings i have to say it gets a person down when everything one writes is tainted with a whiff of the derivative im thinking about moving out of crime fiction for a while since with poe in the field its feeling a little crowded maybe ill write poetry for a change ive even started playing with some nice ideas about this gloomy bird and a lost lover laurie r king regretfully admits that she won and kept the award named after edgar allan poe for her first novel in since then she has written eighteen novels and a number of short stories absolutely none of which were influenced in the least by the work of any other writer and for anyone keeping score the lrk titles referred to above are the beekeepers apprentice a letter of mary justice hall and to play the fool ligeia and the will therein lieth which dieth not who knoweth the mysteries of the will with its vigor for god is but a great will pervading all things by nature of its intentness man doth not yield himself to the angels nor unto death utterly save only through the weakness of his feeble will joseph glanvill i cannot for my soul remember how when or even precisely where i first became acquainted with the lady ligeia long years have since elapsed and my memory is feeble through much suffering or perhaps i cannot now bring these points to mind because in truth the character of my beloved her rare learning her singular yet placid cast of beauty and the thrilling and enthralling eloquence of her low musical language made their way into my heart by paces so steadily and stealthily progressive that they have been unnoticed and unknown yet i believe that i met her first and most frequently in some large old decaying city near the rhine of her familyi have surely heard her speak that it is of a remotely ancient date cannot be doubted ligeia ligeia buried in studies of a nature more than all else adapted to deaden impressions of the outward world it is by that sweet word aloneby ligeiathat i bring before mine eyes in fancy the image of her who is no more and now while i write a recollection flashes upon me that i have never known the paternal name of her who was my friend and my betrothed and who became the partner of my studies and finally the wife of my bosom was it a playful charge on the part of my ligeia or was it a test of my strength of affection that i should institute no inquiries upon this point or was it rather a caprice of my owna wildly romantic offering on the shrine of the most passionate devotion i but indistinctly recall the fact itselfwhat wonder that i have utterly forgotten the circumstances which originated or attended it and indeed if ever that spirit which is entitled romanceif ever she the wan and the mistywinged ashtophet of idolatrous egypt presided as they tell over marriages illomened then most surely she presided over mine there is one dear topic however on which my memory fails me not it is the person of ligeia in stature she was tall somewhat slender and in her latter days even emaciated i would in vain attempt to portray the majesty the quiet ease of her demeanor or the incomprehensible lightness and elasticity of her footfall she came and departed as a shadow i was never made aware of her entrance into my closed study save by the dear music of her low sweet voice as she placed her marble hand upon my shoulder in beauty of face no maiden ever equalled her it was the radiance of an opiumdreaman airy and spiritlifting vision more wildly divine than the phantasies which hovered vision about the slumbering souls of the daughters of delos yet her features were not of that regular mould which we have been falsely taught to worship in the classical labors of the heathen there is no exquisite beauty says bacon lord verulam speaking truly of all the forms and genera of beauty without some strangeness in the proportion yet although i saw that the features of ligeia were not of a classic regularity although i perceived that her loveliness was indeed exquisite and felt that there was much of strangeness pervading it yet i have tried in vain to detect the irregularity and to trace home my own perception of the strange i examined the contour of the lofty and pale foreheadit was faultlesshow cold indeed that word when applied to a majesty so divinethe skin rivalling the purest ivory the commanding extent and repose the gentle prominence of the regions above the temples and then the ravenblack the glossy the luxuriant and naturallycurling tresses setting forth the full force of the homeric epithet hyacinthine i looked at the delicate outlines of the noseand nowhere but in the graceful medallions of the hebrews had i beheld a similar perfection there were the same luxurious smoothness of surface the same scarcely perceptible tendency to the aquiline the same harmoniously curved nostrils speaking the free spirit i regarded the sweet mouth here was indeed the triumph of all things heavenlythe magnificent turn of the short upper lipthe soft voluptuous slumber of the underthe dimples which sported and the color which spokethe teeth glancing back with a brilliancy almost startling every ray of the holy light which fell upon them in her serene and placid yet most exultingly radiant of all smiles i scrutinized the formation of the chinand here too i found the gentleness of breadth the softness and the majesty the fulness and the spirituality of the greekthe contour which the god apollo revealed but in a dream to cleomenes the son of the athenian and then i peered into the large eyes of ligeia for eyes we have no models in the remotely antique it might have been too that in these eyes of my beloved lay the secret to which lord verulam alludes they were i must believe far larger than the ordinary eyes of our own race they were even fuller than the fullest of the gazelle eyes of the tribe of the valley of nourjahad yet it was only at intervalsin moments of intense excitementthat this peculiarity became more than slightly noticeable in ligeia and at such moments was her beautyin my heated fancy thus it appeared perhapsthe beauty of beings either above or apart from the earth the beauty of the fabulous houri of the turk the hue of the orbs was the most brilliant of black and far over them hung jetty lashes of great length the brows slightly irregular in outline had the same tint the strangeness however which i found in the eyes was of a nature distinct from the formation or the color or the brilliancy of the features and must after all be referred to the expression ah word of no meaning behind whose vast latitude of mere sound we intrench our ignorance of so much of the spiritual the expression of the eyes of ligeia how for long hours have i pondered upon it how have i through the whole of a midsummer night struggled to fathom it what was itthat something more profound than the well of democrituswhich lay far within the pupils of my beloved what was it i was possessed with a passion to discover those eyes those large those shining those divine orbs they became to me twin stars of leda and i to them devoutest of astrologers there is no point among the many incomprehensible anomalies of the science of mind more thrillingly exciting than the factnever i believe noticed in the schoolsthat in our endeavors to recall to memory something long forgotten we often find ourselves upon the very verge of remembrance without being able in the end to remember and thus how frequently in my intense scrutiny of ligeias eyes have i felt approaching the full knowledge of their expressionfelt it approachingyet not quite be mineand so at length entirely depart and strange oh strangest mystery of all i found in the commonest objects of the universe a circle of analogies to that expression i mean to say that subsequently to the period when ligeias beauty passed into my spirit there dwelling as in a shrine i derived from many existences in the material world a sentiment such as i felt always around within me by her large and luminous orbs yet not the more could i define that sentiment or analyze or even steadily view it i recognized it let me repeat sometimes in the survey of a rapidly growing vinein the contemplation of a moth a butterfly a chrysalis a stream of running water i have felt it in the oceanin the falling of a meteor i have felt it in the glances of unusually aged people and there are one or two stars in heaven one especially a star of the sixth magnitude double and changeable to be found near the large star in lyra in a telescopic scrutiny of which i have been made aware of the feeling i have been filled with it by certain sounds from stringed instruments and not unfrequently by passages from books among innumerable other instances i well remember something in a volume of joseph glanvill which perhaps merely from its quaintnesswho shall say never failed to inspire me with the sentiment and the will therein lieth which dieth not who knoweth the mysteries of the will with its vigor for god is but a great will pervading all things by nature of its intentness man doth not yield him to the angels nor unto death utterly save only through the weakness of his feeble will length of years and subsequent reflection have enabled me to trace indeed some remote connection between this passage in the english moralist and a portion of the character of ligeia an intensity in thought action or speech was possibly in her a result or at least an index of that gigantic volition which during our long intercourse failed to give other and more immediate evidence of its existence of all the women whom i have ever known she the outwardly calm the everplacid ligeia was the most violently a prey to the tumultuous vultures of stern passion and of such passion i could form no estimate save by the miraculous expansion of those eyes which at once so delighted and appalled meby the almost magical melody modulation distinctness and placidity of her very low voiceand by the fierce energy rendered doubly effective by contrast with her manner of utterance of the wild words which she habitually uttered i have spoken of the learning of ligeia it was immensesuch as i have never known in woman in the classical tongues was she deeply proficient and as far as my own acquaintance extended in regard to the modern dialects of europe i have never known her at fault indeed upon any theme of the most admired because simply the most abstruse of the boasted erudition of the academy have i ever found ligeia at fault how singularlyhow thrillingly this one point in the nature of my wife has forced itself at this late period only upon my attention i said her knowledge was such as i have never known in womanbut where breathes the man who has traversed and successfully all the wide areas of moral physical and mathematical science i saw not then what i now clearly perceive that the acquisitions of ligeia were gigantic were astounding yet i was sufficiently aware of her infinite supremacy to resign myself with a childlike confidence to her guidance through the chaotic world of metaphysical investigation at which i was most busily occupied during the earlier years of our marriage with how vast a triumphwith how vivid a delightwith how much of all that is ethereal in hope did i feel as she bent over me in studies but little soughtbut less knownthat delicious vista by slow degrees expanding before me down whose long gorgeous and all untrodden path i might at length pass onward to the goal of a wisdom too divinely precious not to be forbidden how poignant then must have been the grief with which after some years i beheld my wellgrounded expectations take wings to themselves and fly away without ligeia i was but as a child groping benighted her presence her readings alone rendered vividly luminous the many mysteries of the transcendentalism in which we were immersed wanting the radiant lustre of her eyes letters lambent and golden grew duller than saturnian lead and now those eyes shone less and less frequently upon the pages over which i pored ligeia grew ill the wild eyes blazed with a tootoo glorious effulgence the pale fingers became of the transparent waxen hue of the grave and the blue veins upon the lofty forehead swelled and sank impetuously with the tides of the gentle emotion i saw that she must dieand i struggled desperately in spirit with the grim azrael and the struggles of the passionate wife were to my astonishment even more energetic than my own there had been much in her stern nature to impress me with the belief that to her death would have come without its terrors but not so words are impotent to convey any just idea of the fierceness of resistance with which she wrestled with the shadow i groaned in anguish at the pitiable spectacle i would have soothedi would have reasoned but in the intensity of her wild desire for lifefor lifebut for life solace and reason were alike the uttermost of folly yet not until the last instance amid the most convulsive writhings of her fierce spirit was shaken the external placidity of her demeanor her voice grew more gentlegrew more lowyet i would not wish to dwell upon the wild meaning of the quietly uttered words my brain reeled as i hearkened entranced to a melody more than mortalto assumptions and aspirations which mortality had never before known that she loved me i should not have doubted and i might have been easily aware that in a bosom such as hers love would have reigned no ordinary passion but in death only was i fully impressed with the strength of her affection for long hours detaining my hand would she pour out before me the overflowing of a heart whose more than passionate devotion amounted to idolatry how had i deserved to be so blessed by such confessionshow had i deserved to be so cursed with the removal of my beloved in the hour of her making them but upon this subject i cannot bear to dilate let me say only that in ligeias more than womanly abandonment to a love alas all unmerited all unworthily bestowed i at length recognized the principle of her longing with so wildly earnest a desire for the life which was now fleeing so rapidly away it is this wild longingit is this eager vehemence of desire for lifebut for lifethat i have no power to portrayno utterance capable of expressing at high noon of the night in which she departed beckoning me peremptorily to her side she bade me repeat certain verses composed by herself not many days before i obeyed her they were these lo tis a gala night within the lonesome latter years an angel throng bewinged bedight in veils and drowned in tears sit in a theatre to see a play of hopes and fears while the orchestra breathes fitfully the music of the spheres mimes in the form of god on high mutter and mumble low and hither and thither fly mere puppets they who come and go at bidding of vast formless things that shift the scenery to and fro flapping from out their condor wings invisible woe that motley dramaoh be sure it shall not be forgot with its phantom chased for evermore by a crowd that seize it not through a circle that ever returneth in to the selfsame spot and much of madness and more of sin and horror the soul of the plot but see amid the mimic rout a crawling shape intrude a bloodred thing that writhes from out the scenic solitude it writhesit writheswith mortal pangs the mimes become its food and the seraphs sob at vermin fangs in human gore imbued outout are the lightsout all and over each quivering form the curtain a funeral pall comes down with the rush of a storm and the angels all pallid and wan uprising unveiling affirm that the play is the tragedy man and its hero the conqueror worm o god half shrieked ligeia leaping to her feet and extending her arms aloft with a spasmodic movement as i made an end of these lineso god o divine fathershall these things be undeviatingly soshall this conqueror be not once conquered are we not part and parcel in thee whowho knoweth the mysteries of the will with its vigor man doth not yield him to the angels nor unto death utterly save only through the weakness of his feeble will and now as if exhausted with emotion she suffered her white arms to fall and returned solemnly to her bed of death and as she breathed her last sighs there came mingled with them a low murmur from her lips i bent to them my ear and distinguished again the concluding words of the passage in glanvill man doth not yield him to the angels nor unto death utterly save only through the weakness of his feeble will she died and i crushed into the very dust with sorrow could no longer endure the lonely desolation of my dwelling in the dim and decaying city by the rhine i had no lack of what the world calls wealth ligeia had brought me far more very far more than ordinarily falls to the lot of mortals after a few months therefore of weary and aimless wandering i purchased and put in some repair an abbey which i shall not name in one of the wildest and least frequented portions of fair england the gloomy and dreary grandeur of the building the almost savage aspect of the domain the many melancholy and timehonored memories connected with both had much in unison with the feelings of utter abandonment which had driven me into that remote and unsocial region of the country yet although the external abbey with its verdant decay hanging about it suffered but little alteration i gave way with a childlike perversity and perchance with a faint hope of alleviating my sorrows to a display of more than regal magnificence within for such follies even in childhood i had imbibed a taste and now they came back to me as if in the dotage of grief alas i feel how much even of incipient madness might have been discovered in the gorgeous and fantastic draperies in the solemn carvings of egypt in the wild cornices and furniture in the bedlam patterns of the carpets of tufted gold i had become a bounden slave in the trammels of opium and my labors and my orders had taken a coloring from my dreams but these absurdities must not pause to detail let me speak only of that one chamber ever accursed whither in a moment of mental alienation i led from the altar as my brideas the successor of the unforgotten ligeiathe fairhaired and blueeyed lady rowena trevanion of tremaine there is no individual portion of the architecture and decoration of that bridal chamber which is not now visibly before me where were the souls of the haughty family of the bride when through thirst of gold they permitted to pass the threshold of an apartment so bedecked a maiden and a daughter so beloved i have said that i minutely remember the details of the chamberyet i am sadly forgetful on topics of deep moment and here there was no system no keeping in the fantastic display to take hold upon the memory the room lay in a high turret of the castellated abbey was pentagonal in shape and of capacious size occupying the whole southern face of the pentagon was the sole windowan immense sheet of unbroken glass from venice a single pane and tinted of a leaden hue so that the rays of either the sun or moon passing through it fell with a ghastly lustre on the objects within over the upper portion of this huge window extended the trelliswork of an aged vine which clambered up the massy walls of the turret the ceiling of gloomylooking oak was excessively lofty vaulted and elaborately fretted with the wildest and most grotesque specimens of a semigothic semidruidical device from out the most central recess of this melancholy vaulting depended by a single chain of gold with long links a huge censer of the same metal saracenic in pattern and with many perforations so contrived that there writhed in and out of them as if endued with a serpent vitality a continual succession of particolored fires some few ottomans and golden candelabra of eastern figure were in various stations about and there was the couch toothe bridal couchof an indian model and low and sculptured of solid ebony with a palllike canopy above in each of the angles of the chamber stood on end a gigantic sarcophagus of black granite from the tombs of the kings over against luxor with their aged lids full of immemorial sculpture but in the draping of the apartment lay alas the chief phantasy of all the lofty walls gigantic in heighteven unproportionably sowere hung from summit to foot in vast folds with a heavy and massivelooking tapestrytapestry of a material which was found alike as a carpet on the floor as a covering for the ottomans and the ebony bed as a canopy for the bed and as the gorgeous volutes of the curtains which partially shaded the window the material was the richest cloth of gold it was spotted all over at irregular intervals with arabesque figures about a foot in diameter and wrought upon the cloth in patterns of the most jetty black but these figures partook of the true character of the arabesque only when regarded from a single point of view by a contrivance now common and indeed traceable to a very remote period of antiquity they were made changeable in aspect to one entering the room they bore the appearance of simple monstrosities but upon a farther advance this appearance gradually departed and step by step as the visitor moved his station in the chamber he saw himself surrounded by an endless succession of the ghastly forms which belong to the superstition of the norman or arise in the guilty slumbers of the monk the phantasmagoric effect was vastly heightened by the artificial introduction of a strong continual current of wind behind the draperiesgiving a hideous and uneasy animation to the whole in halls such as thesein a bridal chamber such as thisi passed with the lady of tremaine the unhallowed hours of the first month of our marriagepassed them with but little disquietude that my wife dreaded the fierce moodiness of my temperthat she shunned me and loved me but littlei could not help perceiving but it gave me rather pleasure than otherwise i loathed her with a hatred belonging more to demon than to man my memory flew back oh with what intensity of regret to ligeia the beloved the august the beautiful the entombed i revelled in recollections of her purity of her wisdom of her loftyher ethereal nature of her passionate her idolatrous love now then did my spirit fully and freely burn with more than all the fires of her own in the excitement of my opium dreams for i was habitually fettered in the shackles of the drug i would call aloud upon her name during the silence of the night or among the sheltered recesses of the glens by day as if through the wild eagerness the solemn passion the consuming ardor of my longing for the departed i could restore her to the pathway she had abandonedah could it be for everupon the earth about the commencement of the second month of the marriage the lady rowena was attacked with sudden illness from which her recovery was slow the fever which consumed her rendered her nights uneasy and in her perturbed state of halfslumber she spoke of sounds and of motions in and about the chamber of the turret which i concluded had no origin save in the distemper of her fancy or perhaps in the phantasmagoric influences of the chamber itself she became at length convalescentfinally well yet but a brief period elapsed ere a second more violent disorder again threw her upon a bed of suffering and from this attack her frame at all times feeble never altogether recovered her illnesses were after this epoch of alarming character and of more alarming recurrence defying alike the knowledge and the great exertions of her physicians with the increase of the chronic disease which had thus apparently taken too sure hold upon her constitution to be eradicated by human means i could not fail to observe a similar increase in the nervous irritation of her temperament and in her excitability by trivial causes of fear she spoke again and now more frequently and pertinaciously of the soundsof the slight soundsand of the unusual motions among the tapestries to which she had formerly alluded one night near the closing in of september she pressed this distressing subject with more than usual emphasis upon my attention she had just awakened from an unquiet slumber and i had been watching with feelings half of anxiety half of vague terror the workings of her emaciated countenance i sat by the side of her ebony bed upon one of the ottomans of india she partly arose and spoke in an earnest low whisper of sounds which she then heard but which i could not hearof motions which she then saw but which i could not perceive the wind was rushing hurriedly behind the tapestries and i wished to show her what let me confess it i could not all believe that those almost inarticulate breathings and those very gentle variations of the figures upon the wall were but the natural effects of that customary rushing of the wind but a deadly pallor overspreading her face had proved to me that my exertions to reassure her would be fruitless she appeared to be fainting and no attendants were within call i remembered where was deposited a decanter of light wine which had been ordered by her physicians and hastened across the chamber to procure it but as i stepped beneath the light of the censer two circumstances of a startling nature attracted my attention i had felt that some palpable although invisible object had passed lightly by my person and i saw that there lay upon the golden carpet in the very middle of the rich lustre thrown from the censer a shadowa faint indefinite shadow of angelic aspectsuch as might be fancied for the shadow of a shade but i was wild with the excitement of an immoderate dose of opium and heeded these things but little nor spoke of them to rowena having found the wine i recrossed the chamber and poured out a gobletful which i held to the lips of the fainting lady she had now partially recovered however and took the vessel herself while i sank upon an ottoman near me with my eyes fastened upon her person it was then that i became distinctly aware of a gentle footfall upon the carpet and near the couch and in a second thereafter as rowena was in the act of raising the wine to her lips i saw or may have dreamed that i saw fall within the goblet as if from some invisible spring in the atmosphere of the room three or four large drops of a brilliant and ruby colored fluid if this i sawnot so rowena she swallowed the wine unhesitatingly and i forbore to speak to her of a circumstance which must after all i considered have been but the suggestion of a vivid imagination rendered morbidly active by the terror of the lady by the opium and by the hour yet i cannot conceal it from my own perception that immediately subsequent to the fall of the rubydrops a rapid change for the worse took place in the disorder of my wife so that on the third subsequent night the hands of her menials prepared her for the tomb and on the fourth i sat alone with her shrouded body in that fantastic chamber which had received her as my bride wild visions opiumengendered flitted shadowlike before me i gazed with unquiet eye upon the sarcophagi in the angles of the room upon the varying figures of the drapery and upon the writhing of the particolored fires in the censer overhead my eyes then fell as i called to mind the circumstances of a former night to the spot beneath the glare of the censer where i had seen the faint traces of the shadow it was there however no longer and breathing with greater freedom i turned my glances to the pallid and rigid figure upon the bed then rushed upon me a thousand memories of ligeiaand then came back upon my heart with the turbulent violence of a flood the whole of that unutterable woe with which i had regarded her thus enshrouded the night waned and still with a bosom full of bitter thoughts of the one only and supremely beloved i remained gazing upon the body of rowena it might have been midnight or perhaps earlier or later for i had taken no note of time when a sob low gentle but very distinct startled me from my revery i felt that it came from the bed of ebonythe bed of death i listened in an agony of superstitious terrorbut there was no repetition of the sound i strained my vision to detect any motion in the corpsebut there was not the slightest perceptible yet i could not have been deceived i had heard the noise however faint and my soul was awakened within me i resolutely and perseveringly kept my attention riveted upon the body many minutes elapsed before any circumstance occurred tending to throw light upon the mystery at length it became evident that a slight a very feeble and barely noticeable tinge of color had flushed up within the cheeks and along the sunken small veins of the eyelids through a species of unutterable horror and awe for which the language of mortality has no sufficiently energetic expression i felt my heart cease to beat my limbs grow rigid where i sat yet a sense of duty finally operated to restore my selfpossession i could no longer doubt that we had been precipitate in our preparationsthat rowena still lived it was necessary that some immediate exertion be made yet the turret was altogether apart from the portion of the abbey tenanted by the servantsthere were none within calli had no means of summoning them to my aid without leaving the room for many minutesand this i could not venture to do i therefore struggled alone in my endeavors to call back the spirit still hovering in a short period it was certain however that a relapse had taken place the color disappeared from both eyelid and cheek leaving a wanness even more than that of marble the lips became doubly shrivelled and pinched up in the ghastly expression of death a repulsive clamminess and coldness overspread rapidly the surface of the body and all the usual rigorous stiffness immediately supervened i fell back with a shudder upon the couch from which i had been so startlingly aroused and again gave myself up to passionate waking visions of ligeia an hour thus elapsed when could it be possible i was a second time aware of some vague sound issuing from the region of the bed i listenedin extremity of horror the sound came againit was a sigh rushing to the corpse i sawdistinctly sawa tremor upon the lips in a minute afterward they relaxed disclosing a bright line of the pearly teeth amazement now struggled in my bosom with the profound awe which had hitherto reigned there alone i felt that my vision grew dim that my reason wandered and it was only by a violent effort that i at length succeeded in nerving myself to the task which duty thus once more had pointed out there was now a partial glow upon the forehead and upon the cheek and throat a perceptible warmth pervaded the whole frame there was even a slight pulsation at the heart the lady lived and with redoubled ardor i betook myself to the task of restoration i chafed and bathed the temples and the hands and used every exertion which experience and no little medical reading could suggest but in vain suddenly the color fled the pulsation ceased the lips resumed the expression of the dead and in an instant afterward the whole body took upon itself the icy chilliness the livid hue the intense rigidity the sunken outline and all the loathsome peculiarities of that which has been for many days a tenant of the tomb and again i sunk into visions of ligeiaand again what marvel that i shudder while i write again there reached my ears a low sob from the region of the ebony bed but why shall i minutely detail the unspeakable horrors of that night why shall i pause to relate how time after time until near the period of the gray dawn this hideous drama of revivification was repeated how each terrific relapse was only into a sterner and apparently more irredeemable death how each agony wore the aspect of a struggle with some invisible foe and how each struggle was succeeded by i know not what of wild change in the personal appearance of the corpse let me hurry to a conclusion the greater part of the fearful night had worn away and she who had been dead once again stirredand now more vigorously than hitherto although arousing from a dissolution more appalling in its utter hopelessness than any i had long ceased to struggle or to move and remained sitting rigidly upon the ottoman a helpless prey to a whirl of violent emotions of which extreme awe was perhaps the least terrible the least consuming the corpse i repeat stirred and now more vigorously than before the hues of life flushed up with unwonted energy into the countenancethe limbs relaxed and save that the eyelids were yet pressed heavily together and that the bandages and draperies of the grave still imparted their charnel character to the figure i might have dreamed that rowena had indeed shaken off utterly the fetters of death but if this idea was not even then altogether adopted i could at least doubt no longer when arising from the bed tottering with feeble steps with closed eyes and with the manner of one bewildered in a dream the thing that was enshrouded advanced boldly and palpably into the middle of the apartment i trembled noti stirred notfor a crowd of unutterable fancies connected with the air the stature the demeanor of the figure rushing hurriedly through my brain had paralyzedhad chilled me into stone i stirred notbut gazed upon the apparition there was a mad disorder in my thoughtsa tumult unappeasable could it indeed be the living rowena who confronted me could it indeed be rowena at allthe fairhaired the blueeyed lady rowena trevanion of tremaine why why should i doubt it the bandage lay heavily about the mouthbut then might it not be the mouth of the breathing lady of tremaine and the cheeksthere were the roses as in her noon of lifeyes these might indeed be the fair cheeks of the living lady of tremaine and the chin with its dimples as in health might it not be hersbut had she then grown taller since her malady what inexpressible madness seized me with that thought one bound and i had reached her feet shrinking from my touch she let fall from her head unloosened the ghastly cerements which had confined it and there streamed forth into the rushing atmosphere of the chamber huge masses of long and dishevelled hair it was blacker than the raven wings of the midnight and now slowly opened the eyes of the figure which stood before me here then at least i shrieked aloud can i nevercan i never be mistakenthese are the full and the black and the wild eyesof my lost loveof the ladyof the lady ligeia poe and me at the movies by tess gerritsen my introduction to edgar allan poe wasnt on the page but in a darkened movie theater my fingers clenched in fear around my mothers hand i wish i could say i was already an avid fan of poes written work but i had a good excuse for not reading him i was only seven years old at the time too young to appreciate his dense prose and his convoluted themes but i was certainly old enough to be thrilled by the movies that were loosely based on his stories there were seven poe films made by legendary director roger corman and i saw every single one of them usually the very week they arrived in the theaters i had no choice but to go my mother made me my mother is a chinese immigrant who arrived in the united states in her early twenties speaking almost no english even to this day her grasp of the english language is shaky at best back then in it was truly a struggle for her to read an englishlanguage book or newspaper what she did grasp however were american horror films how much english do you need to know after all to feel the terror of a good oldfashioned movie monster and so she dragged me and my younger brother to the theater at the time there were no mpaa ratings to guide parents no ominous pg labels to deter her she took us to them all i spent my childhood cowering in dark theaters tormented by nightmares of killer ants and pod people i also learned to love poeat least the bmovie versions of poe starting with house of usher all the way to the tomb of ligeia i was captivated by those cheap sets and the hammy acting and happy to be caught up in the pure pleasure of being utterly even sickeningly terrified i was no judge of what constituted a great film my favorite was premature burial which is generally considered by critics to be the worst of the lot but to this day one shocking scene from that film at least i think it was from premature burial still haunts me a thirsty ray milland lifting a wine goblet to his lips only to recoil in horror when he finds it brimming with maggots thats the kind of image that tends to stick with a nineyearold everything i know about thriller writing i learned by watching those bmovie versions of edgar allan poe i know they were hardly faithful translations i have since read the tales bearing the same titles and i can scarcely recognize most of them as an adult i can appreciate poes groundbreaking literary work but as a kid i certainly would not have im sure i would have thought him inaccessible and wordy andif i had known the word at the time pretentious it took a roger corman to translate poes work into a form that even a sevenyearold kid could understand he distilled it down to campy horror some would contend that by doing so he undermined the dignity of the literary works i think not i think corman gave a whole generation of kids our very first look at poes geniusand what an enticing peek it was tess gerritsens father was a restaurant chef and her immigrant mother is the granddaughter of a prominent chinese poet so she grew up enjoying great food great books and scary b movies shes convinced that a childhood spent watching films based on edgar allan poe stories helped turn her into the thriller writer she is today with fifteen million copies of her books sold in thirtytwo countries she lives in maine the telltale heart true nervousvery very dreadfully nervous i had been and am but why will you say that i am mad the disease had sharpened my sensesnot destroyednot dulled them above all was the sense of hearing acute i heard all things in the heaven and in the earth i heard many things in hell how then am i mad hearken and observe how healthilyhow calmly i can tell you the whole story it is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain but once conceived it haunted me day and night object there was none passion there was none i loved the old man he had never wronged me he had never given me insult for his gold i had no desire i think it was his eye yes it was this one of his eyes resembled that of a vulture a pale blue eye with a film over it whenever it fell upon me my blood ran cold and so by degreesvery graduallyi made up my mind to take the life of the old man and thus rid myself of the eye for ever now this is the point you fancy me mad madmen know nothing but you should have seen me you should have seen how wisely i proceededwith what cautionwith what foresightwith what dissimulation i went to work i was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before i killed him and every night about midnight i turned the latch of his door and opened itoh so gently and then when i had made an opening sufficient for my head i put in a dark lantern all closed closed so that no light shone out and then i thrust in my head oh you would have laughed to see how cunningly i thrust it in i moved it slowlyvery very slowly so that i might not disturb the old mans sleep it took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that i could see him as he lay upon his bed hawould a madman have been so wise as this and then when my head was well in the room i undid the lantern cautiouslyoh so cautiouslycautiously for the hinges creakedi undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye and this i did for seven long nightsevery night just at midnightbut i found the eye always closed and so it was impossible to do the work for it was not the old man who vexed me but his evil eye and every morning when the day broke i went boldly into the chamber and spoke courageously to him calling him by name in a hearty tone and inquiring how he had passed the night so you see he would have been a very profound old man indeed to suspect that every night just at twelve i looked in upon him while he slept upon the eighth night i was more than usually cautious in opening the door a watchs minute hand moves more quickly than did mine never before that night had i felt the extent of my own powersof my sagacity i could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph to think that there i was opening the door little by little and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts i fairly chuckled at the idea and perhaps he heard me for he moved on the bed suddenly as if startled now you may think that i drew backbut no his room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness for the shutters were close fastened through fear of robbers and so i knew that he could not see the opening of the door and i kept pushing it on steadily steadily i had my head in and was about to open the lantern when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening and the old man sprang up in the bed crying outwhos there i kept quite still and said nothing for a whole hour i did not move a muscle and in the meantime i did not hear him lie down he was still sitting up in the bed listeningjust as i have done night after night hearkening to the death watches in the wall presently i heard a slight groan and i knew it was the groan of mortal terror it was not a groan of pain or of griefoh noit was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe i knew the sound well many a night just at midnight when all the world slept it has welled up from my own bosom deepening with its dreadful echo the terrors that distracted me i say i knew it well i knew what the old man felt and pitied him although i chuckled at heart i knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise when he had turned in the bed his fears had been ever since growing upon him he had been trying to fancy them causeless but could not he had been saying to himselfit is nothing but the wind in the chimneyit is only a mouse crossing the floor or it is merely a cricket which has made a single chirp yes he had been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions but he had found all in vain all in vain because death in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him and enveloped the victim and it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feelalthough he neither saw nor heardto feel the presence of my head within the room when i had waited a long time very patiently without hearing him lie down i resolved to open a littlea very very little crevice in the lantern so i opened ityou cannot imagine how stealthily stealthilyuntil at length a simple dim ray like the thread of the spider shot from out the crevice and fell upon the vulture eye it was openwide wide openand i grew furious as i gazed upon it i saw it with perfect distinctnessall a dull blue with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones but i could see nothing else of the old mans face or person for i had directed the ray as if by instinct precisely upon the damned spot and now have i not told you that what you mistake for madness is but overacuteness of the sensenow i say there came to my ears a low dull quick sound such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton i knew that sound well too it was the beating of the old mans heart it increased my fury as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage but even yet i refrained and kept still i scarcely breathed i held the lantern motionless i tried how steadily i could maintain the ray upon the eye meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased it grew quicker and quicker and louder and louder every instant the old mans terror must have been extreme it grew louder i say louder every momentdo you mark me well i have told you that i am nervous so i am and now at the dead hour of the night amid the dreadful silence of that old house so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror yet for some minutes longer i refrained and stood still but the beating grew louder louder i thought the heart must burst and now a new anxiety seized methe sound would be heard by a neighbor the old mans hour had come with a loud yell i threw open the lantern and leaped into the room he shrieked onceonce only in an instant i dragged him to the floor and pulled the heavy bed over him i then smiled gaily to find the deed so far done but for many minutes the heart beat on with a muffled sound this however did not vex me it would not be heard through the wall at length it ceased the old man was dead i removed the bed and examined the corpse yes he was stone stone dead i placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes there was no pulsation he was stone dead his eye would trouble me no more if still you think me mad you will think so no longer when i describe the wise precautions i took for the concealment of the body the night waned and i worked hastily but in silence first of all i dismembered the corpse i cut off the head and the arms and the legs i then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber and deposited all between the scantlings i then replaced the boards so cleverly so cunningly that no human eyenot even hiscould have detected any thing wrong there was nothing to wash outno stain of any kindno bloodspot whatever i had been too wary for that a tub had caught allha ha when i had made an end of these labors it was four oclock still dark as midnight as the bell sounded the hour there came a knocking at the street door i went down to open it with a light heartfor what had i now to fear there entered three men who introduced themselves with perfect suavity as officers of the police a shriek had been heard by a neighbor during the night suspicion of foul play had been aroused information had been lodged at the police office and they the officers had been deputed to search the premises i smiledfor what had i to fear i bade the gentlemen welcome the shriek i said was my own in a dream the old man i mentioned was absent in the country i took my visitors all over the house i bade them searchsearch well i led them at length to his chamber i showed them his treasures secure undisturbed in the enthusiasm of my confidence i brought chairs into the room and desired them here to rest from their fatigues while i myself in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim the officers were satisfied my manner had convinced them i was singularly at ease they sat and while i answered cheerily they chatted of familiar things but ere long i felt myself getting pale and wished them gone my head ached and i fancied a ringing in my ears but still they sat and still chatted the ringing became more distinctit continued and became more distinct i talked more freely to get rid of the feeling but it continued and gained definitenessuntil at length i found that the noise was not within my ears no doubt i now grew very palebut i talked more fluently and with a heightened voice yet the sound increasedand what could i do it was a low dull quick soundmuch such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton i gasped for breathand yet the officers heard it not i talked more quicklymore vehemently but the noise steadily increased i arose and argued about trifles in a high key and with violent gesticulations but the noise steadily increased why would they not be gone i paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides as if excited to fury by the observations of the menbut the noise steadily increased oh god what could i do i foamed i ravedi swore i swung the chair upon which i had been sitting and grated it upon the boards but the noise arose over all and continually increased it grew louderlouderlouder and still the men chatted pleasantly and smiled was it possible they heard not almighty godno no they heardthey suspectedthey knewthey were making a mockery of my horrorthis i thought and this i think but any thing was better than this agony any thing was more tolerable than this derision i could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer i felt that i must scream or dieand now againhark louder louder louder louder villains i shrieked dissemble no more i admit the deed tear up the planks here hereit is the beating of his hideous heart the genius of the telltale heart by stephen king when i do public appearances im oftenno alwaysasked what scares me the answer is almost everything from express elevators in very tall buildings to the idea of a zealot loose with a suitcase nuke in one of the great cities of the world but if the question is refined to what works of fiction have scared you two always leap immediately to mind lord of the flies by william golding and the telltale heart by edgar allan poe most people know that poe invented the modern detective story conan doyles sherlock holmes is in many ways the same detective as poes c auguste dupin but few are aware that he also created the first work of criminal sociopathy in the telltale heart a story originally published in many great crime writers of the twentieth century from jim thompson and john d macdonald to thomas harris who in hannibal lecter may have created the greatest sociopath of them all are the children of poe the details of the story are still gruesome enough to produce nightmares the cutting up of the victims body for instance or the old mans one dying shriek but the terror that lingersand the storys geniuslies in the superficially reasonable voice of the narrator he is never named and that is fitting because we have no idea how he picked his victim or what drove him to the crime oh we know what he says it was the old mans gruesomely veiled eye but of course jeffrey dahmer said he wanted to create zombies and the son of sam at one point claimed his dog told him to do it we understand i think that psychopaths offer such wacky motivations because they are as helpless as the rest of us to explain their terrible acts this is above all a persuasive story of lunacy and poe never offers any real explanations nor has to the narrators cheerful laughter a tub had caught all the bloodha ha tells us all we need to know here is a creature who looks like a man but who really belongs to another species thats scary what elevates this story beyond merely scary and into the realm of genius though is that poe foresaw the darkness of generations far beyond his own ours for instance stephen king was born in portland maine in the second son of donald and nellie ruth pillsbury king he made his first professional short story sale in to startling mystery stories in the fall of he began teaching high school english classes at hampden academy the public high school in hampden maine writing in the evenings and on the weekends he continued to produce short stories and work on novels in the spring of doubleday company accepted the novel carrie for publication and the books success provided him with the means to leave teaching and write fulltime he has since published more than forty books and become one of the worlds most successful writers stephen lives in maine and florida with his wife novelist tabitha king they are regular contributors to a number of charities including many libraries and have been honored locally for their philanthropic activities the first time by steve hamilton i read my first poe story the murders in the rue morgue in i was thirteen years old i read that story then another working my way through an old hardback anthology while sitting on a hard plastic chair in the most miserable place in the world that place was highland junior high school in highland michigan nobody is supposed to like junior high school i know but seriously hjh was a twoyear prison sentence the worst part was wintertime when the sun didnt even start coming up until the end of first period as a bonus sometimes a few of the worst kids would escape outside push open the windows and then pelt everyone with ice balls if you werent quick enough you were a goner that first class of the day the world outside still pitchblack was seventhgrade english the teacher was a man named vincent lucius i still remember him because at the time i thought he was probably insane first of all he was always in an unnaturally cheerful mood even on monday mornings in january and even worse he actually seemed to enjoy his job he loved teaching he loved being around seventhgraders if you can even imagine that more than anything he loved good writing the first time he made us all write something i came up with some strange story about me and my best friend catching a burglar mr lucius stood up in front of the class and read it out loud having a teacher single you out in seventh grade was a seriously uncool thing in and i dont imagine thats changed much since but he made me keep writing i ended up giving him more crime stories always me and my friend catching grownup bad guys i was reading a lot of hardy boys then along with encyclopedia brown and the three investigators thats what i thought a mystery should be a little bit of danger to keep things interesting but everything turning out right in the end one day mr lucius gave me the collected stories of edgar allan poe and told me to give it a try i think youre ready for something a little darker he said to me just leave this on my desk at the end of class you can read some more tomorrow he must have known what those stories would do to me the nineteenthcentury language was a little tough to get through at first but once i got the hang of it damn this was a little darker all right this was the real thing this was what it looked like when things didnt turn out right in the end and poe wasnt just standing on the outside of it looking in he lived there the pit and the pendulum the telltale heart every time i go back to these stories im right back there in junior high school again dodging ice balls im back to that one hour when i could lose myself in this other world as dark and mysterious as anything id ever imagined created whole by a man who died years before i was born back to that feeling i had when i first started reading the real thing and wondering if there was any way id ever be able to write that way myself it was in that seventhgrade class in when i decided exactly what i wanted to be when i grew up so thanks mr vincent lucius wherever you are and thanks to you mr edgar allan poe born and raised in detroit steve hamilton graduated from the university of michigan where he won the prestigious hopwood award for fiction in he won the michigan author award for his outstanding body of work his novels have won numerous awards and media acclaim beginning with the very first in the alex mcknight series a cold day in paradise which won the private eye writers of americast martins press award for best first mystery by an unpublished writer once published it went on to win the mwa edgar and the pwa shamus awards for best first novel and it was shortlisted for the anthony and barry awards the awards didnt stop there but hes too modest to crow about them hamilton currently works for ibm in upstate new york where he lives with his wife julia and their two children the pit and the pendulum i was sick sick unto death with that long agony and when they at length unbound me and i was permitted to sit i felt that my senses were leaving me the sentence the dread sentence of deathwas the last of distinct accentuation which reached my ears after that the sound of the inquisitorial voices seemed merged in one dreamy indeterminate hum it conveyed to my soul the idea of revolutionperhaps from its association in fancy with the burr of a millwheel this only for a brief period for presently i heard no more yet for a while i sawbut with how terrible an exaggeration i saw the lips of the blackrobed judges they appeared to me whitewhiter than the sheet upon which i trace these wordsand thin even to grotesqueness thin with the intensity of their expression of firmnessof immoveable resolutionof stern contempt of human torture i saw that the decrees of what to me was fate were still issuing from those lips i saw them writhe with a deadly locution i saw them fashion the syllables of my name and i shuddered because no sound succeeded i saw too for a few moments of delirious horror the soft and nearly imperceptible waving of the sable draperies which enwrapped the walls of the apartment and then my vision fell upon the seven tall candles upon the table at first they wore the aspect of charity and seemed white slender angels who would save me but then all at once there came a most deadly nausea over my spirit and i felt every fibre in my frame thrill as if i had touched the wire of a galvanic battery while the angel forms became meaningless spectres with heads of flame and i saw that from them there would be no help and then there stole into my fancy like a rich musical note the thought of what sweet rest there must be in the grave the thought came gently and stealthily and it seemed long before it attained full appreciation but just as my spirit came at length properly to feel and entertain it the figures of the judges vanished as if magically from before me the tall candles sank into nothingness their flames went out utterly the blackness of darkness supervened all sensations appeared swallowed up in a mad rushing descent as of the soul into hades then silence and stillness and night were the universe i had swooned but still will not say that all of consciousness was lost what of it there remained i will not attempt to define or even to describe yet all was not lost in the deepest slumberno in deliriumno in a swoonno in deathno even in the grave all is not lost else there is no immortality for man arousing from the most profound of slumbers we break the gossamer web of some dream yet in a second afterward so frail may that web have been we remember not that we have dreamed in the return to life from the swoon there are two stages first that of the sense of mental or spiritual secondly that of the sense of physical existence it seems probable that if upon reaching the second stage we could recall the impressions of the first we should find these impressions eloquent in memories of the gulf beyond and that gulf iswhat how at least shall we distinguish its shadows from those of the tomb but if the impressions of what i have termed the first stage are not at will recalled yet after long interval do they not come unbidden while we marvel whence they come he who has never swooned is not he who finds strange palaces and wildly familiar faces in coals that glow is not he who beholds floating in midair the sad visions that the many may not view is not he who ponders over the perfume of some novel flower is not he whose brain grows bewildered with the meaning of some musical cadence which has never before arrested his attention amid frequent and thoughtful endeavors to remember amid earnest struggles to regather some token of the state of seeming nothingness into which my soul had lapsed there have been moments when i have dreamed of success there have been brief very brief periods when i have conjured up remembrances which the lucid reason of a later epoch assures me could have had reference only to that condition of seeming unconsciousness these shadows of memory tell indistinctly of tall figures that lifted and bore me in silence downdownstill downtill a hideous dizziness oppressed me at the mere idea of the interminableness of the descent they tell also of a vague horror at my heart on account of that hearts unnatural stillness then comes a sense of sudden motionlessness throughout all things as if those who bore me a ghastly train had outrun in their descent the limits of the limitless and paused from the wearisomeness of their toil after this i call to mind flatness and dampness and then all is madnessthe madness of a memory which busies itself among forbidden things very suddenly there came back to my soul motion and soundthe tumultuous motion of the heart and in my ears the sound of its beating then a pause in which all is blank then again sound and motion and toucha tingling sensation pervading my frame then the mere consciousness of existence without thoughta condition which lasted long then very suddenly thought and shuddering terror and earnest endeavor to comprehend my true state then a strong desire to lapse into insensibility then a rushing revival of soul and a successful effort to move and now a full memory of the trial of the judges of the sable draperies of the sentence of the sickness of the swoon then entire forgetfulness of all that followed of all that a later day and much earnestness of endeavor have enabled me vaguely to recall so far i had not opened my eyes i felt that i lay upon my back unbound i reached out my hand and it fell heavily upon something damp and hard there i suffered it to remain for many minutes while i strove to imagine where and what i could be i longed yet dared not to employ my vision i dreaded the first glance at objects around me it was not that i feared to look upon things horrible but that i grew aghast lest there should be nothing to see at length with a wild desperation at heart i quickly unclosed my eyes my worst thoughts then were confirmed the blackness of eternal night encompassed me i struggled for breath the intensity of the darkness seemed to oppress and stifle me the atmosphere was intolerably close i still lay quietly and made effort to exercise my reason i brought to mind the inquisitorial proceedings and attempted from that point to deduce my real condition the sentence had passed and it appeared to me that a very long interval of time had since elapsed yet not for a moment did i suppose myself actually dead such a supposition notwithstanding what we read in fiction is altogether inconsistent with real existencebut where and in what state was i the condemned to death i knew perished usually at the autodafés and one of these had been held on the very night of the day of my trial had i been remanded to my dungeon to await the next sacrifice which would not take place for many months this i at once saw could not be victims had been in immediate demand moreover my dungeon as well as all the condemned cells at toledo had stone floors and light was not altogether excluded a fearful idea now suddenly drove the blood in torrents upon my heart and for a brief period i once more relapsed into insensibility upon recovering i at once started to my feet trembling convulsively in every fibre i thrust my arms wildly above and around me in all directions i felt nothing yet dreaded to move a step lest i should be impeded by the walls of a tomb perspiration burst from every pore and stood in cold big beads upon my forehead the agony of suspense grew at length intolerable and i cautiously moved forward with my arms extended and my eyes straining from their sockets in the hope of catching some faint ray of light i proceeded for many paces but still all was blackness and vacancy i breathed more freely it seemed evident that mine was not at least the most hideous of fates and now as i still continued to step cautiously onward there came thronging upon my recollection a thousand vague rumors of the horrors of toledo of the dungeons there had been strange things narratedfables i had always deemed them but yet strange and too ghastly to repeat save in a whisper was i left to perish of starvation in this subterranean world of darkness or what fate perhaps even more fearful awaited me that the result would be death and a death of more than customary bitterness i knew too well the character of my judges to doubt the mode and the hour were all that occupied or distracted me my outstretched hands at length encountered some solid obstruction it was a wall seemingly of stone masonryvery smooth slimy and cold i followed it up stepping with all the careful distrust with which certain antique narratives had inspired me this process however afforded me no means of ascertaining the dimensions of my dungeon as i might make its circuit and return to the point whence i set out without being aware of the fact so perfectly uniform seemed the wall i therefore sought the knife which had been in my pocket when led into the inquisitorial chamber but it was gone my clothes had been exchanged for a wrapper of coarse serge i had thought of forcing the blade in some minute crevice of the masonry so as to identify my point of departure the difficulty nevertheless was but trivial although in the disorder of my fancy it seemed at first insuperable i tore a part of the hem from the robe and placed the fragment at full length and at right angles to the wall in groping my way around the prison i could not fail to encounter this rag upon completing the circuit so at least i thought but i had not counted upon the extent of the dungeon or upon my own weakness the ground was moist and slippery i staggered onward for some time when i stumbled and fell my excessive fatigue induced me to remain prostrate and sleep soon overtook me as i lay upon awaking and stretching forth an arm i found beside me a loaf and a pitcher with water i was too much exhausted to reflect upon this circumstance but ate and drank with avidity shortly afterward i resumed my tour around the prison and with much toil came at last upon the fragment of the serge up to the period when i fell i had counted fiftytwo paces and upon resuming my walk i had counted fortyeight morewhen i arrived at the rag there were in all then a hundred paces and admitting two paces to the yard i presumed the dungeon to be fifty yards in circuit i had met however with many angles in the wall and thus i could form no guess at the shape of the vault for vault i could not help supposing it to be i had little objectcertainly no hopein these researches but a vague curiosity prompted me to continue them quitting the wall i resolved to cross the area of the enclosure at first i proceeded with extreme caution for the floor although seemingly of solid material was treacherous with slime at length however i took courage and did not hesitate to step firmlyendeavoring to cross in as direct a line as possible i had advanced some ten or twelve paces in this manner when the remnant of the torn hem of my robe became entangled between my legs i stepped on it and fell violently on my face in the confusion attending my fall i did not immediately apprehend a somewhat startling circumstance which yet in a few seconds afterward and while i still lay prostrate arrested my attention it was this my chin rested upon the floor of the prison but my lips and the upper portion of my head although seemingly at a less elevation than the chin touched nothing at the same time my forehead seemed bathed in a clammy vapor and the peculiar smell of decayed fungus arose to my nostrils i put forward my arm and shuddered to find that i had fallen at the very brink of a circular pit whose extent of course i had no means of ascertaining at the moment groping about the masonry just below the margin i succeeded in dislodging a small fragment and let it fall into the abyss for many seconds i hearkened to its reverberations as it dashed against the sides of the chasm in its descent at length there was a sullen plunge into water succeeded by loud echoes at the same moment there came a sound resembling the quick opening and as rapid closing of a door overhead while a faint gleam of light flashed suddenly through the gloom and as suddenly faded away i saw clearly the doom which had been prepared for me and congratulated myself upon the timely accident by which i had escaped another step before my fall and the world had seen me no more and the death just avoided was of that very character which i had regarded as fabulous and frivolous in the tales respecting the inquisition to the victims of its tyranny there was the choice of death with its direst physical agonies or death with its most hideous moral horrors i had been reserved for the latter by long suffering my nerves had been unstrung until i trembled at the sound of my own voice and had become in every respect a fitting subject for the species of torture which awaited me shaking in every limb i groped my way back to the wallresolving there to perish rather than risk the terrors of the wells of which my imagination now pictured many in various positions about the dungeon in other conditions of mind i might have had courage to end my misery at once by a plunge into one of these abysses but now i was the veriest of cowards neither could i forget what i had read of these pitsthat the sudden extinction of life formed no part of their most horrible plan agitation of spirit kept me awake for many long hours but at length i again slumbered upon arousing i found by my side as before a loaf and a pitcher of water a burning thirst consumed me and i emptied the vessel at a draught it must have been drugged for scarcely had i drunk before i became irresistibly drowsy a deep sleep fell upon mea sleep like that of death how long it lasted of course i know not but when once again i unclosed my eyes the objects around me were visible by a wild sulphurous lustre the origin of which i could not at first determine i was enabled to see the extent and aspect of the prison in its size i had been greatly mistaken the whole circuit of its walls did not exceed twentyfive yards for some minutes this fact occasioned me a world of vain trouble vain indeedfor what could be of less importance under the terrible circumstances which environed me than the mere dimensions of my dungeon but my soul took a wild interest in trifles and i busied myself in endeavors to account for the error i had committed in my measurement the truth at length flashed upon me in my first attempt at exploration i had counted fiftytwo paces up to the period when i fell i must then have been within a pace or two of the fragment of serge in fact i had nearly performed the circuit of the vault i then sleptand upon awaking i must have returned upon my stepsthus supposing the circuit nearly double what it actually was my confusion of mind prevented me from observing that i began my tour with the wall to the left and ended it with the wall to the right i had been deceived too in respect to the shape of the enclosure in feeling my way i had found many angles and thus deduced an idea of great irregularity so potent is the effect of total darkness upon one arousing from lethargy or sleep the angles were simply those of a few slight depressions or niches at odd intervals the general shape of the prison was square what i had taken for masonry seemed now to be iron or some other metal in huge plates whose sutures or joints occasioned the depression the entire surface of this metallic enclosure was rudely daubed in all the hideous and repulsive devices to which the charnel superstition of the monks has given rise the figures of fiends in aspects of menace with skeleton forms and other more really fearful images overspread and disfigured the walls i observed that the outlines of these monstrosities were sufficiently distinct but that the colors seemed faded and blurred as if from the effects of a damp atmosphere i now noticed the floor too which was of stone in the centre yawned the circular pit from whose jaws i had escaped but it was the only one in the dungeon all this i saw indistinctly and by much effortfor my personal condition had been greatly changed during slumber i now lay upon my back and at full length on a species of low framework of wood to this i was securely bound by a long strap resembling a surcingle it passed in many convolutions about my limbs and body leaving at liberty only my head and my left arm to such extent that i could by dint of much exertion supply myself with food from an earthen dish which lay by my side on the floor i saw to my horror that the pitcher had been removed i say to my horrorfor i was consumed with intolerable thirst this thirst it appeared to be the design of my persecutors to stimulatefor the food in the dish was meat pungently seasoned looking upward i surveyed the ceiling of my prison it was some thirty or forty feet overhead and constructed much as the side walls in one of its panels a very singular figure riveted my whole attention it was the painted figure of time as he is commonly represented save that in lieu of a scythe he held what at a casual glance i supposed to be the pictured image of a huge pendulum such as we see on antique clocks there was something however in the appearance of this machine which caused me to regard it more attentively while i gazed directly upward at it for its position was immediately over my own i fancied that i saw it in motion in an instant afterward the fancy was confirmed its sweep was brief and of course slow i watched it for some minutes somewhat in fear but more in wonder wearied at length with observing its dull movement i turned my eyes upon the other objects in the cell a slight noise attracted my notice and looking to the floor i saw several enormous rats traversing it they had issued from the well which lay just within view to my right even then while i gazed they came up in troops hurriedly with ravenous eyes allured by the scent of the meat from this it required much effort and attention to scare them away it might have been half an hour perhaps even an hour for i could take but imperfect note of time before i again cast my eyes upward what i then saw confounded and amazed me the sweep of the pendulum had increased in extent by nearly a yard as a natural consequence its velocity was also much greater but what mainly disturbed me was the idea that it had perceptibly descended i now observedwith what horror it is needless to saythat its nether extremity was formed of a crescent of glittering steel about a foot in length from horn to horn the horns upward and the under edge evidently as keen as that of a razor like a razor also it seemed massy and heavy tapering from the edge into a solid and broad structure above it was appended to a weighty rod of brass and the whole hissed as it swung through the air i could no longer doubt the doom prepared for me by monkish ingenuity in torture my cognizance of the pit had become known to the inquisitorial agentsthe pit whose horrors had been destined for so bold a recusant as myselfthe pit typical of hell and regarded by rumor as the ultima thule of all their punishments the plunge into this pit i had avoided by the merest of accidents and i knew that surprise or entrapment into torment formed an important portion of all the grotesquerie of these dungeon deaths having failed to fall it was no part of the demon plan to hurl me into the abyss and thus there being no alternative a different and a milder destruction awaited me milder i half smiled in my agony as i thought of such application of such a term what boots it to tell of the long long hours of horror more than mortal during which i counted the rushing oscillations of the steel inch by inchline by linewith a descent only appreciable at intervals that seemed agesdown and still down it came days passed it might have been that many days passedere it swept so closely over me as to fan me with its acrid breath the odor of the sharp steel forced itself into my nostrils i prayedi wearied heaven with my prayer for its more speedy descent i grew frantically mad and struggled to force myself upward against the sweep of the fearful scimitar and then i fell suddenly calm and lay smiling at the glittering death as a child at some rare bauble there was another interval of utter insensibility it was brief for upon again lapsing into life there had been no perceptible descent in the pendulum but it might have been longfor i knew there were demons who took note of my swoon and who could have arrested the vibration at pleasure upon my recovery too i felt veryoh inexpressiblysick and weak as if through long inanition even amid the agonies of that period the human nature craved food with painful effort i outstretched my left arm as far as my bonds permitted and took possession of the small remnant which had been spared me by the rats as i put a portion of it within my lips there rushed to my mind a halfformed thought of joyof hope yet what business had i with hope it was as i say a halfformed thoughtman has many such which are never completed i felt that it was of joyof hope but i felt also that it had perished in its formation in vain i struggled to perfectto regain it long suffering had nearly annihilated all my ordinary powers of mind i was an imbecilean idiot the vibration of the pendulum was at right angles to my length i saw that the crescent was designed to cross the region of the heart it would fray the serge of my robeit would return and repeat its operationsagainand again notwithstanding its terrifically wide sweep some thirty feet or more and the hissing vigor of its descent sufficient to sunder these very walls of iron still the fraying of my robe would be all that for several minutes it would accomplish and at this thought i paused i dared not go further than this reflection i dwelt upon it with a pertinacity of attentionas if in so dwelling i could arrest here the descent of the steel i forced myself to ponder upon the sound of the crescent as it should pass across the garmentupon the peculiar thrilling sensation which the friction of cloth produces on the nerves i pondered upon all this frivolity until my teeth were on edge downsteadily down it crept i took a frenzied pleasure in contrasting its downward with its lateral velocity to the rightto the leftfar and widewith the shriek of a damned spirit to my heart with the stealthy pace of the tiger i alternately laughed and howled as the one or the other idea grew predominant downcertainly relentlessly down it vibrated within three inches of my bosom i struggled violentlyfuriouslyto free my left arm this was free only from the elbow to the hand i could reach the latter from the platter beside me to my mouth with great effort but no farther could i have broken the fastenings above the elbow i would have seized and attempted to arrest the pendulum i might as well have attempted to arrest an avalanche downstill unceasinglystill inevitably down i gasped and struggled at each vibration i shrunk convulsively at its every sweep my eyes followed its outward or upward whirls with the eagerness of the most unmeaning despair they closed themselves spasmodically at the descent although death would have been a relief oh how unspeakable still i quivered in every nerve to think how slight a sinking of the machinery would precipitate that keen glistening axe upon my bosom it was hope that prompted the nerve to quiverthe frame to shrink it was hopethe hope that triumphs on the rack that whispers to the deathcondemned even in the dungeons of the inquisition i saw that some ten or twelve vibrations would bring the steel in actual contact with my robeand with this observation there suddenly came over my spirit all the keen collected calmness of despair for the first time during many hoursor perhaps daysi thought it now occurred to me that the bandage or surcingle which enveloped me was unique i was tied by no separate cord the first stroke of the razorlike crescent athwart any portion of the band would so detach it that it might be unwound from my person by means of my left hand but how fearful in that case the proximity of the steel the result of the slightest struggle how deadly was it likely moreover that the minions of the torturer had not foreseen and provided for this possibility was it probable that the bandage crossed my bosom in the track of the pendulum dreading to find my faint and as it seemed my last hope frustrated i so far elevated my head as to obtain a distinct view of my breast the surcingle enveloped my limbs and body close in all directionssave in the path of the destroying crescent scarcely had i dropped my head back into its original position when there flashed upon my mind what i cannot better describe than as the unformed half of that idea of deliverance to which i have previously alluded and of which a moiety only floated indeterminately through my brain when i raised food to my burning lips the whole thought was now presentfeeble scarcely sane scarcely definitebut still entire i proceeded at once with the nervous energy of despair to attempt its execution for many hours the immediate vicinity of the low framework upon which i lay had been literally swarming with rats they were wild bold ravenoustheir red eyes glaring upon me as if they waited but for motionlessness on my part to make me their prey to what food i thought have they been accustomed in the well they had devoured in spite of all my efforts to prevent them all but a small remnant of the contents of the dish i had fallen into an habitual seesaw or wave of the hand about the platter and at length the unconscious uniformity of the movement deprived it of effect in their voracity the vermin frequently fastened their sharp fangs in my fingers with the particles of the oily and spicy viand which now remained i thoroughly rubbed the bandage wherever i could reach it then raising my hand from the floor i lay breathlessly still at first the ravenous animals were startled and terrified at the changeat the cessation of movement they shrank alarmedly back many sought the well but this was only for a moment i had not counted in vain upon their voracity observing that i remained without motion one or two of the boldest leaped upon the framework and smelt at the surcingle this seemed the signal for a general rush forth from the well they hurried in fresh troops they clung to the woodthey overran it and leaped in hundreds upon my person the measured movement of the pendulum disturbed them not at all avoiding its strokes they busied themselves with the anointed bandage they pressedthey swarmed upon me in ever accumulating heaps they writhed upon my throat their cold lips sought my own i was half stifled by their thronging pressure disgust for which the world has no name swelled my bosom and chilled with a heavy clamminess my heart yet one minute and i felt that the struggle would be over plainly i perceived the loosening of the bandage i knew that in more than one place it must be already severed with a more than human resolution i lay still nor had i erred in my calculationsnor had i endured in vain i at length felt that i was free the surcingle hung in ribands from my body but the stroke of the pendulum already pressed upon my bosom it had divided the serge of the robe it had cut through the linen beneath twice again it swung and a sharp sense of pain shot through every nerve but the moment of escape had arrived at a wave of my hand my deliverers hurried tumultuously away with a steady movementcautious sidelong shrinking and slowi slid from the embrace of the bandage and beyond the reach of the scimitar for the moment at least i was free freeand in the grasp of the inquisition i had scarcely stepped from my wooden bed of horror upon the stone floor of the prison when the motion of the hellish machine ceased and i beheld it drawn up by some invisible force through the ceiling this was a lesson which i took desperately to heart my every motion was undoubtedly watched freei had but escaped death in one form of agony to be delivered unto worse than death in some other with that thought i rolled my eyes nervously around on the barriers of iron that hemmed me in something unusualsome change which at first i could not appreciate distinctlyit was obvious had taken place in the apartment for many minutes of a dreamy and trembling abstraction i busied myself in vain unconnected conjecture during this period i became aware for the first time of the origin of the sulphurous light which illumined the cell it proceeded from a fissure about half an inch in width extending entirely around the prison at the base of the walls which thus appeared and were completely separated from the floor i endeavored but of course in vain to look through the aperture as i arose from the attempt the mystery of the alteration in the chamber broke at once upon my understanding i have observed that although the outlines of the figures upon the walls were sufficiently distinct yet the colors seemed blurred and indefinite these colors had now assumed and were momentarily assuming a startling and most intense brilliancy that gave to the spectral and fiendish portraitures an aspect that might have thrilled even firmer nerves than my own demon eyes of a wild and ghastly vivacity glared upon me in a thousand directions where none had been visible before and gleamed with the lurid lustre of a fire that i could not force my imagination to regard as unreal unreal even while i breathed there came to my nostrils the breath of the vapor of heated iron a suffocating odor pervaded the prison a deeper glow settled each moment in the eyes that glared at my agonies a richer tint of crimson diffused itself over the pictured horrors of blood i panted i gasped for breath there could be no doubt of the design of my tormentorsoh most unrelenting oh most demoniac of men i shrank from the glowing metal to the centre of the cell amid the thought of the fiery destruction that impended the idea of the coolness of the well came over my soul like balm i rushed to its deadly brink i threw my straining vision below the glare from the enkindled roof illumined its inmost recesses yet for a wild moment did my spirit refuse to comprehend the meaning of what i saw at length it forcedit wrestled its way into my soulit burned itself in upon my shuddering reason oh for a voice to speakoh horroroh any horror but this with a shriek i rushed from the margin and buried my face in my handsweeping bitterly the heat rapidly increased and once again i looked up shuddering as with a fit of the ague there had been a second change in the celland now the change was obviously in the form as before it was in vain that i at first endeavored to appreciate or understand what was taking place but not long was i left in doubt the inquisitorial vengeance had been hurried by my twofold escape and there was to be no more dallying with the king of terrors the room had been square i saw that two of its iron angles were now acutetwo consequently obtuse the fearful difference quickly increased with a low rumbling or moaning sound in an instant the apartment had shifted its form into that of a lozenge but the alteration stopped not herei neither hoped nor desired it to stop i could have clasped the red walls to my bosom as a garment of eternal peace death i said any death but that of the pit fool might i not have known that into the pit it was the object of the burning iron to urge me could i resist its glow or if even that could i withstand its pressure and now flatter and flatter grew the lozenge with a rapidity that left me no time for contemplation its centre and of course its greatest width came just over the yawning gulf i shrank backbut the closing walls pressed me resistlessly onward at length for my seared and writhing body there was no longer an inch of foothold on the firm floor of the prison i struggled no more but the agony of my soul found vent in one loud long and final scream of despair i felt that i tottered upon the brinki averted my eyes there was a discordant hum of human voices there was a loud blast as of many trumpets there was a harsh grating as of a thousand thunders the fiery walls rushed back an outstretched arm caught my own as i fell fainting into the abyss it was that of general lasalle the french army had entered toledo the inquisition was in the hands of its enemies the pit the pendulum and perfection by edward d hoch i have written elsewhere that my lifetime commitment to mystery fiction can be traced to an early exposure to the novels of ellery queen but my love for the short story dates from my first reading of edgar allan poe it was in my school textbook that i discovered the pit and the pendulum a nearperfect example of the horror and suspense that marked so much of poes work from the very beginning with its description of the inquisition chamber the reader is caught up in the narrators terrible plight we are to be his companion in the tortures that follow and it seems that death will be his only release he drifts between a conscious and dreamlike state facing first the fate of execution by a swinging razorsharp pendulum a method poe had no doubt seen described in a contemporary history of the inquisition as his narrator describes the slow descent of the pendulum and the scurrying of rats about his chamber there seems to be no chance of survival when he miraculously escapes death by the pendulum he is immediately faced with an even graver danger the redhot walls of his cell begin to close in upon him forcing him ever closer to the gaping abyss at the center of the room the suspense builds to a terrifying pitch that holds the reader until the storys final paragraph poes ending may be a bit farfetched but it has a historical basis to the reader it is supremely satisfying the perfect ending to a half hour of nailbiting suspense for anyone who wishes to write short stories there is no better teacher than edgar allan poe and there is no better example of suspenseful perfection in a short story than the pit and the pendulum edward d hoch was a past president of mystery writers of america and winner of its edgar award for best short story in he received mwas grand master award he was a guest of honor at bouchercon twotime winner of its anthony award and recipient of its lifetime achievement award the private eye writers of america honored him with its life achievement award as well author of some published stories he appeared in every issue of ellery queens mystery magazine in the past thirtyfive years the pit and the pendulum at the palace by peter robinson if i hadnt become a crime writer i think it most likely i would have written horror or science fiction i certainly did when i was a teenager then after many years of poetry i turned to crime while poes stories of ratiocination featuring auguste dupin never really thrilled me even back then i just couldnt believe in that ourangoutang his tales of mystery and imagination enthralled me from the start and i came to them first through the films of roger corman many of them scripted by the excellent richard matheson in england in the early s there were three ratings for films u a and x the first was general admission for an a film you had to be accompanied by an adult and you had to be over sixteen to see an x film x ratings werent reserved for films about sex and violence but were applied to just about every exciting horror and science fiction film that came out in that golden agefrom the blob to psycho for a twelveyearold fan the pickings were pretty slim you might get something decent with an a rating which meant that you had to hang around outside the cinema and ask some adult stranger to take you insomething im sure would be inconceivable in this day and age but we did it and survived luckily though there was one local fleapit incredibly named the palace where the old woman in the ticket booth didnt really care how old you were at twelve or thirteen i was tall enough that i could pass for sixteen there or so i thought at any rate she took my money and let me in without a second glance i can still recall the sense of excitement and anticipation i felt before the lush red velvet curtains parted i was doing something i shouldnt be doing seeing something forbiddenat least to kids my ageand i had no idea what wonders to expect my previous horror and science fiction experiences had included a for andromeda and quatermass and the pit on television and the latter had scared the living daylights out of me now here i was alone in a dark cinema waiting for the ultimate experience in terrorin living color on a large screenthe pit and the pendulum no wonder my stomach clenched as i lit a woodbine and slunk down in my seat when the curtains opened the swirl of colors was much like that of light shows i was to see later in the decade but at the time combined with a quirky contemporary score it was just enough to set the juices flowing this was going to be weird then came the impossible castle on its hill surrounded by a ring of mist and the coach driver who would only take his passenger so far quickly developing a taste for these horror films i also devoured everything hammer produced around the same time and got used to seeing such openings over and over again but it wasnt so much the castle and the cobwebs and the dungeon and the strange colors and the distortion used in flashbacks and dream sequences that made me squirm in my seat poe i discovered through corman was a master of morbid psychology master of the language of grief and loss and how they could lead a man usually vincent price to madness beyond the grave the pit and the pendulum at the palace of course in retrospect its hard to say how much i understood at the time probably the whole element of adultery that underpins the tale was lost on me though the hints of illicit sex and debauchery certainly werentheaving cleavage was as much a feature of the corman films as it was with hammerand the way elizabeth expresses her fascination with the torture chamber rushing around feverishly touching the implements with a kind of sexual longing was both disturbing and exciting i knew about the spanish inquisition though this was several years before it was immortalized by monty python and its torturesthe iron maiden the rack and the rest but perhaps the adult relationships were somewhat lost on me certainly there are moments of pure shockthe opening of the stone tomb to reveal the skeleton of a woman who had obviously died trying to claw her way out the reappearance of elizabeth in the flesh the revelation of the ultimate torture device itself and the heavy swishing sound it made as it got faster and faster apparently corman cut every other frame to get this effect but mostly it was atmosphere the unspoken the hint of terrible mysteries beyond the grave a world where people are condemned to relive terrible acts or suffer the ancient curses of their ancestors and the realm of the opium dreamnightmare that corman fashioned from poes story and of course you couldnt go home after seeing any of these films without being absolutely terrified of being buried alive no doubt i slept uneasily that night but the next day i went out and bought tales of mystery and imagination in no time i was immersed in the telltale heart berenice the teeth my god the teeth and the cask of amontillado and probably produced my own pale imitations in the notebooks i filled with drivel in those days it also didnt take me long to discover that cormans movie had little to do with the actual plot of poes story though he excelled in recreating the atmosphere of poes work in later life i studied poe along with melville when i was doing my phd in english literature and his work has since given me hours of pleasure and many sleepless nights and i went back to the palace i went to see the house of usher the masque of the red death the tomb of ligeia tales of terror and the premature burial i enjoyed them all though i dont think any had quite the same impact as the first one i sawthe pit and the pendulum peter robinson was born in england and now splits his time between toronto and richmond north yorkshire he is the author of the inspector banks series of novels the latest of which is friend of the devil and many short stories one of which missing in action won the mwa edgar award in in his spare time he enjoys mesmerism building model torture chambers and extracting teeth from dead bodies the masque of the red death the red death had long devastated the country no pestilence had ever been so fatal or so hideous blood was its avatar and its sealthe redness and the horror of blood there were sharp pains and sudden dizziness and then profuse bleeding at the pores with dissolution the scarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the face of the victim were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy of his fellowmen and the whole seizure progress and termination of the disease were the incidents of half an hour but the prince prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious when his dominions were half depopulated he summoned to his presence a thousand hale and lighthearted friends from among the knights and dames of his court and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his castellated abbeys this was an extensive and magnificent structure the creation of the princes own eccentric yet august taste a strong and lofty wall girdled it in this wall had gates of iron the courtiers having entered brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts they resolved to leave means neither of ingress nor egress to the sudden impulses of despair or of frenzy from within the abbey was amply provisioned with such precautions the courtiers might bid defiance to contagion the external world could take care of itself in the meantime it was folly to grieve or to think the prince had provided all the appliances of pleasure there were buffoons there were improvisatori there were balletdancers there were musicians there was beauty there was wine all these and security were within without was the red death it was toward the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion and while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad that the prince prospero entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most unusual magnificence it was a voluptuous scene that masquerade but first let me tell of the rooms in which it was held there were sevenan imperial suite in many palaces however such suites form a long and straight vista while the folding doors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand so that the view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded here the case was very different as might have been expected from the dukes love of the bizarre the apartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision embraced but little more than one at a time there was a sharp turn at every twenty or thirty yards and at each turn a novel effect to the right and left in the middle of each wall a tall and narrow gothic window looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued the windings of the suite these windows were of stained glass whose color varied in accordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations of the chamber into which it opened that at the eastern extremity was hung for example in blueand vividly blue were its windows the second chamber was purple in its ornaments and tapestries and here the panes were purple the third was green throughout and so were the casements the fourth was furnished and lighted with orangethe fifth with whitethe sixth with violet the seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down the walls falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material and hue but in this chamber only the color of the windows failed to correspond with the decorations the panes here were scarleta deep blood color now in no one of the seven apartments was there any lamp or candelabrum amid the profusion of golden ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or depended from the roof there was no light of any kind emanating from lamp or candle within the suite of chambers but in the corridors that followed the suite there stood opposite to each window a heavy tripod bearing a brazier of fire that protected its rays through the tinted glass and so glaringly illumined the room and thus were produced a multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances but in the western or black chamber the effect of the firelight that streamed upon the dark hangings through the bloodtinted panes was ghastly in the extreme and produced so wild a look upon the countenances of those who entered that there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all it was in this apartment also that there stood against the western wall a gigantic clock of ebony its pendulum swung to and fro with a dull heavy monotonous clang and when the minutehand made the circuit of the face and the hour was to be stricken there came from the brazen lungs of the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly musical but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that at each lapse of an hour the musicians of the orchestra were constrained to pause momentarily in their performance to hearken to the sound and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions and there was a brief disconcert of the whole gay company and while the chimes of the clock yet rang it was observed that the giddiest grew pale and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows as if in confused revery or meditation but when the echoes had fully ceased a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly the musicians looked at each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and folly and made whispering vows each to the other that the next chiming of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion and then after the lapse of sixty minutes which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of the time that flies there came yet another chiming of the clock and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and meditation as before but in spite of these things it was a gay and magnificent revel the tastes of the duke were peculiar he had a fine eye for colors and effects he disregarded the decora of mere fashion his plans were bold and fiery and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre there are some who would have thought him mad his followers felt that he was not it was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure that he was not he had directed in great part the moveable embellishments of the seven chambers upon occasion of this great fête and it was his own guiding taste which had given character to the masqueraders be sure they were grotesque there were much glare and glitter and piquancy and phantasmmuch of what has been since seen in hernani there were arabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments there were delirious fancies such as the madman fashions there were much of the beautiful much of the wanton much of the bizarre something of the terrible and not a little of that which might have excited disgust to and fro in the seven chambers there stalked in fact a multitude of dreams and thesethe dreamswrithed in and about taking hue from the rooms and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the echo of their steps and anon there strikes the ebony clock which stands in the hall of the velvet and then for a moment all is still and all is silent save the voice of the clock the dreams are stifffrozen as they stand but the echoes of the chime die awaythey have endured but an instantand a light halfsubdued laughter floats after them as they depart and now again the music swells and the dreams live and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever taking hue from the manytinted windows through which stream the rays from the tripods but to the chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven there are now none of the maskers who venture for the night is waning away and there flows a ruddier light through the bloodcolored panes and the blackness of the sable drapery appals and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet there comes from the near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any which reaches their ears who indulge in the more remote gaieties of the other apartments but these other apartments were densely crowded and in them beat feverishly the heart of life and the revel went whirlingly on until at length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock and then the music ceased as i have told and the evolutions of the waltzers were quieted and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before but now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell of the clock and thus it happened perhaps that more of thought crept with more of time into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who revelled and thus too it happened perhaps that before the last echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence there were many individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of no single individual before and the rumor of this new presence having spread itself whisperingly around there arose at length from the whole company a buzz or murmur expressive of disapprobation and surprisethen finally of terror of horror and of disgust in an assembly of phantasms such as i have painted it may well be supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation in truth the masquerade license of the night was nearly unlimited but the figure in question had outheroded herod and gone beyond the bounds of even the princes indefinite decorum there are chords in the hearts of the most reckless which cannot be touched without emotion even with the utterly lost to whom life and death are equally jests there are matters of which no jest can be made the whole company indeed seemed now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the stranger neither wit nor propriety existed the figure was tall and gaunt and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of the grave the mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the cheat and yet all this might have been endured if not approved by the mad revellers around but the mummer had gone so far as to assume the type of the red death his vesture was dabbled in bloodand his broad brow with all the features of the face was besprinkled with the scarlet horror when the eyes of prince prospero fell upon this spectral image which with a slow and solemn movement as if more fully to sustain its rôle stalked to and fro among the waltzers he was seen to be convulsed in the first moment with a strong shudder either of terror or distaste but in the next his brow reddened with rage who dareshe demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near himwho dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery seize him and unmask himthat we may know whom we have to hang at sunrise from the battlements it was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the prince prospero as he uttered these words they rang throughout the seven rooms loudly and clearlyfor the prince was a bold and robust man and the music had become hushed at the waving of his hand it was in the blue room where stood the prince with a group of pale courtiers by his side at first as he spoke there was a slight rushing movement of this group in the direction of the intruder who at the moment was also near at hand and now with deliberate and stately step made closer approach to the speaker but from a certain nameless awe with which the mad assumptions of the murmur had inspired the whole party there were found none who put forth hand to seize him so that unimpeded he passed within a yard of the princes person and while the vast assembly as if with one impulse shrank from the centres of the rooms to the walls he made his way uninterruptedly but with the same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from the first through the blue chamber to the purplethrough the purple to the greenthrough the green to the orangethrough this again to the whiteand even thence to the violet ere a decided movement had been made to arrest him it was then however that the prince prospero maddening with rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice rushed hurriedly through the six chambers while none followed him on account of a deadly terror that had seized upon all he bore aloft a drawn dagger and had approached in rapid impetuosity to within three or four feet of the retreating figure when the latter having attained the extremity of the velvet apartment turned suddenly and confronted his pursuer there was a sharp cryand the dagger dropped gleaming upon the sable carpet upon which instantly afterward fell prostrate in death the prince prospero then summoning the wild courage of despair a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into the black apartment and seizing the mummer whose tall figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow of the ebony clock gasped in unutterable horror at finding the grave cerements and corpselike mask which they handled with so violent a rudeness untenanted by any tangible form and now was acknowledged the presence of the red death he had come like a thief in the night and one by one dropped the revellers in the bloodbedewed halls of their revel and died each in the despairing posture of his fall and the life of the ebony clock went out with that of the last of the gay and the flames of the tripods expired and darkness and decay and the red death held illimitable dominion over all edgar allan poe mark twain and me by s j rozan when i was twelve i had pneumonia complicated by a bad case of strep i wasnt hospitalized but i was confined to my room to keep me from causing havoc among my sibs my mother heroically ferried chicken soup and ice cream from downstairs other than that i was pretty much on my ownfor two weeks luckily we had a complete set of mark twain and a complete set of edgar allan poe my mom deposited them in my room in a couple of tall piles and they made me what i am today from twain i learned about character and narrative structure and humor poe didnt have a lot of that but from poe i learned about language the beauty of poes language still shinesi defy anyone to find a story more perfect in rhythm cadence and sound sentence by sentence than the telltale heart twains language of course is also gorgeous but more subtle i was twelve i didnt want subtle i wanted my socks knocked off and i also found in poe something less tangible but which resonated with me and still does inevitability and the laughable nature of human intention this thread runs all through poes workfor example in poems like conqueror wormincluding the abovementioned telltale heart its not the stillbeating heart of the dead man that gives the killer away after all its his own fearful guilty heart that does but the example i remember most vividly is the masque of the red death in the middle of a plague an array of wealthy citizens lock themselves away and throw a party a big masked ball the danger outside doesnt matter they congratulate one another on how cleverly theyve isolated themselves from it except of course they havent theyve made it worse one of the guests dressed as the red death everyone laughs and applauds hes soooo amusing really is the red death and far from being locked away from him theyre locked in with him he dances with them all and they all die this is the best laid plans gang aft agley this is man proposes god disposes it aint news but it was to me at twelve or no it wasnt it was better than that it was the first time someone had said out loud as it were something id suspected but as a member of a rational hardworking optimistic family and society not been allowed to think its what much much later in a review of the movie chinatown i saw referred to as the disastrous consequences of good intentions was i a bleak twelveyearold sure i was but i had always been like that what reading poe for two solid weeks gave me was the relief of knowing i wasnt alone i dont think ive ever felt closer to a writer than i did to poe those two weeks but i was luckier than poe i had mark twain right beside us showing at least one of us how to laugh despite or at it all bless both their beating hearts s j rozan grew up in the bronx and as a child visited the poe cottage many times where she looked for but never found the telltale heart the author of ten novels and dozens of

what song the syrens sang or what name achilles assumed when he hid himself among women although puzzling questions are not beyond all conjecture sir thomas browne the mental features discoursed of as the analytical are in themselves but little susceptible of analysis we appreciate them only in their effects we know of them among other things that they are always to their possessor when inordinately possessed a source of the liveliest enjoyment as the strong man exults in his physical ability delighting in such exercises as call his muscles into action so glories the analyst in that moral activity which disentangles he derives pleasure from even the most trivial occupations bringing his talent into play he is fond of enigmas of conundrums of hieroglyphics exhibiting in his solutions of each a degree of acumen which appears to the ordinary apprehension praeternatural his results brought about by the very soul and essence of method have in truth the whole air of intuition the faculty of resolution is possibly much invigorated by mathematical study and especially by that highest branch of it which unjustly and merely on account of its retrograde operations has been called as if par excellence analysis yet to calculate is not in itself to analyse a chessplayer for example does the one without effort at the other it follows that the game of chess in its effects upon mental character is greatly misunderstood i am not now writing a treatise but simply prefacing a somewhat peculiar narrative by observations very much at random i will therefore take occasion to assert that the higher powers of the reflective intellect are more decidedly and more usefully tasked by the unostentatious game of draughts than by all the elaborate frivolity of chess in this latter where the pieces have different and bizarre motions with various and variable values what is only complex is mistaken a not unusual error for what is profound the attention is here called powerfully into play if it flag for an instant an oversight is committed resulting in injury or defeat the possible moves being not only manifold but involute the chances of such oversights are multiplied and in nine cases out of ten it is the more concentrative rather than the more acute player who conquers in draughts on the contrary where the moves are unique and have but little variation the probabilities of inadvertence are diminished and the mere attention being left comparatively unemployed what advantages are obtained by either party are obtained by superior acumen to be less abstract let us suppose a game of draughts where the pieces are reduced to four kings and where of course no oversight is to be expected it is obvious that here the victory can be decided the players being at all equal only by some recherché movement the result of some strong exertion of the intellect deprived of ordinary resources the analyst throws himself into the spirit of his opponent identifies himself therewith and not unfrequently sees thus at a glance the sole methods sometimes indeed absurdly simple ones by which he may seduce into error or hurry into miscalculation whist has long been noted for its influence upon what is termed the calculating power and men of the highest order of intellect have been known to take an apparently unaccountable delight in it while eschewing chess as frivolous beyond doubt there is nothing of a similar nature so greatly tasking the faculty of analysis the best chessplayer in christendom may be little more than the best player of chess but proficiency in whist implies capacity for success in all these more important undertakings where mind struggles with mind when i say proficiency i mean that perfection in the game which includes a comprehension of all the sources whence legitimate advantage may be derived these are not only manifold but multiform and lie frequently among recesses of thought altogether inaccessible to the ordinary understanding to observe attentively is to remember distinctly and so far the concentrative chessplayer will do very well at whist while the rules of hoyle themselves based upon the mere mechanism of the game are sufficiently and generally comprehensible thus to have a retentive memory and proceed by the book are points commonly regarded as the sum total of good playing but it is in matters beyond the limits of mere rule that the skill of the analyst is evinced he makes in silence a host of observations and inferences so perhaps do his companions and the difference in the extent of the information obtained lies not so much in the validity of the inference as in the quality of the observation the necessary knowledge is that of what to observe our player confines himself not at all nor because the game is the object does he reject deductions from things external to the game he examines the countenance of his partner comparing it carefully with that of each of his opponents he considers the mode of assorting the cards in each hand often counting trump by trump and honor by honor through the glances bestowed by their holders upon each he notes every variation of face as the play progresses gathering a fund of thought from the differences in the expression of certainty of surprise of triumph or chagrin from the manner of gathering up a trick he judges whether the person taking it can make another in the suit he recognizes what is played through feint by the manner with which it is thrown upon the table a casual or inadvertent word the accidental dropping or turning of a card with the accompanying anxiety or carelessness in regard to its concealment the counting of the tricks with the order of their arrangement embarrassment hesitation eagerness or trepidationall afford to his apparently intuitive perception indications of the true state of affairs the first two or three rounds having been played he is in full possession of the contents of each hand and thenceforward puts down his cards with as absolute a precision of purpose as if the rest of the party had turned outward the faces of their own the analytical power should not be confounded with simple ingenuity for while the analyst is necessarily ingenious the ingenious man is often remarkably incapable of analysis the constructive or combining power by which ingenuity is usually manifested and to which the phrenologists i believe erroneously have assigned a separate organ supposing it a primitive faculty has been so frequently seen in those whose intellect bordered otherwise upon idiocy as to have attracted general observation among writers on morals between ingenuity and the analytic ability there exists a difference far greater indeed than that between the fancy and the imagination but of a character very strictly analogous it will be found in fact that the ingenious are always fanciful and the truly imaginative never otherwise than analytic the narrative which follows will appear to the reader somewhat in the light of a commentary upon the propositions just advanced residing in paris during the spring and part of the summer of i there became acquainted with a monsieur c auguste dupin this young gentleman was of an excellent indeed of an illustrious family but by a variety of untoward events had been reduced to such poverty that the energy of his character succumbed beneath it and he ceased to bestir himself in the world or to care for the retrieval of his fortunes by courtesy of his creditors there still remained in his possession a small remnant of his patrimony and upon the income arising from this he managed by means of a rigorous economy to procure the necessaries of life without troubling himself about its superfluities books indeed were his sole luxuries and in paris these are easily obtained our first meeting was at an obscure library in the rue montmartre where the accident of our both being in search of the same very rare and very remarkable volume brought us into closer communion we saw each other again and again i was deeply interested in the little family history which he detailed to me with all that candor which a frenchman indulges whenever mere self is his theme i was astonished too at the vast extent of his reading and above all i felt my soul enkindled within me by the wild fervor and the vivid freshness of his imagination seeking in paris the objects i then sought i felt that the society of such a man would be to me a treasure beyond price and this feeling i frankly confided to him it was at length arranged that we should live together during my stay in the city and as my worldly circumstances were somewhat less embarrassed than his own i was permitted to be at the expense of renting and furnishing in a style which suited the rather fantastic gloom of our common temper a timeeaten and grotesque mansion long deserted through superstitions into which we did not inquire and tottering to its fall in a retired and desolate portion of the faubourg st germain had the routine of our life at this place been known to the world we should have been regarded as madmenalthough perhaps as madmen of a harmless nature our seclusion was perfect we admitted no visitors indeed the locality of our retirement had been carefully kept a secret from my own former associates and it had been many years since dupin had ceased to know or be known in paris we existed within ourselves alone it was a freak of fancy in my friend for what else shall i call it to be enamored of the night for her own sake and into this bizarrerie as into all his others i quietly fell giving myself up to his wild whims with a perfect abandon the sable divinity would not herself dwell with us always but we could counterfeit her presence at the first dawn of the morning we closed all the massy shutters of our old building lighting a couple of tapers which strongly perfumed threw out only the ghastliest and feeblest of rays by the aid of these we then busied our souls in dreamsreading writing or conversing until warned by the clock of the advent of the true darkness then we sallied forth into the streets arm in arm continuing the topics of the day or roaming far and wide until a late hour seeking amid the wild lights and shadows of the populous city that infinity of mental excitement which quiet observation can afford at such times i could not help remarking and admiring although from his rich ideality i had been prepared to expect it a peculiar analytic ability in dupin he seemed too to take an eager delight in its exerciseif not exactly in its displayand did not hesitate to confess the pleasure thus derived he boasted to me with a low chuckling laugh that most men in respect to himself wore windows in their bosoms and was wont to follow up such assertions by direct and very startling proofs of his intimate knowledge of my own his manner at these moments was frigid and abstract his eyes were vacant in expression while his voice usually a rich tenor rose into a treble which would have sounded petulant but for the deliberateness and entire distinctness of the enunciation observing him in these moods i often dwelt meditatively upon the old philosophy of the bipart soul and amused myself with the fancy of a double dupinthe creative and the resolvent let it not be supposed from what i have just said that i am detailing any mystery or penning any romance what i have described in the frenchman was merely the result of an excited or perhaps of a diseased intelligence but of the character of his remarks at the periods in question an example will best convey the idea we were strolling one night down a long dirty street in the vicinity of the palais royal being both apparently occupied with thought neither of us had spoken a syllable for fifteen minutes at least all at once dupin broke forth with these words he is a very little fellow thats true and would do better for the théâtre des variétés there can be no doubt of that i replied unwittingly and not at first observing so much had i been absorbed in reflection the extraordinary manner in which the speaker had chimed in with my meditations in an instant afterward i recollected myself and my astonishment was profound dupin said i gravely this is beyond my comprehension i do not hesitate to say that i am amazed and can scarcely credit my senses how was it possible you should know i was thinking of here i paused to ascertain beyond a doubt whether he really knew of whom i thought of chantilly said he why do you pause you were remarking to yourself that his diminutive figure unfitted him for tragedy this was precisely what had formed the subject of my reflections chantilly was a quondam cobbler of the rue st denis who becoming stagemad had attempted the rôle of xerxes in crébillons tragedy so called and been notoriously pasquinaded for his pains tell me for heavens sake i exclaimed the methodif method there isby which you have been enabled to fathom my soul in this matter in fact i was even more startled than i would have been willing to express it was the fruiterer replied my friend who brought you to the conclusion that the mender of soles was not of sufficient height for xerxes et id genus omne the fruitereryou astonish mei know no fruiterer whomsoever the man who ran up against you as we entered the streetit may have been fifteen minutes ago i now remembered that in fact a fruiterer carrying upon his head a large basket of apples had nearly thrown me down by accident as we passed from the rue c into the thoroughfare where we stood but what this had to do with chantilly i could not possibly understand there was not a particle of charlatânerie about dupin i will explain he said and that you may comprehend all clearly we will first retrace the course of your meditations from the moment in which i spoke to you until that of the rencontre with the fruiterer in question the larger links of the chain run thus chantilly orion dr nichols epicurus stereotomy the street stones the fruiterer there are few persons who have not at some period of their lives amused themselves in retracing the steps by which particular conclusions of their own minds have been attained the occupation is often full of interest and he who attempts it for the first time is astonished by the apparently illimitable distance and incoherence between the startingpoint and the goal what then must have been my amazement when i heard the frenchman speak what he had just spoken and when i could not help acknowledging that he had spoken the truth he continued we had been talking of horses if i remember aright just before leaving the rue c this was the last subject we discussed as we crossed into this street a fruiterer with a large basket upon his head brushing quickly past us thrust you upon a pile of pavingstones collected at a spot where the causeway is undergoing repair you stepped upon one of the loose fragments slipped slightly strained your ankle appeared vexed or sulky muttered a few words turned to look at the pile and then proceeded in silence i was not particularly attentive to what you did but observation has become with me of late a species of necessity you kept your eyes upon the groundglancing with a petulant expression at the holes and ruts in the pavement so that i saw you were still thinking of the stones until we reached the little alley called lamartine which has been paved by way of experiment with the overlapping and riveted blocks here your countenance brightened up and perceiving your lips move i could not doubt that you murmured the word stereotomy a term very affectedly applied to this species of pavement i knew that you could not say to yourself stereotomy without being brought to think of atomies and thus of the theories of epicurus and since when we discussed this subject not very long ago i mentioned to you how singularly yet with how little notice the vague guesses of that noble greek had met with confirmation in the late nebular cosmogony i felt that you could not avoid casting your eyes upward to the great nebula in orion and i certainly expected that you would do so you did look up and i was now assured that i had correctly followed your steps but in that bitter tirade upon chantilly which appeared in yesterdays musée the satirist making some disgraceful allusions to the cobblers change of name upon assuming the buskin quoted a latin line about which we have often conversed i mean the line perdidit antiquum litera prima sonum i had told you that this was in reference to orion formerly written urion and from certain pungencies connected with this explanation i was aware that you could not have forgotten it it was clear therefore that you would not fail to combine the two ideas of orion and chantilly that you did combine them i saw by the character of the smile which passed over your lips you thought of the poor cobblers immolation so far you had been stooping in your gait but now i saw you draw yourself up to your full height i was then sure that you reflected upon the diminutive figure of chantilly at this point i interrupted your meditations to remark that as in fact he was a very little fellowthat chantilly he would do better at the théâtre des variétés not long after this we were looking over an evening edition of the gazette des tribunaux when the following paragraphs arrested our attention extraordinarymurdersthis morning about three oclock the inhabitants of the quartier st roch were roused from sleep by a succession of terrific shrieks issuing apparently from the fourth story of a house in the rue morgue known to be in the sole occupancy of one madame lespanaye and her daughter mademoiselle camille lespanaye after some delay occasioned by a fruitless attempt to procure admission in the usual manner the gateway was broken in with a crowbar and eight or ten of the neighbors entered accompanied by two gendarmes by this time the cries had ceased but as the party rushed up the first flight of stairs two or more rough voices in angry contention were distinguished and seemed to proceed from the upper part of the house as the second landing was reached these sounds also had ceased and every thing remained perfectly quiet the party spread themselves and hurried from room to room upon arriving at a large back chamber in the fourth story the door of which being found locked with the key inside was forced open a spectacle presented itself which struck every one present not less with horror than with astonishment the apartment was in the wildest disorderthe furniture broken and thrown about in all directions there was only one bedstead and from this the bed had been removed and thrown into the middle of the floor on a chair lay a razor besmeared with blood on the hearth were two or three long and thick tresses of gray human hair also dabbled with blood and seeming to have been pulled out by the roots upon the floor were found four napoleons an earring of topaz three large silver spoons three smaller of métal dalger and two bags containing nearly four thousand francs in gold the drawers of a bureau which stood in one corner were open and had been apparently rifled although many articles still remained in them a small iron safe was discovered under the bed not under the bedstead it was open with the key still in the door it had no contents beyond a few old letters and other papers of little consequence of madame lespanaye no traces were here seen but an unusual quantity of soot being observed in the fireplace a search was made in the chimney and horrible to relate the corpse of the daughter head downward was dragged therefrom it having been thus forced up the narrow aperture for a considerable distance the body was quite warm upon examining it many excoriations were perceived no doubt occasioned by the violence with which it had been thrust up and disengaged upon the face were many severe scratches and upon the throat dark bruises and deep indentations of finger nails as if the deceased had been throttled to death after a thorough investigation of every portion of the house without farther discovery the party made its way into a small paved yard in the rear of the building where lay the corpse of the old lady with her throat so entirely cut that upon an attempt to raise her the head fell off the body as well as the head was fearfully mutilatedthe former so much so as scarcely to retain any semblance of humanity to this horrible mystery there is not as yet we believe the slightest clue the next days paper had these additional particulars the tragedy in the rue morguemany individuals have been examined in relation to this most extraordinary and frightful affair the word affaire has not yet in france that levity of import which it conveys with us but nothing whatever has transpired to throw light upon it we give below all the material testimony elicited pauline dubourg laundress deposes that she has known both the deceased for three years having washed for them during that period the old lady and

into them herself refusing to let any portion the old lady was childish witness had seen the daughter some five or six times during the six years the two lived an exceedingly retired lifewere reputed to have money had heard it said among the neighbors that madame l told fortunesdid not believe it had never seen any person enter the door except the old lady and her daughter a porter once or twice and a physician some eight or ten times many other persons neighbors gave evidence to the same effect no one was spoken of as frequenting the house it was not known whether there were any living

admittance forced it open at length with a bayonetnot with a crowbar had but little difficulty in getting it open on account of its being a double or folding gate and bolted neither at bottom nor top

entrance they reclosed the door to keep out the crowd which collected very fast notwithstanding the lateness of the hour the shrill voice this witness thinks was that of an italian was certain it was

corroborates the general testimony is an italian never conversed with a native of russia several witnesses recalled here testified that the chimneys of all the rooms on the fourth story were too narrow to admit the passage of a human being by sweeps were meant cylindrical sweepingbrushes such as are employed by those who clean chimneys these brushes were passed up and down every flue in the house there is no back passage by which any one could have descended while the party proceeded upstairs the body of mademoiselle lespanaye was so firmly wedged in the chimney that it could not be got down until four or five of the party united their strength paul dumas physician deposes that he was called to view the bodies about daybreak they were both then lying on the sacking of the bedstead in the chamber where mademoiselle l was found the corpse of the young lady was much bruised and excoriated the fact that it had been thrust up the chimney would sufficiently account for these appearances the throat was greatly chafed there were several deep scratches just below the chin together with a series of livid spots which were evidently the impression of fingers the face was fearfully discolored and the eyeballs protruded the tongue had been partially bitten through a large bruise was discovered upon the pit of the stomach produced apparently by the pressure of a knee in the opinion of m dumas mademoiselle lespanaye had been throttled to death by some person or persons unknown the corpse of the mother was horribly mutilated all the bones of the right leg and arm were more or less shattered the left tibia much splintered as well as all the ribs of the left side whole body dreadfully bruised and discolored it was not possible to say how the injuries had been inflicted a heavy club of wood or a broad bar of irona chairany large heavy and obtuse weapon would have produced such results if wielded by the hands of a very powerful man no woman could have inflicted the blows with any weapon the head of the deceased when seen by witness was entirely separated from the body and was also greatly shattered the throat had evidently been cut with some very sharp instrumentprobably with a razor alexandre etienne surgeon was called with m dumas to view the bodies corroborated the testimony and the opinions of m dumas nothing farther of importance was elicited although several other persons were examined a murder so mysterious and so perplexing in all its particulars was never before committed in paris if indeed a murder has been committed at all the police are entirely at fault an unusual occurrence in affairs of this nature there is not however the shadow of a clue apparent the evening edition of the paper stated that the greatest excitement still continued in the quartier st rochthat the premises in question had been carefully researched and fresh examinations of witnesses instituted but all to no purpose a postscript however mentioned that adolphe le bon had been arrested and imprisonedalthough nothing appeared to criminate him beyond the facts already detailed dupin seemed singularly interested in the progress of this affairat least so i judged from his manner for he made no comments it was only after the announcement that le bon had been imprisoned that he asked me my opinion respecting the murders i could merely agree with all paris in considering them an insoluble mystery i saw no means by which it would be possible to trace the murderer we must not judge of the means said dupin by this shell of an examination the parisian police so much extolled for acumen are cunning but no more there is no method in their proceedings beyond the method of the moment they make a vast parade of measures but not unfrequently these are so illadapted to the objects proposed as to put us in mind of monsieur jourdains calling for his robedechambrepour mieux entendre la musique the results attained by them are not unfrequently surprising but for the most part are brought about by simple diligence and activity when these qualities are unavailing their schemes fail vidocq for example was a good guesser and a persevering man but without educated thought he erred continually by the very intensity of his investigations he impaired his vision by holding the object too close he might see perhaps one or two points with unusual clearness but in so doing he necessarily lost sight of the matter as a whole thus there is such a thing as being too profound truth is not always in a well in fact as regards the more important knowledge i do believe that she is invariably superficial the depth lies in the valleys where we seek her and not upon the mountaintops where she is found the modes and sources of this kind of error are well typified in the contemplation of the heavenly bodies to look at a star by glancesto view it in a sidelong way by turning toward it the exterior portions of the retina more susceptible of feeble impressions of light than the interior is to behold the star distinctlyis to have the best appreciation of its lustrea lustre which grows dim just in proportion as we turn our vision fully upon it a greater number of rays actually fall upon the eye in the latter case but in the former there is the more refined capacity for comprehension by undue profundity we perplex and enfeeble thought and it is possible to make even venus herself vanish from the firmament by a scrutiny too sustained too concentrated or too direct as for these murders let us enter into some examinations for ourselves before we make up an opinion respecting them an inquiry will afford us amusement i thought this an odd term so applied but said nothing and besides le bon once rendered me a service for which i am not ungrateful we will go and see the premises with our own eyes i know g the prefect of police and shall have no difficulty in obtaining the necessary permission the permission was obtained and we proceeded at once to the rue morgue this is one of those miserable thoroughfares which intervene between the rue richelieu and the rue st roch it was late in the afternoon when we reached it as this quarter is at a great distance from that in which we resided the house was readily found for there were still many persons gazing up at the closed shutters with an objectless curiosity from the opposite side of the way it was an ordinary parisian house with a gateway on one side of which was a glazed watchbox with a sliding panel in the window indicating a loge de concierge before going in we walked up the street turned down an alley and then again turning passed in the rear of the buildingdupin meanwhile examining the whole neighborhood as well as the house with a minuteness of attention for which i could see no possible object retracing our steps we came again to the front of the dwelling rang and having shown our credentials were admitted by the agents in charge we went upstairsinto the chamber where the body of mademoiselle lespanaye had been found and where both the deceased still lay the disorders of the room had as usual been suffered to exist i saw nothing beyond what had been stated in the gazette des tribunaux dupin scrutinized every thingnot excepting the bodies of the victims we then went into the other rooms and into the yard a gendarme accompanying us throughout the examination occupied us until dark when we took our departure on our way home my companion stepped in for a moment at the office of one of the daily papers i have said that the whims of my friend were manifold and that je les ménagaisfor this phrase there is no english equivalent it was his humor now to decline all conversation on the subject of the murder until about noon the next day he then asked me suddenly if i had observed any thing peculiar at the scene of the atrocity there was something in his manner of emphasizing the word peculiar which caused me to shudder without knowing why no nothing peculiar i said nothing more at least than we both saw stated in the paper the gazette he replied has not entered i fear into the unusual horror of the thing but dismiss the idle opinions of this print it appears to me that this mystery is considered insoluble for the very reason which should cause it to be regarded as easy of solutioni mean for the outré character of its features the police are confounded by the seeming absence of motivenot for the murder itselfbut for the atrocity of the murder they are puzzled too by the seeming impossibility of reconciling the voices heard in contention with the facts that no one was discovered upstairs but the assassinated mademoiselle lespanaye and that there were no means of egress without the notice of the party ascending the wild disorder of the room the corpse thrust with the head downward up the chimney the frightful mutilation of the body of the old lady these considerations with those just mentioned and others which i need not mention have sufficed to paralyze the powers by putting completely at fault the boasted acumen of the government agents they have fallen into the gross but common error of confounding the unusual with the abstruse but it is by these deviations from the plane of the ordinary that reason feels its way if at all in its search for the true in investigations such as we are now pursuing it should not be so much asked what has occurred as what has occurred that has never occurred before in fact the facility with which i shall arrive or have arrived at the solution of this mystery is in the direct ratio of its apparent insolubility in the eyes of the police i stared at the speaker in mute astonishment i am now awaiting continued he looking toward the door of our apartmenti am now awaiting a person who although perhaps not the perpetrator of these butcheries must have been in some measure implicated in their perpetration of the worst portion of the crimes committed it is probable that he is innocent i hope that i am right in this supposition for upon it i build my expectation of reading the entire riddle i look for the man herein this roomevery moment it is true that he may not arrive but the probability is that he will should he come it will be necessary to detain him here are pistols and we both know how to use them when occasion demands their use i took the pistols scarcely knowing what i did or believing what i heard while dupin went on very much as if in a soliloquy i have already spoken of his abstract manner at such times his discourse was addressed to myself but his voice although by no means loud had that intonation which is commonly employed in speaking to some one at a great distance his eyes vacant in expression regarded only the wall that the voices heard in contention he said by the party upon the stairs were not the voices of the women themselves was fully proved by the evidence this relieves us of all doubt upon the question whether the old lady could have first destroyed the daughter and afterward have committed suicide i speak of this point chiefly for the sake of method for the strength of madame lespanaye would have been utterly unequal to the task of thrusting her daughters corpse up the chimney as it was found and the nature of the wounds upon her own person entirely preclude the idea of selfdestruction murder then has been committed by some third party and the voices of this third party were those heard in contention let me now advertnot to the whole testimony respecting these voicesbut to what was peculiar in that testimony did you observe any thing peculiar about it i remarked that while all the witnesses agreed in supposing the gruff voice to be that of a frenchman there was much disagreement in regard to the shrill or as one individual termed it the harsh voice that was the evidence itself said dupin but it was not the peculiarity of the evidence you have observed nothing distinctive yet there was something to be observed the witnesses as you remark agreed about the gruff voice they were here unanimous but in regard to the shrill voice the peculiarity isnot that they disagreedbut that while an italian an englishman a spaniard a hollander and a frenchman attempted to describe it each one spoke of it as that of a foreigner each is sure that it was not the voice of one of his own countrymen each likens itnot to the voice of an individual of any nation with whose language he is conversant but the converse the frenchman supposes it the voice of a spaniard and might have distinguished some words had he been acquainted with the spanish the dutchman maintains it to have been that of a frenchman but we find it stated that not understanding french this witness was examined through an interpreter the englishman thinks it the voice of a german and does not understand german the spaniard is sure that it was that of an englishman but judges by the intonation altogether as he has no knowledge of the english the italian believes it the voice of a russian but has never conversed with a native of russia a second frenchman differs moreover with the first and is positive that the voice was that of an italian but not being cognizant of that tongue is like the spaniard convinced by the intonation now how strangely unusual must that voice have really been about which such testimony as this could have been elicitedin whose tones even denizens of the five great divisions of europe could recognize nothing familiar you will say that it might have been the voice of an asiaticof an african neither asiatics nor africans abound in paris but without denying the inference i will now merely call your attention to three points the voice is termed by one witness harsh rather than shrill it is represented by two others to have been quick and unequal no wordsno sounds resembling wordswere by any witness mentioned as distinguishable i know not continued dupin what impression i may have made so far upon your own understanding but i do not hesitate to say that legitimate deductions even from this portion of the testimonythe portion respecting the gruff and shrill voicesare in themselves sufficient to engender a suspicion which should give direction to all farther progress in the investigation of the mystery i said legitimate deductions but my meaning is not thus fully expressed i designed to imply that the deductions are the sole proper ones and that the suspicion arises inevitably from them as the single result what the suspicion is however i will not say just yet i merely wish you to bear in mind that with myself it was sufficiently forcible to give a definite forma certain tendencyto my inquiries in the chamber let us now transport ourselves in fancy to this chamber what shall we first seek here the means of egress employed by the murderers it is not too much to say that neither of us believe in praeternatural events madame and mademoiselle lespanaye were not destroyed by spirits the doers of the deed were material and escaped materially then how fortunately there is but one mode of reasoning upon the point and that mode must lead us to a definite decision let us examine each by each the possible means of egress it is clear that the assassins were in the room where mademoiselle lespanaye was found or at least in the room adjoining when the party ascended the stairs it is then only from these two apartments that we have to seek issues the police have laid bare the floors the ceilings and the masonry of the walls in every direction no secret issues could have escaped their vigilance but not trusting to their eyes i examined with my own there were then no secret issues both doors leading from the rooms into the passage were securely locked with the keys inside let us turn to the chimneys these although of ordinary width for some eight or ten feet above the hearths will not admit throughout their extent the body of a large cat the impossibility of egress by means already stated being thus absolute we are reduced to the windows through those of the front room no one could have escaped without notice from the crowd in the street the murderers must have passed then through those of the back room now brought to this conclusion in so unequivocal a manner as we are it is not our part as reasoners to reject it on account of apparent impossibilities it is only left for us to prove that these apparent impossibilities are in reality not such there are two windows in the chamber one of them is unobstructed by furniture and is wholly visible the lower portion of the other is hidden from view by the head of the unwieldy bedstead which is thrust close up against it the former was found securely fastened from within it resisted the utmost force of those who endeavored to raise it a large gimlethole had been pierced in its frame to the left and a very stout nail was found fitted therein nearly to the head upon examining the other window a similar nail was seen similarly fitted in it and a vigorous attempt to raise this sash failed also the police were now entirely satisfied that egress had not been in these directions and therefore it was thought a matter of supererogation to withdraw the nails and open the windows my own examination was somewhat more particular and was so for the reason i have just givenbecause here it was i knew that all apparent impossibilities must be proved to be not such in reality i proceeded to think thusa posteriori the murderers did escape from one of these windows this being so they could not have refastened the sashes from the inside as they were found fastened the consideration which put a stop through its obviousness to the scrutiny of the police in this quarter yet the sashes were fastened they must then have the power of fastening themselves there was no escape from this conclusion i stepped to the unobstructed casement withdrew the nail with some difficulty and attempted to raise the sash it resisted all my efforts as i had anticipated a concealed spring must i now know exist and this corroboration of my idea convinced me that my premises at least were correct however mysterious still appeared the circumstances attending the nails a careful search soon brought to light the hidden spring i pressed it and satisfied with the discovery forbore to upraise the sash i now replaced the nail and regarded it attentively a person passing out through this window might have reclosed it and the spring would have caughtbut the nail could not have been replaced the conclusion was plain and again narrowed in the field of my investigations the assassins must have escaped through the other window supposing then the springs upon each sash to be the same as was probable there must be found a difference between the nails or at least between the modes of their fixture getting upon the sacking of the bedstead i looked over the headboard minutely at the second casement passing my hand down behind the board i readily discovered and pressed the spring which was as i had supposed identical in character with its neighbor i now looked at the nail it was as stout as the other and apparently fitted in the same mannerdriven in nearly up to the head you will say that i was puzzled but if you think so you must have misunderstood the nature of the inductions to use a sporting phrase i had not been once at fault the scent had never for an instant been lost there was no flaw in any link of the chain i had traced the secret to its ultimate resultand that result was the nail it had i say in every respect the appearance of its fellow in the other window but this fact was an absolute nullity conclusive as it might seem to be when compared with the consideration that here at this point terminated the clue there must be something wrong i said about the nail i touched it and the head with about a quarter of an inch of the shank came off in my fingers the rest of the shank was in the gimlethole where it had been broken off the fracture was an old one for its edges were incrusted with rust and had apparently been accomplished by the blow of a hammer which had partially imbedded in the top of the bottom sash the head portion of the nail i now carefully replaced this head portion in the indentation whence i had taken it and the resemblance to a perfect nail was completethe fissure was invisible pressing the spring i gently raised the sash for a few inches the head went up with it remaining firm in its bed i closed the window and the semblance of the whole nail was again perfect the riddle so far was now unriddled the assassin had escaped through the window which looked upon the bed dropping of its own accord upon his exit or perhaps purposely closed it had become fastened by the spring and it was the retention of this spring which had been mistaken by the police for that of the nail farther inquiry being thus considered unnecessary the next question is that of the mode of descent upon this point i had been satisfied in my walk with you around the building about five feet and a half from the casement in question there runs a lightningrod from this rod it would have been impossible for any one to reach the window itself to say nothing of entering it i observed however that the shutters of the fourth story were of the peculiar kind called by parisian carpenters ferradesa kind rarely employed at the present day but frequently seen upon very old mansions at lyons and bordeaux they are in the form of an ordinary door a single not a folding door except that the lower half is latticed or worked in open trellisthus affording an excellent hold for the hands in the present instance these shutters are fully three feet and a half broad when we saw them from the rear of the house they were both about half openthat is to say they stood off at right angles from the wall it is probable that the police as well as myself examined the back of the tenement but if so in looking at these ferrades in the line of their breadth as they must have done they did not perceive this great breadth itself or at all events failed to take it into due consideration in fact having once satisfied themselves that no egress could have been made in this quarter they would naturally bestow here a very cursory examination it was clear to me however that the shutter belonging to the window at the head of the bed would if swung fully back to the wall reach to within two feet of the lightningrod it was also evident that by exertion of a very unusual degree of activity and courage an entrance into the window from the rod might have been thus effected by reaching to the distance of two feet and a half we now suppose the shutter open to its whole extent a robber might have taken a firm grasp upon the trelliswork letting go then his hold upon the rod placing his feet securely against the wall and springing boldly from it he might have swung the shutter so as to close it and if we imagine the window open at the time might even have swung himself into the room i wish you to bear especially in mind that i have spoken of a very unusual degree of activity as requisite to success in so hazardous and so difficult a feat it is my design to show you first that the thing might possibly have been accomplishedbut secondly and chiefly i wish to impress upon your understanding the very extraordinary the almost praeternatural character of that agility which could have accomplished it you will say no doubt using the language of the law that to make out my case i should rather undervalue than insist upon a full estimation of the activity required in this matter this may be the practice in law but it is not the usage of reason my ultimate object is only the truth my immediate purpose is to lead you to place in juxtaposition that very unusual activity of which i have just spoken with that very peculiar shrill or harsh and unequal voice about whose nationality no two persons could be found to agree and in whose utterance no syllabification could be detected at these words a vague and halfformed conception of the meaning of dupin flitted over my mind i seemed to be upon the verge of comprehension without power to comprehendas men at times find themselves upon the brink of remembrance without being able in the end to remember my friend went on with his discourse you will see he said that i have shifted the question from the mode of egress to that of ingress it was my design to convey the idea that both were effected in the same manner at the same point let us now revert to the interior of the room let us survey the appearances here the drawers of the bureau it is said had been rifled although many articles of apparel still remained within them the conclusion here is absurd it is a mere guessa very silly oneand no more how are we to know that the articles found in the drawers were not all these drawers had originally contained madame lespanaye and her daughter lived an exceedingly retired lifesaw no companyseldom went outhad little use for numerous changes of habiliment those found were at least of as good quality as any likely to be possessed by these ladies if a thief had taken any why did he not take the bestwhy did he not take all in a word why did he abandon four thousand francs in gold to encumber himself with a bundle of linen the gold was abandoned nearly the whole sum mentioned by monsieur mignaud the banker was discovered in bags upon the floor i wish you therefore to discard from your thoughts the blundering idea of motive engendered in the brains of the police by that portion of the evidence which speaks of money delivered at the door of the house coincidences ten times as remarkable as this the delivery of the money and murder committed within three days upon the party receiving it happen to all of us every hour of our lives without attracting even momentary notice coincidences in general are great stumblingblocks in the way of that class of thinkers who have been educated to know nothing of the theory of probabilitiesthat theory to which the most glorious objects of human research are indebted for the most glorious of illustration in the present instance had the gold been gone the fact of its delivery three days before would have formed something more than a coincidence it would have been corroborative of this idea of motive but under the real circumstances of the case if we are to suppose gold the motive of this outrage we must also imagine the perpetrator so vacillating an idiot as to have abandoned his gold and his motive together keeping now steadily in mind the points to which i have drawn your attentionthat peculiar voice that unusual agility and that startling absence of motive in a murder so singularly atrocious as thislet us glance at the butchery itself here is a woman strangled to death by manual strength and thrust up a chimney head downward ordinary assassins employ no such modes of murder as this least of all do they thus dispose of the murdered in the manner of thrusting the corpse up the chimney you will admit that there was something excessively outrésomething altogether irreconcilable with our common notions of human action even when we suppose the actors the most depraved of men think too how great must have been that strength which could have thrust the body up such an aperture so forcibly that the united vigor of several persons was found barely sufficient to drag it down turn now to other indications of the employment of a vigor most marvellous on the hearth were thick tressesvery thick tressesof grey human hair these had been torn out by the roots you are aware of the great force necessary in tearing thus from the head even twenty or thirty hairs together you saw the locks in question as well as myself their roots a hideous sight were clotted with fragments of the flesh of the scalpsure token of the prodigious power which had been exerted in uprooting perhaps half a million of hairs at a time the throat of the old lady was not merely cut but the head absolutely severed from the body the instrument was a mere razor i wish you also to look at the brutal ferocity of these deeds of the bruises upon the body of madame lespanaye i do not speak monsieur dumas and his worthy coadjutor monsieur etienne have pronounced that they were inflicted by some obtuse instrument and so far these gentlemen are very correct the obtuse instrument was clearly the stone pavement in the yard upon which the victim had fallen from the window which looked in upon the bed this idea however simple it may now seem escaped the police for the same reason that the breadth of the shutters escaped thembecause by the affair of the nails their perceptions had been hermetically sealed against the possibility of the windows having ever been opened at all if now in addition to all these things you have properly reflected upon the odd disorder of the chamber we have gone so far as to combine the ideas of an agility astounding a strength superhuman a ferocity brutal a butchery without motive a grotesquerie in horror absolutely alien from humanity and a voice foreign in tone to the ears of men of many nations and devoid of all distinct or intelligible syllabification what result then has ensued what impression have i made upon your fancy i felt a creeping of the flesh as dupin asked me the question a madman i said has done this deedsome raving maniac escaped from a neighboring maison de santé in some respects he replied your idea is not irrelevant but the voices of madmen even in their wildest paroxysms are never found to tally with that peculiar voice heard upon the stairs madmen are of some nation and their language however incoherent in its words has always the coherence of syllabification besides the hair of a madman is not such as i now hold in my hand i disentangled this little tuft from the rigidly clutched fingers of madame lespanaye tell me what you can make of it dupin i said completely unnerved this hair is most unusualthis is no human hair i have not asserted that it is said he but before we decide this point i wish you to glance at the little sketch i have here traced upon this paper it is a facsimile drawing of what has been described in one portion of the testimony as dark bruises and deep indentations of finger nails upon the throat of mademoiselle lespanaye and in another by messrs dumas and etienne as a series of livid spots evidently the impression of fingers you will perceive continued my friend spreading out the paper upon the table before us that this drawing gives the idea of a firm and fixed hold there is no slipping apparent each finger has retainedpossibly until the death of the victimthe fearful grasp by which it originally imbedded itself attempt now to place all your fingers at the same time in the respective impressions as you see them i made the attempt in vain we are possibly not giving this matter a fair trial he said the paper is spread out upon a plane surface but the human throat is cylindrical here is a billet of wood the circumference of which is about that of the throat wrap the drawing around it and try the experiment again i did so but the difficulty was even more obvious than before this i said is the mark of no human hand read now replied dupin this passage from cuvier it was a minute anatomical and generally descriptive account of the large fulvous ourangoutang of the east indian islands the gigantic stature the prodigious strength and activity the wild ferocity and the imitative propensities of these mammalia are sufficiently well known to all i understood the full horrors of the murder at once the description of the digits said i as i made an end of reading is in exact accordance with this drawing i see that no animal but an ourangoutang of the species here mentioned could have impressed the indentations as you have traced them this tuft of tawny hair too is identical in character with that of the beast of cuvier but i cannot possibly comprehend the particulars of this frightful mystery besides there were two voices heard in contention and one of them was unquestionably the voice of a frenchman true and you will remember an expression attributed almost unanimously by the evidence to this voicethe expression mon dieu this under the circumstances has been justly characterized by one of the witnesses montani the confectioner as an expression of remonstrance or expostulation upon these two words therefore i have mainly built my hopes of a full solution of the riddle a frenchman was cognizant of the murder it is possibleindeed it is far more than probablethat he was innocent of all participation in the bloody transactions which took place the ourangoutang may have escaped from him he may have traced it to the chamber but under the agitating circumstances which ensued he could never have recaptured it it is still at large i will not pursue these guessesfor i have no right to call them moresince the shades of reflection upon which they are based are scarcely of sufficient depth to be appreciable by my own intellect and since i could not pretend to make them intelligible to the understanding of another we will call them guesses then and speak of them as such if the frenchman in question is indeed as i suppose innocent of this atrocity this advertisement which i left last night upon our return home at the office of le monde a paper devoted to the shipping interest and much sought by sailors will bring him to our residence he handed me a paper and i read thus caughtin the bois de boulogne early in the morning of the inst the morning of the murder a very large tawny ourangoutang of the bornese species the owner who is ascertained to be a sailor belonging to a maltese vessel may have the animal again upon identifying it satisfactorily and paying a few charges arising from its capture and keeping call at no rue faubourg st germainau troisième how was it possible i asked that you should know the man to be a sailor and belonging to a maltese vessel i do not know it said dupin i am not sure of it here however is a small piece of ribbon which from its form and from its greasy appearance has evidently been used in tying the hair in one of those long queues of which sailors are so fond moreover this knot is one which few besides sailors can tie and is peculiar to the maltese i picked the ribbon up at the foot of the lightningrod it could not have belonged to either of the deceased now if after all i am wrong in my induction from this ribbon that the frenchman was a sailor belonging to a maltese vessel still i can have done no harm in saying what i did in the advertisement if i am in error he will merely suppose that i have been misled by some circumstance into which he will not take the trouble to inquire but if i am right a great point is gained cognizant although innocent of the murder the frenchman will naturally hesitate about replying to the advertisementabout demanding the ourangoutang he will reason thusi am innocent i am poor my ourangoutang is of great valueto one in my circumstances a fortune of itselfwhy should i lose it through idle apprehensions of danger here it is within my grasp it was found in the bois de boulogne at a vast distance from the scene of that butchery how can it ever be suspected that a brute beast should have done the deed the police are at fault they have failed to procure the slightest clue should they even trace the animal it would be impossible to prove me cognizant of the murder or to implicate me in guilt on account of that cognizance above all i am known the advertiser designates me as the possessor of the beast i am not sure to what limit his knowledge may extend should i avoid claiming a property of so great value which it is known that i possess i will render the animal at least liable to suspicion it is not my policy to attract attention either to myself or to the beast i will answer the advertisement get the ourangoutang and keep it close until this matter has blown over at this moment we heard a step upon the stairs be ready said dupin with your pistols but neither use them nor show them until at a signal from myself the front door of the house had been left open and the visitor had entered without ringing and advanced several steps upon the staircase now however he seemed to hesitate presently we heard him descending dupin was moving quickly to the door when we again heard him coming up he did not turn back a second time but stepped up with decision and rapped at the door of our chamber come in said dupin in a cheerful and hearty tone a man entered he was a sailor evidentlya tall stout and muscularlooking person with a certain daredevil expression of countenance not altogether unprepossessing his face greatly sunburnt was more than half hidden by whisker and mustachio he had with him a huge oaken cudgel but appeared to be otherwise unarmed he bowed awkwardly and bade us good evening in french accents which although somewhat neufchatelish were still sufficiently indicative of a parisian origin sit down my friend said dupin i suppose you have called about the ourangoutang upon my word i almost envy you the possession of him a remarkably fine and no doubt a very valuable animal how old do you suppose him to be the sailor drew a long breath with the air of a man relieved of some intolerable burden and then replied in an assured tone i have no way of tellingbut he cant be more than four or five years old have you got him here oh no we had no conveniences for keeping him here he is at a livery stable in the rue dubourg just by you can get him in the morning of course you are prepared to identify the property to be sure i am sir i shall be sorry to part with him said dupin i dont mean that you should be at all this trouble for nothing sir said the man couldnt expect it am very willing to pay a reward for the finding of the animalthat is to say any thing in reason well replied my friend that is all very fair to be sure let me thinkwhat should i have oh i will tell you my reward shall be this you shall give me all the information in your power about these murders in the rue morgue dupin said the last words in a very low tone and very quietly just as quietly too he walked toward the door locked it and put the key in his pocket he then drew a pistol from his bosom and placed it without the least flurry upon the table the sailors face flushed up as if he were struggling with suffocation he started to his feet and grasped his cudgel but the next moment he fell back into his seat trembling violently and with the countenance of death itself he spoke not a word i pitied him from the bottom of my heart my friend said dupin in a kind tone you are alarming yourself unnecessarilyyou are indeed we mean you no harm whatever i pledge you the honor of a gentleman and of a frenchman that we intend you no injury i perfectly well know that you are innocent of the atrocities in the rue morgue it will not do however to deny that you are in some measure implicated in them from what i have already said you must know that i have had means of information about this mattermeans of which you could never have dreamed now the thing stands thus you have done nothing which you could have avoidednothing certainly which renders you culpable you were not even guilty of robbery when you might have robbed with impunity you have nothing to conceal you have no reason for concealment on the other hand you are bound by every principle of honor to confess all you know an innocent man is now imprisoned charged with that crime of which you can point out the perpetrator the sailor had recovered his presence of mind in a great measure while dupin uttered these words but his original boldness of bearing was all gone so help me god said he after a brief pause i will tell you all i know about this affairbut i do not expect you to believe one half i sayi would be a fool indeed if i did still i am innocent and i will make a clean breast if i die for it what he stated was in substance this he had lately made a voyage to the indian archipelago a party of which he formed one landed at borneo and passed into the interior on an excursion of pleasure himself and a companion had captured the ourangoutang this companion dying the animal fell into his own exclusive possession after great trouble occasioned by the intractable ferocity of his captive during the home voyage he at length succeeded in lodging it safely at his own residence in paris where not to attract toward himself the unpleasant curiosity of his neighbors he kept it carefully secluded until such time as it should recover from a wound in the foot received from a splinter on board ship his ultimate design was to sell it returning home from some sailors frolic on the night or rather in the morning of the murder he found the beast occupying his own bedroom into which it had broken from a closet adjoining where it had been as was thought securely confined razor in hand and fully lathered it was sitting before a lookingglass attempting the operation of shaving in which it had no doubt previously watched its master through the keyhole of the closet terrified at the sight of so dangerous a weapon in the possession of an animal so ferocious and so well able to use it the man for some moments was at a loss what to do he had been accustomed however to quiet the creature even in its fiercest moods by the use of a whip and to this he now resorted upon sight of it the ourangoutang sprang at once through the door of the chamber down the stairs and thence through a window unfortunately open into the street the frenchman followed in despair the ape razor still in hand occasionally stopping to look back and gesticulate at its pursuer until the latter had nearly come up with it it then again made off in this manner the chase continued for a long time the streets were profoundly quiet as it was nearly three oclock in the morning in passing down an alley in the rear of the rue morgue the fugitives attention was arrested by a light gleaming from the open window of madame lespanayes chamber in the fourth story of her house rushing to the building it perceived the lightning rod clambered up with inconceivable agility grasped the shutter which was thrown fully back against the wall and by its means swung itself directly upon the headboard of the bed the whole feat did not occupy a minute the shutter was kicked open again by the ourangoutang as it entered the room the sailor in the meantime was both rejoiced and perplexed he had strong hopes of now recapturing the brute as it could scarcely escape from the trap into which it had ventured except by the rod where it might be intercepted as it came down on the other hand there was much cause for anxiety as to what it might do in the house this latter reflection urged the man still to follow the fugitive a lightningrod is ascended without difficulty especially by a sailor but when he had arrived as high as the window which lay far to his left his career was stopped the most that he could accomplish was to reach over so as to obtain a glimpse of the interior of the room at this glimpse he nearly fell from his hold through excess of horror now it was that those hideous shrieks arose upon the night which had startled from slumber the inmates of the rue morgue madame lespanaye and her daughter habited in their night clothes had apparently been occupied in arranging some papers in the iron chest already mentioned which had been wheeled into the middle of the room it was open and its contents lay beside it on the floor the victims must have been sitting with their backs toward the window and from the time elapsing between the ingress of the beast and the screams it seems probable that it was not immediately perceived the flappingto of the shutter would naturally have been attributed to the wind as the sailor looked in the gigantic animal had seized madame lespanaye by the hair which was loose as she had been combing it and was flourishing the razor about her face in imitation of the motions of a barber the daughter lay prostrate and motionless she had swooned the screams and struggles of the old lady during which the hair was torn from her head had the effect of changing the probably pacific purposes of the ourangoutang into those of wrath with one determined sweep of its muscular arm it nearly severed her head from her body the sight of blood inflamed its anger into phrenzy gnashing its teeth and flashing fire from its eyes it flew upon the body of the girl and imbedded its fearful talons in her throat retaining its grasp until she expired its wandering and wild glances fell at this moment upon the head of the bed over which the face of its master rigid with horror was just discernible the fury of the beast who no doubt bore still in mind the dreaded whip was instantly converted into fear conscious of having deserved punishment it seemed desirous of concealing its bloody deeds and skipped about the chamber in an agony of nervous agitation throwing down and breaking the furniture as it moved and dragging the bed from the bedstead in conclusion it seized first the corpse of the daughter and thrust it up the chimney as it was found then that of the old lady which it immediately hurled through the window headlong as the ape approached the casement with its mutilated burden the sailor shrank aghast to the rod and rather gliding than clambering down it hurried at once homedreading the consequences of the butchery and gladly abandoning in his terror all solicitude about the fate of the ourangoutang the words heard by the party upon the staircase were the frenchmans exclamations of horror and affright commingled with the fiendish jabberings of the brute i have scarcely anything to add the ourangoutang must have escaped from the chamber by the rod just before the break of the door it must have closed the window as it passed through it it was subsequently caught by the owner himself who obtained for it a very large sum at the jardin des plantes le bon was instantly released upon our narration of the circumstances with some comments from dupin at the bureau of the prefect of police this functionary however well disposed to my friend could not altogether conceal his chagrin at the turn which affairs had taken and was fain to indulge in a sarcasm or two about the propriety of every person minding his own business let him talk said dupin who had not thought it necessary to reply let him discourse it will ease his conscience i am satisfied with having defeated him in his own castle nevertheless that he failed in the solution of this mystery is by no means that matter for wonder which he supposes it for in truth our friend the prefect is somewhat too cunning to be profound in his wisdom is no stamen it is all head and no body like the pictures of the goddess laverna or at best all head and shoulders like a codfish but he is a good creature after all i like him especially for one master stroke of cant by which he has attained his reputation for ingenuity i mean the way he has de nier ce quiest et dexpliquer ce quinest pas the quick and the undead by nelson demille so much commentary has been written about edgar allan poe over the last century and a half that it seems unnecessary to add more unless of course one has something new to say which is unlikely though thats never stopped academic writers this is my way of saying that im not going to try to outshine the poe scholars who delve deep into the mind and writings of edgar allan poe and who allude to jung freud and the collective unconsciousness not to mention mythopoeic inevitability instead im going to fall back on the safety of a personal narrative which recounts my introduction to edgar allan poe this story begins in when i was eleven years old so if the details seem fuzzy youll understand threed movies were big in the mids and i made it a point not to miss any of them no matter how badly theyd been reviewed by my peers whod scraped up the twentyfive cents before i did in the hot d movie that everyone was raving about was phantom of the rue morgue i didnt know what a rue morgue was but i did know that the phantom was a good comic strip id also never heard of edgar allan poe and i didnt know that poes short story upon which the movie was loosely based had been titled the murders in the rue morgue that was irrelevant to me and apparently also to hollywood in any case my classmates whod seen the movie set me straight on the meaning of the title a rue is like a street and gave the movie a solid rating of piss your pants i grew up in elmont a small community on long island new york which consisted mostly of postwar housing tracts within this community was a new movie theater within walking distance of my house which in those days meant two miles lying between the theater and my house wasspooky music pleasea cemetery but this was not the kind of horrorflick churchyard cemetery that i associated with ghosts ghouls zombies werewolves vampires or any other species of the living dead this was a nice jewish cemetery and who ever heard of a jewish vampire the cemetery beth david by name actually bordered the backyard of my house and lying as it did in the center of the town it was a good shortcut to and from a lot of places including the movie theater i had lived peacefully with this cemetery since wed moved into the house about six or seven years before and from my secondfloor bedroom window i could see the neat green acres of beth david and rows and rows of polished granite tombstones during the day the cemetery was filled with funeral processions workers and visitors and my only fear in crossing this burial ground was the possibility of getting chased by the cemetery guards who patrolled in marked cars i never got caught and years later i became the star sprinter onehundredyard dash in ten flat of the elmont memorial high school track team my only experience with the cemetery at night was to stare at it now and then from my bedroom window in five or six years of looking i never once saw anything come out of a grave or move that shouldnt move the trees moved in the wind the headlights of patrol cars moved on the roads that was about it so my proximity to and trespassing in the cemetery in my backyard made it a familiar place that held no terrors for me and caused no childhood mental trauma that needed to be addressed then or now except for that one time when i took the shortcut through the cemetery following a latesaturdayafternoon showing of phantom of the rue morgue in d color the movie by todays standards would barely raise a hair on the back of anyones neck but in when youre eleven weird makeup creepy music and bloodsplatter patterns can easily send you sprinting up the aisle to the popcorn stand a quick internet search of edgar allan poe filmography informs me that karl malden before he learned how to act played the part of the rue morgue mad scientist dr marais logging in a better performance was a trained gorilla whose name is lost to cinema history and also merv griffin of all people who played a french medical student i remember the mad scientist and the gorilla but not merv the plot such as it is is simple dr marais uses the gorilla to exact revenge on various beautiful women who have spurned him each of these ladies has been given a jingling bracelet that attracts the killer gorilla i know you want more of this plot but i dont want to spoil your next netflix selection suffice it to say whenever these young ladies walk along a street alone at night the tinkling bracelet is heard by the sharpeared preprogrammed gorilla why no one notices this gorilla is not something to be examined too closely i never gave it much thought myself and neither did the adults who made the movie were talking here of a major suspension of disbelief and kids are good at that kids are also good at pavlovian response and getting themselves scared out of their susceptible little minds so when those pretty ladies jangled their bracelets the movie theater let out a collective gasp and a few involuntary squeals the future dogooders among the mostly preadolescent crowd yelled out warnings to the strutting tarts the really scary parts of the movie however were the d shock effects you just never knew when something was going to hurtle at you from the screen and if you can remember this youll verify that literally the entire audience in a d shocker screamed and ducked i mean popcorn flying cokes splashing and d glasses being ripped from faces by the gforces created by rapidly moving heads arms and bodies bottom line on phantom of the rue morgue is it sucked but it was scary it was fall or maybe winter and by the time i and a few friends left the theater about pm it was getting dark the rule was get home as soon as the streetlights come on theyd come on and i was late my cell phone hadnt been invented yet and the pay phone on the corner cost a nickel or maybe a dime and no one wanted to splurge on that just to say we were alive and running late we mostly walked or biked wherever we went and the concept of a parent coming to pick us up was not part of the zeitgeist of that simpler safer and unpampered age our parents had taught us well however you got there get back the same way well id walked to the movie theater and now i had to walk home from the corner of elmont road and hempstead turnpike where the theater was it was about two miles if i took the circuitous street route however if i took the direct route through the cemetery two of the three guys i was with lived in the opposite direction so the cemetery was not part of their plan but the third guywho ill call jack so as not to embarrass him a half century later or call into question the size of his developing cojoneslived down the block from me so quite naturally i thought id have company on my quick trip through the land of the living dead jack however had other ideas and informed me that hed rather be late for dinner than be dinner for a werewolf i should have followed his line of reasoning but i was in the early stages of mastering the art of the bad decisionreally nothing more than macho recklessnessthat would later reach its crowning stupidity when i quit college joined the army and volunteered for vietnam at this point in my life however i really wanted company on my road toward discovering the limits of my courage and idiocy so i said to jack youre a chicken am not chicken chicken and i imitated a chicken today jack would tell me to go fk myself but i think he replied ah youre nuts and ran off toward the safety of home along lighted streets slowing only long enough to turn and deliver a parthian shot youre gonna diiiie of course i should have reconsidered my route home and sprinted after him and when i caught up with him i could have pushed him on his face then challenged him to a race home but the idea i held on to was to cut about half a mile or more off my route and beat him home stopping only long enough to ring his bell and tell his parents that jack had stopped at the candy store to gorge on snickers before dinner my other motivation for the cemetery route was less spiteful i needed to get home as soon after the streetlight curfew as possible i wasnt sure what would happen if i didnt and i didnt want to find out i crossed elmont road and ran along the sidewalk that bordered the cemetery which was enclosed by a wroughtiron fence about eight feet high posted at intervals with signs that said keep out the streetlights always came on before it was really dark so there was some light left in the sky but it was fading fast a half mile up ahead were the main gates and the guard booth of the cemetery and i needed to scale the fence well before i reached the gates in order to benefit from the most direct route which id used many times in the daylight so without giving it much thought i scrambled up the wroughtiron fence and dropped into beth david cemetery i knelt motionless listening for any sign that id been seen or heard i gave it ten seconds then i was up and running it was fun at first i stuck to the rows between the gravestones avoiding the roads which were patrolled by guard vehicles i needed to cover about a mile and a half and at the speed i was moving i could do that in less than fifteen minutes one time i did it in under twelve minutes in the daylight the obvious problem was the sinking sun and i found it was becoming more difficult to see i spotted a few freshly dug open graves covered only by green tarps awaiting occupants and i didnt want to fall into one of those sixfoot holes so i slowed up cursed jack and within a few minutes realized i was disoriented in fact i was fking lost it was almost pitchdark now and i couldnt recognize any landmarks it was also cold and i wished id taken my mothers advice about wearing a hat to cut to the chase i was becoming frightened i mean really really scared everybody in that place except for me and a few guards was dead or undead because it was such an open space there was a wind that i hadnt noticed back on the road and the wind was making things movetree limbs dead leaves litter and the white shrouds that cover jewish tombstones until the day of unveiling and along with these movements came sounds and shadows that startled me every few seconds to make matters worse if that were possible i now heard something id never heard before in the cemeterydogs the guards had one or two dogs but these dogs that i heard were not those welltrained guard animals these were wild dogs and a lot of them baying and barking into the black night or were they werewolves i mean if you still believe in santa claus at age eleven and you believe in good fairies then it stands to reason that you will also believe in ghosts witches warlocks werewolves vampires zombies and flesheating ghouls and if youre particularly gullible killer mummies i could stretch things here and say i had visions of the killer gorilla and the creepy dr marais but i really didnt those guys were wimps compared to the undead i was however prespooked by the d shock effects and my spine had tingled about ten times already in the movie theater so whatever it is in our psyches that causes us to become frightened by a horror flick this feeling stays with us for a while and when we go to bed we pull the sheets over our heads and listen for vampires trying to get in the window or zombies banging on the door this in retrospect may have been why my imagination was running wild in the cemetery and why i froze with fear as i crouched in the dark listening to the wind blowing between the tombstones and the dogs or werewolves barking in the distance so quick segue to edgar allan poe master of the macabre manipulator of our minds and a very elegant writer long before the study of the mind became a quasiscientific discipline poe was able to grasp what frightened us and he transformed that understanding into spooky and entertaining tales that were far ahead of their time and which have endured through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and into the twentyfirstwhich is more than i can say about that d schlocker shocker i saw fifty years ago you could analyze this guy to death and people haveand maybe poe had that comingbut in the final nonanalysis just read this extraordinary writer enjoy his prose with a glass of sherry and read aloud the poetryespecially the ravento some kid in a dimly lit room dont forget the sound effects cut to beth david cemetery exterior evening a calm fatalistic sensation passed over me i knew i was going to die and id accepted that i just wasnt sure if i was going to get eaten by dogs or werewolves i wasnt thinking much about the killer gorilla though somewhere in the back of my mind i could still see him jumping at me out of the movie screen i stood and began walking toward my fate wondering what i had missed for dinner eventually i came across a familiar road and i allowed myself a small glimmer of hope i pointed myself in the right direction and ran like hell i could see house lights now and i knew i was less than a minute from the chainlink fence that separated the living from the dead i honestly dont even remember climbing the fence i think i ran up it then i remember being in someones backyard and dashing down their driveway then running on the sidewalk then home my mother said jacks mother called and said you were cutting through the cemetery we were worried i replied its a shortcut mom my father said dont cut through the cemetery again he explained the ghosts come out at night thanks pop ill remember that nelson demille was born in new york city but grew up next door to a cemetery on long island he spent four undistinguished years at hofstra university where he was introduced to the works of edgar allan poe cliff notes and was inspired by poe to excessive drinking and growing a weird beard and mustache demille is the author of fourteen bestselling novels a member of the authors guild and maybe a member of pen and poets writers though hes not sure he was president of the mystery writers of america in and served without mishap the goldbug what ho what ho this fellow is dancing mad he hath been bitten by the tarantula all in the wrong many years ago i contracted an intimacy with a mr william legrand he was of an ancient huguenot family and had once been wealthy but a series of misfortunes had reduced him to want to avoid the mortification consequent upon his disasters he left new orleans the city of his forefathers and took up his residence at sullivans island near charleston south carolina this island is a very singular one it consists of little else than the sea sand and is about three miles long its breadth at no point exceeds a quarter of a mile it is separated from the mainland by a scarcely perceptible creek oozing its way through a wilderness of reeds and slime a favorite resort of the marshhen the vegetation as might be supposed is scant or at least dwarfish no trees of any magnitude are to be seen near the western extremity where fort moultrie stands and where are some miserable frame buildings tenanted during summer by the fugitives from charleston dust and fever may be found indeed the bristly palmetto but the whole island with the exception of this western point and a line of hard white beach on the seacoast is covered with a dense undergrowth of the sweet myrtle so much prized by the horticulturists of england the shrub here often attains the height of fifteen or twenty feet and forms an almost impenetrable coppice burthening the air with its fragrance in the inmost recesses of this coppice not far from the eastern or more remote end of the island legrand had built himself a small hut which he occupied when i first by mere accident made his acquaintance this soon ripened into friendshipfor there was much in the recluse to excite interest and esteem i found him well educated with unusual powers of mind but infected with misanthropy and subject to perverse moods of alternate enthusiasm and melancholy he had with him many books but rarely employed them his chief amusements were gunning and fishing or sauntering along the beach and through the myrtles in quest of shells or entomological specimenshis collection of the latter might have been envied by a swammerdamm in these excursions he was usually accompanied by an old negro called jupiter who had been manumitted before the reverses of the family but who could be induced neither by threats nor by promises to abandon what he considered his right of attendance upon the footsteps of his young massa will it is not improbable that the relatives of legrand conceiving him to be somewhat unsettled in intellect had contrived to instill this obstinacy into jupiter with a view to the supervision and guardianship of the wanderer the winters in the latitude of sullivans island are seldom very severe and in the fall of the year it is a rare event indeed when a fire is considered necessary about the middle of october there occurred however a day of remarkable chilliness just before sunset i scrambled my way through the evergreens to the hut of my friend whom i had not visited for several weeksmy residence being at that time in charleston a distance of nine miles from the island while the facilities of passage and repassage were very far behind those of the present day upon reaching the hut i rapped as was my custom and getting no reply sought for the key where i knew it was secreted unlocked the door and went in a fine fire was blazing upon the hearth it was a novelty and by no means an ungrateful one i threw off an overcoat took an armchair by the crackling logs and awaited patiently the arrival of my hosts soon after dark they arrived and gave me a most cordial welcome jupiter grinning from ear to ear bustled about to prepare some marshhens for supper legrand was in one of his fitshow else shall i term themof enthusiasm he had found an unknown bivalve forming a new genus and more than this he had hunted down and secured with jupiters assistance a scarabaeus which he believed to be totally new but in respect to which he wished to have my opinion on the morrow and why not tonight i asked rubbing my hands over the blaze and wishing the whole tribe of scarabaei at the devil ah if i had only known you were here said legrand but its so long since i saw you and how could i foresee that you would pay me a visit this very night of all others as i was coming home i met lieutenant g from the fort and very foolishly i lent him the bug so it will be impossible for you to see it until the morning stay here tonight and i will send jup down for it at sunrise it is the loveliest thing in creation whatsunrise nonsense nothe bug it is of a brilliant gold colorabout the size of a large hickorynutwith two jet black spots near one extremity of the back and another somewhat longer at the other the antennae are dey aint no tin in him massa will i keep a tellin on you here interrupted jupiter de bug is a goolebug solid ebery bit of him inside and all sep him wingneber feel half so hebby a bug in my life well suppose it is jup replied legrand somewhat more earnestly it seemed to me than the case demanded is that any reason for your letting the birds burn the colorhere he turned to meis really almost enough to warrant jupiters idea you never saw a more brilliant metallic luster than the scales emitbut of this you cannot judge till tomorrow in the meantime i can give you some idea of the shape saying this he seated himself at a small table on which were a pen and ink but no paper he looked for some in a drawer but found none never mind he said at length this will answer and he drew from his waistcoat pocket a scrap of what i took to be very dirty foolscap and made upon it a rough drawing with the pen while he did this i retained my seat by the fire for i was still chilly when the design was complete he handed it to me without rising as i received it a loud growl was heard succeeded by a scratching at the door jupiter opened it and a large newfoundland belonging to legrand rushed in leaped upon my shoulders and loaded me with caresses for i had shown him much attention during previous visits when his gambols were over i looked at the paper and to speak the truth found myself not a little puzzled at what my friend had depicted well i said after contemplating it for some minutes this is a strange scarabaeus i must confess new to me never saw any thing like it beforeunless it was a skull or a deathshead which it more nearly resembles than any thing else that has come under my observation a deathshead echoed legrand ohyeswell it has something of that appearance upon paper no doubt the two upper black spots look like eyes eh and the longer one at the bottom like a mouthand then the shape of the whole is oval perhaps so said i but legrand i fear you are no artist i must wait until i see the beetle itself if i am to form any idea of its personal appearance well i dont know said he a little nettled i draw tolerably should do it at leasthave had good masters and flatter myself that i am not quite a blockhead but my dear fellow you are joking then said i this is a very passable skullindeed i may say that it is a very excellent skull according to the vulgar notions about such specimens of physiology and your scarabaeus must be the queerest scarabaeus in the world if it resembles it why we may get up a very thrilling bit of superstition upon this hint i presume you will call the bug scarabaeus caput hominis or something of that kindthere are many similar titles in the natural histories but where are the antennae you spoke of the antennae said legrand who seemed to be getting unaccountably warm upon the subject i am sure you must see the antennae i made them as distinct as they are in the original insect and i presume that is sufficient well well i said perhaps you havestill i dont see them and i handed him the paper without additional remark not wishing to ruffle his temper but i was much surprised at the turn affairs had taken his ill humor puzzled meand as for the drawing of the beetle there were positively no antennae visible and the whole did bear a very close resemblance to the ordinary cuts of a deathshead he received the paper very peevishly and was about to crumple it apparently to throw it in the fire when a casual glance at the design seemed suddenly to rivet his attention in an instant his face grew violently redin another as excessively pale for some minutes he continued to scrutinize the drawing minutely where he sat at length he arose took a candle from the table and proceeded to seat himself upon a seachest in the farthest corner of the room here again he made an anxious examination of the paper turning it in all directions he said nothing however and his conduct greatly astonished me yet i thought it prudent not to exacerbate the growing moodiness of his temper by any comment presently he took from his coatpocket a wallet placed the paper carefully in it and deposited both in a writingdesk which he locked he now grew more composed in his demeanor but his original air of enthusiasm had quite disappeared yet he seemed not so much sulky as abstracted as the evening wore away he became more and more absorbed in revery from which no sallies of mine could arouse him it had been my intention to pass the night at the hut as i had frequently done before but seeing my host in this mood i deemed it proper to take leave he did not press me to remain but as i departed he shook my hand with even more than his usual cordiality it was about a month after this and during the interval i had seen nothing of legrand when i received a visit at charleston from his man jupiter i had never seen the good old negro look so dispirited and i feared that some serious disaster had befallen my friend well jup said i what is the matter nowhow is your master why to speak de troof massa him not so berry well as mought be not well i am truly sorry to hear it what does he complain of dar dats ithim neber plain of notinbut him berry sick for all dat very sick jupiterwhy didnt you say so at once is he confined to bed no dat he ainthe aint find nowhardats just whar de shoe pinchmy mind is got to be berry hebby bout poor massa will jupiter i should like to understand what it is you are talking about you say your master is sick hasnt he told you what ails him why massa taint worf while for to git mad about de matter massa will say noffin at all aint de matter wid himbut den what make him go about looking dis here way wid he head down and he soldiers up and as white as a goose and den he keep a syphon all de time keeps a what jupiter keeps a syphon

de whole ob de blessed day i had a big stick ready cut for to gib him deuced good beating when he did comebut ise sich a fool dat i hadnt de heart arter allhe looked so berry poorly ehwhatah yesupon the whole i think you had better not be too severe with the poor fellowdont flog him jupiterhe cant very well stand itbut can you form no idea of what has occasioned this illness or rather this change of conduct has any thing unpleasant happened since i saw you no massa dey aint bin noffin onpleasant since dentwas fore den im fearedtwas de berry day you was dare how what do you mean why massa i mean de bugdare now the what de bugim berry sartain dat massa will bin bit somewhere bout de head by dat goolebug and what cause have you jupiter for such a supposition claws enuff massa and mouff too

if taint cause he bit by the goolebug ise heerd bout dem goolebugs fore dis but how do you know he dreams about gold how i know why cause he talk about it in he sleepdats how i nose well jup perhaps you are right but to what fortunate circumstance am i to attribute the honor of a visit from you today what de matter massa did you bring any message from mr legrand no massa i bring dis here pissel and here jupiter handed me a note which ran thus my dear why have i not seen you for so long a time i hope you have not been so foolish as to take offense at any little brusquerie of mine but no that is improbable since i saw you i have had great cause for anxiety i have something to tell you yet scarcely know how to tell it or whether i should tell it at all i have not been quite well for some days past and poor old jup annoys me almost beyond endurance by his wellmeant attentions would you believe ithe had prepared a huge stick the other day with which to chastise me for giving him the slip and spending the day solus among the hills on the mainland i verily believe that my ill looks alone saved me a flogging i have made no addition to my cabinet since we met if you can in any way make it convenient come over with jupiter do come i wish to see you tonight upon business of importance i assure you that it is of the highest importance ever yours william legrand there was something in the tone of this note which gave me great uneasiness its whole style differed materially from that of legrand what could he be dreaming of what new crotchet possessed his excitable brain what business of the highest importance could he possibly have to transact jupiters account of him boded no good i dreaded lest the continued pressure of misfortune had at length fairly unsettled the reason of my friend without a moments hesitation therefore i prepared to accompany the negro upon reaching the wharf i noticed a scythe and three spades all apparently new lying in the bottom of the boat in which we were to embark what is the meaning of all this jup i inquired him syfe massa and spade very true but what are they doing here him de syfe and de spade what massa will sis pon my buying for him in de town and de debbils own lot of money i had to gib for em but what in the name of all that is mysterious is your massa will going to do with scythes and spades dats more dan i know and debbil take me if i dont blieve tis more dan he know too but its all cum ob de bug finding that no satisfaction was to be obtained of jupiter whose whole intellect seemed to be absorbed by de bug i now stepped into the boat and made sail with a fair and strong breeze we soon ran into the little cove to the northward of fort moultrie and a walk of some two miles brought us to the hut it was about three in the afternoon when we arrived legrand had been waiting us in eager expectation he grasped my hand with a nervous empressement which alarmed me and strengthened the suspicions already entertained his countenance was pale even to ghastliness and his deepset eyes glared with unnatural luster after some inquiries respecting his health i asked him not knowing what better to say if he had yet obtained the scarabaeus from lieutenant g oh yes he replied coloring violently i got it from him the next morning nothing should tempt me to part with that scarabaeus do you know that jupiter is quite right about it in what way i asked with a sad foreboding at heart in supposing it to be a bug of real gold he said this with an air of profound seriousness and i felt inexpressibly shocked this bug is to make my fortune he continued with a triumphant smile to reinstate me in my family possessions is it any wonder then that i prize it since fortune has thought fit to bestow it upon me i have only to use it properly and i shall arrive at the gold of which it is the index jupiter bring me that scarabaeus what de bug massa id rudder not go fer trubble dat bug you mus git him for your own self hereupon legrand arose with a grave and stately air and brought me the beetle from a glass case in which it was enclosed it was a beautiful scarabaeus and at that time unknown to naturalistsof course a great prize in a scientific point of view there were two round black spots near one extremity of the back and a long one near the other the scales were exceedingly hard and glossy with all the appearance of burnished gold the weight of the insect was very remarkable and taking all things into consideration i could hardly blame jupiter for his opinion respecting it but what to make of legrands concordance with that opinion i could not for the life of me tell i sent for you said he in a grandiloquent tone when i had completed my examination of the beetle i sent for you that i might have your counsel and assistance in furthering the views of fate and of the bug my dear legrand i cried interrupting him you are certainly unwell and had better use some little precautions you shall go to bed and i will remain with you a few days until you get over this you are feverish and feel my pulse said he i felt it and to say the truth found not the slightest indication of fever but you may be ill and yet have no fever allow me this once to prescribe for you in the first place go to bed in the next you are mistaken he interposed i am as well as i can expect to be under the excitement which i suffer if you really wish me well you will relieve this excitement and how is this to be done very easily jupiter and myself are going upon an expedition into the hills upon the mainland and in this expedition we shall need the aid of some person in whom we can confide you are the only one we can trust whether we succeed or fail the excitement which you now perceive in me will be equally allayed i am anxious to oblige you in any way i replied but do you mean to say that this infernal beetle has any connection with your expedition into the hills it has then legrand i can become a party to no such absurd proceeding i am sorryvery sorryfor we shall have to try it by ourselves try it by yourselves the man is surely madbut stayhow long do you propose to be absent probably all night we shall start immediately and be back at all events by sunrise and will you promise me upon your honor that when this freak of yours is over and the bug business good god settled to your satisfaction you will then return home and follow my advice implicitly as that of your physician yes i promise and now let us be off for we have no time to lose with a heavy heart i accompanied my friend we started about four oclocklegrand jupiter the dog and myself jupiter had with him the scythe and spadesthe whole of which he insisted upon carryingmore through fear it seemed to me of trusting either of the implements within reach of his master than from any excess of industry or complaisance his demeanor was dogged in the extreme and dat deuced bug were the sole words which escaped his lips during the journey for my own part i had charge of a couple of dark lanterns while legrand contented himself with the scarabaeus which he carried attached to the end of a bit of whipcord twirling it to and fro with the air of a conjurer as he went when i observed this last plain evidence of my friends aberration of mind i could scarcely refrain from tears i thought it best however to humor his fancy at least for the present or until i could adopt some more energetic measures with a chance of success in the meantime i endeavored but all in vain to sound him in regard to the object of the expedition having succeeded in inducing me to accompany him he seemed unwilling to hold conversation upon any topic of minor importance and to all my questions vouchsafed no other reply than we shall see we crossed the creek at the head of the island by means of a skiff and ascending the high grounds on the shore of the mainland proceeded in a northwesterly direction through a tract of country excessively wild and desolate where no trace of a human footstep was to be seen legrand led the way with decision pausing only for an instant here and there to consult what appeared to be certain landmarks of his own contrivance upon a former occasion in this manner we journeyed for about two hours and the sun was just setting when we entered a region infinitely more dreary than any yet seen it was a species of tableland near the summit of an almost inaccessible hill densely wooded from base to pinnacle and interspersed with huge crags that appeared to lie loosely upon the soil and in many cases were prevented from precipitating themselves into the valleys below merely by the support of the trees against which they reclined deep ravines in various directions gave an air of still sterner solemnity to the scene the natural platform to which we had clambered was thickly overgrown with brambles through which we soon discovered that it would have been impossible to force our way but for the scythe and jupiter by direction of his master proceeded to clear for us a path to the foot of an enormously tall tuliptree which stood with some eight or ten oaks upon the level and far surpassed them all and all other trees which i had then ever seen in the beauty of its foliage and form in the wide spread of its branches and in the general majesty of its appearance when we reached this tree legrand turned to jupiter and asked him if he thought he could climb it the old man seemed a little staggered by the question and for some moments made no reply at length he approached the huge trunk walked slowly around it and examined it with minute attention when he had completed his scrutiny he merely said yes massa jup climb any tree he ebber see in he life then up with you as soon as possible for it will soon be too dark to see what we are about how far mus go up massa inquired jupiter get up the main trunk first and then i will tell you which way to goand herestop take this beetle with you de bug massa willde goolebug cried the negro drawing back in dismaywhat for mus tote de bug way up de treedn if i do if you are afraid jup a great big negro like you to take hold of a harmless little dead beetle why you can carry it up by this string but if you do not take it up with you in some way i shall be under the necessity of breaking your head with this shovel what de matter now massa said jup evidently shamed into compliance always want for to raise fuss wid old nigger was only funnin anyhow me feered de bug what i keer for de bug here he took cautiously hold of the extreme end of the string and maintaining the insect as far from his person as circumstances would permit prepared to ascend the tree in youth the tuliptree or liriodendron tulipiferum the most magnificent of american foresters has a trunk peculiarly smooth and often rises to a great height without lateral branches but in its riper age the bark becomes gnarled and uneven while many short limbs make their appearance on the stem thus the difficulty of ascension in the present case lay more in semblance than in reality embracing the huge cylinder as closely as possible with his arms and knees seizing with his hands some projections and resting his naked toes upon others jupiter after one or two narrow escapes from falling at length wriggled himself into the first great fork and seemed to consider the whole business as virtually accomplished the risk of the achievement was in fact now over although the climber was some sixty or seventy feet from the ground which way mus go now massa will he asked keep up the largest branchthe one on this side said legrand the negro obeyed him promptly and apparently with but little trouble ascending higher and higher until no glimpse of his squat figure could be obtained through the dense foliage which enveloped it presently his voice was heard in a sort of halloo how much fudder is got to go how high up are you asked legrand ebber so fur replied the negro can see de sky fru de top ob de tree never mind the sky but attend to what i say look down the trunk and count the limbs below you on this side how many limbs have you passed one two tree four fibei done pass fibe big limb massa pon dis side then go one limb higher in a few minutes the voice was heard again announcing that the seventh limb was attained now jup cried legrand evidently much excited i want you to work your way out upon that limb as far as you can if you see anything strange let me know by this time what little doubt i might have entertained of my poor friends insanity was put finally at rest i had no alternative but to conclude him stricken with lunacy and i became seriously anxious about getting him home while i was pondering upon what was best to be done jupiters voice was again heard mos feered for to venture pon dis limb berry fartis dead limb putty much all de way did you say it was a dead limb jupiter cried legrand in a quavering voice yes massa him dead as de doornaildone up for sartain done departed dis here life what in the name of heaven shall i do asked legrand seemingly in the greatest distress do said i glad of an opportunity to interpose a word why come home and go to bed come nowthats a fine fellow its getting late and besides you remember your promise jupiter cried he without heeding me in the least do you hear me yes massa will hear you ebber so plain try the wood well then with your knife and see if you think it very rotten him rotten massa sure nuff replied the negro in a few moments but not so berry rotten as mought be mought venture out leetle way pon de limb by myself dats true by yourselfwhat do you mean why i mean de bug tis berry hebby bug spose i drop him down fuss an den de limb wont break wid just de weight of one nigger you infernal scoundrel cried legrand apparently much relieved what do you mean by telling me such nonsense as that as sure as you drop that beetle ill break your neck look here jupiter do you hear me yes massa neednt hollo at poor nigger dat style well now listenif you will venture out on the limb as far as you think safe and not let go the beetle ill make you a present of a silver dollar as soon as you get down im gwine massa willdeed i is replied the negro very promptlymos out to the eend now out to the end here fairly screamed legrand do you say you are out to the end of that limb soon be to de eend massaoooooh lorgolamarcy what is dis here pon de tree well cried legrand highly delighted what is it why taint noffin but a skullsomebody bin left him head up de tree and de crows done gobble ebery bit ob de meat off a skull you sayvery wellhow is it fastened to the limb what holds it on sure nuff massa mus look why dis berry curous sarcumstance pon my worddares a great big nail in de skull what fastens ob it on to de tree well now jupiter do exactly as i tell youdo you hear yes massa pay attention thenfind the left eye of the skull hum hoo dats good why dey aint no eye lef at all curse your stupidity do you know your right hand from your left yes i knows datknows all about dattis my lef hand what i chops de wood wid to be sure you are lefthanded and your left eye is on the same side as your left hand now i suppose you can find the left eye of the skull or the place where the left eye has been have you found it here was a long pause at length the negro asked is de lef eye of de skull pon de same side as de lef hand ob de skull toocause de skull aint got not a bit ob a hand at allnebber mind i got de lef eye nowhere de lef eye what mus do wid it let the beetle drop through it as far as the string will reach but be careful and not let go your hold of the string all dat done massa will mighty easy ting for to put de bug fru de holelook out for him dare below during this colloquy no portion of jupiters person could be seen but the beetle which he had suffered to descend was now visible at the end of the string and glistened like a globe of burnished gold in the last rays of the setting sun some of which still faintly illumined the eminence upon which we stood the scarabaeus hung quite clear of any branches and if allowed to fall would have fallen at our feet legrand immediately took the scythe and cleared with it a circular space three or four yards in diameter just beneath the insect and having accomplished this ordered jupiter to let go the string and come down from the tree driving a peg with great nicety into the ground at the precise spot where the beetle fell my friend now produced from his pocket a tapemeasure fastening one end of this at that point of the trunk of the tree which was nearest the peg he unrolled it till it reached the peg and thence further unrolled it in the direction already established by the two points of the tree and the peg for the distance of fifty feetjupiter clearing away the brambles with the scythe at the spot thus attained a second peg was driven and about this as a center a rude circle about four feet in diameter described taking now a spade himself and giving one to jupiter and one to me legrand begged us to set about digging as quickly as possible to speak the truth i had no especial relish for such amusement at any time and at that particular moment would most willingly have declined it for the night was coming on and i felt much fatigued with the exercise already taken but i saw no mode of escape and was fearful of disturbing my poor friends equanimity by a refusal could i have depended indeed upon jupiters aid i would have had no hesitation in attempting to get the lunatic home by force but i was too well assured of the old negros disposition to hope that he would assist me under any circumstances in a personal contest with his master i made no doubt that the latter had been infected with some of the innumerable southern superstitions about money buried and that his phantasy had received confirmation by the finding of the scarabaeus or perhaps by jupiters obstinacy in maintaining it to be a bug of real gold a mind disposed to lunacy would readily be led away by such suggestionsespecially if chiming in with favorite preconceived ideasand then i called to mind the poor fellows speech about the beetles being the index of his fortune upon the whole i was sadly vexed and puzzled but at length i concluded to make a virtue of necessityto dig with a good will and thus the sooner to convince the visionary by ocular demonstration of the fallacy of the opinion he entertained the lanterns having been lit we all fell to work with a zeal worthy of a more rational cause and as the glare fell upon our persons and implements i could not help thinking how picturesque a group we composed and how strange and suspicious our labors must have appeared to any interloper who by chance might have stumbled upon our whereabouts we dug very steadily for two hours little was said and our chief embarrassment lay in the yelpings of the dog who took exceeding interest in our proceedings he at length became so obstreperous that we grew fearful of his giving the alarm to some stragglers in the vicinityor rather this was the apprehension of legrandfor myself i should have rejoiced at any interruption which might have enabled me to get the wanderer home the noise was at length very effectually silenced by jupiter who getting out of the hole with a dogged air of deliberation tied the brutes mouth up with one of his suspenders and then returned with a grave chuckle to his task when the time mentioned had expired we had reached a depth of five feet and yet no signs of any treasure became manifest a general pause ensued and i began to hope that the farce was at an end legrand however although evidently much disconcerted wiped his brow thoughtfully and recommenced we had excavated the entire circle of four feet diameter and now we slightly enlarged the limit and went to the farther depth of two feet still nothing appeared the goldseeker whom i sincerely pitied at length clambered from the pit with the bitterest disappointment imprinted upon every feature and proceeded slowly and reluctantly to put on his coat which he had thrown off at the beginning of his labor in the meantime i made no remark jupiter at a signal from his master began to gather up his tools this done and the dog having been unmuzzled we turned in profound silence toward home we had taken perhaps a dozen steps in this direction when with a loud oath legrand strode up to jupiter and seized him by the collar the astonished negro opened his eyes and mouth to the fullest extent let fall the spades and fell upon his knees you scoundrel said legrand hissing out the syllables from between his clenched teethyou infernal black villainspeak i tell youanswer me this instant without prevaricationwhich which is your left eye oh my golly massa will aint dis here my lef eye for sartain roared the terrified jupiter placing his hand upon his right organ of vision and holding it there with a desperate pertinacity as if in immediate dread of his masters attempt at a gouge i thought soi knew it hurrah vociferated legrand letting the negro go and executing a series of curvets and caracols much to the astonishment of his valet who arising from his knees looked mutely from his master to myself and then from myself to his master come we must go back said the latter the games not up yet and he again led the way to the tuliptree jupiter said he when we reached its foot come here was the skull nailed to the limb with the face outward or with the face to the limb de face was out massa so dat de crows could get at de eyes good widout any trouble well then was it this eye or that through which you dropped the beetle here legrand touched each of jupiters eyes twas dis eye massa de lef eyejis as you tell me and here it was his right eye that the negro indicated that will dowe must try it again here my friend about whose madness i now saw or fancied that i saw certain indications of method removed the peg which marked the spot where the beetle fell to a spot about three inches to the westward of its former position taking now the tapemeasure from the nearest point of the trunk to the peg as before and continuing the extension in a straight line to the distance of fifty feet a spot was indicated removed by several yards from the point at which we had been digging around the new position a circle somewhat larger than in the former instance was now described and we again set to work with the spade i was dreadfully weary but scarcely understanding what had occasioned the change in my thoughts i felt no longer any great aversion from the labor imposed i had become most unaccountably interestednay even excited perhaps there was something amid all the extravagant demeanor of legrandsome air of forethought or of deliberation which impressed me i dug eagerly and now and then caught myself actually looking with something that very much resembled expectation for the fancied treasure the vision of which had demented my unfortunate companion at a period when such vagaries of thought most fully possessed me and when we had been at work perhaps an hour and a half we were again interrupted by the violent howlings of the dog his uneasiness in the first instance had been evidently but the result of playfulness or caprice but he now assumed a bitter and serious tone upon jupiters again attempting to muzzle him he made furious resistance and leaping into the hole tore up the mould frantically with his claws in a few seconds he had uncovered a mass of human bones forming two complete skeletons intermingled with several buttons of metal and what appeared to be the dust of decayed woolen one or two strokes of a spade upturned the blade of a large spanish knife and as we dug farther three or four loose pieces of gold and silver coin came to light at sight of these the joy of jupiter could scarcely be restrained but the countenance of his master wore an air of extreme disappointment he urged us however to continue our exertions and the words were hardly uttered when i stumbled and fell forward having caught the toe of my boot in a large ring of iron that lay half buried in the loose earth we now worked in earnest and never did i pass ten minutes of more intense excitement during this interval we had fairly unearthed an oblong chest of wood which from its perfect preservation and wonderful hardness had plainly been subjected to some mineralizing processperhaps that of the bichloride of mercury this box was three feet and a half long three feet broad and two and a half feet deep it was firmly secured by bands of wrought iron riveted and forming a kind of open trelliswork over the whole on each side of the chest near the top were three rings of ironsix in allby means of which a firm hold could be obtained by six persons our utmost united endeavors served only to disturb the coffer very slightly in its bed we at once saw the impossibility of removing so great a weight luckily the sole fastenings of the lid consisted of two sliding bolts these we drew backtrembling and panting with anxiety in an instant a treasure of incalculable value lay gleaming before us as the rays of the lanterns fell within the pit there flashed upward a glow and a glare from a confused heap of gold and of jewels that absolutely dazzled our eyes i shall not pretend to describe the feelings with which i gazed amazement was of course predominant legrand appeared exhausted with excitement and spoke very few words jupiters countenance wore for some minutes as deadly a pallor as it is possible in the nature of things for any negros visage to assume he seemed stupefiedthunderstricken presently he fell upon his knees in the pit and burying his naked arms up to the elbows in gold let them there remain as if enjoying the luxury of a bath at length with a deep sigh he exclaimed as if in a soliloquy and dis all cum ob de goolebug de putty goolebug the poor little goolebug what i boosed in dat sabage kind ob style aint you shamed ob yourself niggeranswer me dat it became necessary at last that i should arouse both master and valet to the expediency of removing the treasure it was growing late and it behooved us to make exertion that we might get everything housed before daylight it was difficult to say what should be done and much time was spent in deliberationso confused were the ideas of all we finally lightened the box by removing two thirds of its contents when we were enabled with some trouble to raise it from the hole the articles taken out were deposited among the brambles and the dog left to guard them with strict orders from jupiter neither upon any pretense to stir from the spot nor to open his mouth until our return we then hurriedly made for home with the chest reaching the hut in safety but after excessive toil at one oclock in the morning worn out as we were it was not in human nature to do more immediately we rested until two and had supper starting for the hills immediately afterwards armed with three stout sacks which by good luck were upon the premises a little before four we arrived at the pit divided the remainder of the booty as equally as might be among us and leaving the holes unfilled again set out for the hut at which for the second time we deposited our golden burthens just as the first faint streaks of the dawn gleamed from over the treetops in the east we were now thoroughly broken down but the intense excitement of the time denied us repose after an unquiet slumber of some three or four hours duration we arose as if by preconcert to make examination of our treasure the chest had been full to the brim and we spent the whole day and the greater part of the next night in a scrutiny of its contents there had been nothing like order or arrangement every thing had been heaped in promiscuously having assorted all with care we found ourselves possessed of even vaster wealth than we had at first supposed in coin there was rather more than four hundred and fifty thousand dollarsestimating the value of the pieces as accurately as we could by the tables of the period there was not a particle of silver all was gold of antique date and of great varietyfrench spanish and german money with a few english guineas and some counters of which we had never seen specimens before there were several very large and heavy coins so worn that we could make nothing of their inscriptions there was no american money the value of the jewels we found more difficulty in estimating there were diamondssome of them exceedingly large and finea hundred and ten in all and not one of them small eighteen rubies of remarkable brilliancythree hundred and ten emeralds all very beautiful and twentyone sapphires with an opal these stones had all been broken from their settings and thrown loose in the chest the settings themselves which we picked out from among the other gold appeared to have been beaten up with hammers as if to prevent identification besides all this there was a vast quantity of solid gold ornaments nearly two hundred massive finger and earrings rich chainsthirty of these if i remember eightythree very large and heavy crucifixes five gold censers of great value a prodigious golden punchbowl ornamented with richly chased vineleaves and bacchanalian figures with two sword handles exquisitely embossed and many other smaller articles which i cannot recollect the weight of these valuables exceeded three hundred and fifty pounds avoirdupois and in this estimate i have not included one hundred and ninetyseven superb gold watches three of the number being worth each five hundred dollars if one many of them were very old and as timekeepers valueless the works having suffered more or less from corrosionbut all were richly jeweled and in cases of great worth we estimated the entire contents of the chest that night at a million and a half of dollars and upon the subsequent disposal of the trinkets and jewels a few being retained for our own use it was found that we had greatly undervalued the treasure when at length we had concluded our examination and the intense excitement of the time had in some measure subsided legrand who saw that i was dying with impatience for a solution of this most extraordinary riddle entered into a full detail of all the circumstances connected with it you remember said he the night when i handed you the rough sketch i had made of the scarabaeus you recollect also that i became quite vexed at you for insisting that my drawing resembled a deathshead when you first made this assertion i thought you were jesting but afterwards i called to mind the peculiar spots on the back of the insect and admitted to myself that your remark had some little foundation in fact still the sneer at my graphic powers irritated mefor i am considered a good artistand therefore when you handed me the scrap of parchment i was about to crumple it up and throw it angrily into the fire the scrap of paper you mean said i no it had much of the appearance of paper and at first i supposed it to be such but when i came to draw upon it i discovered it at once to be a piece of very thin parchment it was quite dirty you remember well as i was in the very act of crumpling it up my glance fell upon the sketch at which you had been looking and you may imagine my astonishment when i perceived in fact the figure of a deathshead just where it seemed to me i had made the drawing of the beetle for a moment i was too much amazed to think with accuracy i knew that my design was very different in detail from thisalthough there was a certain similarity in general outline presently i took a candle and seating myself at the other end of the room proceeded to scrutinize the parchment more closely upon turning it over i saw my own sketch upon the reverse just as i had made it my first idea now was mere surprise at the really remarkable similarity of outlineat the singular coincidence involved in the fact that unknown to me there should have been a skull upon the other side of the parchment immediately beneath my figure of the scarabaeus and that this skull not only in outline but in size should so closely resemble my drawing i say the singularity of this coincidence absolutely stupefied me for a time this is the usual effect of such coincidences the mind struggles to establish a connectiona sequence of cause and effectand being unable to do so suffers a species of temporary paralysis but when i recovered from this stupor there dawned upon me gradually a conviction which startled me even far more than the coincidence i began distinctly positively to remember that there had been no drawing upon the parchment when i made my sketch of the scarabaeus i became perfectly certain of this for i recollected turning up first one side and then the other in search of the cleanest spot had the skull been then there of course i could not have failed to notice it here was indeed a mystery which i felt it impossible to explain but even at that early moment there seemed to glimmer faintly within the most remote and secret chambers of my intellect a glowwormlike conception of that truth which last nights adventure brought to so magnificent a demonstration i arose at once and putting the parchment securely away dismissed all further reflection until i should be alone when you had gone and when jupiter was fast asleep i betook myself to a more methodical investigation of the affair in the first place i considered the manner in which the parchment had come into my possession the spot where we discovered the scarabaeus was on the coast of the mainland about a mile eastward of the island and but a short distance above highwater mark upon my taking hold of it it gave me a sharp bite which caused me to let it drop jupiter with his accustomed caution before seizing the insect which had flown toward him looked about him for a leaf or something of that nature by which to take hold of it it was at this moment that his eyes and mine also fell upon the scrap of parchment which i then supposed to be a paper it was lying half buried in the sand a corner sticking up near the spot where we found it i observed the remnants of the hull of what appeared to have been a ships longboat the wreck seemed to have been there for a very great while for the resemblance to boat timbers could scarcely be traced well jupiter picked up the parchment wrapped the beetle in it and gave it to me soon afterward we turned to go home and on the way met lieutenant g i showed him the insect and he begged me to let him take it to the fort upon my consenting he thrust it forthwith into his waistcoat pocket without the parchment in which it had been wrapped and which i had continued to hold in my hand during his inspection perhaps he dreaded my changing my mind and thought it best to make sure of the prize at onceyou know how enthusiastic he is on all subjects connected with natural history at the same time without being conscious of it i must have deposited the parchment in my own pocket you remember that when i went to the table for the purpose of making a sketch of the beetle i found no paper where it was usually kept i looked in the drawer and found none there i searched my pockets hoping to find an old letter when my hand fell upon the parchment i thus detail the precise mode in which it came into my possession for the circumstances impressed me with peculiar force no doubt you will think me fancifulbut i had already established a kind of connection i had put together two links of a great chain there was a boat lying upon a seacoast and not far from the boat was a parchmentnot a paperwith a skull depicted upon it you will of course ask where is the connection i reply that the skull or deathshead is the wellknown emblem of the pirate the flag of the deathshead is hoisted in all engagements i have said that the scrap was parchment and not paper parchment is durablealmost imperishable matters of little moment are rarely consigned to parchment since for the mere ordinary purposes of drawing or writing it is not nearly so well adapted as paper this reflection suggested some meaningsome relevancyin the deathshead i did not fail to observe also the form of the parchment although one of its corners had been by some accident destroyed it could be seen that the original form was oblong it was just such a slip indeed as might have been chosen for a memorandumfor a record of something to be long remembered and carefully preserved but i interposed you say that the skull was not upon the parchment when you made the drawing of the beetle how then do you trace any connection between the boat and the skullsince this latter according to your own admission must have been designed god only knows how or by whom at some period subsequent to your sketching the scarabaeus ah hereupon turns the whole mystery although the secret at this point i had comparatively little difficulty in solving my steps were sure and could afford but a single result i reasoned for example thus when i drew the scarabaeus there was no skull apparent upon the parchment when i had completed the drawing i gave it to you and observed you narrowly until you returned it you therefore did not design the skull and no one else was present to do it then it was not done by human agency and nevertheless it was done at this stage of my reflections i endeavored to remember and did remember with entire distinctness every incident which occurred about the period in question the weather was chilly oh rare and happy accident and a fire was blazing upon the hearth i was heated with exercise and sat near the table you however had drawn a chair close to the chimney just as i placed the parchment in your hand and as you were in the act of inspecting it wolf the newfoundland entered and leaped upon your shoulders with your left hand you caressed him and kept him off while your right holding the parchment was permitted to fall listlessly between your knees and in close proximity to the fire at one moment i thought the blaze had caught it and was about to caution you but before i could speak you had withdrawn it and were engaged in its examination when i considered all these particulars i doubted not for a moment that heat had been the agent in bringing to light upon the parchment the skull which i saw designed upon it you are well aware that chemical preparations exist and have existed time out of mind by means of which it is possible to write upon either paper or vellum so that the characters shall become visible only when subjected to the action of fire zaffre digested in aqua regia and diluted with four times its weight of water is sometimes employed a green tint results the regulus of cobalt dissolved in spirit of nitre gives a red these colors disappear at longer or shorter intervals after the material written upon cools but again become apparent upon the reapplication of heat i now scrutinized the deathshead with care its outer edges the edges of the drawing nearest the edge of the vellumwere far more distinct than the others it was clear that the action of the caloric had been imperfect or unequal i immediately kindled a fire and subjected every portion of the parchment to a glowing heat at first the only effect was the strengthening of the faint lines in the skull but upon persevering in the experiment there became visible at the corner of the slip diagonally opposite to the spot in which the deathshead was delineated the figure of what i at first supposed to be a goat a closer scrutiny however satisfied me that it was intended for a kid ha ha said i to be sure i have no right to laugh at youa million and a half of money is too serious a matter for mirthbut you are not about to establish a third link in your chainyou will not find any especial connection between your pirates and a goat pirates you know have nothing to do with goats they appertain to the farming interest but i have just said that the figure was not that of a goat well a kid thenpretty much the same thing pretty much but not altogether said legrand you may have heard of one captain kidd i at once looked upon the figure of the animal as a kind of punning or hieroglyphical signature i say signature because its position upon the vellum suggested this idea the deathshead at the corner diagonally opposite had in the same manner the air of a stamp or seal but i was sorely put out by the absence of all elseof the body to my imagined instrumentof the text for my context i presume you expected to find a letter between the stamp and the signature something of that kind the fact is i felt irresistibly impressed with a presentiment of some vast good fortune impending i can scarcely say why perhaps after all it was rather a desire than an actual beliefbut do you know that jupiters silly words about the bug being of solid gold had a remarkable effect upon my fancy and then the series of accidents and coincidencesthese were so very extraordinary do you observe how mere an accident it was that these events should have occurred upon the sole day of all the year in which it has been or may be sufficiently cool for fire and that without the fire or without the intervention of the dog at the precise moment in which he appeared i should never have become aware of the deathshead and so never the possessor of the treasure but proceedi am all impatience well you have heard of course the many stories currentthe thousand vague rumors afloat about money buried somewhere upon the atlantic coast by kidd and his associates these rumors must have had some foundation in fact and that the rumors have existed so long and so continuously could have resulted it appeared to me only from the circumstance of the buried treasures still remaining entombed had kidd concealed his plunder for a time and afterward reclaimed it the rumors would scarcely have reached us in their present unvarying form you will observe that the stories told are all about moneyseekers not about moneyfinders had the pirate recovered his money there the affair would have dropped it seemed to me that some accidentsay the loss of a memorandum indicating its localityhad deprived him of the means of recovering it and that this accident had become known to his followers who otherwise might never have heard that the treasure had been concealed at all and who busying themselves in vain because unguided attempts to regain it had given first birth and then universal currency to the reports which are now so common have you ever heard of any important treasure being unearthed along the coast never but that kidds accumulations were immense is well known i took it for granted therefore that the earth still held them and you will scarcely be surprised when i tell you that i felt a hope nearly amounting to certainty that the parchment so strangely found involved a lost record of the place of deposit but how did you proceed i held the vellum again to the fire after increasing the heat but nothing appeared i now thought it possible that the coating of dirt might have something to do with the failure so i carefully rinsed the parchment by pouring warm water over it and having done this i placed it in a tin pan with the skull downward and put the pan upon a furnace of lighted charcoal in a few minutes the pan having become thoroughly heated i removed the slip and to my inexpressible joy found it spotted in several places with what appeared to be figures arranged in lines again i placed it in the pan and suffered it to remain another minute upon taking it off the whole was just as you see it now here legrand having reheated the parchment submitted it to my inspection the following characters were rudely traced in a red tint between the deathshead and the goat but said i returning him the slip i am as much in the dark as ever were all the jewels of golconda awaiting me upon my solution of this enigma i am quite sure that i should be unable to earn them and yet said legrand the solution is by no means so difficult as you might be led to imagine from the first hasty inspection of the characters these characters as any one might readily guess form a cipherthat is to say they convey a meaning but then from what is known of kidd i could not suppose him capable of constructing any of the more abstruse cryptographs i made up my mind at once that this was of a simple speciessuch however as would appear to the crude intellect of the sailor absolutely insoluble without the key and you really solved it readily i have solved others of an abstruseness ten thousand times greater circumstances and a certain bias of mind have led me to take interest in such riddles and it may well be doubted whether human ingenuity can construct an enigma of the kind which human ingenuity may not by proper application resolve in fact having once established connected and legible characters i scarcely gave a thought to the mere difficulty of developing their import in the present caseindeed in all cases of secret writingthe first question regards the language of the cipher for the principles of solution so far especially as the more simple ciphers are concerned depend upon and are varied by the genius of the particular idiom in general there is no alternative but experiment directed by probabilities of every tongue known to him who attempts the solution until the true one be attained but with the cipher now before us all difficulty was removed by the signature the pun upon the word kidd is appreciable in no other language than the english but for this consideration i should have begun my attempts with the spanish and french as the tongues in which a secret of this kind would most naturally have been written by a pirate of the spanish main as it was i assumed the cryptograph to be english you observe there are no divisions between the words had there been divisions the task would have been comparatively easy in such cases i should have commenced with a collation and analysis of the shorter words and had a word of a single letter occurred as is most likely a or i for example i should have considered the solution as assured but there being no division my first step was to ascertain the predominant letters as well as the least frequent counting all i constructed a table thus of the character there are of the character there are now in english the letter which most frequently occurs is e afterward the succession runs thus aoidhnrstuycfglmwbkpqxz e predominates so remarkably that an individual sentence of any length is rarely seen in which it is not the prevailing character here then we have in the very beginning the groundwork for something more than a mere guess the general use which may be made of the table is obviousbut in this particular cipher we shall only very partially require its aid as our predominant character is we will commence by assuming it as the e of the natural alphabet to verify the supposition let us observe if the be seen often in couplesfor e is doubled with great frequency in englishin such words for example as meet fleet speed seen been agree etc in the present instance we see it doubled no less than five times although the cryptograph is brief let us assume then as e now of all words in the language the is most usual let us see therefore whether there are not repetitions of any three characters in the same order of collocation the last of them being if we discover repetitions of such letters so arranged they will most probably represent the word the upon inspection we find no less than seven such arrangements the characters being we may therefore assume that represents t represents h and represents ethe last being now well confirmed thus a great step has been taken but having established a single word we are enabled to establish a vastly important point that is to say several commencements and terminations of other words let us refer for example to the last instance but one in which the combination occursnot far from the end of the cipher we know that the immediately ensuing is the commencement of a word and of the six characters succeeding this the we are cognizant of no less than five let us set these characters down thus by the letters we know them to represent leaving a space for the unknown t eeth here we are enabled at once to discard the th as forming no portion of the word commencing with the first t since by experiment of the entire alphabet for a letter adapted to the vacancy we perceive that no word can be formed of which this th can be a part we are thus narrowed into t ee and going through the alphabet if necessary as before we arrive at the word tree as the sole possible reading we thus gain another letter r represented by with the words the tree in juxtaposition looking beyond these words for a short distance we again see the combination and employ it by way of termination to what immediately precedes we have thus this arrangement the tree the or substituting the natural letters where known it reads thus the tree thrh the now if in place of the unknown characters we leave blank spaces or substitute dots we read thus the tree thr h the when the word through makes itself evident at once but this discovery gives us three new letters o u and g represented by and looking now narrowly through the cipher for combinations of known characters we find not very far from the beginning this arrangement or egree which plainly is the conclusion of the word degree and gives us another letter d represented by four letters beyond the word degree we perceive the combination translating the known characters and representing the unknown by dots as before we read thus thrtee an arrangement immediately suggestive of the word thirteen and again furnishing us with two new characters i and n represented by and referring now to the beginning of the cryptograph we find the combination translating as before we obtain good which assures us that the first letter is a and that the first two words are a good it is now time that we arrange our key as far as discovered in a tabular form to avoid confusion it will stand thus represents a d e g h i n o r t we have therefore no less than eleven of the most important letters represented and it will be unnecessary to proceed with the details of the solution i have said enough to convince you that ciphers of this nature are readily soluble and to give you some insight into the rationale of their development but be assured that the specimen before us appertains to the very simplest species of cryptograph it now only remains to give you the full translation of the characters upon the parchment as unriddled here it is a good glass in the bishops hostel in the devils seat fortyone degrees and thirteen minutes northeast and by north main branch seventh limb east side shoot from the left eye of the deathshead a beeline from the tree through the shot fifty feet out but said i the enigma seems still in as bad a condition as ever how is it possible to extort a meaning from all this jargon about devils seats deathsheads and bishops hostels i confess replied legrand that the matter still wears a serious aspect when regarded with a casual glance my first endeavor was to divide the sentence into the natural division intended by the cryptographist you mean to punctuate it something of that kind but how was it possible to effect this i reflected that it had been a point with the writer to run his words together without division so as to increase the difficulty of solution now a not overacute man in pursuing such an object would be nearly certain to overdo the matter when in the course of his composition he arrived at a break in his subject which would naturally require a pause or a point he would be exceedingly apt to run his characters at this place more than usually close together if you will observe the ms in the present instance you will easily detect five such cases of unusual crowding acting upon this hint i made the division thus a good glass in the bishops hostel in the devils seatfortyone degrees and thirteen minutesnortheast and by north main branch seventh limb east sideshoot from the left eye of the deathsheada beeline from the tree through the shot fifty feet out even this division said i leaves me still in the dark it left me also in the dark replied legrand for a few days during which i made diligent inquiry in the neighborhood of sullivans island for any building which went by the name of the bishops hotel for of course i dropped the obsolete word hostel gaining no information on the subject i was on the point of extending my sphere of search and proceeding in a more systematic manner when one morning it entered into my head quite suddenly that this bishops hostel might have some reference to an old family of the name of bessop which time out of mind had held possession of an ancient manorhouse about four miles to the northward of the island i accordingly went over to the plantation and reinstituted my inquiries among the older negroes of the place at length one of the most aged of the women said that she had heard of such a place as bessops castle and thought that she could guide me to it but that it was not a castle nor a tavern but a high rock i offered to pay her well for her trouble and after some demur she consented to accompany me to the spot we found it without much difficulty when dismissing her i proceeded to examine the place the castle consisted of an irregular assemblage of cliffs and rocksone of the latter being quite remarkable for its height as well as for its insulated and artificial appearance i clambered to its apex and then felt much at a loss as to what should be next done while i was busied in reflection my eyes fell upon a narrow ledge in the eastern face of the rock perhaps a yard below the summit upon which i stood this ledge projected about eighteen inches and was not more than a foot wide while a niche in the cliff just above it gave it a rude resemblance to one of the hollowbacked chairs used by our ancestors i made no doubt that here was the devilsseat alluded to in the ms and now i seemed to grasp the full secret of the riddle the good glass i knew could have reference to nothing but a telescope for the word glass is rarely employed in any other sense by seamen now here i at once saw was a telescope to be used and a definite point of view admitting no variation from which to use it nor did i hesitate to believe that the phrases fortyone degrees and thirteen minutes and northeast and by north were intended as directions for the leveling of the glass greatly excited by these discoveries i hurried home procured a telescope and returned to the rock i let myself down to the ledge and found that it was impossible to retain a seat upon it except in one particular position this fact confirmed my preconceived idea i proceeded to use the glass of course the fortyone degrees and thirteen minutes could allude to nothing but elevation above the visible horizon since the horizontal direction was clearly indicated by the words northeast and by north this latter direction i at once established by means of a pocketcompass then pointing the glass as nearly at an angle of fortyone degrees of elevation as i could do it by guess i moved it cautiously up or down until my attention was arrested by a circular rift or opening in the foliage of a large tree that overtopped its fellows in the distance in the centre of this rift i perceived a white spot but could not at first distinguish what it was adjusting the focus of the telescope i again looked and now made it out to be a human skull upon this discovery i was so sanguine as to consider the enigma solved for the phrase main branch seventh limb east side could refer only to the position of the skull upon the tree while shoot from the left eye of the deathshead admitted also of but one interpretation in regard to a search for buried treasure i perceived that the design was to drop a bullet from the left eye of the skull and that a beeline or in other words a straight line drawn from the nearest point of the trunk through the shot or the spot where the bullet fell and thence extended to a distance of fifty feet would indicate a definite pointand beneath this point i thought it at least possible that a deposit of value lay concealed all this i said is exceedingly clear and although ingenious still simple and explicit when you left the bishops hotel what then why having carefully taken the bearings of the tree i turned homeward the instant that i left the devilsseat however the circular rift vanished nor could i get a glimpse of it afterward turn as i would what seems to me the chief ingenuity in this whole business is the fact for repeated experiment has convinced me it is a fact that the circular opening in question is visible from no other attainable point of view than that afforded by the narrow ledge upon the face of the rock in this expedition to the bishops hotel i had been attended by jupiter who had no doubt observed for some weeks past the abstraction of my demeanor and took especial care not to leave me alone but on the next day getting up very early i contrived to give him the slip and went into the hills in search of the tree after much toil i found it when i came home at night my valet proposed to give me a flogging with the rest of the adventure i believe you are as well acquainted as myself i suppose said i you missed the spot in the first attempt at digging through jupiters stupidity in letting the bug fall through the right instead of through the left eye of the skull precisely this mistake made a difference of about two inches and a half in the shotthat is to say in the position of the peg nearest the tree and had the treasure been beneath the shot the error would have been of little moment but the shot together with the nearest point of the tree were merely two points for the establishment of a line of direction of course the error however trivial in the beginning increased as we proceeded with the line and by the time we had gone fifty feet threw us quite off the scent but for my deepseated impressions that treasure was here somewhere actually buried we might have had all our labor in vain but your grandiloquence and your conduct in swinging the beetlehow excessively odd i was sure you were mad and why did you insist upon letting fall the bug instead of a bullet from the skull why to be frank i felt somewhat annoyed by your evident suspicions touching my sanity and so resolved to punish you quietly in my own way by a little bit of sober mystification for this reason i swung the beetle and for this reason i let it fall from the tree an observation of yours about its great weight suggested the latter idea yes i perceive and now there is only one point which puzzles me what are we to make of the skeletons found in the hole that is a question i am no more able to answer than yourself there seems however only one plausible way of accounting for themand yet it is dreadful to believe in such atrocity as my suggestion would imply it is clear that kiddif kidd indeed secreted this treasure which i doubt notit is clear that he must have had assistance in the labor but this labor concluded he may have thought it expedient to remove all participants in his secret perhaps a couple of blows with a mattock were sufficient while his coadjutors were busy in the pit perhaps it required a dozenwho shall tell imagining edgar allan poe by

the anonymous drunk in the black cat the man in the pit and the pendulum watching helplessly as the walls of the inquisitions prison close in on him the heart pounding loudly beneath the floorboards where the narrator has buried his victim in the telltale heart but terror isnt all that lies in poes stories theres the blood that drenches people theres love and a heartbreaking sense of loss especially in poems like the raven or annabel lee and theres the analytical critical mind at work in the dupin stories the goldbug and the thoughtful literary essays such a varied sensibility combined with poes turbulent biography makes it understandable that artists as different as toni morrison and dominick argento have tried to come to grips with him every reader has his or her own take on the poet some colored by his stormy life some by his work andrew taylors the american boy shows an inquisitive boy the poe who excelled as a student at stoke newington the english prep school where he studied for five years for taylor poe is a detective manqué as if dupin emerged from the writers own experiences taylor s poe is a quickwitted attractive youth whose presence in the novel helps

bayards poetic voice is shaped by an unfortunate love affair with the daughter of the points doctor the madness of the doctors whole family is macabre in the extreme and the denouement in the academys icehouse is a staggering episode if poe left the point in disgrace it wasnt too seriouscadets and officers pooled their money to subscribe to his second collection of poems and hes still something of a romantic hero at west point the cadets love his poetry and apocryphal tales of his exploits are popular including the legend that he appeared on parade naked except for his sashes for toni morrison it is the issue of color and race that matters in poe in playing in the dark morrison writes no early american writer is more important to the concept of american africanism than poe and no image is more telling than the one at the end of the narrative of arthur gordon pym of nantucket the visualized but somehow unknowable white form that rises from the mists the images of the white curtain and the shrouded human figure with skin the perfect whiteness of the snow occur after the narrative has encountered blackness both are figurations of impenetrable whiteness that surface in american literature whenever an africanist presence is engaged these images of impenetrable whiteness appear almost always with representations of black or africanist people who are dead or impotent ftnref toni morrison playing in the dark quoted in richard delgado and jean stefancic eds critical white studies looking behind the mirror philadelphia temple university press pp passim poe lived a chunk of his life in the slaveholding south at one point although he wasnt wealthy he was in a position to sell a slave i might read the images of whiteness somewhat differently than morrison but not the difficult demeaning treatment of darkness i cannot bear to read poes depictions of negroes who always speak in the stereotypic language of the obsequious slave and who feel fulfilled in their service

of his young massa will of all the literary and critical responses to poeincluding the critiques of his substance abusethe one i find most compelling is argentos voyage of edgar allan poe this opera composed for the us bicentennial is an emotional account of poes voyage from philadelphia to baltimore where he died in the kind of mystery that invites conspiracy theories argento has a sort of psychological courtroom battle over poe with dupin conducting the defense and poes nemesis the critic griswold attacking poe for using the events of his own turbulent life as the basis for his creative work the staging with its insistent themes of blood the intertwining of the masque of the red death which alludes to the deaths of poes mother foster mother and bride from consumption is shocking and compelling the blooddrenched poe the racially charged poe the analytic the poeticall are aspects of this complicated writer none explains him fully when i read poe what makes his stories terrifying is a sense of helplessness i imagine him suffocatingalmost literally in the alcohol he consumed and the blood he saw his consumptive mother cough upas well as figuratively his father abandoned him his foster father never accepted him and ultimately cast him off his mother died when he was two most children blame themselves for abandonments like these and in poes fiction its the narrator who is almost always the perpetrator when evil deeds are done the black cat the education of william wilson the telltale heart the cask of amontilladoall have a narrator who is a knave or a madman in the black cat the narrator goes out of his way to explain how vile he is torturing the animals who have loved him degrading himself with drink beating his wife and finally driving an ax into her brain of course my response is as partial as bayards or argentos i cant imagine trying to make such a difficult figure the subject of a novel or a story in general im uneasy with using real figures as players in a novelhighlighting one facet means overlooking others still with poe i can understand the temptation to do so the opium the alcohol the love affairs the slave owner the gambler

weak and weary over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore while i nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping as of some one gently rapping rapping at my chamber door tis some visitor i muttered tapping at my chamber door only this and nothing more ah distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor eagerly i wished the morrowvainly i had sought to borrow from my books surcease of sorrowsorrow for the lost lenore for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore nameless for evermore and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain thrilled mefilled me with fantastic terrors never felt before so that now to still the beating of my heart i stood repeating tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door this it is and nothing more presently my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer sir said i or madam truly your forgiveness i implore but the fact is i was napping and so gently you came rapping and so faintly you came tapping tapping at my chamber door that i scarce was sure i heard youhere i opened wide the door darkness there and nothing more deep into that darkness peering long i stood there wondering fearing doubting dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before but the silence was unbroken and the stillness gave no token and the only word there spoken was the whispered word lenore this i whispered and an echo murmured back the word lenore merely this and nothing more back into the chamber turning all my soul within me burning soon again i heard a tapping something louder than before surely said i surely that is something at my window lattice let me see then what thereat is and this mystery explore let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore tis the wind and nothing more open here i flung the shutter when with many a flirt and flutter in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore not the least obeisance made he not a minute stopped or stayed he but with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door perched and sat and nothing more then the ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou i said art sure no craven ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore tell me what thy lordly name is on the nights plutonian shore quoth the raven nevermore much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly though its answer little meaninglittle relevancy bore for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door with such name as nevermore but the raven sitting lonely on that placid bust spoke only that one word as if its soul in that one word he did outpour nothing farther then he utterednot a feather then he fluttered till i scarcely more than muttered other friends have flown before on the morrow he will leave me as my hopes have flown before then the bird said nevermore startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken doubtless said i what it utters is its only stock and store caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore of nevernevermore but the raven still beguiling my sad fancy into smiling straight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door then upon the velvet sinking i betook myself to linking fancy unto fancy thinking what this ominous bird of yore what this grim ungainly ghastly gaunt and ominous bird of yore meant in croaking nevermore this i sat engaged in guessing but no syllable expressing to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosoms core this and more i sat divining with my head at ease reclining on the cushions velvet lining that the lamplight gloated oer but whose velvetviolet lining with the lamplight gloating oer she shall press ah nevermore then methought the air grew denser perfumed from an unseen censer swung by seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor wretch i cried thy god hath lent theeby these angels he hath sent thee respiterespite and nepenthe from thy memories of lenore quaff oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost lenore quoth the raven nevermore

horror hauntedtell me truly i implore is thereis there balm in gileadtell metell me i implore quoth the raven nevermore prophet said i thing of evilprophet still if bird or devil by that heaven that bends above usby that god we both adore tell this soul with sorrow laden if within the distant aidenn it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name lenore clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom

volumes id explored then my guilt it overtook me mikes insistent plea it shook me the email i should have deleted could now not be ignored i thought somehow i must comply for poe whos on a throne so high deserves much thanks from such as i and others gone before thus i set off plodding spurred by michaels gentle prodding hoping i could yet discover sentiments that soar i imagined many noble words

walsh prize for investigative journalism he lives with his wife in california a little thought on poe by thomas h cook i was once asked what oneword description of a book would most likely cause me to read it without a blink i answered haunting why because i have found to my surprise that although people will often describe a book as great they will upon further questioning be wholly unable to recall a single line or scene or even the basic plot of a book that though evidently great proved to be not in the least memorable it is just the opposite with poe whose greatness it seems to me resides in the fact that his readers actually remember him in poem after poem and story after story we remember poe we remember that when i was a child and she was a child these two children lived in a kingdom by the sea we remember the ravens bleak warning that in the end everything dissolves into the oblivion of nevermore we remember the beating of a telltale heart and the moaning and the groaning of the bells to remember a writer in this way is to be haunted by him to have his words and scenes and characters forever alive in your mind that is what true literary greatness is and it is

writing less is more and that poetry when well crafted is the most emotionally direct form of written communication richard wilbur the former poet laureate of america offered this metaphor about poetry im paraphrasing the confinement of the bottle is what gives the genie his strength his meaning is that conciseness and controlled rhythm rhyme and figure of speech create a more powerful expression than unleashed outpourings in poes work the combination of this control and his preferred themescrime passion death the dark side of the mindmake pure magic blend those two ingredients with

into the top there have been many other performers from dylan to marilyn manson to iron maiden who claimed inspiration by poe or worked references from his work into theirs oh okay ill mention one other adaptation my own musical version of poes a dream within a dream which i composed when i was in my twenties and determined to slap the wrist of a selfdelusional society inexplicably my adaptation did not make any top lists so dont bother searching for downloads on itunesor even limewire looking at this recitation of adaptations you cant help but wonder why poe appeals to so many musicians and ones of such vastly differing styles and forms i mean debussy and lou reed i think the answer is that poes work is inherently musical his storytelling is the stuff of opera which has classic beginning middle and end structures revels in crime violence the gothic passion and death and is often over the top and borders on melodrama sure but hey we dont go to the opera for subtlety as for his poemsthey uniformly display a lyricism and craft that the best most emotionally engaging songs possess whether or not its been set to music poes writing is hummable after all name another

it just wont fly excerpt from the narrative of arthur gordon pym of nantucket preface upon my return to the united states a few months ago after the extraordinary series of adventures in the south seas and elsewhere of which an account is given in the following pages accident threw me into the society of several gentlemen in richmond va who felt deep interest in all matters relating to the regions i had visited and who were constantly urging it upon me as a duty to give my narrative to the public i had several reasons however for declining to do so some of which were of a nature altogether private and concern no person but myself others not so much so one consideration which deterred me was that having kept no journal during a greater portion of the time in which i was absent i feared i should not be able to write from mere memory a statement so minute and connected as to have the appearance of that truth it would really possess barring only the natural and unavoidable exaggeration to which all of us are prone when detailing events which have had a powerful influence in exciting the imaginative faculties another reason was that the incidents to be narrated were of a nature so positively marvellous that unsupported as my assertions must necessarily be except by the evidence of a single individual and he a halfbreed indian i could only hope for belief among my family and those of my friends who have had reason through life to put faith in my veracitythe probability being that the public at large would regard what i should put forth as merely an impudent and ingenious fiction a distrust in my own abilities as a writer was nevertheless one of the principal causes which prevented me from complying with the suggestion of my advisers among those gentlemen in virginia who expressed the greatest interest in my statement more particularly in regard to that portion of it which related to the antarctic ocean was mr poe lately editor of the southern literary messenger a monthly magazine published by mr thomas w white in the city of richmond he strongly advised me among others to prepare at once a full account of what i had seen and undergone and trust to the shrewdness and common sense of the publicinsisting with great plausibility that however roughly as regards mere authorship my book should be got up its very uncouthness if there were any would give it all the better chance of being received as truth notwithstanding this representation i did not make up my mind to do as he suggested he afterward proposed finding that i would not stir in the matter that i should allow him to draw up in his own words a narrative of the earlier portion of my adventures from facts afforded by myself publishing it in the southern messenger under the garb of fiction to this perceiving no objection i consented stipulating only that my real name should be retained two numbers of the pretended fiction appeared consequently in the messenger for january and february and in order that it might certainly be regarded as fiction the name of mr poe was affixed to the articles in the table of contents of the magazine the manner in which this ruse was received has induced me at length to undertake a regular compilation and publication of the adventures in question for i found that in spite of the air of fable which had been so ingeniously thrown around that portion of my statement which appeared in the messenger without altering or distorting a single fact the public were still not at all disposed to receive it as fable and several letters were sent to mr ps address distinctly expressing a conviction to the contrary i thence concluded that the facts of my narrative would prove of such a nature as to carry with them sufficient evidence of their own authenticity and that i had consequently little to fear on the score of popular incredulity this exposé being made it will be seen at once how much of what follows i claim to be my own writing and it will also be understood that no fact is misrepresented in the first few pages which were written by mr poe even to those readers who have not seen the messenger it will be unnecessary to point out where his portion ends and my own commences the difference in point of style will be readily perceived a g pym newyork july chapter x shortly afterward an incident occurred which i am induced to look upon as more intensely productive of emotion as far more replete with the extremes first of delight and then of horror than even any of the thousand chances which afterward befell me in nine long years crowded with events of the most startling and in many cases of the most unconceived and unconceivable character we were lying on the deck near the companionway and debating the possibility of yet making our way into the storeroom when looking toward augustus who lay fronting myself i perceived that he had become all at once deadly pale and that his lips were quivering in the most singular and unaccountable manner greatly alarmed i spoke to him but he made me no reply and i was beginning to think that he was suddenly taken ill when i took notice of his eyes which were glaring apparently at some object behind me i turned my head and shall never forget the ecstatic joy which thrilled through every particle of my frame when i perceived a large brig bearing down upon us and not more than a couple of miles off i sprung to my feet as if a musket bullet had suddenly struck me to the heart and stretching out my arms in the direction of the vessel stood in this manner motionless and unable to articulate a syllable peters and parker were equally affected although in different ways the former danced about the deck like a madman uttering the most extravagant rhodomontades intermingled with howls and imprecations while the latter burst into tears and continued for many minutes weeping like a child the vessel in sight was a large hermaphrodite brig of a dutch build and painted black with a tawdry gilt figurehead she had evidently seen a good deal of rough weather and we supposed had suffered much in the gale which had proved so disastrous to ourselves for her foretopmast was gone and some of her starboard bulwarks when we first saw her she was as i have already said about two miles off and to windward bearing down upon us the breeze was very gentle and what astonished us chiefly was that she had no other sails set than her foremast and mainsail with a flying jibof course she came down but slowly and our impatience amounted nearly to phrensy the awkward manner in which she steered too was remarked by all of us even excited as we were she yawed about so considerably that once or twice we thought it impossible she could see us or imagined that having seen us and discovered no person on board she was about to tack and make off in another direction upon each of these occasions we screamed and shouted at the top of our voices when the stranger would appear to change for a moment her intention and again hold on toward usthis singular conduct being repeated two or three times so that at last we could think of no other manner of accounting for it than by supposing the helmsman to be in liquor no person was seen upon her decks until she arrived within about a quarter of a mile of us we then saw three seamen whom by their dress we took to be hollanders two of these were lying on some old sails near the forecastle and the third who appeared to be looking at us with great curiosity was leaning over the starboard bow near the bowsprit this last was a stout and tall man with a very dark skin he seemed by his manner to be encouraging us to have patience nodding to us in a cheerful although rather odd way and smiling constantly so as to display a set of the most brilliantly white teeth as his vessel drew nearer we saw a red flannel cap which he had on fall from his head into the water but of this he took little or no notice continuing his odd smiles and gesticulations i relate these things and circumstances minutely and i relate them it must be understood precisely as they appeared to us the brig came on slowly and now more steadily than before andi cannot speak calmly of this eventour hearts leaped up wildly within us and we poured out our whole souls in shouts and thanksgiving to god for the complete unexpected and glorious deliverance that was so palpably at hand of a sudden and all at once there came wafted over the ocean from the strange vessel which was now close upon us a smell a stench such as the whole world has no name forno conception ofhellishutterly suffocating insufferable inconceivable i gasped for breath and turning to my companions perceived that they were paler than marble but we had now no time left for question or surmisethe brig was within fifty feet of us and it seemed to be her intention to run under our counter that we might board her without putting out a boat we rushed aft when suddenly a wide yaw threw her off full five or six points from the course she had been running and as she passed under our stern at the distance of about twenty feet we had a full view of her decks shall i ever forget the triple horror of that spectacle twentyfive or thirty human bodies among whom were several females lay scattered about between the counter and the galley in the last and most loathsome state of putrefaction we plainly saw that not a soul lived in that fated vessel yet we could not help shouting to the dead for help yes long and loudly did we beg in the agony of the moment that those silent and disgusting images would stay for us would not abandon us to become like them would receive us among their goodly company we were raving with horror and despairthoroughly mad through the anguish of our grievous disappointment as our first loud yell of terror broke forth it was replied to by something from near the bowsprit of the stranger so closely resembling the scream of a human voice that the nicest ear might have been startled and deceived at this instant another sudden yaw brought the region of the forecastle for a moment into view and we beheld at once the origin of the sound we saw the tall stout figure still leaning on the bulwark and still nodding his head to and fro but his face was now turned from us so that we could not behold it his arms were extended over the rail and the palms of his hands fell outward his knees were lodged upon a stout rope tightly stretched and reaching from the heel of the bowsprit to a cathead on his back from which a portion of the shirt had been torn leaving it bare there sat a huge seagull busily gorging itself with the horrible flesh its bill and talons deep buried and its white plumage spattered all over with blood as the brig moved farther round so as to bring us close in view the bird with much apparent difficulty drew out its crimsoned head and after eyeing us for a moment as if stupefied arose lazily from the body upon which it had been feasting and flying directly above our deck hovered there a while with a portion of clotted and liverlike substance in its beak the horrid morsel dropped at length with a sullen splash immediately at the feet of parker may god forgive me but now for the first time there flashed through my mind a thought a thought which i will not mention and i felt myself making a step toward the ensanguined spot i looked upward and the eyes of augustus met my own with a degree of intense and eager meaning which immediately brought me to my senses i sprang forward quickly and with a deep shudder threw the frightful thing into the sea the body from which it had been taken resting as it did upon the rope had been easily swayed to and fro by the exertions of the carnivorous bird and it was this motion which had at first impressed us with the belief of its being alive as the gull relieved it of its weight it swung round and fell partially over so that the face was fully discovered never surely was any object so terribly full of awe the eyes were gone and the whole flesh around the mouth leaving the teeth utterly naked this then was the smile which had cheered us on to hope this thebut i forbear the brig as i have already told passed under our stern and made its way slowly but steadily to leeward with her and with her terrible crew went all our gay visions of deliverance and joy deliberately as she went by we might possibly have found means of boarding her had not our sudden disappointment and the appalling nature of the discovery which accompanied it laid entirely prostrate every active faculty of mind and body we had seen and felt but we could neither think nor act until alas too late how much our intellects had been weakened by this incident may be estimated by the fact that when the vessel had proceeded so far that we could perceive no more than the half of her hull the proposition was seriously entertained of attempting to overtake her by swimming i have since this period vainly endeavoured to obtain some clew to the hideous uncertainty which enveloped the fate of the stranger her build and general appearance as i have before stated led us to the belief that she was a dutch trader and the dresses of the crew also sustained this opinion we might have easily seen the name upon her stern and indeed taken other observations which would have guided us in making out her character but the intense excitement of the moment blinded us to every thing of that nature from the saffronlike hue of such of the corpses as were not entirely decayed we concluded that the whole of her company had perished by the yellow fever or some other virulent disease of the same fearful kind if such were the case and i know not what else to imagine death to judge from the positions of the bodies must have come upon them in a manner awfully sudden and overwhelming in a way totally distinct from that which generally characterizes even the most deadly pestilences with which mankind are acquainted it is possible indeed that poison accidentally introduced into some of their seastores may have brought about the disaster or that the eating of some unknown venomous species of fish or other marine animal or oceanic bird might have induced itbut it is utterly useless to form conjectures where all is involved and will no doubt remain for ever involved in the most appalling and unfathomable mystery chapter xi we spent the remainder of the day in a condition of stupid lethargy gazing after the retreating vessel until the darkness hiding her from our sight recalled us in some measure to our senses the pangs of hunger and thirst then returned absorbing all other cares and considerations nothing however could be done until the morning and securing ourselves as well as possible we endeavoured to snatch a little repose in this i succeeded beyond my expectations sleeping until my companions who had not been so fortunate aroused me at daybreak to renew our attempts at getting up provisions from the hull it was now a dead calm with the sea as smooth as i have ever known itthe weather warm and pleasant the brig was out of sight we commenced our operations by wrenching off with some trouble another of the forechains and having fastened both to peters feet he again made an endeavour to reach the door of the storeroom thinking it possible that he might be able to force it open provided he could get at it in sufficient time and this he hoped to do as the hulk lay much more steadily than before he succeeded very quickly in reaching the door when loosening one of the chains from his ankle he made every exertion to force the passage with it but in vain the framework of the room being far stronger than was anticipated he was quite exhausted with his long stay under water and it became absolutely necessary that some other one of us should take his place for this service parker immediately volunteered but after making three ineffectual efforts found that he could never even succeed in getting near the door the condition of augustuss wounded arm rendered it useless for him to attempt going down as he would be unable to force the room open should he reach it and it accordingly now devolved upon me to exert myself for our common deliverance peters had left one of the chains in the passage and i found upon plunging in that i had not sufficient balance to keep me firmly down i determined therefore to attempt no more in my first effort than merely to recover the other chain in groping along the floor of the passage for this i felt a hard substance which i immediately grasped not having time to ascertain what it was but returning and ascending instantly to the surface the prize proved to be a bottle and our joy may be conceived when i say that it was found to be full of port wine giving thanks to god for this timely and cheering assistance we immediately drew the cork with my penknife and each taking a moderate sup felt the most indescribable comfort from the warmth strength and spirits with which it inspired us we then carefully recorked the bottle and by means of a handkerchief swung it in such a manner that there was no possibility of its getting broken having rested a while after this fortunate discovery i again descended and now recovered the chain with which i instantly came up i then fastened it on and went down for the third time when i became fully satisfied that no exertions whatever in that situation would enable me to force open the door of the storeroom i therefore returned in despair there seemed now to be no longer any room for hope and i could perceive in the countenances of my companions that they had made up their minds to perish the wine had evidently produced in them a species of delirium which perhaps i had been prevented from feeling by the immersion i had undergone since drinking it they talked incoherently and about matters unconnected with our condition peters repeatedly asking me questions about nantucket augustus too i remember approached me with a serious air and requested me to lend him a pocketcomb as his hair was full of fishscales and he wished to get them out before going on shore parker appeared somewhat less affected and urged me to dive at random into the cabin and bring up any article which might come to hand to this i consented and in the first attempt after staying under a full minute brought up a small leather trunk belonging to captain barnard this was immediately opened in the faint hope that it might contain something to eat or drink we found nothing however except a box of razors and two linen shirts i now went down again and returned without any success as my head came above water i heard a crash on deck and upon getting up saw that my companions had ungratefully taken advantage of my absence to drink the remainder of the wine having let the bottle fall in the endeavour to replace it before i saw them i remonstrated with them on the heartlessness of their conduct when augustus burst into tears the other two endeavoured to laugh the matter off as a joke but i hope never again to behold laughter of such a species the distortion of countenance was absolutely frightful indeed it was apparent that the stimulus in the empty state of their stomachs had taken instant and violent effect and that they were all exceedingly intoxicated with great difficulty i prevailed upon them to lie down when they fell very soon into a heavy slumber accompanied with loud stertorous breathing i now found myself as it were alone in the brig and my reflections to be sure were of the most fearful and gloomy nature no prospect offered itself to my view but a lingering death by famine or at the best by being overwhelmed in the first gale which should spring up for in our present exhausted condition we could have no hope of living through another the gnawing hunger which i now experienced was nearly insupportable and i felt myself capable of going to any lengths in order to appease it with my knife i cut off a small portion of the leather trunk and endeavoured to eat it but found it utterly impossible to swallow a single morsel although i fancied that some little alleviation of my suffering was obtained by chewing small pieces of it and spitting them out toward night my companions awoke one by one each in an indescribable state of weakness and horror brought on by the wine whose fumes had now evaporated they shook as if with a violent ague and uttered the most lamentable cries for water their condition affected me in the most lively degree at the same time causing me to rejoice in the fortunate train of circumstances which had prevented me from indulging in the wine and consequently from sharing their melancholy and most distressing sensations their conduct however gave me great uneasiness and alarm for it was evident that unless some favourable change took place they could afford me no assistance in providing for our common safety i had not yet abandoned all idea of being able to get up something from below but the attempt could not possibly be resumed until some one of them was sufficiently master of himself to aid me by holding the end of the rope while i went down parker appeared to be somewhat more in possession of his senses than the others and i endeavoured by every means in my power to rouse him thinking that a plunge in the seawater might have a beneficial effect i contrived to fasten the end of a rope around his body and then leading him to the companionway he remaining quite passive all the while pushed him in and immediately drew him out i had good reason to congratulate myself upon having made this experiment for he appeared much revived and invigorated and upon getting out asked me in a rational manner why i had so served him having explained my object he expressed himself indebted to me and said that he felt greatly better from the immersion afterward conversing sensibly upon our situation we then resolved to treat augustus and peters in the same way which we immediately did when they both experienced much benefit from the shock this idea of sudden immersion had been suggested to me by reading in some medical work the good effect of the showerbath in a case where the patient was suffering from mania a potu finding that i could now trust my companions to hold the end of the rope i again made three or four plunges into the cabin although it was now quite dark and a gentle but long swell from the northward rendered the hulk somewhat unsteady in the course of these attempts i succeeded in bringing up two caseknives a threegallon jug empty and a blanket but nothing which could serve us for food i continued my efforts after getting these articles until i was completely exhausted but brought up nothing else during the night parker and peters occupied themselves by turns in the same manner but nothing coming to hand we now gave up this attempt in despair concluding that we were exhausting ourselves in vain we passed the remainder of this night in a state of the most intense mental and bodily anguish that can possibly be imagined the morning of the sixteenth at length dawned and we looked eagerly around the horizon for relief but to no purpose the sea was still smooth with only a long swell from the northward as on yesterday this was the sixth day since we had tasted either food or drink with the exception of the bottle of port wine and it was clear that we could hold out but a very little while longer unless something could be obtained i never saw before nor wish to see again human beings so utterly emaciated as peters and augustus had i met them on shore in their present condition i should not have had the slightest suspicion that i had ever beheld them their countenances were totally changed in character so that i could not bring myself to believe them really the same individuals with whom i had been in company but a few days before parker although sadly reduced and so feeble that he could not raise his head from his bosom was not so far gone as the other two he suffered with great patience making no complaint and endeavouring to inspire us with hope in every manner he could devise for myself although at the commencement of the voyage i had been in bad health and was at all times of a delicate constitution i suffered less than any of us being much less reduced in frame and retaining my powers of mind in a surprising degree while the rest were completely prostrated in intellect and seemed to be brought to a species of second childhood generally simpering in their expressions with idiotic smiles and uttering the most absurd platitudes at intervals however they would appear to revive suddenly as if inspired all at once with a consciousness of their condition when they would spring upon their feet in a momentary flash of vigour and speak for a short period of their prospects in a manner altogether rational although full of the most intense despair it is possible however that my companions may have entertained the same opinion of their own condition as i did of mine and that i may have unwittingly been guilty of the same extravagances and imbecilities as themselvesthis is a matter which cannot be determined about noon parker declared that he saw land off the larboard quarter and it was with the utmost difficulty i could restrain him from plunging into the sea with the view of swimming toward it peters and augustus took little notice of what he said being apparently wrapped up in moody contemplation upon looking in the direction pointed out i could not perceive the faintest appearance of the shoreindeed i was too well aware that we were far from any land to indulge in a hope of that nature it was a long time nevertheless before i could convince parker of his mistake he then burst into a flood of tears weeping like a child with loud cries and sobs for two or three hours when becoming exhausted he fell asleep peters and augustus now made several ineffectual efforts to swallow portions of the leather i advised them to chew it and spit it out but they were too excessively debilitated to be able to follow my advice i continued to chew pieces of it at intervals and found some relief from so doing my chief distress was for water and i was only prevented from taking a draught from the sea by remembering the horrible consequences which thus have resulted to others who were similarly situated with ourselves the day wore on in this manner when i suddenly discovered a sail to the eastward and on our larboard bow she appeared to be a large ship and was coming nearly athwart us being probably twelve or fifteen miles distant none of my companions had as yet discovered her and i forbore to tell them of her for the present lest we might again be disappointed of relief at length upon her getting nearer i saw distinctly that she was heading immediately for us with her light sails filled i could now contain myself no longer and pointed her out to my fellowsufferers they immediately sprang to their feet again indulging in the most extravagant demonstrations of joy weeping laughing in an idiotic manner jumping stamping upon the deck tearing their hair and praying and cursing by turns i was so affected by their conduct as well as by what i considered a sure prospect of deliverance that i could not refrain from joining in with their madness and gave way to the impulses of my gratitude and ecstasy by lying and rolling on the deck clapping my hands shouting and other similar acts until i was suddenly called to my recollection and once more to the extreme human misery and despair by perceiving the ship all at once with her stern fully presented toward us and steering in a direction nearly opposite to that in which i had at first perceived her it was some time before i could induce my poor companions to believe that this sad reverse in our prospects had actually taken place they replied to all my assertions with a stare and a gesture implying that they were not to be deceived by such misrepresentations the conduct of augustus most sensibly affected me in spite of all i could say or do to the contrary he persisted in saying that the ship was rapidly nearing us and in making preparations to go on board of her some seaweed floating by the brig he maintained that it was the ships boat and endeavoured to throw himself upon it howling and shrieking in the most heartrending manner when i forcibly restrained him from thus casting himself into the sea having become in some degree pacified we continued to watch the ship until we finally lost sight of her the weather becoming hazy with a light breeze springing up as soon as she was entirely gone parker turned suddenly toward me with an expression of countenance which made me shudder there was about him an air of selfpossession which i had not noticed in him until now and before he opened his lips my heart told me what he would say he proposed in a few words that one of us should die to preserve the existence of the others chapter xii i had for some time past dwelt upon the prospect of our being reduced to this last horrible extremity and had secretly made up my mind to suffer death in any shape or under any circumstances rather than resort to such a course nor was this resolution in any degree weakened by the present intensity of hunger under which i laboured the proposition had not been heard by either peters or augustus i therefore took parker aside and mentally praying to god for power to dissuade him from the horrible purpose he entertained i expostulated with him for a long time and in the most supplicating manner begging him in the name of every thing which he held sacred and urging him by every species of argument which the extremity of the case suggested to abandon the idea and not to mention it to either of the other two he heard all i said without attempting to controvert any of my arguments and i had begun to hope that he would be prevailed upon to do as i desired but when i had ceased speaking he said that he knew very well all i had said was true and that to resort to such a course was the most horrible alternative which could enter into the mind of man but that he had now held out as long as human nature could be sustained that it was unnecessary for all to perish when by the death of one it was possible and even probable that the rest might be finally preserved adding that i might save myself the trouble of trying to turn him from his purpose his mind having been thoroughly made up on the subject even before the appearance of the ship and that only her heaving in sight had prevented him from mentioning his intention at an earlier period i now begged him if he would not be prevailed upon to abandon his design at least to defer it for another day when some vessel might come to our relief again reiterating every argument i could devise and which i thought likely to have influence with one of his rough nature he said in reply that he had not spoken until the very last possible moment that he could exist no longer without sustenance of some kind and that therefore in another day his suggestion would be too late as regarded himself at least finding that he was not to be moved by anything i could say in a mild tone i now assumed a different demeanor and told him that he must be aware i had suffered less than any of us from our calamities that my health and strength consequently were at that moment far better than his own or than that either of peters or augustus in short that i was in a condition to have my own way by force if i found it necessary and that if he attempted in any manner to acquaint the others with his bloody and cannibal designs i would not hesitate to throw him into the sea upon this he immediately seized me by the throat and drawing a knife made several ineffectual efforts to stab me in the stomach an atrocity which his excessive debility alone prevented him from accomplishing in the meantime being roused to a high pitch of anger i forced him to the vessels side with the full intention of throwing him overboard he was saved from his fate however by the interference of peters who now approached and separated us asking the cause of the disturbance this parker told before i could find means in any manner to prevent him the effect of his words was even more terrible than what i had anticipated both augustus and peters who it seems had long secretly entertained the same fearful idea which parker had been merely the first to broach joined with him in his design and insisted upon its immediately being carried into effect i had calculated that one at least of the two former would be found still possessed of sufficient strength of mind to side with myself in resisting any attempt to execute so dreadful a purpose and with the aid of either one of them i had no fear of being able to prevent its accomplishment being disappointed in this expectation it became absolutely necessary that i should attend to my own safety as a further resistance on my part might possibly be considered by men in their frightful condition a sufficient excuse for refusing me fair play in the tragedy that i knew would speedily be enacted i now told them i was willing to submit to the proposal merely requesting a delay of about one hour in order that the fog which had gathered around us might have an opportunity of lifting when it was possible that the ship we had seen might be again in sight after great difficulty i obtained from them a promise to wait thus long and as i had anticipated a breeze rapidly coming in the fog lifted before the hour had expired when no vessel appearing in sight we prepared to draw lots it is with extreme reluctance that i dwell upon the appalling scene which ensued a scene which with its minutest details no after events have been able to efface in the slightest degree from my memory and whose stern recollection will embitter every future moment of my existence let me run over this portion of my narrative with as much haste as the nature of the events to be spoken of will permit the only method we could devise for the terrific lottery in which we were to take each a chance was that of drawing straws small splinters of wood were made to answer our purpose and it was agreed that i should be the holder i retired to one end of the hulk while my poor companions silently took up their station in the other with their backs turned toward me the bitterest anxiety which i endured at any period of this fearful drama was while i occupied myself in the arrangement of the lots there are few conditions into which man can possibly fall where he will not feel a deep interest in the preservation of his existence an interest momentarily increasing with the frailness of the tenure by which that existence may be held but now that the silent definite and stern nature of the business in which i was engaged so different from the tumultuous dangers of the storm or the gradually approaching horrors of famine allowed me to reflect on the few chances i had of escaping the most appalling of deathsa death for the most appalling of purposesevery particle of that energy which had so long buoyed me up departed like feathers before the wind leaving me a helpless prey to the most abject and pitiable terror i could not at first even summon up sufficient strength to tear and fit together the small splinters of wood my fingers absolutely refusing their office and my knees knocking violently against each other my mind ran over rapidly a thousand absurd projects by which to avoid becoming a partner in the awful speculation i thought of falling on my knees to my companions and entreating them to let me escape this necessity of suddenly rushing upon them and by putting one of them to death of rendering the decision by lot uselessin short of every thing but of going through with the matter i had in hand at last after wasting a long time in this imbecile conduct i was recalled to my senses by the voice of parker who urged me to relieve them at once from the terrible anxiety they were enduring even then i could not bring myself to arrange the splinters upon the spot but thought over every species of finesse by which i could trick some one of my fellowsufferers to draw the short straw as it had been agreed that whoever drew the shortest of four splinters from my hand was to die for the preservation of the rest before any one condemn me for this apparent heartlessness let him be placed in a situation precisely similar to my own at length delay was no longer possible and with a heart almost bursting from my bosom i advanced to the region of the forecastle where my companions were awaiting me i held out my hand with the splinters and peters immediately drew he was freehis at least was not the shortest and there was now another chance against my escape i summoned up all my strength and passed the lots to augustus he also drew immediately and he also was free and now whether i should live or die the chances were no more than precisely even at this moment all the fierceness of the tiger possessed my bosom and i felt toward my poor fellowcreature parker the most intense the most diabolical hatred but the feeling did not last and at length with a convulsive shudder and closed eyes i held out the two remaining splinters toward him it was fully five minutes before he could summon resolution to draw during which period of heartrending suspense i never once opened my eyes presently one of the two lots was quickly drawn from my hand the decision was then over yet i knew not whether it was for me or against me no one spoke and still i dared not satisfy myself by looking at the splinter i held peters at length took me by the hand and i forced myself to look up when i immediately saw by the countenance of parker that i was safe and that he it was who had been doomed to suffer gasping for breath i fell senseless to the deck i recovered from my swoon in time to behold the consummation of the tragedy in the death of him who had been chiefly instrumental in bringing it about he made no resistance whatever and was stabbed in the back by peters when he fell instantly dead i must not dwell upon the fearful repast which immediately ensued such things may be imagined but words have no power to impress the mind with the exquisite horror of their reality let it suffice to say that having in some measure appeased the raging thirst which consumed us by the blood of the victim and having by common consent taken off the hands feet and head throwing them together with the entrails into the sea we devoured the rest of the body piecemeal during the four ever memorable days of the seventeenth eighteenth nineteenth and twentieth of the month on the nineteenth there coming on a smart shower which lasted fifteen or twenty minutes we contrived to catch some water by means of a sheet which had been fished up from the cabin by our drag just after the gale the quantity we took in all did not amount to more than half a gallon but even this scanty allowance supplied us with comparative strength and hope on the twentyfirst we were again reduced to the last necessity the weather still remained warm and pleasant with occasional fogs and light breezes most usually from n to w on the twentysecond as we were sitting close huddled together gloomily revolving over our lamentable condition there flashed through my mind all at once an idea which inspired me with a bright gleam of hope i remembered that when the foremast had been cut away peters being in the windward chains passed one of the axes into my hand requesting me to put it if possible in a place of security and that a few minutes before the last heavy sea struck the brig and filled her i had taken this axe into the forecastle and laid it in one of the larboard berths i now thought it possible that by getting at this axe we might cut through the deck over the storeroom and thus readily supply ourselves with provisions when i communicated this object to my companions they uttered a feeble shout of joy and we all proceeded forthwith to the forecastle the difficulty of descending here was greater than that of going down in the cabin the opening being much smaller for it will be remembered that the whole framework about the cabin companionhatch had been carried away whereas the forecastleway being a simple hatch of only about three feet square had remained uninjured i did not hesitate however to attempt the descent and a rope being fastened round my body as before i plunged boldly in feet foremost made my way quickly to the berth and at the first attempt brought up the axe it was hailed with the most ecstatic joy and triumph and the ease with which it had been obtained was regarded as an omen of our ultimate preservation we now commenced cutting at the deck with all the energy of rekindled hope peters and myself taking the axe by turns augustuss wounded arm not permitting him to aid us in any degree as we were still so feeble as to be scarcely able to stand unsupported and could consequently work but a minute or two without resting it soon became evident that many long hours would be necessary to accomplish our taskthat is to cut an opening sufficiently large to admit of a free access to the storeroom this consideration however did not discourage us and working all night by the light of the moon we succeeded in effecting our purpose by daybreak on the morning of the twentythird peters now volunteered to go down and having made all arrangements as before he descended and soon returned bringing up with him a small jar which to our great joy proved to be full of olives having shared these among us and devoured them with the greatest avidity we proceeded to let him down again this time he succeeded beyond our utmost expectations returning instantly with a large ham and a bottle of madeira wine of the latter we each took a moderate sup having learned by experience the pernicious consequences of indulging too freely the ham except about two pounds near the bone was not in a condition to be eaten having been entirely spoiled by the salt water the sound part was divided among us peters and augustus not being able to restrain their appetite swallowed theirs upon the instant but i was more cautious and ate but a small portion of mine dreading the thirst which i knew would ensue we now rested a while from our labors which had been intolerably severe by noon feeling somewhat strengthened and refreshed we again renewed our attempt at getting up provisions peters and myself going down alternately and always with more or less success until sundown during this interval we had the good fortune to bring up altogether four more small jars of olives another ham a carboy containing nearly three gallons of excellent cape madeira wine and what gave us still more delight a small tortoise of the gallipago breed several of which had been taken on board by captain barnard as the grampus was leaving port from the schooner mary pitts just returned from a sealing voyage in the pacific in a subsequent portion of this narrative i shall have frequent occasion to mention this species of tortoise it is found principally as most of my readers may know in the group of islands called the gallipagos which indeed derive their name from the animalthe spanish word gallipago meaning a freshwater terrapin from the peculiarity of their shape and action they have been sometimes called the elephant tortoise they are frequently found of an enormous size i have myself seen several which would weigh from twelve to fifteen hundred pounds although i do not remember that any navigator speaks of having seen them weighing more than eight hundred their appearance is singular and even disgusting their steps are very slow measured and heavy their bodies being carried about a foot from the ground their neck is long and exceedingly slender from eighteen inches to two feet is a very common length and i killed one where the distance from the shoulder to the extremity of the head was no less than three feet ten inches the head has a striking resemblance to that of a serpent they can exist without food for an almost incredible length of time instances having been known where they have been thrown into the hold of a vessel and lain two years without nourishment of any kindbeing as fat and in every respect in as good order at the expiration of the time as when they were first put in in one particular these extraordinary animals bear a resemblance to the dromedary or camel of the desert in a bag at the root of the neck they carry with them a constant supply of water in some instances upon killing them after a full years deprivation of all nourishment as much as three gallons of perfectly sweet and fresh water have been found in their bags their food is chiefly wild parsley and celery with purslain seakelp and prickly pears upon which latter vegetable they thrive wonderfully a great quantity of it being usually found on the hillsides near the shore wherever the animal itself is discovered they are excellent and highly nutritious food and have no doubt been the means of preserving the lives of thousands of seamen employed in the whalefishery and other pursuits in the pacific the one which we had the good fortune to bring up from the storeroom was not of a large size weighing probably sixtyfive or seventy pounds it was a female and in excellent condition being exceedingly fat and having more than a quart of limpid and sweet water in its bag this was indeed a treasure and falling on our knees with one accord we returned fervent thanks to god for so seasonable a relief we had great difficulty in getting the animal up through the opening as its struggles were fierce and its strength prodigious it was upon the point of making its escape from peters grasp and slipping back into the water when augustus throwing a rope with a slipknot around its throat held it up in this manner until i jumped into the hole by the side of peters and assisted him in lifting it out the water we drew carefully from the bag into the jug which it will be remembered had been brought up before from the cabin having done this we broke off the neck of a bottle so as to form with the cork a kind of glass holding not quite half a gill we then each drank one of these measures full and resolved to limit ourselves to this quantity per day as long as it should hold out during the last two or three days the weather having been dry and pleasant the bedding we had obtained from the cabin as well as our clothing had become thoroughly dry so that we passed this night that of the twentythird in comparative comfort enjoying a tranquil repose after having supped plentifully on olives and ham with a small allowance of the wine being afraid of losing some of our stores overboard during the night in the event of a breeze springing up we secured them as well as possible with cordage to the fragments of the windlass our tortoise which we were anxious to preserve alive as long as we could we threw on its back and otherwise carefully fastened how i became an edgar allan poe convert by sue grafton i hadnt had occasion to read edgar allan poe since high school so when michael connelly asked me to contribute a few laudatory words to this anthology commemorating poes two hundredth birthday i said id consider his request please note i didnt actually commit myself but i did experience a mild surge of interest and told michael connelly id do what i could after all why not this was late october and my comments wouldnt be due until the end of february a lead time of three months during which i might very well be killed aside from the fact that i seldom agree to write anything offgrid my reservations were twofold im not a scholar by any stretch and i generally refuse to hold forth on any subject except possibly cats id recently started work on u is for and i knew i needed to focus on the task at hand nonetheless being a fan of michael connellys especially since heretofore hed never asked me for anything i bought a paperback edition of great tales and poems of edgar allan poe to refresh my memory i sailed through the introduction and the section called chronology of edgar allan poes life and work so far so good i did question the wisdom of his marrying his thirteenyearold tubercular cousin but boys will be boys and poor poe was known as a fallingdown drunk in rapid succession i read the pit and the pendulum the purloined letter manuscript found in a bottle and the murders in the rue morgue oh dear that ourangoutang business really didnt fly as far as i was concerned lets not even talk about the goldbug which left me cranky and out of sorts i found poe profligate with his exclamation points and his overheated prose was larded with inexplicable french phrases not only that he was much too fond of adverbs and his dialogue fairly cried out for the stern admonitions of a good editor mon dieu these are all writerly habits of which i thoroughly disapprove further reading of his work did nothing to soften my views what was i to do i had nothing nice to say about the man and no hope of faking it i wrote to michael connelly begging to be relieved of my responsibilities he wrote back and most graciously excused me quel joie i returned to u and thought no more about the poe anthology then two months later just when my guilt was beginning to subside michael wrote again on the long shot of all long shots that i might relent in the unlikely event that id say yes he cautioned that my term paper would be due not the middle of february as originally thought but closer to february i felt myself waver and wondered if there was any way i might be of help i decided to renew my efforts before closing the door on him once and for all given the accelerated deadline i took the only sensible action that crossed my mind i turned to the internet and googled edgar allan poe in hopes of cribbing an academic paper i could pass off as my own in the course of this random research i came across a reference to a poe story called the narrative of arthur gordon pym of nantucket which wasnt included in the collected works id bought what caught my attention were comments i unearthed from the archives of cornell university the works of the late edgar allan poe with a memoir by rufus wilmot griswold and notices of his life and genius by n p willis and j r lowell vols new york redfield on page of one of these volumes alas i know not which either mr griswold n p willis or j r lowell wrote the following had this narrative been brought to a conclusion satisfactory or even plausible arthur gordon pym would have been the most perfect specimen of poes imaginative and constructive powers well that was curious fifty key strokes later i found the lengthy story online and reproduced as much of it as printer paper would allow id read no more than a few paragraphs when i found myself transfixed the prose was clear and accessible with nary a in sight but what intrigued me was the challenge poe had set for himself the narrative purports to be an account of an extraordinary and entirely invented journey across the antarctic ocean as told by one arthur gordon pym at a gentlemens club in richmond virginia in the latter months of those who hear of his remarkable adventures urge pym to make the matter public pym declines explaining that he kept no written journal during this protracted period and that he questions his ability to write from mere memory a statement so minute and connected as to have the appearance of that truth it would really possess the incidents he says are of a nature so marvelous that he doubts the public would regard his comments as anything other than an impudent and ingenious fiction as luck would have it among those present at the gathering is our very own edgar allan poe lately editor of the southern literary messenger who strongly advises pym to prepare a thorough rendering of the affair and who further proposes to publish this chronicle in the southern literary messenger as a work of fiction under his poes name this ruse says poe will allow pym to fully air his tale without inciting the publics incredulity in january and february twentyfive chapters of this narrative appear in the messenger meticulously detailing a voyage to the south pacific which results in the alleged discovery of a new land complete with the specifics of climate atmosphere water novel plants and strange animals capped by a description of the inhabitants who differ from all other races of men the response is unexpected as convincing as the author poe has hoped to be in persuading the public that the tale is mere fable letters are sent to mr poes address distinctly expressing a conviction to the contrary far from viewing these exploits as fiction the public believes them to be true edgar allan poe is forced to confess that the tale is not his but is an unexpurgated and completely factual account of actual events that happened to arthur gordon pym arthur gordon pym in turn is finally convinced to step forward and acknowledge the reportage as his own he then proceeds to dictate his experiences in such an authoritative tone that the whole of it is accepted as gospel so much so that a publishing house in london commences arrangements to reprint the work as a bona fide history having established this dazzling turnabout premise poe now faces the tricky issue of how to bring the tale to a conclusion without leaving himself open to the very scientific scrutiny hes hoping to avoid in order to sustain the authenticity of his deceptionposing as pym and limning a supposed fiction whose outing as truth motivates pym to affirm his role as author and participant whewpoe must find a means of completing the yarn without tipping his hand for a few moments i put myself in poes shoes and pondered the possibilities my temptation would have been to chuck the whole scheme as a rebellion of plot and character now desperately in need of quashing his solution was to make the following announcement the circumstances connected with the late sudden and distressing death of mr pym are already well known to the public through the medium of the daily press it is feared that the few remaining chapters which were to have completed his narrative and which were retained by him for the purpose of revision have been irrecoverably lost through the accident by which he perished himself this however may prove not to be the case and the papers if ultimately found will be given to the public the loss of two or three final chapters is the more deeply to be regretted as it can not be doubted they contained matter relative to the pole itself or at least to regions in its very near proximity and as too the statements of the author in relation to these regions may shortly be verified or contradicted by means of the governmental expedition now preparing for the southern ocean in support of this poe attaches a number of footnotes in which he clarifies and annotates the veracity of pyms assertions in all of their particulars the elaborate and ingenious conceit of this story which is by the way executed with unfaltering confidence was finally sufficient to arouse my admiration and elevate my prior opinion of edgar allan poe at least in terms of this one stunning testimonial to his skills im delighted to recommend the narrative of arthur gordon pym of nantucket as exemplary of poes powers of invention i do this with a clear conscience and in sincere support of this anthology honoring his work personal integrity aside there is one more important point to be made now michael connelly owes me sue grafton entered the mystery field in with the publication of a is for alibi which introduced female hardboiled private investigator kinsey millhone who operates out of the fictional town of santa teresa aka santa barbara
