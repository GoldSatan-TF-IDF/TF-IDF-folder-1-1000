catherine s mcmullen was just twelve years old at the time of the writing of this story she wrote her first story when she was seven but that one is still buried in a drawer somewhere she has had six stories published professionally or sold starting with teddy cat in the august interzone she has been involved in the writing community since she was two and is constantly reminded that many people used to know her when she was just a kid she loves to write and is fascinated by the peculiarities of the english language she is also an avid reader and has read as many as one thousand books in one year her work has appeared in such venues as interzone a drop of imagination spinouts and thrillogies maar was closing in and while everyone was to be evacuated from the tower area eventually the noncombatants were leaving first urthro didnt want anyone nearby who would panic and cause disruption some large groups had already been sent to places far enough away to be safe from maar everyone was being spread out so thinly that maar would never have a large group close to him it was true that the precautions might not be necessary maar might eventually be defeated but unfortunately it was unlikely to happen now if ever i looked at the organized chaos and turned to master thomas i had not counted on being part of the evacuation i was apprenticed to a great war mage surely we would be needed if were packing our tent we are going to be evacuated master thomas i am right in assuming this you are correct errold you and i are going to go with a large group about three hundred people who are to be gated to safety the requirements of precisely where are not very rigid the place just has to be fairly safe that is not a swamp or a lava pit and very very far away it will be a oneway gate once we are gone we will be cut off from urthos camp permanently ahhh and i can see another question in your eyes why are we going with this particular group they need us as mages to heal to defend and to lead the group was most reassured when they were told that we were to come with them they asked for a mage because where they are to be gated is the farthest away of all we dont even know what animals live there what the land is like or even if there are any other humans there this group is a special case and you and i fit the requirements more people have been watching your development as a healer than you realize my leadership experience and probably my reputation help keep the group together but what about the war here dont they need you to help defeat maar i am known as a very powerful war mage ill grant you that but what about the people who are being scattered who will teach them our skills besides i want to have a place to settle down where i can livewith challenges to cope with but none of them named maar i am heartily sick of that name and all the troubles that go with it welli can understand why the group would need a leader but why not have a professional healer with the group i mean i am not really qualified as a mage or even a herbalist let alone a healer yet and a group of this size will need a proper healer wont they have you listened to anything ive been saying you are known to be a dedicated student and are well versed in herbal techniques you would be able to cope with any injuries that occur on the journey without a doubt it would be perfect for both of us to go with them are you prepared to go you do have a choice you know if you dont want to go you dont have to i would understand when are we leaving master thomas master thomas smiled thats the spirit we are leaving soon very soon our group is ready and we are only waiting until our gate gets set up about how long will that be i havent finished packing about a half a day but youd better hurry ive already almost finished getting my own things together you just wanted to get a head start on me so the master wouldnt be shamed by his students fast progress hah ill show you and with master thomas laughter ringing in my ears i left to pack for the journey of my life i had a list of what i needed to pack and how i needed to pack it i had decided after many shorter trips where i had been badly equipped that i would not make a single mistake it would be faster to pack everything slowly but correctly the first time instead of throwing everything together and having to repack a hundred times first in were some of my softer clothes with no metal buckles or straps in them placed against the back of the pack so that i had padding against my skin i had made the mistake of putting a belt buckle at my back once before on one of my short journeys into the forest needless to say after a day of it rubbing against me that was a mistake i intended never to repeat next the seeds went in a vital component of my supplies when we reached a place where we could settle down the seeds would be needed to grow crops and for my herbs i placed the seeds in specially prepared bags that were proof against water and fire and woven through with protective spells the spells had been done by me not master thomas master thomas was an expert on war magics but he recognized that i knew more about the smaller more useful spells for daily chores it wasnt something that was likely to get me recognition as a great mage but i had a knack for it after i had learned all the simple spells that master thomas could teach me and after that had become apparent that i would never master the really powerful ones i started turning to books i had had to learn most of what i knew by myself deciphering the spells alone i still hadnt learned even half of what i wanted to know so i was taking some books with me it had been hard to decide what books to take and which ones to give away but it came down to what i would really need and eventually what a village would need i carefully packed five spell books into my pack wrapping them in more clothes i had also prepared a whole range of herbal remedies but only a little of each someone in the group was sure to need them as we traveled and i didnt want to be caught unprepared lastly i packed the food water and metal tools that master thomas had given me to carry for the group these all went at the top because they would be needed most often i did one last check of the list making sure i hadnt left anything out then i struggled into the straps and heaved the pack onto my shoulders i had been confident that i could cope with the weight or that i would get used to it in time but it turned out that i had a previously undiscovered ability to underestimate weight well i would have to adapt or dieguess which one i thought was more likely at that stage i took a last look at my bare tent it was a sobering sight seeing the emptiness of it when only a couple of days ago it had been full of furniture books clothes and other paraphernalia everything had either been packed to be taken with us or given away there was no point asking people to save things for us as we would never be coming back there were some very happy mages as a result of the grand book handout that master thomas and i conducted so many loved wellused books now in so many different hands oh well at least they would be appreciated i sighed and staggered off to find master thomas i hoped that he wasnt moving around as i didnt want the camps last memory of me being me hyperventilating as the pack became too much probably a forlorn hope unfortunately our gate was finally ready a place sufficiently far away had been found a forest with really huge trees it was so remote that nobody even recognized the types of trees we all lined up all loaded down with our carefully prepared and very heavy packs have i already mentioned heavy anything that couldnt be carried just wasnt taken when people complained about their packs being too heavy master thomas just took out the really useless thingslike jewelry coins and so onand showed them the differences in weight it worked every time as soon as everyone was ready the gate was activated showing the forest on the other side when the last person was through the gate it closed the light from the camp on the other side disappeared and we were left in the halflight under towering tree giants we were a long way away from home with no chance of ever returning master thomas clapped his hands for everyones attention we have one longterm problem and a lot of shortterm problems he began the longterm problem is finding a place with suitable resources to settle down and build a village the shortterm problems are who will cook who will hunt who shares tents with whom what the rotations of lookouts are to bein other words our organization for traveling and getting along together before we start moving we must have a meeting to sort everything out anyone who has anything to contribute or who thinks they can do something particularly well should speak up this meeting is essential to the groups wellbeing so everyone must come along the meeting had a really long agenda and it lasted until after dark master thomas was quickly confirmed as the leader of our group because he was already experienced with organizing large numbers of people after that was established he ran everything efficiently but it still took a long time and a lot of talking everyone had to do something but he arranged duties so that people did what they were good at or enjoyed the only people who did not have mundane tasks assigned to them were master thomas and myself master thomas actually had the hardest task of all running things making decisions sorting out disputes and shouldering the heavy burden of responsibility my trouble was that quite a few people didnt realize that i was his student after a few complaints along the lines of what about im he dont have to do no dishwashing everyone was treated to a lecture from master thomas about who had heated the water driven the insects away made the tents waterproof and many other things it then became established that for the little spells you came to me not him after that i not only didnt have to do chores but i was called on to do a lot of spells that i had never tried before i knew i would have to study my books a lot more and find new possibilities in some previously useless spells i did some reading by the campfires light then returned to the tent that master thomas and i shared he was outside staring up at the sky through a break in the trees canopy he stood up and asked me to walk with him we had only gone a short distance when there was a flash of light in the east but it was the sort of flash that blazed out but just kept getting stronger and stronger for a few seconds slowly it began to fade everyone had stopped talking by then and they were all looking across at us i had to turn away so that i did not show the worry that i was feeling for the people nearer to the blast many of my friends had been very much closer that must have been the magical weapon of urthos combined with the tower being annihilated said master thomas hurry we dont have much time i had to start to run to keep up with him why are you running whats the threat to us think we are at least an ocean away from all that magic yet we still saw the flash we must shield the campsite from the magical blast which will follow if we shield the group the effects on us might not be too bad we can only hope we gathered everyone together and began putting up the shields a lot of people were scared but master thomas reassured them by explaining what the flash of light had meant just as he had explained it to me once the shields were up we just settled down to wait people began to relax and make themselves comfortable it had been lucky that nobody had put up their tents too far away from anyone else a smaller area meant a tougher shield master thomas and i walked back the short distance to our tent and went inside i was worried but i hadnt wanted to ask any questions in front of the rest of the group it would only have scared them master thomas if you think the magic will be dangerous for us all the way over here what would it be like over there i asked will anyone have survived i think urthos remaining people will have survived they have experienced mages who are experts at coping with the unexpected but i dont think the land or the animals on it will ever be the same again he looked into the distance and seemed thoughtful this means the changing of magic as we know it forever the people like you who can ration their magic will be the ones who prosper and survive it is highly likely that i will never be able to perform really powerful spells ever again we have never seen anything like this before this kind of magical situation you have just become part of an event that will be remembered forever as the day magic changed half an hour later the mage storm hit the shields with deadly force i soon began to worry more about us than the people closer to the blast master thomas and i were the only mages here whereas they had many skilled mages to put up shields and protective spells we really had our hands full considering what lay outside of our shields out there the forest seemed to be in chaos magic was swirling everywhere and when i looked outside of the shields for too long my eyes hurt just as i thought we could hold the storm back up for no longer it abated the assault had only lasted for a day but to me it seemed like it had lasted for weeks when we lowered the shields the forest around us seemed fairly normal but then when night would normally have fallen there was only an eerie halflight there were places where piles of ash and soot were all that was left of great tree giants flickering lights in the trees had everyone scared and the few children in our group had to stay with their parents all the time i made an observation to master thomas about something that worried me a lot master thomas i have noticed something and i want to know whether it is just me werent the leaves green and healthy before the mage storm hit and not brown and falling from the trees i think youre right about that errold but what is your point there have been much worse things done by the mage storm than simply changing the state of the leaves thats just it all the other effects of the mage storm have been obvious but what if there are effects that are even more subtle if the state of the leaves could be changed couldnt berries we know are safe to eat have become poisonous that is a very intelligent observation to make errold i will alert the rest of the group to this new danger they might not react very well but i think it is necessary thank you i wouldnt want to lose anyone from the group and your observation may have stopped that from happening because of foolish mistakes as i sat in our tent i continued to worry and turned similar thoughts over in my head this forest had been changed dramatically by what master thomas now called the mage storm but could we survive in it or was even the water no longer safe to drink and what about the animals that hadnt been within our shields what about them we began traveling again the second morning after the storm all seemed well until one of the scouts saw huge animal footprints we reported back to master thomas as he didnt recognize what he had seen everyone was told to be especially careful until we learned what the animal ate and more importantly whether its diet might include us the next day while the group was resting and eating i wandered off in search of any recognizable wild herbs i had no luck in finding any and decided that when we settled down i would experiment to see what those that were new to me were useful for i was walking back to where the group was resting when i came upon the type of animal that must have made the footprints it was large and woolly but seemed to be fairly harmless i had never seen anything like it in the forests i had traveled before i herded it back to the group and master thomas proposed that it be taken with us we had no other livestock for when we founded the village and besides it could carry packs i thought that the thing probably wasnt safe to eat because of the magic that had obviously affected it master thomas called a meeting to discuss possible problems from changed animals as we all know the mage storm has obviously affected the land and the plants and animals on it we have one of the results of the storm in our camp now the animal we have named carpet carpet will be very helpful to us when we settle down but although she is apparently safe we do have to look at the wider range of our worries i personally have noticed that carpet is unusually intelligent and other people have also commented on this forest animals are often cunning but never intelligent we will have to be exceptionably wary and closely observe all animals that we encounter from now on our scouts will be carrying magical sensors that errold will make these will detect any large animals nearby and by night i will erect shields around the camp to protect us when we are sleeping does anyone have anything else to suggest or does anyone disagree with our plan now that people knew the facts the meeting went well people who wanted to be taken off scout duty were reassigned but generally everybody was fairly happy with what our leader had proposed after everyone had dispersed i went over to master thomas master thomas i have an idea i said what is it master consider the level of intelligence in our friend carpet herbivores are usually a bit dim they dont seem to need that much intelligence but carpet is as bright as a dog if a herbivore is now that smart what will the carnivores be like they may be extremely intelligent now possibly even sentientand all that being sentient implies this is true errold what are you proposing making the sensors for the scouts wont be hard at most it will take a couple of hours i must do some scouting myself though while you are shielding the camp i will set up scanning spells to sweep the forest for a hundred yards all around if some of predators in this forest are as intelligent as we think they will come at night to observe us if i detect something i will go out and make sure it is harmless or try to disable it thats very good proposition errold but i dont want you outside of my protection like that i am tempted to go instead of you but i am used to working with huge amounts of magic and i would not be as good as you would be against a single animal you use the smallest spells to the best advantage i give you permission for this plan do you really think that the predators will be so intelligent yes i do even before the storm it was thought that some predators in the known world were remarkably cunning if only in pursuit of their prey i think that any new smart predators will be a real threat to us if not now then when we settle down it is vital for us to establish that we are not prey and should be avoided master thomas nodded his head but still looked doubtful better figure out how you are to disable predators though they will be fast deadly and intelligent while you are just intelligent you need a spell that can tell if something really is intelligent in all my studies i had not come across anything like that itll be tricky but im sure ill think of something master thomas i said not at all sure if i could actually do it i lay in my tent that night furiously studying the spell books i had brought i had an idea that would use a really simple spell predators are curious and did a lot of patient stalking thus my trap worked on curiosity and would certainly disable anything watching me it was the sensing of large animals that i needed to work on i stayed up most of the night figuring out how to combine shields together how to get the right range and the search requirements i got it together eventually then crawled gratefully to my bed roll i needed all the sleep i could get because i knew that some night soon we would have company the following day everything seemed to go fairly normally we noticed no large shapes in the distance and saw no unusual tracks i still felt as if we were being watched though any truly smart animal would stay on rocky ground or the trunks of fallen trees it was nightfall that i was waiting for that was when we were not moving and the shields would be up it would be then that i would be prowling just like a predator after we had found a suitable spot to camp i immediately cast my sensing spell but it wasnt till halfway though the night that it alerted me i sneaked out of camp using a simple camouflage enchantment on my clothes and carrying a rope the magical sensor that i carried told me when i was fairly close to the animal and it felt only one animal in a hundredyard radius this made everything a lot easier for me i sat down a few yards from the bushes where my sensor amulet had shown the animal was now i prepared the spell that i had thought of using the night before i took my time anything nearby that was curious would be watching intently as i waved my hands and conjured energies then closed my eyes and set it off even with my eyes shut the blinding flash of light still hurt judging from the thrashing noises and growls from the bushes whatever had been lurking there had been staring at what i had been doing with intense interest i conjured a globe of light and set it hanging in midair it showed a huge cat with a high forehead its fur was a very deep shade of green using my rope i ensnared the thrashing limbs and tied up the cat before it could see again then i sat down in front of it weaving a rather delicate and tricky translation spell soon i could hear that the animals noises were not really just yowling but some very nasty swear words after it had blinked a few times and seemed to be able to see a bit it focused its gaze on me speak i can understand i told it for a moment it just stared in surprise well why havent you killed me it asked i could ask why you have not attacked our other scouts i replied but i already know why you are intelligent and you were being sensible and cautious because of that i caught you with a spell that would have worked with any truly intelligent species a more stupid predator would have just attacked me because i am smaller and look defenseless i do not care to risk injury by attacking dangerous prey if i am not fast fit and strong i will starve to answer your first question i havent killed you because we too are an intelligent species that is obvious i was sent to watch your camp for three nights then report to the rest of the pack you puzzled us you do not hunt yet you do not graze either you are soft and defenseless like grazers yet bright and cunning like hunters yes we would have attacked your camp already otherwise that would have been very very silly our weapons are not claws and teeth but they are still deadly now i know that your species is truly sentient not like the mrran mrran what is that i asked a mrran is the animal that you have adopted into your herdor should i say pack it puzzled me greatly when you did not kill and eat the mrran the others could hardly believe me when i told them we have other uses for the mrran it provides wool to cover us unlike you we have little fur of our own do you understand that yes in a way i pity you for not having a naturally warm glossy thick coat at this it preened a bit what are the other reasons do you remember what happened a couple of days ago vaguely there was a stormand before the storm i was something else as smart as the mrran perhaps maybe even less smart during the storm i changed all those of my pack changed in a way the storm created us as well i explained we make our own food we are neither hunters nor hunted but we are very very dangerous spread the message to your pack leave us alone soon we shall stop and make a thing called a village stay away from it you are most dangerous when you pounce but we are even more deadly when we stop moving i have seen that i slipped the knots on its bonds and it shook itself free in a moment it stood and looked at me after a moment it spoke something in me says i shouldnt respect anything without fur but i respect your kind if they are all as smart as you is this the right thing to feel i wonder i respect your kind i replied but i do not fear them then we are equal and because we are equal i dont think that our peoples should be enemies spoken like a true and intelligent predator if my villagers and your pack can stay friendly then when one of you is sick or injured and needs care i can help help the injured why because it benefits everyone are you intelligent enough to see that if cats could frown it did fighting would bring the pack no benefit it said eventually i assume that you need clear land and nearby water for your village yes we do that is why we have not settled down yet there are too many trees if you continue on for about a day and then turn east you will come to the edge of the forest where the grasslands begin there is a stream running close by we dont like water or open land you are welcome to it thank you i think we shall like it a lot i picked up my pack but it did not move just one last question before i go to my pack do you know what we were before the storm you were cats i guessed all that has been changed is your coloring your intelligence and your size you werent dark green before the storm and you didnt have language and reasoning you certainly werent four yards long i hoped that i had guessed correctly but soon it nodded its head and padded for the trees then it stopped and looked back perhaps sometime we should talk again it suggested it could prevent misunderstandings in the future if you need to speak to me just ask one of my people for me my name is proouw a good suggestion proouw my name is errold i said proouw turned and glided away into the shadows of the forest without another word after i had had the meeting with proouw i went back to the camp and called a meeting i explained what had happened what he had told us and what i had arranged everyone was very happy that we would not be hunted by anything so big and intelligent and that there was a site nearby to build the village on it was felt that looking after proouw and his pack medically was a fair exchange after the meeting was over i just sat and thought i wondered whether the shields hadnt somehow leaked during the storm and changed me like it had changed the cats the old errold would have never even thought of that plan let alone have insisted that he be the one to carry it out and the old errold wouldnt have negotiated like that with proouw but i eventually decided that it was just me doing what everyone did adapting as new things happened to me after a day of traveling and after we turned east we found the spot proouw had mentioned it was perfect for our needs and everyone immediately started talking about what we would do and how the village would be organized and laid out there was also discussion about what the village would be called they eventually decided on a nameerrolds grove it was a big surprise to me but as they explained i had done the most in regard to founding it the stream was named master thomas stream which was just as important as without water there could be no village i was happy and the arrangement with the cats worked out well with proouw and i meeting like ambassadors and the pack chasing mrran in our direction to keep in our flock i had a feeling that the village would last for a long time two thousand yearsor maybe more the cat who came to dinner nancy asire nancy asire is the author of four novels twilights kingdom tears of time to fall like starsand wizards spawn she also has written short stories for the series anthologies heroes in hell and merovingen nights and a short story for mercedes lackeys flights of fantasy she has lived inafrica and traveled the world but now resides in missouri with her cats and two vintage corvairs the last rays of the setting sun struck the multiple small circular windows of the chapel fracturing the light into a myriad sparks dancing on the warm wooden walls and on the altar reulan stood for a long moment caught in the glittering manifestation of the gods greatest gift to mankindlight several village women had finished their task of caring for the interior of the sanctuary only a candlemark ago and the pungent scent of wood polish filled the chapel reulan held a taper in both hands as he stood facing the altar of vkandis sunlord where in colder weather a fire burned on the altar summertime warmth dictated a profusion of red flowers reulan briefly bowed his head in contemplationvkandis source of all comfort light and warmth protector and sustainer of mankind the light faded fractionally reulan stepped close to the altar and as the chapel grew dim with the setting of the sun he lit the large thick candle that stood at the center of the altar darkness should never touch the chapel with some form of light needed at all times to honor the sunlord flickering shadows danced on the chimneyaltar then steadied as the candleflame stabilized the gold image of vkandis on the chimney glittered in that candlelight the features of the image inscrutable but hinting of both power and love reulan bowed his head again in homage to the god made the sign of the holy disk and left the chapel through the door to one side of the altar only a step lay between the chapel and reulans room but the distance might as well have been leagues closing the door he removed the heavy gold chain of sunpriest and then his vestments standing clad in simple black robes he sighed quietly standing silent for a few long breaths mentally moving from his attitude of worship into the mundane world with the night candle lit the chapel secure until the rising sun celebration he could now turn to supper the height of summer was nearly on the village of sweetwater two windows and a door stood open to catch the breeze just enough light lingered for reulan to strike flame to the candles on the table dresser kitchen cupboard and the smaller table that stood beside his narrow cot he gathered up the greens he had picked from his garden added them to the plate where his sausage sat next to a roasted potato and filled a cup with water from the village wellwater so pure and sweet it had given this village its name sitting down at the table he blessed the food he was about to eat and looked up a pair of eyes looked back the candlelight flaming in their depths like golden fire vkandis preserve me he murmured starting at the sight it was a cat a very large and furry cat sitting in the chair opposite as if specifically invited to dinner where in the gods green earth did you come from the cat as was typical of all members of the species gazed back expressionless as a statue having recovered from his surprise reulan examined the cat closely large was a understatement this was possibly the biggest cat he had ever seen and the village of sweetwater was no stranger to champion mousers but here sat an interloper the cats of sweetwater were by and large brown or grey tabbies while his guest sported a coat of light cream a thick mane surrounded the cats face and even without seeing it reulan knew the creatures tail most likely would be a plume you are a big one he observed the cat yawned and resumed its staring begging for dinner are you i dont think i have any mice and i doubt you can while away the evening with a tale or two however the god has been generous this summer and im more than willing to share he cut off a hunk of his sausage and extended it with a delicacy belying its size the cat gently took the offered meat jumped to the floor and settled down to its dinner reulan chewed his own meal thoughtfully the low rumble of a purr filled the room and for an instant reulan was transported back to his fathers barn where he had sometimes sat surrounded by the resident cats all of whom seemed content to lie purring in the sun until night and the hunt were upon them darkness hovered not far away the long summertime dusk deepening outside reulan cleaned his dish put it away and blew out the candle on the cupboard he expected his visitor to be gone when he turned back but no the cat was now busy cleaning his face and whiskers time to go reulan said and reached down to push his guest toward the open door dawn comes early and i must be in bed the cat protested with a deep meow standing stifflegged but finally allowed reulan to escort him out the door he stood facing reulan for a moment a halfaccusing expression on his face and then sat down wrapping his thicklyfurred tail around his front paws the young priest felt a slight twinge of guilt as he closed the door and turned toward his bed tomorrow he would ask around the village to see if anyone knew who might own the cat tonight however with all of sweetwaters barns available the feline could easily find any number of places to hunt and sleep the first light of dawn woke reulan from a deep sleep something heavy lay next to his feet and when he looked down to the end of his bed he was amazed to find the creamcolored tabby curled up in a comfortable ball still sleeping deeply the window he thought absently the cat must have come in through the window last night well see howlong he stays but all that day through the numerous chores reulan completed the day after and the next the cat never stayed far away no matter what he didwhether weeding his garden repairing a few shingles on the chapel and it took some doing to scale the tree nearby to jump across to the roof or taking meditative walks through the fields or forestthe cat kept close to his side no one reulan spoke with could remember seeing such a magnificent beast or one of that particular color he finally admitted the cat had adopted him and felt oddly grateful for the company one evening as he and the cat sat down to supper together reulan heard the distant rumble of thunder he had been expecting a storm for the air had been close and heavy all day and its coming promised some relief from the heat finished with both dinner and toilet the cat disappeared into the night he never stayed away longno chasing down sausages in the night for this fellow far better to wait politely and let the human provide the meal reulan closed the shutters to his room as the wind rose and the temperature started to drop distant lightning became more vivid now and foretold a good soaking overnight rain reulan still didnt see the cat and called out to his companion but saw nothing a faint pang of anxiety tightened his hearthe didnt want the poor fellow to be caught in a downpour another rumble of thunder and one last call cats been out in the rain before he thought and likely will be again trust to the goddess to keep him safe shutting the door reulan slipped into bed blessed himself with thoughts of the god he served and blew out the candle one last prayer for the safety of the cat crossed his mind and then he fell asleep the thunder now overhead and the rain beating down on his roof long years of training and practice woke reulan the next morning before dawn though with his windows shuttered the interior of his room was dark as night he reached for the candle on his bedside table and froze in place a light purr sounded from the end of his bed and the by now familiar weight of the cat shifted ever so slightly beside reulans feet a chill ran up reulans spine as he lit the candle and discovered the cat busily engrossed in his morning bath a quick glance to both windows revealed that the wind had not blown them open during the night and that the door remained securely shut how in the name of vkandis sunlord had the cat managed to get inside youre the oddest fellow ive ever had the occasion to meet reulan said reaching down to scratch his bedmate behind the ears the sound of his own voice helping dispel the strangeness of the situation you must have run in between my feet last night without my knowing it no the cat merely yawned showing sharp white teeth and pink tongue reulan stretched rose from bed and opened his windows and door the storm had indeed cleared the air and this high in the hills even in summer the morning was bracingly cool the cat rubbed up against his ankles meowed pitifully as if he had not eaten in days and planted himself in the chair he had claimed for his own reulan washed his face from the bucket on the cupboard dried off and donned his vestments the rising sun celebration was close at hand he left his room crossed the small chapel and threw open the doors at its west end then standing before the altar he closed his eyes opened his mind to the glory of the god and waited for first light to strike the windows above his head he felt a bump against his leg and quickly opened his eyes the cat sat beside him facing the altar proper as any worshiping villager at first this had somehow bothered reulan but he believed that vkandis cared for all creatures that any who wished to worship the god should be welcome at his altar reulan heard the village farmers arriving and sensed them standing in silent meditation as the first rays of sun struck the windows above lifting his hands reulan spoke the words of morning greeting vkandis sunlord giver of life and light be with us today we praise you we honor you we keep you in our hearts and minds what is good and true help us to do and become what is hateful and cruel aid us in denying we offer this day to you sunlord and seek your blessings on all that we do may it be so responded the voices behind him reulan extinguished the candle that had lit the chapel during the night and turned to face his congregation go forth to daylight knowing the god is by your side the farmers bowed their heads briefly smiled at reulan and silently filed out of the chapel to their various fields and gardens once again the cat rubbed up against his legs meowing pitifully breakfast eh what would you like this morning sir cat i have only what ive given you in the pastsausage id think youd grow tired of it the cat looked up and for a brief moment reulan could have sworn he heard a voice saying well if you must ask id really rather have fish he laughed quietly amused that he had assigned spoken words to an animal and returned to his room and his morning meal the cat following close behind being a sunpriest in a small village required not only knowledge of the ways of vkandis sunlord but also of teaching mending both physical and metaphysical gardening and to a certain extent more than a passing proficiency in healing but one of the most pleasant duties of a priest to reulans mind was the time he spent in silent meditation fixing his mind on the glory and love of the god he served it had become his habit not long after arriving in sweetwater and becoming old beckors assistant priest to spend this time outdoors preferably at high noon when the vkandis power was the greatest the place he set aside for communion with the god was a small clearing in the forest east of the village it was there that reulan turned his footsteps this day his morning chores done and the villagers about their daily tasks he strode along the pathway his mind stilled already slipping into light meditation the cat as usual came along periodically darting off into the bushes then back again the day was especially fine blue sky above and sunlight slanting through the trees reulan rejoiced and marveled at the power of the god that protected the land and its people though apprenticed at an early age to beckor which made his parents proud and additionally relieved them of a mouth to feed he had always felt close to the god somehow he sensed he had been born to thisthat he had been chosen from an early age now with beckor gone to the god and reulan no longer apprenticed his life seemed to have become all it was meant to be the clearing lay just over a rocky rise in the ground reulan could see the sunlight pooling ahead and quickened his pace eager to arrive at his goal reulan snake dont move for a moment reulan thought his heart had stopped he certainly did for anyone who had been born and raised in this area of karse knew the peril of snakes frozen into immobility he looked down to see a large rock snake stretched out on the path in a patch of sunlight only two steps away a cold sweat broke out on reulans forehead the bite of a rock snake was often fatal very carefully and ever so slowly he backed away never taking his eyes from the reptile halfway down the path now and far enough away that the snake posed no immediate danger he started shaking aware just how close to death he had come but who had called out his name who had warned him the cat rubbed up against his leg and sat down well a voice said inside his head the least you could do is thank me reulan stared at the cat feeling his mouth drop open and close your mouth before you catch flies the cat advised cocking his head and twitching his tail around his front paws a talking cat knees suddenly weak reulan glanced around very carefully this time for a place to sit that was not already occupied by a snake sinking down on a small boulder he stared at the cat his pulse racing he had heard old grandmother tales about talking beastsbirds horses catscreatures larger than normal that could speak mindtomind but he had always considered these tales a fine way to while away the long hours of a winter night not truth but now reulan swallowed heavily you talk he finally got out when he had gained control of his voice its fortunate for you that i do the cat retorted but reulan sensed a smile and sincewere now on speaking terms you may call me khar khar certainly no name of any cat he had ever knowncertainly not boots patches puss or any of the other descriptive appellations people gave their cats buthowi mean youre speaking to me likelike a person and this time reulan was certain he heard a laugh we all have ourburdens to bear and yours sunpriest is rudeness you still havent thanked me reulan licked his lips and swallowed again thank you khar i could be dead if you hadnt been with me but why if youd be so kind khar interrupted busy now smoothing down his abundant whiskers id appreciate a small reward i would suggest a fisha large fat fish how catlike despite his confusion and awe reulan smiled trust a feline to always be looking out for itself im sorry khar he said feeling slightly foolish to be talking to a cat sweetwater has no fish and if we wanted fish which most of us dont wed have to depend on traders or go to sunhame itself well now thats an idea lets go to sunhame you and i and you can get me afish reulan stared at the cat unsure if he was being mocked or not sunhame was more than four days walk away not an arduous journey but one he had not particularly contemplated a sudden thought passed through his mind sunhame he hadnt been in the capital city since the final sixmonth period of his training as sunpriest and that had been over three years ago the holy writ required that every person once in his or her lifetime should visit sunhame the most propitious of times to make that journey was at midsummer to be present at the high holy day of summer solstice when the sun stood longest in the sky naturally the journey was even more important for sunpriests who were expected to serve as examples to the populace he mentally figured out the calendar summer solstice was only six days away he could easily make sunhame by then he snorted what was he thinking why should he suddenly leave his village to make a journey to sunhame certainly not for a fish though he knew he owed khar more than a simple meal for saving his life on the other hand the village was as prosperous as a village its size could be its people were healthy and no babies were due besides the village midwife could handle that far better than he a strange fey mood swept over him sunhame why not do you think he asked reaching down to scratch khar under the chin that you could wait a bit to collect your reward long enough for me to set things right in the village and to pack my supplies or do you suggest we leave this very day if feline expressions could be said to duplicate those of human beings khar looked positively disgusted cats reulan he said with monumental dignity are known for theirpatience a few more days certainly wont kill me and so it had been decided reulan had sought out santon the village headman and explained that he would be making a pilgrimage to sunhame to fulfill his obligation to be present at the temple of vkandis sunlord at the summer solstice santon understandably was somewhat taken aback by the suddenness of this decision but reulan had mollified the big farmer by pointing out that the villagers could walk to twotrees the village closest for their own midsummer celebration at that chapel and if anyone was injured or needed medical care two trees was large enough to have its own healer truth to be told another reason surfaced in reulans mind for the journey and that was simple curiosity when traders had come through sweetwater a month ago they had told the villagers that the tragic and untimely death of the son of the sun along with the inability of the seniormost priests of the temple to choose his successor had thrown sunhame into confused anticipation from what the traders said infighting among various factions of the senior priesthood had broken out time and again they had sought a consensus put forward various candidates but had reached no agreement it seemed as if something was blocking a decision that would make everyone happy reulan looked on the infighting among his superiors with a certain amount of disdain politics god he hated politics as a priest it was his duty to worship vkandis and to look after the gods people not to find ways to increase his own standing but if there was any time to journey to sunhame to see the temple again and possibly to be present at the elevation of the new son of the sun this was it and so the following morning reulan set forth carrying a light pack filled with provisions enough to see him there and back the villagers had wished him a good journey and smiled to see their priest and his alwayspresent cat set off down the dusty road to the south long accustomed to physical activity reulan soon settled into his walking stride an easy gait that would carry him to his stopping place for the night without leaving him exhausted he glanced down at khar who trotted alongside and shook his head if he hadnt thought his eyes were deceiving him he would have sworn that khar had grown overnight the biggest cat he had ever seen now appeared even bigger well khar he said conversationally are you happy now were off to sunhame and your fish and possibly more than that was the cats reply reulan waited for khar to continue but the cat fell silent reulan shook his head cats some of the most secretive creatures ever born it ill served a human to attempt to pry information from them even ones who spoke the setting sun to his right reulan and khar entered the next village south of sweetwater his black robes and gold chain of office would grant him food and rest wherever he chose to stop but he aimed for the chapel knowing that faroaks own priest would welcome him for the night and he was correct for as he approached the chapel to attend its own sunset service dhadi stood at the doors waiting for the villagers who chose to attend the service reulan the priest said extending his hand in greeting what brings you to faroaks his eyes fell on the cat who sat at reulans side breathing a bit heavily from the long walk god of light reulan where in the world did you find that cat its absolutely huge reulan glanced at khar and started if possible khar had grown even more during the walk from sweetwater he adopted me he explained lamely feeling as if he had blundered into some story and dhadi only knew the half of it reulan smiled what he hoped was his most disarming smile im on my way to sunhame for the summer solstice and if i could spend the night with you id be most appreciative of course dhadi said come in reulan the suns nearly set and i must light the night candle he looked slightly askance at khar does he follow you even to services hes one of the gods creatures reulan responded if you dont mind hell come with me for a moment reulan thought dhadi would refuse but his fellow priest merely shook his head and gestured inside stranger things have happened he murmured you and your cat are welcome reulan the gods blessing be on both of you after assisting dhadi in celebrating the rising sun and sharing a wholesome breakfast with his fellow priest reulan set out on the road again he had not even reached the fields when he noticed several villagers following after with the breeze at his back he overheard snatches of conversation not a bit of which was devoted to him no it was khar they spoke about finally curiosity triumphed and one of the men trotted up to reulans side begging your pardon sunsray he said dipping his head in an abbreviated bow me and my friends well weve never seen such a cat as the one youve got hes near big as my dog reulan shrugged uncomfortably you think hes big you should see the mice in sweetwater the farmer simply stared oblivious to reulans attempted humor maybe so sunsray but hes one blessed big cat he dipped his head again sunlord guard you on your journey and bless you and your endeavors reulan replied automatically sketching the holy disk symbol to include them all he turned away and set out on the road again khar trotting along at his side once he was out of hearing range he glanced down at the cat youve grown again he accused shifting his pack on his shoulders to a more comfortable position and dont try to deny it perhaps khar replied but maybe youre only seeing better reulan made a face inscrutable as always sir cat i must admit youre beginning to make me nervous if a cat could snort derisively khar did just that spoken by a man who for days nowhas been conversing with a dumb animal a faint blush heated reulans cheeks maybe so khar but somethings going on here that i dont understand why did you adopt me and for the love of the lord of light how is it that you talk khar flicked his tail in high good humor youve been initiated into mysteries priestreulan and aside from your initial shock youve adapted very well who better to ask forfish three days into his journey reulan found the road becoming more crowded no longer did he simply meet farmers going out to their fields or the occasional horsedrawn cart filled with vegetables headed off to market somewhere now he shared the road with welldressed folk who rode horseback or those who walked in groups all seemingly headed to sunhame for the summer solstice as the riders passed bowing in their saddles to a sunpriest he had to endure their comments about the size and beauty of the cat at his side a few even made offers of purchase proposing sums that made reulans head spin as for khar despite his dissembling he had continued to grow the farmers outside faroaks should see him now reulan thought though he had become somewhat accustomed if that word fairly described his state of mind to khars company and to sharing conversations with what everyone else deemed a speechless animal he felt he somehow skirted the edge of mystery that evening stopping in a large village he once again sought out the local sunpriest arriving just in time for the lighting of the night candle he knew the priest here very well his former master beckor had apprenticed jaskhi at one time before reulans entry into the priesthood reulan and jaskhi had become close friends after beckor had died the young priest turning to the older man for wisdom and support so reulan jaskhi said dinner over and the two of them sitting for a moment in the welllit room behind jaskhis chapel khar had curled up at reulans feet purring like approaching thunder youre making your pilgrimage eh better early than late i say youve timed your journey well my friend you should arrive in sunhame the morning of the summer solstice all the inns will be full but you can always find a place to sleep at the temple unless its too full of quarreling priests reulan murmured ah that jaskhi waved a dismissive hand when vkandis wills theyll find their choice obvious and what better day for that to happen than summer solstice i envy you reulan to be present at such an event is something no one would ever forget he ran a hand through his hair now tell me about your cat reulan sighed if one more person asked him about khar he thought he would choke by this time however he had come up with a story of how khar had adopted him he could recite without even thinking about it theres still something strange about that cat jaskhi said unconvinced and i think you know more than youre letting on what do you mean aside from his size which is enough in itself to set anyone back theres a touch of mystery about him as if hes a gateway into somewhere we cant go reulan stared what are you talking about i really dont know jaskhi admitted but ill tell you right nowthis is no ordinary if simply oversized cat cats dont grow that big and ive never heard of one walking beside a human all the way to sunhame he held up a hand no dont say anything im sure im not the first to comment on your cat just remember this reulanthere are more things in this world than even we sunpriests can see and i think youve walked straight into one of them when reulan set out on the last day of his journey he was only hours away from sunhame by now the road had grown congested with people from all walks of life as had become the case yesterday reulan was surrounded by a crowd of people who for all their deference to a sunpriest couldnt refrain from making comments about khar reulan set his face in a proper priestly expression refusing to acknowledge the remarks supposedly made out of his hearing khar of course remained oblivious to the commotion he caused the outskirts of sunhame came into view around a bend in the road a road that was now broad and paved with large flat cobbles as had been the case when reulan had seen it first the capital of karse seemed overwhelming born and raised in the country reulan had found it hard to believe so many people could live in one place the six months he had spent in his final studies before being elevated to the priesthood had not lessened that feeling today was no different the buildings were huge the press of people amazing the noise the confusion the smells and now people were pointing in his direction the crowds created so much noise that reulan could not hear what was being said from the expressions on peoples faces some great lord and his escort had been caught up by the press of people behind him but when he looked over his shoulder all he saw was a sea of faces and each one of them seemed to be staring at him or he admitted uncomfortably at the cat he glanced down at khar who walked very close to him now to avoid being stepped on by the unwary person or horse the cats appearance was slightly differenthis tail face and legs appeared a darker shade of cream but that plume of a tail was held straight up and there was a spring to khars step that reulan had not seen before fish it had to be fish close as sunhame lay to a broad slow moving river and to both ruby lake and its smaller companion lake mist fish would be readily at hand the buildings loomed taller now over three sometimes four stories the closer one drew to the center of sunhame the more impressive the architecture the capital was laid out in the shape of a wheel or a sundisk with the temple holding the center and twelve main roads leading out from that center reulan glanced up and saw faces looking down from many of those windows the noise of the crowd grew even louder and people leaned out from those windows pointing downward vkandis sunlord what was going on once more he glanced over his shoulder certain he would find a procession or something of the sort that could be causing all the commotion again he saw nothing but wideeyed faces staring at him and the cat that walked at his side there are more things in this world than even we sunpriests can see his friend jaskhi had said and i think youve walked straight into one of them reulan quickened his pace the sun was near its zenith and he wanted to be standing with the rest of the people at the temple when the solstice occurred he knew from past experience he was too late to attend the service inside the temple and with no son of the sun to lead the ceremonies the great sanctuary would be packed by senior priests and those who had staked their claims on the best spots to see and be seen he heard someone cry out but couldnt distinguish the words nervous now he kept his eyes straight forward and concentrated on ignoring the growing noise of the crowd though he walked down a clogged street no one bumped into him or for that matter even came close he and khar walked in a small circle of emptiness and that fact alone made reulan more jittery than ever vkandis sunlord he prayed protect me he didnt include khar in that prayer quite certain the cat could more than take care of himself more shouting broke out but reulan couldnt see far enough to tell what was happening but when the road rose upward toward the temple at the highest point in the city he began to see what was going on a crowd of blackrobes redrobes and whiterobes plowed through the crowd swimming upstream as it were against the tide of travelers headed toward the temple reulan swallowed heavily something was happening heresomething of great importance and he didnt have a clue as to what it was im a simple country priest im no one important he pleaded inwardly dont look atme as if i were one of the blackrobes a senior fellow if his gorgeous robes and gold accouterments meant anything turned and all but sprinted toward the temple his fellow priests falling back to let him through the noise of the crowd intensified blending into an excited roar reulan could see the temple now white marble caught and held the sunlight and shone like a flame at nighttime the many steps leading up to the sanctuary gleamed in the sunlight and the gold on the cornices seemed blindingly bright he approached the steps more determined than ever to ignore the uproar the crowd had drawn back from the main entrance to the temple leaving the plaza around it shockingly empty reulan stopped unsure what to do next then something bumped into his leg above the knee the familiar headbutt of his cat but above knee height reulan looked down and his heart gave an absurd little leap in his chest knees trembling feeling faint he stared at his feline companion in place of the cat who had journeyed with him from sweetwater stood a creature straight out of legend one every child had heard about in tale after tale the creamcolored body was still there but no tabby markings marred its hue now a brickred mask legs and tail graced the cream and the eyes o vkandis sunlord the eyes were blue the blue of a cloudless sky a blue so deep he felt he could have fallen into their depths and kept falling forever a firecat khar he breathed knowing the cat would hear o lord of lightkhar is that you steady reulan khar said rubbing his cheek against reulans leg take a few deepbreaths and everything will be fine the noise of the crowd shut off as if someone had taken a knife to it separating one moment of clamor from the next instant of total silence reulan stood rooted in place lifting his eyes to the steps leading up to the sanctuary a procession had formed at the top of those steps that consisted of the seniormost priests of the land who were now slowly headed down toward where reulan stood though every muscle in his body quivered screaming at him to turn and run he could not move his mouth grew dry and he feared he would choke on the avalanche of emotions that gripped his heart the procession stopped a few steps from where he stood the expressions on the faces of the priests one of uniform awe it had become so quiet now he could hear khars rumbling purr as one every priest facing him bowed low two of them approached one removed reulans pack and the other fastened a cloak about his shoulders a cloak heavily encrusted with gold and sungems reulan could hardly breathe at this point his mind whirling out of control and his heart beating so loud he was sure the entire plaza could hear it then from the center of the procession stepped the seniormost priest of all who had gathered here a man his master beckor had acknowledged as one of the purest souls in the capital an old man white hair gleaming in the sunlight and eyes wide with awe the priest bore in his hands the great golden crown of the son of the sun reulan briefly closed his eyes this couldnt be happening it was utterly impossible he had never had any desire to do more than minister to his people and vkandis has chosen the old man called out his voice surprisingly clear and more than loud enough to be heard by those who had gathered in the plaza he lifted the crown and set it on reulans head at the very moment the sun reached its zenith in the sky for an instant reulan forgot to breathe and then the glory descended light golden light light that filled him like water poured into an empty vessel light that lifted him out of himself into a place where no darkness could ever come he was enfolded by light consumed by light cradled by light he was the fiery wick on a brilliant candle the size of the universe he cried out voicelessly in the presence of that light protesting that he could not be worthy and the light responded not in words but in something far beyond words comfort came with those words along with a feeling of subtle good humor could he question the will of vkandis could he possibly know more than the god and what if vkandis required a simple country priest to lead his people the light if possible intensified and coursed through his veins like fire his heart expanded accepting the love and wisdom of the god who touched him he bowed before that presence accepting the choice of the god he loved and suddenly he saw again with the eyes of flesh the silence in the plaza beat at his ears with the same intensity that the roar of the crowd had possessed not long agoa lifetime ago he felt khars shoulder snug against his leg heard the firecats soothing purr the crown on his head should have weighed enough to bend his neck but he felt nothing heavier than the touch of a gentle hand he stared at the crowd that stood in a circle around him no one moved or spoke he turned slowly looking from person to person and his heart quivered in his chest at what he saw behind those who faced him stretched their shadows as if he were a lamp lit in the darkness and they had turned toward his light khar butted his head against reulans leg again he glanced down at the firecat seeing true affection dancing in those very blue eyes well reulan were here at last now can i have my fishwinter death by michelle west michelle west is the author of numerous novels including the sacred hunter duology and the sunsword series which will be concluded with the publication of the sun sword in january she reviews books for the online column first contacts and less frequently for the magazine of fantasy sciencefiction other short fiction by her has appeared in dozens of anthologies most recently in the sorcerersacademy apprentice fantastic once upon a galaxy familiars and vengeance fantastic kayla was born in the harsh winter of life in the mining town of riverend her father had been born there and her mother had come from the flats of valdemars most fertile lands an outsider she had learned to face the winter with the same respect and the same dread that the rest of the villagers showed she had come to be accepted by the villagers in the same way slowly and grudgingly at first but with a healthy respect that in the end outlasted all of their earlier superstitious fear of the different margaret merton called magda for reasons that kayla never quite understood was different she could walk into a room and it would grow warmer she could smile and her smile would spread like fire her joy could dim the sharpest and bitterest of winter joy could dim the sharpest and bitterest of tempers when cabin fever ran high how could they not learn to love her even in her absence that memory remained and when her daughter showed some of the same strange life she was loved for it more for the fact that she was born to the village the heralds came through the village of riverend in the spring when the snows had receded and the passes in the steep roads and treacherous flats of the mountains were opened heralds seldom stopped in the village although they rode through it from time to time when they did kayla took the little ones from the hold and made her way down to the village center to watch them ride through she would bundle them one at a time in the sweaters and shawls that kept the bite of spring air at bay and gently remind them of foreign thingsmanners behavior the language children should use in the presence of their elders she would remind them of the purpose of heralds and promise them a story or two if they behaved themselves and then she would pick up the children whose toddling led them to cracks in the dirt sprigs of new green sodden puddlesin fact anything that caught their eye from the moment the holds great doors were openedand hurry them along in that way she managed to keep them from missing the heralds altogether this spring was the same but it was also different every gesture was muted and if she smiled at all it was so slight an expression that the children could be forgiven for missing it it had been a harsh winter a terrible winter and the winter had taken the joy out of kayla so completely the villagers mourned its passing and wondered if it was buried with those who had passed away in the cold on this spring day the heralds stopped as the children gathered in as orderly a group as children could who had been cooped up all winter there were two a man and the woman who rode astride the companions that set them apart from any other riders in the kingdom of valdemar well met the woman said nudging her companion forward at a slow walk kayla heard the whisper that started at one end of the small group and traveled to the other she almost smiled almost mitchell and evan began to shove each other out of the way in an attempt to be at the front of the group kayla set tess down and separated them grabbing an elbow in either hand she didnt need to speak her expression said everything bells caught light and made of sound a musical cacophony which was not in fact dissimilar to the sound it evoked from the children whose quarrels fell away in the wake of shared wonder well almost all of the quarrels at any rate there was still some scuffling for position with its attendant shoving and hissed accusation given everything this was almost angelic behavior it wouldnt be good enough for the old aunts but it was good enough for kayla two years ago she would have asked for moreand gotten it toobut two years ago behavior had seemed so much more important than it was now these children were the children of winter and the winter was harsh she knew that if half of them lived to be eight the village would count itself lucky if half of those lived to be fifteen it would count itself more than that the herald an older woman with broad hips and an easy smile watched the children from the safe distance of her companions back her companion on the other hand had no difficulty wandering among the many outstretchedand upstretchedhands the second companion seemed to have a more obvious sense of personal dignityor at least a healthy caution when it came to children it was hard to say which her rider was a handful of years older than kayla if at all but his face was smooth and unblemished by either time or war and he seemed both grave and dignified in a way that reminded her of her dead riverend was a harsh northern town the dead were many youngling the older herald barked her voice loud but not unfriendly mitchell leaped up about six feet straining to look much older than his handful of years yes maam the young man who rode at her side laughed maam is it his glance belied the gravity of his expression kayla liked the sound of his voice obviously i dont look as young as id like to think i do ah well time is cruel her smile showed no disappointment at that cruelty as she looked down at mitchell you know the people of the village by name he nodded good im wondering where kayla grayson lives mitchell lifted a hand and pointed toward the large hold will she be down at the mines or up at the hold he frowned neither kayla said nothing but she felt it a change in the older womans mood and intent there were currents in it now that were deeper than they should have been she snuck a glance at the man and listened carefully there too she felt a determination that was out of place it put her on her guard why are you looking for kayla she asked weve heard a bit about her and wewell i at leastthought it would be nice to meet her on our way through riverend we dont often get much call to travel this way what have you heard well for one that shes magda mertons daughter the last of four and the one most like her mother kayla hesitated a moment and hid that hesitation in the action of lifting a child to the wide wide nostrils of a very patient companion she had the grace to wince and pull back when the childs first act was to attempt to shove his whole hand up the left one thats true she said at last at least that shes the last of her daughters youll have to judge for yourself how much alike they actually are she straightened her shoulders shifting her burden again with an ease that spoke of practice because im guessing you knew my mother the heralds expression shifted it didnt matter kayla already knew what the woman was feeling surprise concern hope so youre kayla and you anne the woman replied she reached out with a hand and after only a slight hesitation kayla shifted the boy to one hip freeing one of hers she shook the heralds hand and then turned to face the quieter young man if you want to join us theres food but ill warn you its spare we can offer you news or trade or waterbut we barter for most of our food and only widow davis has stores enough to entertain important guests the heralds exchanged a look and then the young man smiled were well provisioned wed be happy to offer food for our discussion or news he meansand is too polite to say itgossip but kayla felt the twinge of guilt that hid beneath the surface of those cheerful words and her eyes fell to the saddlebags that his companion bore without complaint it occurred to her that the companions and their heralds seldom carried much food with them for the villages who fed and housed them were reimbursed for their troubles and at a rate that made it especially appealing for the poorer towns but when the man dismounted and unstrapped the bags from the side of his companion she knew she just knew that they had been brought solely to be offered to riverend and she didnt like it although she couldnt say why your pardon he said dipping his head slightly for my manners my name is carris and her name she asked staring at his companion the herald smiled her name is arana she is a queen among companions and knows it he added ruefully kayla nodded quietly and turned away the hold is dark even at this time of day there is only one room with good windows shall i send for the mayor no no that isnt necessary its really an informal visit anne frowned and yes i did know your mother she was a very very stubborn woman you know that she died anne nodded and there was a very real weariness in the movement aye i know it but she added no more instead she turned to her companion and began to unstrap her saddlebags as well they were equally heavy i wont lie to you kayla anne said as she took a seat while kayla set to boiling water for the tea and herbal infusions that the southerners often found too thin or too bitter i did not know your mother well this has been my circuit for a number of years and although were often sent out on different routes we become familiar with the villages along the kings roads your mother wasnt the mayor but she was the center of riverend i never met a woman with a cannier sense of the dangers of living in such an isolated placeand i grew up a few towns off the holderkin so im aware of just how dangerous those fringes can be but your mother had a great love for your father and for the lands that produced him and she had a gift as well aclear understanding of people she hesitated and kayla felt it again that low current beneath the words that seemed to move in a different direction from their surface a clearer understanding than perhaps most of us have she waited carris said nothing but he did clear his throat weve brought a few things that the village will find useful he said at last looking to just one side of her face as if his dark and graceful gaze had become suddenly awkward magda often asked for aid for the rough times andandshe made it clear what was needed there are medical herbs and unguents here there are potions as well there are bandages and cleansing herbs as well as honest tea theres salted dried meat in the second bag a lot of it which might help the harvest in the mainland has beenpoor this year theres also some money in the last bag you shouldnt be telling me this kayla said quietly you should talk to widow davis shes the mayor hereabouts or what passes for one shell know what to do and shell be very grateful to you both they exchanged another glance well then maybe youd better call for the widow davis after all kayla smiled politely if you think she isnt already on her way you dont know riverend all that well but kayla knew something was wrong the widow davis did indeed arrive she scattered the children with a sharp inquiry about the current state of their chores and an even sharper glance at the children who had the temerity to tell her they wanted to stay with the companions and then eyed the saddlebags the heralds carried with an obvious and deep suspicion kayla go mind the children if you cant teach them to heed their duties no one can ill deal with the strangers kayla felt her jaw go slack but she hid the surprise that had caused it as she nodded to the widow and retreated these were heralds not medicants and she had never heard the widow davis be rude to a herald before she was glad that the children had been sent back to their work she did not see the heralds leave but when she had time to glance outside again they were gone the white of their uniforms and the white of companion coats little glimpses into the heart of winter a hint of the future and when she at last tucked in for bed she fought sleep with a kind of dread that she hadnt felt since she had slept in the arms of her own mother at a time of life so far removed it seemed centuries must have passed the nightmares had been strong then they were strong now many of the village children dreamed they found a place in her lap when they wished to make sense of all the things that occurred only after they closed their eyes and she had spent years listening with both wonder and envy to the hundreds of broken stories that occupied their dreamscapes not so her own she had two dreams there was a black dream and a white dream set against the mountains winter as a child the black dreams were frightening bewildering she would wake from sleep to search for her mother it never took long her mother would come precious candle burning and sit by the side of her bed what did you dream of kayla the dragon she had never seen a dragon the stories that the old wives told described them as terrible ancient beasts who had long since vanished from the face of the free lands books in the hold were so rare they were seldom seen and books with pictures tipped in were rarer still but there was something in the shape of shadow that reminded her of those pictures what was he doing crying ah try not to listen too carefully kayla dragon tears are a terrible thing i thinkhes lonely her mothers smile was shallow even by candlelight dragons are lonely they sit on their cold cold gold their hard jewels and they never come out to play he would she would tell her mother if he could find us i think it best that he never find us kayla riverend is no place for such a creature the white dreams were different the snows were clearer and cleaner and the pines that guarded the pass stretched beyond them to cut moonlight and hide it but the light was strong enough to see by and she always saw the same thing the white horse he was the color of snow of light on snow and in the hold in this place just one edge of rock and mountain where spring came and went so quickly and summers stretch was measured in weeks snow was the color of death even as a child she had understood that he did not speak to her until her father died you can talk yes a little it is difficult now but i heard your voice little one i heard yoursinging singing aye song a dirge i think to break the heart for its softness i heard you sing yearsago and your song was so light and so joyful i waned all of my compatriots to stand tolisten to feel there was such love in that song and in this one in this one too she knew what he spoke of and said nothing but looked down at the back of her hands they were childs hands smooth and unblemished by calluses and dirt because it was a dream she did not ask him how he had come to hear her hearts song if i asked you to come with me what would you do and because she understood something of the nature of dreaming she allowed herself to be honest if you had asked me as a child i would have tendered a childs answer but i have children now and they need me greatly and you are not a creature to be confined to a place like riverend he had met her eyes with eyes she thought that saw whole lives as if they were the course rivers ran beginning to end and he might map them out might remark on where the rapids lay and where the oceans at last waited for the movements of rivers to cease and he said tonight then dear heart i will not ask but she knew that the time was coming when he would and she was afraid of it because riverend was her home and she wanted to leave he came to her often in her dreams after that and she spoke with him he with her but his was not the only dream which changed for one night huddled alone in the cold she dreamed the black dream and it was different the dragon took flight it searched it searched for her she could hear it roar when it opened its lips and its voice was a song of death and desire and when it sang she heard over voices as well thin and terrible the wailing of children of grown men reduced to that earlier state of women whose losses were so profound that silenceeven the silence of the grave seemed to offer mercy they were lost these voices she knew it they were lost to the devourer the shadow the dragon and if she were not careful if she were not silent as mouse and hidden in the darkness of a holds small room it would find her it would consume her and it would add her voice to its song she woke sweating her voice raw the walls of the hold were solid but she could hear footsteps in the halls beyond her room they paused a moment outside her door but no one knocked no one entered her mother was gone after that she dreamed of the darkness often it grew stronger and stronger and she weaker on the morning of the worst of these dreams the heralds had come with their ominous gifts and she had left them with widow davis tonight the darkness had not yet fallen across the field of her vision he was waiting for her cold beauty she felt the howl of winter wind through passes closed by snow and storm memory of spring and summer faded until only the cold remained essential and eternal the ice glittered from the heights of the mountains peaks caught light in a skirt around the fringes of the evergreens that stretched a hundred feet in height to the edge of her vision the snow did not swallow him is weight did not bear him down down through the thin crust of snow silent he waited for her as he always waited but it was different tonight and she knew it she said you cannot carry an oathbreaker he met her gaze and held it but she heard no voice and she found the absence unsettling for in dreams like these she had spoken to him for much of her life did you send the heralds did they bring gifts that were meant to take my place he offered no reply and she was afraid her arms were cold the day was fading night in the mountains was bright if not brighter by moonlight but the colorswinter colors to be surewere leached from the landscape until only shades of gray remained beneath the black and white of sky and star this is no dream she said quietly the question a shadow across the words he nodded she did not know what to feel the winter had settled deep within her in the morning he came he came after breakfast had been prepared but before the miners had gathered in the hold the sun cut crisp long shadows against the sparse growth the children carried word of his presence from one end of the village to the other but they came in numbers to where kayla cleaned the heavy ceramics that held the morning porridge kayla quietly washed and dried her hands while smaller hands tugged at her aprons hem and strings theres a companion in riverend tess said her dark eyes wide and round i know kayla told her softly bending and gathering her in shaking arms its got no herald evan added lts got no rider i know kayla replied she straightened everyone wants to see it do you think its come searching aye little i think its come searching for who tess asked insistent and unaware of the stillness of kaylas expression do you think hell take evan away evan was her older brother by about four years not yet too bad she laughed im sure evan thinks so too but do you think hes lost his herald do you think he needs help do you think i think she said that hell have died of old age before i can see him if i answer all your questions first just one more one more do you think hell let me ride no little i think youll fall off his back and companions arent in the business of visiting villages just to injure the dearest of their people she kissed the girls forehead just as she would have once kissed the forehead of her youngest tess wrapped her arms around kaylas neck but what do you think he wants i think she said quietly that well find out soon now hush widow davis was there in the clearing by rivers side the river itself cold and loud was a thin one but it was clear and the water fresh she looked up when kayla approached her eyes narrowed and wrinkled by exposure to wind to cold and yes to the scant sun well then she said youve heard iveheard your mother told me the widow said turning back to her bucket told you to be careful of the companions theyre not evil widow davis no im certain of it all of our stories say so and theyve come to the aid of the village at least three times in my living memory she was silent a moment but this will be the first time they take more than they offer widow davis the old womans look stopped her flat come on then youre here and we might as well have it out she offered kayla an arm kayla shifted tess to one side and took it together they crossed the uneven ground that led from stream to the shadows cast by the tall white companion caparisoned in livery of blue and sliver belled so his movements might evoke a sense of music a sense of play but his eyes were dark and large as the palms of a childs hand and he did not blink when he turned his massive head toward the two women children dogged their steps crossed their shadows whispered eagerly and quickly amongst themselves not even the dour expression of the widow davis could silence them completely the widows hand tightened kaylas arm began to tingle she did not however ask the old woman to let go hes here for you girl the woman said pulling her arm free kayla looked up at the companion and then she reached out with her free hand her fingers stopped inches from his nose and she let that hand fall she said quietly do i have to go with you he looked into her eyes and said in a voice that made all song seem flat and thin the choice is yours i have waited long for this day i have waited bright heart and promised myself that iwould let you lead the life the mountain would give you but i have heard your cries from across the continent i have been with you whenyou buried your dead when you cradled the living that you knew you could not hold on to she looked up at his eyes his gaze never wavered you know that this choice is no choice he was silent a moment she thought he would offer no answer and then quietly he said better than you would understand because the choice has always been yours to make because the companions choose yes and the heralds they are chosen but they feel the bond and they desire it and they accept it for allthat it is all that it can be and my oath she asked him voice steady arm now drawing on an young child for support there are oaths that are made that cannot be kept in the manner that their makerenvisioned if a child promises to love you and only you for all of forever could you holdhim to that vow would you desire it i was no child when i made that vow dear heart he said gently you are barely an adult now and you made that vowwhen your older brother moved away long before you had husband or children he stepped forward and she shied away because she wanted what he offered because she had never wanted anything so badly i choose you kayla she heard the song of his name although she had never asked it of him and he had never offered itas if they both understood in the dreams of her youth that his name was a binding they had avoided by careful dance until this moment darius widow david coughed the old womans face was set in its harshest lines in the distance children that had been silent until that moment surged forward as kayla did they came in a press of small bodies eager and excited but she knew that they would understand it truly later for now all they said was youre to be chosen kayla youre going to be a herald will you wear white will you have a sword will you have a bow she answered all questions gravely until one lone boy spoke evan will you come back yes she said fiercely often i will come back with a saddlebag full of northern toys and treats and books and i will come at the edge of winter just before they close the passes like some foolish green merchant darius had saddlebags she knew without looking that they were full full enough for a long journey widow davis she said softly can you do without me the old woman had some mercy aye she said gruffly we did before your mother came we managed she started to say something else and then stopped they must need you kayla they must need you even more than we do kayla said nothing because she knew a lie when she heard it what could they need from her that a hundred other girls couldnt give them they had heralds fulltrained they had soldiers they had lords ladies kings they had so much and riverend had so little ill be back she whispered widow davis met her eyes without blinking and then to kaylas astonishment the old woman stepped forward and wrapped arms around her shoulders come back child she said although it had been years since she had called kayla a child come back whole kayla flinched she felt her eyes sting widow davis youve not come back to us with the spring we missed your song in the winter it may be that you need what it is he offers it may be hell help you to sing for us again kayla buried her face in the old womans shoulders before lunch that day she was on the road her neck was cramped shed done nothing but gaze backward over her shoulder until not even the hills that were home to riverend could be seen in the distance all of her life lay in that village or beneath it all of the things she valued promise me kayla that youll stay promise me that youll take care of riverendwhen im gone i promise mother but you wont be gone for a long time will you not if i have anything to say about it of course she hadnt riding was nothing like it had been in her dreams it was hard work and painful she could feel darius rueful smile she could not see his face of course they need me you know she told him the accusation soft i am sorry dear heart but so do we why that i cannot tell you yet but you will understand i fear as we approach the city what city the kings city he told her quietly the capital or whats left of it what do you mean darius darius didnt answer are we at war we are always at war kayla but the battlefields shift and change with time he had to tell her what to do for him when they stopped by the waystations left for herald use she did not know how to brush him water him blanket him was not familiar with the food that he ate everything about the life beyond riverend was strange and unexpected but sleep was bad every night she spent away from the hold she spent beneath the great unfurled wings of the shadow beast the devourer she knew that she would never have the white dreams again darius would nudge her out of sleep and she would cry out reach for him and then stop letting her hands fall away i dont see you in my dreams anymore the words shook as much as her hands did i know will i ever yes kayla but it was never easy to reach through your dreams to you it takesgift talent but youwhen i dreamed of you i didnt dream of theof theother i would claim that as my action but there will be too much between us to endure alie if you found peace and haven from thefrom your dreams it was not a haven i couldcreate not then not now if i not been meant for you if i had not known of you when you were a child i wouldnever have been able to breach the barriers set byi he fell silent and after an awkward pause she asked how did you know of me i heard you you traveled through riverend no but i heard you i heard your fear and your terror i heard your sorrow i heardyour song your song is powerful my mother used to tell me song was my gift did she interesting song is the only way that i have seen you use your gift yousing and others listen you listen and you hear the harmonies and disharmonies that arehidden in a speakers voice but that is not your gift kayla what is his mane flew as he shook his head the dreams are worse yes she knew that that was as much an answer that he would offer and it made her uneasy she said simply my mother told me i was safe as long as i was in riverend you were safe there but others are not he was silent while she gathered her things only when she was safe upon the height of his back did he continue what you dream ofitis true in a fashion we are closer to it we will draw closer still i amsorry on the fourth day she woke from dreaming with darius muzzle in the side of her neck she was sweating although it was cold and he caught the edge of her rough woolen blankets in his perfect teeth and pulled them more tightly around her his eyes were dark his gaze somber darius she whispered when she could speak past the rawness in the throat i heard bells he was silent not bells like yours not bells like the ones youre decorated with but bells loud and low i know there are no bells here are there no not on these roads the next village is half a days hard riding away what are they you know kayla and she did although she did not know how death bells tell me he shook his head it is forbidden for me to tell you what they are you will know wewill reach the capital in the next two days as he spoke the hairs on the back of her neck rose she thought of riverend of tessa and evan of mitchell of the widow davis for no reason at all she wanted to weep the first large town that kayla entered seemed so vast she assumed it was the capital darius laughed but his laughter was gentle enough that it reminded her of her fathers amusement at her younglings antics a lifetime ago but its sosobig it is big yes but it is not a city the town is large that building there thathouses the mayor and his family and that that is as close to a cathedral as you will find but this is a tenth a twentieth of the size of the city you will enter when wekayla she sat frozen across his bare back her legs locked so tightly her body was shuddering kayla she could not even shake her head her mouth when it opened was too dry to form words darius kayla what is wrong the screaming cant you hear it the screaming kayla kayla she was on her feet not his back not his feet she could not remember sliding from the complicated bits and pieces of baubles that announced his presence and his station so eloquently the cobbled streets passed beneath her she noticed them only because they felt so strange to her feet so unnatural beneath open sky the screaming was so loud she could hear no other words although she thought she could glimpse from the corners of her eyes the opened mouths and shocked faces of the strangers she hurtled past pushed through she was through the doors and into the light before she realized that she had entered the cathedral that she stood in the slanting rays of colors such as she had never seen captured in glass a man ghostly and regal illuminated her and the ground upon which she stood she stopped only a moment because given a choice between beauty and terror beauty could not hold her she knew what she heard she knew it the cathedral was an open empty place of light and space with benches and an altar at the end of the apse she ran down it boots pounding the ground footsteps echoing in heights she would never have dreamed possible in riverend and she forgot to feel small to feel humble she knew she had to read the person whose screams were so terrible and soon or it would be too late and she never once stopped to wonder what too late meant she found him it wasnt easy there were doors secreted in the vast stone walls beautifully oiled and tended that nonetheless seemed like prison doors they opened into a room so small curled against wall and floor huddling in the corner was a man a stranger in riverend strangers were always eyed with suspicion greeted with hearty hospitality and an implacable distance she had shed both of those the moment she had heard his terrible cry and she heard it still although she could seewith wide eyesthat his lips were still but his eyes were wider than eyes should be and they stared ahead to her sightless as if he had gone blind kayla be careful darius voice she realized then what was so wrong so cutting about this mans cry of terror it reached her the same way that darius words did in a silence that spoke of knowledge and intimacy without thought she bent to the man huddled against the floor and without thought she tried to lift him realized that lifting him would strain the muscles she had built in the hold lifting even the largest of the children he was not a small man and she was a small woman but determination had always counted for something always she caught him in her arms caught his face in her hands as his head sought the cradle of arms and breasts his screaming was terrible but hers was louder longer as insistent as his own look at me he whimpered but the sound was a real sound a thing of throat and breath and lips his eyes glassy brown deep shifted and jerked upward now seeking her face the darkness he whispered the darkness the emptiness ive lost them ive failed them all for a large man his voice was small tiny she should have been terrified then but as he spoke she felt what he felt and she knew knew that she had passed through it herself her own children were gone and she was young enough that the visiting merchants never realized that she had had a husbandgone tooand a family that she had had everything she had desired in her youth and what was the point of that desire but pain in the end what was the point her children had not disappeared in the mining accidents that killed the men when the men did die they had not gone missing in the terrible snows that could strand a person feet away from the doors of the hold and bury them there as a taunt a winter cruelty no she had held them she had held them just as she had held this man in this dark cramped room in this empty place that had no words of comfort to offer her the cabin in which she had lived was hallowed by the terrible silence of their absence she might walk from room to roomfor there were only threeand listen furtively to catch their ghostly voices this was the way she evoked memory and memory in this dark place this gloom of log and burning wood and little lightfor light let in coldwas unkind it led her into darkness and that darkness might have devoured her if her mother had not held her held on to her filled the emptiness with her words and the blessed sound of her voice mothers pain always she spoke to this stranger she spoke to this man who understood who was somehowat this instanta part of all the losses she had faced and as she did she opened her eyes to a dream heard the voice of the devourer all his voices the cries of terror and emptiness promise me kayla promise me you will stay and protect riverend promise me i promise i promise mother i promise she forgot the cathedral then forgot the lines of this strangers face she held him as if a storm raged just beyond her bent shoulders her bowed back she found voice she sang she sang to him and the singing did what the words she had spokenfor she was aware that words had left her lips aware that they were a failure before she had finished speaking themcould not dark eyes turned to her dark eyes saw her the agony written and etched in terrible lines across a gray face shifted as eyes she would have sworn couldnt grow any wider did he clung to her his face made her breasts ache her spine curved in until it was almost painful just to sit but she sat she sat and the priest came she heard his voice at a distance she heard his words as if they were spoken from within her he was praying after a moment she joined him although she didnt know the words that he spoke hers were as heartfelt and they were all she had to offer come home she whispered kissing the sweaty damp strands of this strangers hair stroking his face as if it were the fevered face of her eldest come home darius was waiting for her companions it seemed were not considered beasts of burden in even the grandest of venues he stood in the light of the windows as if he were a dream he walked forward slowly as the priest helped the man to his feet kayla he said gravely what you did here was bravely done what did i do she whispered softly what you were born to do the priest was staring at her she turned to him and bowed iim sorry she stammered butii he shook his head he came to this place seeking help and you came to this place offering aid that we could not offer do not apologize child but she shook her head i dont know i dont know whatwhat i did you saved him the priest whispered i was so certain he closed his eyes a moment she thought he might retreat into prayer again but he shook himself free of the words and when he stood she saw that he was over six feet tall his shoulders wide and broad as her fathers had once been before the mines there are others he said after a moment he turned and bowed to her companion she is your chosen the companion nickered softly but she wears no white no gray child can it be that you have not yet made your journey to the collegium ino i think were on the way there might i askif its not too muchthat you come to the infirmary she looked at darius darius was absolutely silent as if he were adornment to the statues the windows the altar of this place her decision then she nodded he led her through the cloisters she realized later that this was a courtesy to darius darius was comfortable in the apse but once the halls narrowed movement would be restricted and it was clear what the companionno her companionthought of that she even smiled felt a moment of almost gentle amusement until she glanced at the older mans face care had worn lines from his eyes to his lips and she thought that no matter what happened in future they were there to stay they grew deeper as he left the cloister deeper still as he walked down a hall and stopped in front of a door that was slightly ajar here he said quietly she nodded and opened the door and stopped there beneath the lintel staring there was more than one room she could see that clearly in the streaming light of day and there were beds bedrolls makeshift cots with only barely enough room between them to allow a man passage each of the beds was occupied darius kayla the word was urgent but real she was afraid i canti cant go in there she whispered kayla but the door was no protection it was open she could hear weeping whimpering screaming her hand caught the frame of the door and her fingers grew white as she held it bright heart darius said firmly see with your eyes hear with your ears hear onlywith your ears she drew a deep breath squaring her shoulders see she thought with your eyes she could do that she could look men lay abed women there were children as well although they were mercifully few they gazed up at the ceiling of the room or at the walls their eyes unblinking they did not move their lips were still she shook her head to clear it of the sounds of despair and as she did the priest gently pushed his way past her they have been this way he said softly for weeks they will eat what we feed them and drink when we offer them water we can clean them wash them bathe them but they will not rise or move on their own they do not speak some of them have families in this town butbut most of their families can only bear to visit for the first few days he walked over to one of the beds and set upon its edge heavily more and more of my people are brought here every day and throughout the town there are others whose families can afford the cost of their care theythey have no fever none no rash no bleeding no outward sign of illness but they are gone from us he looked up met her eyes the man that youyou found today would have joined them by evening at the latest how do you know ive seen it i know the signs all of us do but we have no doctors who can aid us no healers who can reach them he closed his eyes opened them again what did you do herald she shook her head nnothing andand im notnot a herald she walked into the room to shed the weight of the bleak hope in his eyes and as she did she passed a small cot and stopped before it frozen it held a young child eyes wide hair damp against his forehead were it not for the slack emptiness of his features he would have been beautiful she forgot darius forgot his words she listened with her heart and her heart shuddered and nearly broke from the weight of what it heard she had once been near the mines when a shaft had collapsed the roar of falling rock had deafened her the shouts of fear of terror the commands for action had done the same and through it all one guilty thought had kept her still she should not have come here children were not allowed by the mines but she had wanted to see her father standing in this room at the foot of this anonymous cot she felt the same deafness and the same guilt some part of her urged her to turn to run but she ignored it because she had heard it for most of her adult life what loss could she suffer that she had not suffered she took a step and then another pushing her way forward as if through a gale until she stood by the childs side and then she reached for him he was not large she did not know if he had once been chubby as children his age often were he was not that now he weighed almost nothing she lifted him as she had lifted one other sick child almost two years ago he was screaming now in the silence behind her silence and she joined him because it was the only way she knew to answer the memories that even now threatened to break her her son mommmmmmmeeeeeee her child mommmmmeeeeee her own son had not wept or cried or struggled the fever had spared him terror and he understood in the height of its grip that she held him in the safety of her arms almost unconsciously she shifted her grip on this stranger until it was the same embrace her shoulders were curved forward her spine rounded at the top as if hunched over him she might hide from the death that was waiting waiting in the winters depths she placed her lips against his forehead and tasted salt she was crying he was screaming but she knew how to comfort terror by now her arms tightened and she began to rock him gently back and forth whispering his name her sons name as if they were the same it happened suddenly his arms jerked and trembled as he tried to lift them she did not know how long he had lain in that cot inactive but his hands were so weak they were like butterfly wings against her neck the dragon he whispered his voice a rasp a creak the dragon will eat us no she told him firmly the dragon cant land he can only fly making night wherever he goes he can roar he can scream but he cant land he hates us aye she replied she had never lied to her children she felt no need to lie to this one he hates all living things all happy things and as she said those words she felt the truth of them although she had never thought to speak them before the boys hands touched her cheeks you were scared he whispered no but you were you have tears on your face she could not dry them both of her hands were occupied with his scant weight but she turned to the priest who was watching in utter silence you can breathe now she said the priests eyes were wide herald he said again and this time she did not correct him can you reach the others i no she frowned it was darius voice dariuswhy you are exhausted kayla you are lightheaded you you will put yourself at graverisk if you attempt to proceed these people have lain immobile for some weeks and thetownspeople are decent they will care for them but if we do not reach the capital before he finds you they will have no way back before who finds me darius was silent she drew the boy up in her arms into a hug her arms were as gentle as she could make them in a grip so tight she felt his bony chin in the hollow between her neck and her shoulder and the weight of it resting there was everything she desired for that moment but this is how she had quieted her sorrow she had filled it with life small life the immediacy of children where are his parents she asked the priest he has no parents i am sorry they passed away a year and a half ago in the summer crippling plague his family he was their only child they were newly married his grandmother is in the town to the east she is his only living relation it is why he was herewhen it happened she pulled the boy away from her chest and her neck held him out so that she could meet his serious brown eyes he was so damn thin daniel she said softly my name is kayla i know i am going to the capital i am going to learn how to become aa herald he was too tired to look awed and she loved him for it was afraid of that emotion because she knew it should not have come so quickly so easily for a stranger but i dont want to leave you here alone i dream of the dragon i have always dreamed of the dragon he hunts me in my sleep but he has never caught me never once if you wantif you would likeyou can come with me kayla that is not allowed i dont give a damn the boy slid his arms around her neck and held her tightly and that was his entire answer she turned to the priest a mixture of defiance and possessiveness lending strength to the soft lines of her face i cannot help them all she said quietly not yet but i promise if it is in my power that i will and wondered what the word of an oathbreaker was worth looked at the childs head his messy hair the wax in his ears that hadnt been cleaned out by whoever had been attending him and knew that the word was everything mother forgive me forgive me i will return to riverend when i am done i am taking this child with me she told the priest she almost lied she almost told him that if she didnt he would lapse back into his state of wideeyed immobility but she didnt believe it will you take him into safety herald call me kayla kayla grayson will you take him into safety kayla or into danger if you ride toward the capital you will find thisdiseaseis far more prevalent as you approach the palace we have had care of him for two weeks and we are prepared to care for him until until he falls victim to the terrors once again no if i take him into danger i take him with me and i knowi know how to comfort a child you will have your duties what duty is more important than this i will protect him but and a head appeared in the doorway a white large head with deep blue eyes the size of palms and a long straight muzzle wearing a silverandblue strap and bells companions had no words to offer anyone but each otherand their heraldsif the stories were true but darius did not need words he butted the priest gently in the chest and met his eyes unblinking it was the priest who looked away i wont abandon you she said softly and hesitantly as riverend flashed before her eyes butbut i think i understand now why i was called what are you child i dont know tell him your gift is empathy darius says my gift is empathy the priest closed his eyes then he is taking you to an unkind fate kayla why do you say that the empaths the greatest of the empaths were the first to fall the towns many inns offered food and wine and water when darius entered their courtyards but they were silent as they made their offers and the fear that she had sensed in the infirmary had extended outward in an echo that was terrible to witness on impulse she said i have with me one of the children who was in the cathedral infirmary hes not very talkative she added as the boy shyly turned his face into her shoulder but hes recovering i know its been bad on the town but as an outsider im amazed at the way the town has come together to help the fallen even when they dont understand the disease theres hope she added softly and the innkeepers their wives their guests leaped at the words that she had spoken aloud a clear indication that eavesdropping was a way of life in any place be it small hold or large town they might have called her a liar but she was astride a companion and the heralds did not lie so they breathed a sigh of relief instead weve been pleading for help the innkeepers wife said as she added four extra pies to their load but the only help the king sent lies in the infirmary with the others we didnt know she ran the back of her hand across her eyes my brothers in back same as them that you saw thank you herald kayla had given up telling people that she wasnt the woman composed herself although the redness of her eyes spoke of unshed tears youll want a blanket for the boy its chilly on the hills in these parts the boy ate like a pig which is to say he ate everything they put in front of him and he ate it in a way calculated to leave the most food on his clothes the innkeepers wifea woman and a mother who therefore thought of these thingshad seen fit to pack him extra clothing kayla was grateful for it she did not let the boy leave her and he did not wander farther than her hand could reach but his ordeal had left him easily tired and he slept frequently his back against her chest her arms on either side of his upright body to stop him from plunging the distance between darius back and the forest floor is it true darius yes in the capital where there are so many more people many have died fromtheailment they cannot feed themselves and if they fall in the streets before theheralds or the kings men find them theyre often robbed and left for dead how long has this been happening darius was silent darius i think ive figured out why you came to riverend by now how does my ignorance serve your purpose tell me if im to help i need to know i would tell you everything in a minute but there are oaths you must swear and vowsyou must undertake before you become herald and if you are herald there is noinformation with which you cannot be trusted she knew when she heard his words that she suddenly didnt want that much trust daniel chattered as they rode and he helped with the food that was meant for darius helped with the blankets that were meant to keep him warm in the night but he helped in a way that he didnt understand for he would not sleep without kaylas arms around him she held him when the nightmares came that night they were subtly different the beast that roared with the voice of a thousandtens of thousandsof screams had eyes that were focused its flight was lazy the circles it drew in the night sky slow and deliberate he was searching kayla realized for her for the child she had taken from him she did not scream she wanted to but she knew what it would cost the boy and she kept it to herself and because of that she reached the capital and the heralds collegium before suns full height the next day the kings guards bowed quietly as darius approached the main gates and although it was evident that they were curious they merely welcomed him home they are usually more friendly darius said apologetically but things in thecollegium have been dark for many months i come kayla here is a woman you mustsee a herald yes she is the kings own second only to the king in authority and she is belovedof the heralds i should warn you though that it is not for the quickness or sharpness ofher tongue that she is loved kayla learned this almost instantly a herald met her at the front doors to the dauntingly huge building he bowed to darius so youve brought her he said finally yes kayla replied although the words had clearly not been directed at her he did and i guess he didnt tell you that im not used to being talked about as if im not here the man raised a brow i see that you have more in common with magda merton than it seems his frown edged with weariness deepened dariusyou did not choose someone with a child that young no she said flatly he waited until all mine were dead the herald had the grace to look shocked and she regretted the words almost instantly such a grief such a loss was never meant to be used as a weapon it was wrong it was just wrong she slid off the back of her companion gently extricating herself from daniels arms my pardon herald she said to the chest of the man in whites i woke the child from afrom a deep sleep it was safest to bring him here there is no safety here if the child was affected by the he grimaced the kings own has been waiting for you if you are kayla please follow me she hesitated a moment and then daniel said its all right kayla his words were thin and shaky she could see the fear in his eyes but he drew himself up to his full height as if he were adult as if he could bear the weight of her absence darius says that hell take care of me darius says her eyes widened you can hear him sometimes when hes talking to me she pondered that as she followed the herald he led her down the hall into a very finely appointed rooma room that was the size of the gathering hall in the hold of riverend there a woman was standing by the great window that ran from floor to ceiling an ostentatious display of glass kayla had the ridiculous urge to kneel she fought it carefully although she did bow deeply i am gisel the woman said im kayla kayla grayson margaret mertons daughter her youngest yes arlen says that youve been through evandale arlen ah my companion she has been speaking with darius it appears that youmet withthe victims of the shadow plague and that you saved two kayla nodded hesitantly i guess that means that magda took it upon herself to teach you tteach me gisel frowned yes teach you your gift when silence prevailed the unpleasant frown deepened you must understand your gift wwhat gift would that be gisel raised a hand to her gray hair and yanked it out of her face i wish i had time child i dont your mother was one of the most gifted empaths the kingdom of valdemar has ever known eempath i really do not have the patience for this it was true kayla could feel the older womans anger but it was mixed with a terrible sorrow and a deep guilt guilt in her experience had always been a doubleedged sword it could drive men mad in the hold it had empathy is a gift that is deeper than words and more subtle you have that gift and if your mother didnt teach you how to use it and youve survived the passage through evandalethen you are more than just her daughter gisel walked away from the window and the light in the room grew it was a cold light there are people who are born with other talents you must have heard their stories some can summon fire some can work great magic some can heal with a touch some can hear the words that men dont speak aloud any of these untrained are a danger to themselves or to others but empaths can exist without such training they are often sympathetic or perhaps skittish because of what they can sense feelings often run deeper than words most men and women never really learn how to adequately speak of what they feel i have wine here and water would you care for either kayla shook her head as you wish i intend to have a great deal of the former before this is over true to her word she poured herself a glass of a liquid that was a deep crimson and stared at its surface as if she could glean information from it an empath can do these things it is why empaths have often made better diplomats than those whose gift it is to read the thoughts the unspoken words of others kayla had only barely heard of people like that and she had always feared them she said nothing youll be given your grays and settled in but you wont have the chance to train and learn with the newest of the chosen your work is already waiting andim sorry childbut we dont have the time it would take to prepare you this is a risk i apologize for forcing you to take it you know that the king has three sons yes and two daughters which is more children than yes yes and theyve all survived kayla added unable to keep the bitterness out of the words it depends the youngest of his sons was adifficult lad he doted on his mother the queen when she passed away he drifted and his father was not a sensitive man the running of the kingdom during the border skirmishes kept him away from the capital for much of the year but gregori was chosen in spite of his black moods and his despondency his companion and here she did flinch was rodri rodri was as sensitive as gregori and gentle in a way gregori was not and when rodri did choose him we rejoiced again the words were bitter we rejoiced anew when we discovered that gregori was gifted that he was an empath of exceptional power it was part of the reason he was so withdrawn and so moody as a child he could not bear the constant anger fear and hatred that he felt around him the courtis not a suitable place for a child of such sensitivity its not just those things what isnt that you feel that i feel theres more theres joy theres silliness magda did teach you even if she didnt tell you what it was she was teaching rodri did teach gregori to listen to those things and gregoriflourished we were grateful the king was grateful she knew that the story was going someplace bad and she almost raised a hand to stem the flow of this autocratic womans words but she knew that would be a mistake rodri died didnt he gisel raised a brow lifted her glass yes he died and gregori gisel closed her eyes set the glass down and filled it again there are empaths among the heralds she said when she chose to speak again i am not one of them if i were i would not be here to speak to you now and kayla knew as the words left the lips of the kings own that she was angry that had it been up to this woman gregori would be dead she took a step back a step away and lifted her hand gisels dark eyes became narrowed edges into a harsh expression yes kayla youre right if it had been up to me i would have killed the boy if it were up to me he would be dead now but the king yes the king feels guilt even though he sees the cost of gregoris continuedexistence he feels that if he had somehow been present he could have prevented what did happen what is happening even as we speak and he has summoned every healer in the kingdom to the side of his sons bed in an attempt to revive him to bring him back they have failed all of them and the empaths two of them were my closest friends gisel said she walked back to the tall window and stood in its frame looking out the bells have tolled for the youngest but but i dont understand that much is clear ask and ask quickly if the empaths couldnt help him why have you been waiting for me i dont know ppardon gisel turned the light was harsh it made her face look like broken stone i dont know i dont know what it was that magdathat margaretmerton might have done to save him i was there when sasha fell i was there when michael joined her ive been all over the city looking at the sleepers who are just waiting to join the dead and i can hear what they think when their terror has any words at all its my belief that if gregori died they would wake kayla listened as gisel spoke darius kayla it isthe kings sonhe is yes the dragon youre wrong she heard herself say gisel raised a brow if you killed him hed take them all with him when he went all of them gisel closed her eyes her turn but she snapped them open quickly enough and you know this how helpless kayla shrugged i dont know butid bet my life on it well thats good because you will be go and get a bath get food settle into your room well come for you kayla nodded can i have what darius can i have darius with me gisel hesitated it was a cold hesitation it would bebetterif you did not in her roomand it really was a single roomshe found daniel perched on the edge of her bed he started when he saw her and leaped up from the beds edge shortening the distance with his flight of steps she caught him in her arms and held him tightly seeing another child in his stead you need a bath she told him gently he said very little but she managed to ask for water hot and cold and she tended him first she had spent most of her life taking care of the children of riverend and this one was no different or so she told herself darius she said as she worked soap adding to tangles of hair and the murk of what had been clear water what was gregori doing when rodri died he was at the border darius replied it was strange that she could speak to him from such a distance and that it could feel so natural during the skirmishing yes why he was a herald thats not enough of an answer if he was so sensitivegisel spoke of training washe trained he had better teachers than you if thats what you meant but he he was very very powerful kayla then why did it take so long to figure out what he was he let no one know no one but rodri he was in the middle of battle yes constantly notphysically but there is evidence that he was aware of it he could sense themovement of our enemies well before any others could war breeds fear and hatred she pulled her sonno this child this strangers sonfrom the bath water and set him in the towel in her lap darius i need the truth i have not lied to you bright heart between us there can be no lie could he use his gift as a weapon darius did not answer answer enough she did not sleep that night she knew that sleep in this place was death close her eyes and she could see the black spread of dragon wings the lift and curl of air beneath their span close her eyes and she could hear those borne aloft by that terrible flight the screaming and the terror of those who had not yet realized they were dead kayla her mother said from the distance of years from the safety of death peoplemake weapons out of anything its important that you understand this her mothers voice sad but firm was all that remained her she could not see her face in the darkness in the hands of the wrong men guilt is a weapon love is a weapon hopeis a weapon you have the ability to make weapons far sharper far harsher than others can andthe only person who can choose how those weapons are wielded is you she hadnt understood what her mother meant then she had been younger young caroline makes a weapon of desire every time she wanders past the boys atthe mine she understands this but she wants only the power of their adoration others are not so kind you cannot be caroline im not beautiful enough hush you are far far more beautiful to me but thats not the point and i wont letyou distract me tonight there is a difference between manipulation and motivation sometimes desire is good sometimes it is bad she will discover that in her time you must understand it now you understand love as a young girl does and not asan old woman like me you must let it come to you you must never force it upon another but ive seen you ive seen you make caroline cry because youre jealous of her ivestopped you from doing it myself but i will not always be here to stop it she will growchild she will change let her instead of forcing others to respond to you becomesomething worthy of the response you desire kayla was silent in the present with a child cradled against her she lay openeyed in the dark hearing his heartbeat as if it were her own her mothers words continued the past seeping into the present in a way that kayla would never have foreseen why do you think i came to riverend because of father yes and no why do you think i tell you this now when i could keep it hidden i dont know because i killed a man kayla she felt the harsh shock she had felt upon first hearing the words felt the panic as she had attempted to deny the truth of them by finding the lie in her mothers mood it wasnt there bbut why how i forced him to feel my despair my selfloathing as if it were his own he was nottrained not aware that what he felt came from outside of his core he could not cope withwhat it was i placed there i did not lift a hand of course but the end was the same as if had and worse i look at my hands now and i see a killers hands i look at my hands and i seeworse i taught this gift i passed it on butbut what does that have to do with riverend nothing everything the holds are so dark and so isolated people can go mad in the winters and do butwith my gift here among these people i can remind them without words of thespring and the summer i can give them hope they take hope and they make of it whatthey will and we survive until the passes open but is that so different if you make them feel what they dont feel is there a difference between watering a plant and drowning it here in riverendthere are few the ore the mines produce is needed by the king i have chosen to helpthese people as i can because i have grown to love them she had been silent then promise me kayla i promise mother in the end she slept and the great beast was waiting for her eyes red with fire wings a maelstrom of emotion he was despair anger loathing but worse he made mockery of the transience of the things kayla valued love loyalty hope and who better to know of transience than she she had buried a husband a mother a father but worse so much worse the dreams had always been her terror and her salvation when she lost her oldest child darius unnamed and unnameable had come to her in the untouched winter of a riverend that was barren of life and she clung to his back and wept and wept and wept her youngest was old enough to walk not old enough to speak and he was also feverish and she prayed to every god that might have conceivably lived and in the end weak and almost weightless her second childs fever had broken but he never recovered and although he seemed to take delight in the coming of spring in the warmth and color of summer the weight he had lost did not return and she had wept then at the start of winter because she knew what it would mean but at least with her second she had time she told him stories she sang him songs she held him in the cradle of aching arms and she comforted him and herself until she was at last alone but she was considered young enough in the village if her heart was scarred she was twentytwo her oldest son had survived six years which was better than many and the oldwives gathered to discuss her fate and to ask her to marry again she had almost forgotten her mothers words that day and the promise she had made to her motherfor her mother was dead and that death was so less painful than this terrible intrusion of the living she had had nothing nothing at all she had carried the blackness and the emptiness within her until it had almost hollowed her out completely she felt it now it was a visceral terrible longing a desire for an end an ending and she knew it for her own the dragon nodded wordless swept back huge wings opened its terrible jaws they were kin she thought he offered nothing but truth two things saved her the first was the flash of white in the darkness darius the companion of winter in riverend and the second more real more painful the small fingers that bruised her arms the whimpering that reached her ears that pierced the fabric of a dream she could not escape tearing a hole in the wall between sleep and the waking world the child was weeping she held him and the ache in her arms subsided this was what she was this was what her mother had taught her to be comfort hope but when he called for his mother in the darkened room she answered she could not deprive herself of that one lie in the morning grim she rose the child was sleeping and his peace was fitful but it was there she dressed in the odd gray uniform shed been given admiring the quality of its workmanship if not the choice of its colors then she lifted him waking him he was disoriented but only for a moment she let him throw his arms around her neck until she could almost not breathe for the tightness of the grip she loved that breathlessness daniel she told him gently i need you to talk with darius i need you to stay with him the boys smile was shy but it was genuine ii have work to do today darius is not really allowed inside but hes not a horse nohes not a horse hes better than that and im sure hell let you ride him if you want come lets find him the halls were bustling there were more people in the collegium than she had ever seen in the hold and she found their presence almost overwhelming but she discovered two important things from the youngthe very youngman who stopped to talk to her the first where breakfast was servedand when that being importantand the second where the companions were stabled she knew breakfast was important and stopped for just long enough to feed daniel then she carried him to where she knew darius was waiting he met her eyes his own dark and unblinking without preamble kayla set daniel upon his back he accepted the burden you made a weapon out of him no kayla he made a weapon out of himself he thought that that was the best wayof proving his worth to a distant father but his father his father loved him yes loves him still if he was truly an empath he would have known that the kings darius said sadly are taught to shield themselves against all intrusionall influence they must be strong and his youngest son was so insecure that he couldnt infer that love darius was silent my mother knew him your motherknew him yes your mother could have reached him had she livedyour mother was the one who discovered his gift the strength of his gift your mother wasthe woman who insisted that he be moved from the court and taken to a place without thepolitics of power but she must have knownthe dreams the dreams i hadshe must have had them ido not know she could have reached him the heralds who have some hint ofyour giftcould not he made a weapon out of himself and the forging was completed withthe death of his companion she knew then hehe killed his companion no no but the loss broke something in him no other companion can reach himnow and believe me kayla we have tried he is one of the gifted he can hear us all if heso chooses but this must have happened years ago yes but few thats not possible i felt him years ago in my dreams i but the dreams had been different she had felt loneliness isolation the desperate desire to be loved not madness you are powerful kayla what you felt then was true it is far far less than what youwill feel now far less kayla i must warn you i know those who are affected always are those who have some hint of the gift when thegift is strong the effect is not sleep its death yes gisel summoned her shortly after darius informed her of the summons and she hastened backwith some difficulty for the building really was a maze of passages compared to the simplicity of the holdto the rooms in which they had first met im ready to meet him now she said before gisel could speak gisel raised a brow there are things you should know about there is nothing i should know that you will tell me kayla replied softly but i believe that thisthis princehas been hunting for me for much of my life and its about time i stopped running hunting for you in my dreams kayla replied gisel added nothing the grays will do gregori is here in the collegium weve sent all those who might be affected as far away as we can distance seems to have some affect on his ability toto reach people but not enough not enough no understand that we have not explained this to the world at large it is treason to speak of it i will have your oath child that you will comport yourself as a heraldas a true servant of the king kayla nodded and then quietly she knelt her knees gracing the cold stone floor the two women traveled kayla let gisel lead and made no attempt to memorize their journey to map the long halls the odd doors the hanging tapestries and the crystal lamps she could see other things more clearly once or twice she reached out for darius and when he replied she continued until they reached a set of doors she froze outside of them almost literally do you know why darius waited she asked gisel softly waited to choose you kayla nodded no he told us that he knew where you were to be found but he refused to tell us how to find you until this spring she nodded again touched the door it was cold winter cold death cold within these walls beyond these doors the dragon lay coiled will you wait outside kayla asked it was not possible to give an order to this woman gisel ignored the request she pulled a ring of keys from her belt and slid one into the doors single lock whatever kayla expected from the rooms of a prince had come from stories that widow davis told the children she had long since passed the age where stories were necessary but she wanted them anyway she gazed not at a room but at a small graveyard one blanketed as if by snow hidden from sight unless one knew how to look for it she knew her dead were here her deadand the losses that death inflicted she faced them now swallowed air shaking its hard kayla whispered when theyre gone its so damned hard what gisels sharp tone had not softened in the slightest to feel loved to know that you are loved i thinki think sometimes its the hardest thing in the world she entered the room unaware of the weight of the kings owns stare a young man lay abed he was older than kayla he had to be older she knew this because of her mothers words her mothers memory but had she not known it she would not have guessed he was slender with youth and he lay curled on his side shaking slightly his eyes wide and unseeing she felt his pain as if it were her own as if it were exactly her own she did not know if she loved darius that was truth he was part of her in a way that she could not fathom did not struggle to understand but she did not know if she loved him she could say with certainty that she had loved her husband could sayno could not say but could feelwith certainty that she had loved her children the children that life in riverend had taken from her one by one and she could say with certainty that this manboy this terrible dragon this hunting horror had loved his companion or had felt loved by him the loss she felt was profound and terrible it dwarfed all losses that she had ever suffered but one leave us she whispered gisel hesitated for only a minute but that minute stretched out into forever and then she was gone all right kayla said quietly its time you and i had a talk she touched his face his skin was clammy his eyes wide and unseeing did not turn toward her but something beneath them did kayla looked into the red eyes of the dragon and trapped within them she saw a child or a mirror she had never dreamed of flight although the other village children often spoke of it she had never dreamed of wings the only time her feet left the ground in her dreams was when she rode a companion who could cross the walls that darkness imposed upon her dreaming gregori she whispered he did not move but the beast did it knew exactly where she was and the waking world offered her no protection no place to hide gregori dragon name prince name powerful name he turned you yes i know you yes i am kayla despair washed over her despair and more death images of death the loss of her home the loss of her villageof riverend the home she had promised her mother she would protect but there was more she felt the death of her husband as the mines colapsed as oxygen fled slowly enough that fear and hysteria had time to build she felt her fathers death the snap of his spine sawalthough not with her eyesthe pale whites of eyes rolled shut when no hands were there to gently drawn lids across them her mothers death followed and after that the deaths of her life her sons one by one in the absence of healers in the winter when no one could travel through the pass she was alone terribly horribly alone everyone that had ever loved her gone she was like a ship without anchor all that existed was this darkness she wandered within it weeping now her arms so empty she knew they would never be full again but she was not terrified she felt no horror how could she the things she had feared the things that made fear so visceral that made her feel truly vulnerable had already come to pass she could not speak her lips trembled her jaw her shoulders shook as if she were caught in the spasms that collapsed whole tunnels dug in rock and because these things were truth she accepted them as she had managed just barelyto accept them in the village of riverend how how had she done it for a moment she could not remember and then her mothers voice returned distant and tinny promise me that you will care for riverend duty just that only that hollow and cold despair gave way to anger is that the worst you can do she asked the dragon she so small she was almost insignificant i killed them the dragon roared she almost believed him the emotion was so compelling so much so very much like her own but she said as she had said to herself over and over again for the last year lifekilled them winter killed them work killed them how dare you do you not know who i am oh yes i know you despair terror fear i have lived with nothing but you for thelast several months of my life i killed them no i killed them she could no longer feel her feet she threw her weight forward because she had some hope that she could land on the bed instead of the hardwood floor no you didnt i killed rodri no he laughed and the laughter was terrible the most terrible thing she had heard from him in all of her nightmares the dragons voice had been a roar of pain but this this mirthless sound was worse it was true she could not see for darkness but sensation returned to her hands and beneath her hands she felt the clammy warmth of his body the fever of it she could count his ribs as her palms traveled the length of his slender chest childs chest he was dying he was dying the feverroot had done nothing to drive the fires away and he was burning from within heno no tell me she said softly as her hands touched his chin tell me his hair was a tangle matted and thin childs hair the sensation was almost more than she could bear and only the fact that she knew he was too heavy for her to lift kept her from gathering his body to her she had carried her son she had carried him for three hours in the cold while her toddler wailed mother she could not answer him could not lie to him instead she continued to stroke his hair and after a moment she sang her voice a little too dry a little too shaky song had been her gift she had never found a person in riverend who would not listen to her song not be gentled by it i wanted to help them i wanted to help i couldnt wield a sword i tried i tried for solong i cut my legs my arms i cut rodris flank i couldnt do it and i couldnt pull the bow i could wind a crossbow i his hair she saw images of a child thin and awkward and she knew what that child represented the prince gregori she saw the ghostly image of a mother a specter composed of a childs loss a childs longing she saw the gray distant ice of a fathers disappointment and contempt she felt his isolation and his loneliness so clearly she could not separate it from her own nor did she try rodri loved me rodri found me when i was lost he called me and i came they gave me whites they tried to train me we were happy here she felt his terror building and she knew the storm would return but she had lived life in riverend and she had wintered there there was no storm that she could not weather not now i could tell where the enemy was i could tell them by what they were feeling i they had not made a weapon of the boy she saw that he had made a weapon of himself she saw her mother she saw an assassin she knew then when her mother had killed and why to save this boy he had begged her to teach him this gift and her mother had fled taking her loveyes even her motherwith her to the farthest reaches of the kingdoms border that desertion had hurt him she could feel the pain clearly but she could also feel the determination that followed as he dismissed magda merton for a selfish powermongering woman like all the other women in court in silence she let his story unfold it was not neatly told it was broken by storm and rage by fear by selfloathing he had taught himself he had used his power his full power for the first time it had been a surprise a gift a thing to give his father a way to prove to his friends that he too could help save the kingdom from invasion he had turned his gift outward reflecting emotion magnifying it it worked it struck the enemy scattering them breaking their lines but the bond between companion and herald was strong the creature most affected by the sudden outward blow was rodri would have to be rodri gregori screamed he screamed not with his gift but with his voice and she seeing her own graveyard and knowing what lay beneath the earth screamed with him and then soundless he turned dragon wings wide he listened for the sound of singing for the songs of joy or hope or love that he had heard for almost all of kaylas life she knew it was her song and what he found was her pain her despair her endless rage at fate and winter and people who still had children to love she continued to stroke his hair darius woke her she rose at the sound of her name and found that she could see the room clearly the storm had passed for the moment she turned to look at the man who lay in the bed saw that his eyes were closed his lashes were long like boys lashes so often are his skin was winterpale on impulse she bent and kissed his forehead he isnt doing it on purpose she said quietly her arm around darius neck darius said nothing the king had little patience for him and no affection he loves his children gregori felt what the king felt darius he wasnt just guessing he felt part of it some people remember best the things which wound them she thought of her children after a moment she said he would have killed himself why didnt he i dont know but she was beginning to she said instead you lied to me he did kill rodri he did not the enemy shot rodri rodri was mad with terror and fear and it was gregoris darius said nothing kayla let her arm slide away from his shoulder i have to speak with gisel she said softly just that gisel was waiting for her tense and pale she looked old kayla thought bent with gregoris weight but she smiled a moment when she saw kayla enter the room and looked surprised he cant stop kayla told her you dont believe in idle chatter do you im from the holds kayla replied tartly but you survived him youtouched him and you survived kayla nodded i know why darius waited she told the kings own and i know that what you thought he waited for cant happen not here you cant reach him i can but she shook her head stared at her hands for a moment but not here gisel rose mistaking her meaning not in the capital kayla told her gently almost as if she were speaking to a child what do you mean let me take him home this is his home kayla rose rose and walked to a window whose splendor she had never seen in riverend light broke upon the river that ran through the city the river was murky and slow she thought it must be warm as warm as the air in this almost endless spring without turning she said i have to take him to riverend you cant here the healers and the empaths have worked to contain him and theyre failing one by one theyre failing he speaks to sorrow and loss and speaks so strongly that thats all thats left to those who can hear his voice you hear him yes magdamargaret mertonwas the only empath to equal gregori in the kingdom youand i mean no offense childare untested yes and i will remain untested for now i am safe in riverend do you know why i can hear him feel him listen to him and walk away no child although i am certain there are those within the collegium who would love to know it because i have felt everything he offers and i have learned towalkaway from it let me take him home gisel hesitated and then after a moment she nodded i will need to speak with the king wait outside but kayla did not wait instead she went to her room and found daniel he smiled when he saw her daniel she said quietly i have to leave the collegium i come from the north near the mountains and i have to return there can i come with you yes she held out her arms and he ran into them she lifted him easily catching most of his weight with her right hip but first i want you to come with me where to meet a prince the door was open slightly no one kayla realized had touched it since shed walked away she took a deep breath no matter what you feel or hear here remember that im with you that i will always be with you daniel nodded she nudged the door open with her foot and took a step inside the prince was sleeping is that a prince really yes daniel he doesnt look like much of a prince no he doesnt is he sick yes can you make him better maybe she walked to the side of the bed and sat on it the eyes of the prince opened she felt daniels sudden terror and she held him tightly pressing her chin into the top of his head and rocking him this sensation was as real as any sensation an echo of another time shed been happy then she remembered it drew on it calling her ghosts this boy was her son this boy was her child she loved her children and for her children she could sing she remembered the sweet gentle nature of her oldest and the stubborn fury of her youngest and for the first time since she had bid them farewell she laughed in delight at their antics the man in the bed stirred she had survived their loss because of her vows and she had found that sorrow in the end could not keep her from the other children in the hold they needed her their parents needed her in the worst of winter she could soothe temper displace boredom still fury she could invoke the love her mother invoked even after the deaths even then gregori the sound of his name drained the room of light but daniel was safe she felt his fear struggle a moment with her love and lose such a small thing that fear she reached out to touch gregoris forehead his eyes widened in terror and he backed away but he had been abed many many months he was slow and she mountain girl miners daughter was fast she ran her fingers through his hair and let go of all thought what remained was feeling love loss gently gently now she brushed his hair from his face she felt the raging fury the emptiness the guilt and the horror that he could not let go not on his own but surely surely she had felt this before a childs emotions were always raw always a totality they existed in the now as if the past and the future were severed neatly by the strength of what they felt in the present dont touch me dont touch me ill kill you but she continued to touch his face the fine line of his nose the thin thin stretch of his lips you need my song she whispered and i had forgotten how to sing i am sorry i am sorry gregori she did not question did not think to do either was death instead she gave in to her gift to her mothers gift what she felt she made him feel just as he had made his enemies feel dontdont touch me dont touch ill kill you ill kill you too dont want to kill you too she sat in the room with her younger child in her lap and her older child in his bed hush hush and when the older child began to weep she held him darius was a patient companion and a large one he did not complain at the weight of three passengers and had he kayla would have kicked him after all she was no giant daniel was less than half her weight and the prince tall and skeletal probably weighed less than the saddlebags the king had agreed to let his son go but with misgivings it was therefore decided by royal decree that a healer and three attendants would accompany them she was grateful for that the spring in riverend had already passed into summer and in the winter with a healer there might be no deaths a winter without death kayla gregori said as the hold came into view she felt his anxiety daniels fallen asleep and my arms gone numb i dont want him to fall you wont let him fall she told the prince gently and i wont let you fall will it be all right will they accept me i was so lonely here she answered i was so lonely i dont think theyll begrudge us each other she smiled and the smile was genuine do you think youve learned the dawnsong

crowded in for a closer look his tunic tickling santars bare arm his shadow falling over the hoof think so santar grunted got to get past all the crap first flipping the pick in a wellpracticed motion he gingerly hooked out chunks of road grime and straw the sharp odor of manure rose momentarily over the sweet musk of horse here he touched the pick to a gray cobble shard lodged in the groove

wooden wall with a ping then tumbled to join the rest of the debris on the stables earthen floor still clutching the pick santar scooped the hoof back upward to examine the damage he discovered a light bruise but nothing that suggested serious swelling or infection he stroked the injury with a gentle finger and the horse calmed hosfins head obscured the hoof no wonder he was hopping and snorting yeah santar released the hoof and patted the horses sticky flank could have been a lot worse lucky beast lucky man hosfin corrected he stepped back skinny arms smeared with grime sandy hair swept back and tied with a scrap of leather dont think he could afford another horse by the look of him needs to learn to take better care of his valuables santars brown hair hung in shaggy disarray in need of a cut horse work had honed his muscles lugging grain bags and hay bales exercising his charges cleaning and grooming he also had an almost inexplicable way with afflicted creatures that made his fathers stables an exceptionally logical place for any traveler to board they might find stables nearer their lodgings or destination ones larger or with more modern construction ones with fancier names or decor but santars father prided himself on service mostly provided by his seven sons and one daughter travelers who cared as much for their animals comfort as their own tended to seek them out including the occasional herald from valdemar santar especially loved their huge white mounts with their impeccable coats and strange soft blue eyes they seemed so docile and intelligent their conformations so perfect their intensity of attachment to their riders so mythically intense the heralds tended them so vigilantly santar rarely had the opportunity to do anything for them but stare a sharp whinny from the yard sent santars head jerking up so suddenly he nearly brained his brother whos that hosfins thin shoulders lifted and he slouched from the stall as santar watched him move he marveled at how his brother had grown just in the last few months gaining the gawky spindly proportions of an adolescent santar wondered if their eldest brother had looked at him the same way when he had turned fourteen three years ago santar caught up to his brother at the door of the stable the younger man stood as if frozen the door wedged against him alarmed santar pushed past hosfin what is it a handsome white stallion stood in the yard coat shimmering silver in the late afternoon sunlight against his fine pink hooves the grass looked like crystalline emerald and blue sky reflected from eyes full of wisdom santar shook his head to clear it shocked to find the creature of his reverie come so abruptly to life itsits a companion hosfin finally spoke but only to force out a single syllable yes the companion let out another trumpeting cry this one seeming ten times louder without the sheltering walls of the stable it cocked its head one pale eye focusing directly on santar hosfin managed more words ive never seen one without a herald on it santar had but only after the rider had negotiated its board very odd he held out a hand toward the animal and advanced with shy caution if it wanted the huge stallion could stomp him to a smear head still tipped the companion watched santars approach he had almost drawn near enough to touch it when the stallion raised his muzzle in a blasting whinny ears ringing santar jerked back watching the animal prance a wild circle then stop to snort and stare at him again cursing himself for his own sudden movement he spoke softly and soothingly as he would to any horse whats wrong boy still at the entrance to the stables hosfin said maybe hes lost his herald it seemed unlikely santar believed the companions chose the best and brightest and the heraldcompanion bond was unbreakable needing something to say to the horse however santar repeated have you lost your herald boy the horse bobbed his head savagely and pawed the ground he whirled stepped then looked back at santar over his shoulder the gesture was unmistakable hosfin explained the obvious he wants you to follow him yes santar studied the horse only one scenario made sense to him is your heraldin needof help the companions head whipped up and down so hard he had to make himself dizzy he pranced forward and back still staring at santar terror shocked through santar he wiped his grimy hands on his tunic all right let me just gather a search party he considered aloud well need a doctor a few strong men a the companion spun suddenly and charged at santar hey santar ran toward the barn hosfin ducked behind the door santar had barely managed two steps when the stallions head slammed his side bowling him to the ground hey he shouted again throwing up his hands to protect his head from the heavy hooves huge flat teeth closed over his tunic hefting him into the air santar bit back a scream which would only further upset the horse instead he launched into a steady patter in a calm voice meant to compose both of them easy now boy nothing to get riled about he hid fear behind a tone deliberately pitched to rescue self and animal from panic he felt himself lifted tossed air sang through his ears then he landed on his belly across the horses withers it did not wait for him to settle before galloping away from the village for an instant horror overwhelmed logic stunned silent santar could only feel each wild hooffall jar through his body instinct awakened first and he scrambled to a sitting position grasping a hold on the streaming white mane the smooth precision of the companions run thrilled through him he had ridden many horses in his day but none with the silken grace of this stallion every stride seemed to flow into the next and his body cycled like liquid through every movement finally the last of santars fear slipped away replaced by exhilaration hesitantly santar stroked a neck as soft as velvet glazed with sweat the familiar perfume of horse musk filled his nose and the mane striped his knuckles like bleached twine all right boy i get it your herald is in immediate trouble the companion nickered a clear indication that santar had properly interpreted his actions what goods my getting there fast if i dont have any supplies or expertise to help him this time the horse gave no reply the road through the surrounding farmland unscrolling beneath his hooves apparently the horse found santar adequate enough to save his herald the stable boy hoped hosfin would have the sense to call for help perhaps they could mass a group to follow him hopefully one that included men with healing knowledge and strength as the companions long strides ate up a mile santar caught sight of farmers too far away to hear his call suddenly it occurred to him where the companion was headed not toward the river recent rains had swollen the waters past their banks and well over the ford santar glanced around the stallions neck they approached the river at breakneck speed and santar knew it had surged to well above his head stop he shouted to santars surprise the horse obeyed it drew up with a suddenness that should have sent him flying but that motion proved as fluid as every other instead they came to an effortless halt just a few steps in front of the flooded fording uncertain of his next chance santar dismounted the companion made a mournful sound deep in his throat he plunged toward the water then looked longingly at santar he lunged forward again this time splashing at the edges of the pool though it was against his better judgment santar approached the companion i know youre intelligent and you can understand me the horse pawed the ground furiously attention beyond the water where the road continued eastward through the tangled forest santar had only gone this far a few times and then only in the company of his father and brothers the sun already lay well behind him unless the herald lay just past the ford they would wind up in the woods at night never a pleasant prospect even in broad daylight on the welltraveled path demons owned the forest nights ready to steal the soul of any man foolish enough to wander into their realm santar continued it might take a few more seconds to gather a party but itll be well worth the trouble to save your the companion bellowed out an impatient sound then slammed a hoof into the river splashing muddy droplets in all directions santar bit his lip trusting the companions judgment he knew the bond between companion and herald surpassed anything he would ever understand this horse came to me for help and im goingto give it im not going to let another man die for my fear all right lets go catching a handful of mane he dragged himself to the stallions withers again without a moments hesitation the companion sprang into the ford cold pinpoints of water splashed santars face and arms and his legs seemed suddenly plunged in ice he wound his hands into the companions mane gripping desperately as the water surged and sucked around them threatening to drag him from the stallions back he watched a massive branch swirling wildly in the current lost to his sight in moments the understanding of true danger finally reached him having thought only of the bare possibility of demons he had not considered how much the horse would struggle in the current how dire the swim that the churning current could pluck him like a twig from the animals back and send him helplessly spinning to his doom though an able swimmer he could never win against such a force apparently immersed in the swim the companion paid the man on his back no notice though santars death grip on his neck had to have become burdensome the water slapped and tugged at santars sodden clothing threatening a hold that he gradually winched tighter focused on his grip santar put his trust wholly in the companion blindly depending on him to bring them safely ashore and never once considering that the stallions strength too might fail it was a companion the most clever and competent animal alive and used to having a human wholly reliant upon it not wholly reliant santar reminded himself were talking about heralds here plenty capable and talented in their own right only then santar thought to worry that his own puny normalness might disrupt the tenuous balance that the horse might count on him to perform with the ability of a herald were dead by the time the idea materialized the companion gave a mighty surge that hauled both of them from the water glad to find himself on dry land santar leaped from the horse and wrapped his arms around the nearest tree we made it gradually the doubts raised by his earlier thoughts intruded the torrent had carried them far enough downstream that he could no longer find the road the horizon cut a crescent from the lowest edge of sun giving the woods a grayorange cast that seemed supernatural over the bubble of water he could hear a softly rising chorus of bugs punctuated by other unidentifiable sounds demons santar shivered in his soaked clothing and looked to the companion the horse pawed the ground clearly anxious he nudged santar toward the woods santar swallowed his fear a heralds life depends on me on us he appreciated the company though it had dragged him here in the first place he remembered how the stallion had given him the chance to back out at the fording he had chosen to continue to save a mans life to trust the horses instincts meant believing time of the essence for the companion to opt for sped over preparation and skill had to mean the herald lay close to death the horse he felt certain would know though the urge to remount prodded strongly santar resisted in the dark forest he could see and lead safely better than any horse he only wished he had had time to grab a lantern or even just a tinderbox as the forest supplied plenty of torches and kindling he pushed through the underbrush tense as an overwound lute string the horse moving quietly at his heels the woods smelled of damp moss and pungent berries close and green branches swept across his face stinging and he tried to hold them aside for his larger companion a whirring sound appeared and disappeared at intervals grinding at his nerves an owl cut loose above his head sending him skittering forward in a rush stop it stay calm accustomed to regular horses santar tried to maintain the appearance of selfcontrol the animal might sense his fear and a panicked horse became a deadly and unpredictable weapon forcing himself to appear calm gradually resulted in a true inner peace santar surrendered himself to the mission for whatever reason the companion had chosen him to rescue the herald an enormous responsibility at first he had believed it sheer coincidence but he discarded that thought companions had a good people sense it could have approached anyone else in the town or his brother but had selected him whether santar saw the quality in himself or not the companion had and he would not betray the stallions trust nor the life of its herald the animals nose poked santars right side steering him leftward the moist nostrils tickled the inner part of santars elbow and he could not help smiling through his fear he allowed the horse to steer him in this manner blazing a trail through the tangled forest that anticipated deadfalls brush too thick to penetrate and trees packed too closely for a large horse to squeeze around a gray glaze descended around them deepening the forest shadows to unsettling darkness the black flies and mosquitoes swarmed in a biting cloud that followed their every movement chilled santar wished his tunic at least had sleeves as the night wore on santar battled exhaustion he had worked a full day in the stables since sunrise hauling bags and bales cleaning stalls wrangling horses and he had missed the evening meal the bugs and the cold seemed to drain his vitality along with his blood yet the companion steered him ever onward with delicate nudges that displayed need but forced nothing santar wished for supplies but refused to bemoan them somewhere out there an injured man needed him or woman santar reminded himself the heralds he remembered come in both varieties the journey continued as fatigue became a leaden weight across santars shoulders he longed to sit for just a few moments his eyes glided shut and he forced them open in time to avoid walking into a towering oak worries about demons receded replaced by a solid fight against the sleep that threatened to overwhelm him just putting one foot ahead of the other became an allencompassing battle only the realization of a life dependent on his own kept him going he found himself blundering into deadends and copses uncertain how he had gotten there he forced himself onward every step a victory and hoped he would catch a second wind when he finally reached the ailing herald suddenly the stallion gave santar a hard nudge that drove him to his knees moonlight glared into his eyes blindingly bright after the vast expanse of dark forest in front of him lay a craggy mountain that seemed to touch the very sky santar closed and opened his eyes but the towering monstrosity remained a dozen others beyond it groaning santar staggered to his feet and willed himself forward preparing to climb the companion gave santar another abrupt nudge that once again dropped him to his knees rocks stabbed into flesh and a trickle of blood stained his britches pained tired irritated he turned on the horse im going already im going the companion nickered pawing up divots of muddy weeds he tossed his head santar glanced ahead only then noticing the dark mouth of a cave etched against the rocky cliffs suddenly the horses intention became clear hes in there the horse whinnied head bobbing santar felt a warm wash of relief that he would not have to fight his way up the mountains tempered by the realization that he would have to enter a dark cave alone and without a light the stallion could never fit inside which made sense if he could he would have scooped up the herald and assisted or carried him to safety rather than dragged some stable boy through demoninfested forest and high water to the herald santar sucked in a deep breath releasing it in a slow hiss all right im going in he rose and picked his way to the entrance staring into the black interior any chance you could help me find my way around inside the companion nickered didnt think so santar mumbled he returned his gaze to the cave seeing only as far as the moonlight could penetrate it did not show him much let me gather some weeds or pebbles first something to drop and follow back out the companion shook his head wildly silver mane flying a strangers voice touched santars mind then i will guide you startled santar whirled who who come ill guide you the herald santar had heard that heralds had unusual powers but it still took him inordinately long to figure out the obvious can you hear me as well no response the voice gained a touch of urgency please come quickly im coming santar promised if this herald was like those he had met he would maintain grace under pressure which meant he probably needed help a lot more than he would admit santar secretly wondered if he could do anything worthwhile to assist he did have a way with horses and their wounds but he had never tried his skills on humans nevertheless he plunged into the cave the leathery flap of wings filled santars hearing and the air became pungent with guano a clotted mass of bats hurtled from the cave wings beating furiously startled santar dropped to the floor ears filled with the smack and cut of their wild flight silence followed eerie with menace though glad the bats had gone santar could not help filling the intensity of the quiet darkness with unseen demons take your first left the voice ordered shocked from his own thoughts santar obeyed gratefully he hoped the herald would stay with him in spirit he felt so much braver with a companion even a disembodied faceless one all right santar concentrated on the thought though the other gave no indication he received the message santar veered leftward keeping a hand lightly against each damp musty wall better to glide his fingers through something disgusting than to risk losing his way skip the next opening to the left then the one to the right santar obeyed passing up both opportunities to turn now go right santar did as the other suggested still scraping the stone with his fingers though worried to interrupt the concentration of the one he sought he tried tentatively can you understand me too yes the other sent go right again santar did so my name is santar orrin skip the next right then go right again careful its a tight fit orrin was not kidding santar found himself suddenly entering a narrowing that seemed impassable if he became wedged they would both die in the dark dank interior orrin i cant fit youll fit trust me santar had to keep reminding himself that he spoke with a herald one who desperately needed his help for survival the idea that he might become stuck fast grew into obsession santar realized he alone could make that judgment the herald could not know the size of the man who had come for him i cantmake it orrin im sorry do what you must simple words brave words from one who had just condemned himself to death santar knew he had to try he could not banish his fear but he could choose to ignore it he sucked in a deep breath then let it out fully tightening his muscles and huddling into the smallest area he could manage then he forced himself into the opening the rock crushed in on him tearing furrows of skin from his chest and arms he closed his eyes trying to trick his senses into believing this deliberate act was the source of the darkness he felt pinched squeezed in all directions crushed empty his lungs spasmed seeking air panic trickled through him sending his wits scattering he forced himself onward gathering his thoughts and binding them together into one solid goalthe rescue of a stranger for whom he had already risked so much then suddenly the pressure disappeared santar popped into a cavern that seemed enormous after the constriction that had nearly held him fast im coming he sent you were right i made itthrough his tunic had torn and now hung in two rags from his shoulders though irritating he did not remove them he might need the fabric to cushion some other movement or to use as bandages for a moment he wondered how he would get back especially towing another man he brushed the thought side first he had to find that injured herald when orrin made no reply santar forced conversation he had once seen a healer do the same thing keep his patient talking to assure he did not lose consciousness obliged to respond the wounded man had had little choice but to attend the questions no matter how silly or obvious the answers which kept his mind working awake and focused your companion brought me here the herald did not seem impressed id guessed that next right please undeterred santar continued a remarkably handsome creature in addition to being loyaland intelligent best there is orrins voice itself seemed to smile distracted from the pain im very lucky whats his name santar took the indicated right and suddenly found himself bathed in moonlight though still night the contrast with the depthless cave interior seemed blinding he blinked several times gradually taking in the spray of stars across the bluegray sky the skeletal hulks of trees waving in the wind and the snarl of weeds and bushes that defined the tangled forest the companion lifted his head and looked worriedly in santars direction oh no filled with a tense mixture of alarm and despair santar dropped to a crouch i messedup i lost you santar whirled rushing back into the cave ive gone in a circle im sorry youll haveto start over the companions nameis orrin santar froze orrin but thats your shoulders drawn up to his ears he turned slowly to confront the stallion you the horse nodded yes santar could only stare incredulously why i needed to know you were up to the job someone who can push himself to his limits whowill do so for the good of a sick or injured stranger why even as he asked the question santar understood the answer your herald my herald orrin repeated then added is you i choose you me the reply was startled from santar me he repeated internally herald santar he shook his head to awaken himself from what had to be a dream then looked into the blue eyes of the very real dazzingly gorgeous white stallion in front of him he had aspired to owning a horse half this fine and now he had a companion as a lifelong friend so much more than a possession or a mount thank you santar breathed thank you for choosing me orrin lunged like a striking snake caught santars britches and hurled him into the air santar barely managed to twist before he found himself once again unceremoniously dumped belly first astride the companion come on the horse sent lets go home turning toward valdemar he trotted into the forest mounted on the best there is santar scrambled onto the stallions withers and forgot to worry about demons in the eye of

york mets horses aviation and space science visit her at wwwsffnetpeoplejosephasherman toward the end of the second day of struggling her way through the forest marra was certain she was being followed the question was by what i dont need this really i dont marra was not exactly young anymore not exactly slim and heroic in shape or manner just an ordinary woman she thought wearily not anyone to be followed by well whatever a fourlegged predator would already have tried an attack and a twolegged one the bandit sort would have had no reason not to have done the same as for lord daricks men marra bit her lip that was done and over she was the last survivor of what had been a peaceful village and if she hadnt collapsed after buryingwhat she couldshe wasnt going to break down now she couldnt afford to collapse someone had to deliver the story of that unprovoked raid to whatever authorities she could reach even if it did mean pushing on through she had no idea how much wilderness marra was doing her best to keep heading in the right direction if she could only reach the shore of lake evandim she could hopefully follow it along to civilization or at least a real road at least marra thought she knew woodcraft and could forage for food easily enough and at least darick had had thegood taste to attack in warmer weather so she didnt have to worry about freezing to death damn him damn him and his men and his idea ofof burning down a village over anaccidental insultha no he burned it down for fun for a minute she had a flash of imagined satisfaction seeing whiteclad heralds declaring daricks guilt hearing him proclaimed a criminal and punished as a murderer might as well imagine herself a herald while she was at it with one of those snowybright companions or maybemarra whirled hands clenched on the branch she was using for a walking staff all right whoever you are i know youre there so stop being childish and either step forward where i can see you or get the hell away from me oh smart youve just announced where you are to anyone in earshot she waited heart pounding the forest had gone utterly still shocked into silence by her shout then a male voice low but so musical it gave her a little shiver of delight said your pardon i shall bother you no longer whowhat no answer marra waited but whoever had been following her really must be gone now because the birds were resuming their cheerful noise warily wondering marra moved on but night fell swiftly in the forest and even though a glance upward told her that the sky was still bright with sunlight down here it was already twilight shed better start thinking about stopping for the night another glance upward and marra froze wonderstruck far overhead two gryphons were sporting in the air so high in the dazzling blue that they looked small as birds the sunlight glinted off their golden coats and wings and for a moment more she stood motionless holding her breath then they were gone soaring down the wind and with a sigh she began hunting for a place to camp till morning it really was growing darkand in a hurry too suddenly athing was on her with a roar hurling her to the ground under a mass of dark fur fangs glinted and marra gasping managed to get the staff up in time to have them clash together on the branch splintering it as she struggled to get free before sharp talons could rake her orsuddenly the thing roared again in pain this time and the suffocating weight was gone from her marra caught a glimpse of a manno not a man not with those curling horns or those clawed hands but whatever he as he was fighting the creature saving her and marra looked wildly about for some way to help him pebbles twigs nothing like a good solid rock she grabbed the largest branch she could find and whaled the creature over the head with it the branch broke and the thing whirled to her snarling marra thought wildly wonderful now its really mad but shed given thethe man the chance he needed he had other weapons than claws evidently because a blade glinted then stopped glinting red with the things blood the creature lunged the manwhatever he wascried out in pain then the creature fell twitching and then lay still over the crumpled mound of dark fur eyes golden as a gryphons stared at her for an instant then the man too had crumpled oh no you dont marra thought and hurried to his side ive seen enough death lately but then she froze looking down at him his face was finely drawn almost thin handsome in its own way but rimmed with russetfur the tips of sharp fangs showed between human lips and the tips of pointed animal ears poked through the tangled russethair the horns shed noted rising from his forehead were elegant like twin spirals of ivory maybe a hands breadth long definitely not what one expected to see on a human head marra swallowed dryly his hands were such normal handsbut they ended in powerful curving claws yet the rest of him seemed utterly human clad in tunic and trousers that were tattered but clearly of fine weave and heand he was going to bleed to death if she didnt stop maundering and did something to help him a slash crossed his chest and as marra pulled the torn tunic aside to get at the woundit was no longer bleeding in fact it was no longer there a clawed hand caught her own before marra could pull away the mans eyes shot open they were that brilliant gold wild and confused and marra said hastily its all right you killed thethe thing the wildness faded and suddenly those were purely human eyes despite the odd color the eyes of someone who has lived with despair so long that it has become a companion yes he said i remember now releasing her he sat up in one fluid movement that voice that musical voice you were the one following me why i wanted to be sure you came to no harm oh please im not some fine lady with a noble protector marra closed a hand about a rock just in case why were you following me theman sighed if you must know i was lonely idont get to see too many of my kind these days your kind she echoed warily human lady i amwas a human even as you ofcourse he stood shuddering the night is almost here come ill lead you to a safer place to camp marra glanced about wrapping her arms about herself forest forest and more forest and all of it growing dark with a sigh she followed him since there didnt seem to be much of a choice besides he had saved her lifefor whatever reason who are you marra asked suddenly no one oh dont be cute if you really are as human as you claim you have a name was that a reluctant chuckle i can see that you have scant patience for fools i am albain tandarek a slight ironic bow at your service ah that was clearly a nobles name im marra he glanced back at her as though about to ask what a village woman was doing wandering in the wilderness by herself but said nothing they walked on through the growing darkness in silence but then healbainwhatever he was stopped suddenly this looks like a good place for you to camp with that he vanished into the gloom hey you cant leave me like that hey albain returned in only a few moments his arms full of wood surely you wish a fire surely i wish to know whats going on who are you i mean really not just a name and whywere you following me he sighed and squatted down making a big show of arranging the firewood just so clawed fingers neatly snagging stray tinder and putting each bit in place the second part i already told you i was lonely besides i didnt like the idea of a woman alone not here he clearly didnt mean in an ordinary forest the uh thing marra paused in the middle of lighting the fire the one you killed she heard her voice rise there are more of those very possibly but then but then marra stammered in a rush of sudden desperate hope officials warriors heralds someones bound to be coming to investigate and i wont have to go so far to tell themabout darick how would they know wouldnt you send word thatoh theyd think him a monster too and probably slay him before he could convince them otherwise they would magic or marra clicked flint and steel together once more in fierce determination the fire burst into life tinder first then branches as the light blazed up albain shrank back into the shadows an eerie figure in the night that was the final strain on marras already overworked nerves you enjoy being mysterious dont you she snapped or is it that youre busy feeling sorry for yourself he lunged forward with a snarl fanged face clear in the firelight shouldnt i be marra refused to flinch look i just lost my whole village to a bastard who thought it would be fun to wipe us out oh i didnt realize he sat back staring i am sorry truly i wasnt married or anything like that but but marra fiercely wiped her eyes i dont know what happened to you but i dont think you have the corner on selfpity its not selfpity to mourn for others but then his voice hardened who was it who led the attack surprised marra said lord darick damn him why do you know him she saw the faintest of flinches before he caught himself no albain said a second too late to be convincing but then ive been alone in this forest long enough to be doubtful about a good many things you do know him he sighed put down the rock im not his ally the very opposite in fact much to my disgust he and i are related and yes albain added sharply i meant disgust when i last saw him he was a sadistic boy and now hes a sadistic man ironic that hes the one whos human selfpity marra prodded dont i have the right i dont belittle your loss truly but at least you are not a monster she sniffed and you are what do you call this a fierce sweep of clawed hands took in fangs pointed ears horns just a few blemishes look whatever happened to you you clearly started out human she paused which brings us back to my first question what did happen when he looked at her in what might have been annoyance or surprise marra added honestly i know im prying its none of my business but well youre not the only one whos been alone and lonely ah understandable albain shrugged not meeting her gaze the worst of it is that what happened was my own damned mistake im not a wizard or a sorcerer or anything so grand but i do have some tiny powers iwell when the creatures started to appear the result of a greater mages battle or experiment gone wrong i thought i could be a hero i thought i could take on some monstrous powers that would help me defeat the things as you see i succeeded far too well you cant change back he snorted i cant even kill myself you saw how quickly my wounds heal you didnt answer me theres no way for you to change back albain gave a sharp little laugh oh theres one someone has to want to take on this appearance not very likely is it never mind marra on my word which at least is still wholly mine ill see you safely through the forest and thats the end of it no its not marra thought with a touch of pity youre not the first man to make a mistakewhile trying to do the right thing and ive never yet seen a mistake that couldnt be corrected one way or another it was startling to realize that she cared it was even more startling to realize that she still could care albain caught them dinnerrabbit which marra was secretly relieved to see he ate cooked after that well after that she was just too tired to stay up all night worrying about what he might or might not do curling up she slept she woke with a start in the first dim light of morning a clawed hand over her mouth before marra could struggle she saw albain frantically gesture with his free hand silence she relaxed ever so slightly and he removed the hand from her mouth whispering were not alone monster humans were near a trail she sat bolt upright mouthing darick at his nod marra scrambled to her feet suddenly so overwhelmed with rage that she was blind and deaf to all reason she rushed forward hardly aware of albain trying frantically to stop her they crashed out of the underbrush together out onto the trail right in front of men on horsebackdaricks men who were fighting horses gone mad with terror at albains nonhuman scent good get them out of the way it was only when she was looking up at darick who had managed to stay on his horse that the truth penetrated marras mad rageshe was trying to attack an armed man with nothing but her bare hands he couldnt have recognized her as one of the villagers just as a madwoman trying to tear him apart and marra saw the glint of the sword that was about to cut her down oh hell said a voice clawed hands pushed her out of the way albain lunged at darick daricks horse decided enough was enough and suddenly albain darick and marra were on the ground she grabbed the first weapon that came to hand another rock and started beating at darick with it his flailing arm caught her a sharp blow to the head and she lost her grip on the rock she heard albainroar no other word for it and saw those clawed hands rake at darick yes but his menif they have bows only a few had managed to stay on their panicked horses but those few did indeed have bows marra struggled to her feet shouting wildly shoot and your lord dies the monsters already slain him one of them shouted back marra whirled albain had drawn back shaking clearly horrified at his own brutality no darick wasnt deadyet but albains claws had done some ugly work on his throat and chest he wont be in that body much longer and then the idea hit her with a force that nearly staggered her marra threw herself down beside darick snapping do you want to live well do you want to live a painfilled terrified glance flicked her way darick managed a nod would you be invulnerable would you be immortal wait watch this marra clawed the startled albains hands drawing a few beads of blood darick gave a choked cry of wonder as the scratch neatly sealed and disappeared then the wonder turned to a frantic gasping as his lacerated throat couldnt get in enough air choose marra cried take this immortality or die which life or deathand the ghosts of the villagers you slew choice mortlty chosn the words were barely understandable but it was enough and there was mist everywhere and suddenly the mist was gone marra heard the men gasp and stared at albain terrified that she might have done something wrong but hehe was human fully normally human the monster that had been darick snarled its shock clenching its clawed hands then scrambled up and raced off into the forest did you see marra cried to the men did you see your lord he is a monster they couldnt argue with her not after what theyd just seen with shouts of horror they crashed off through the forest after him albainstood just stood are you all right marra asked carefully he looked down at his human hands flexing them in wonder then turned to give her an equally wonderstruck look youhepowers oh powers lady i would never want to be on the wrong side of your anger but thank you thank you and thank you youre welcome marra said and to her utter embarrassment burst into tears she felt albains arms go about her and thought a village woman and a lord well stranger things had happened indeed they have marra thought and shifted position so that albain could kiss her more easily trance tower

grayhaired man standing beside her gave a brief nod yep and it looks like theyre plannin to stay yep a long time mebe she glared over at him dont be strainin your voice box now ernie he shrugged mebe not so long he elaborated after a moment how do you figure the kingll send help only if he gets word bessie got through you dont know that his eyes narrowed she got through he growled raising her hands norma dropped the subject after the first trickle of soldiers had come over the mountains the garrison commander had sent his lieutenant galloping for the capital as the trickled become a flood hed sent half a dozen more all but one ernies niece bess taws had been returned to them as a headless corpse thrown down before the gateincluding the lieutenant bess was their only hope but after nearly a month with no sign of aid only ernie still believed shed made it through her expression grim norma squinted southward how long do you figure it takes to get to haven she asked ernie shrugged ridin hard eight mebe nine days less if she could get a boat down the terilee river yep how long to raise a relief force dunno depends a couple of weeks more like a couple of months mebe with a scowl norma peered up at the tiny line of enemy troops bringing supplies over the mountains with the harsh northern winter just past trance towers own stores were low if it took another month it wouldnt matter if bess had gotten through or not the garrison would be out of food youd think thered have been a paymaster or a supply wagon or somethin come from haven before now anyway she snarled mebe there has been ernie answered in an ominous voice as one they glanced toward the main gate neither could see the dark flycovered bloodstains from where they stood but that didnt stop them from looking how long before theyd be due back do you figure someone might go lookin for them dunno a while i guess returning her attention to the force below norma shook her head with a friggin army that big she muttered youd think somebody wouldve noticed it by now ernie just shrugged the sound of shouting pulled their attention back inside the garrison what the from their vantage point they could see a knot of people behind the west barracks shouting atcheering onnorma amended two struggling figures there was a glint of golden hair as one had his head knocked back from a wellplaced blow and ernie swore garet blast you know that means andy ernie was already halfway to the stairs little i told him come on he puffed angrily andy ducked a wild swing drove his fists into the other youths unprotected right side in a quick flurry of blows then danced back with a tight smile although garet was older and larger than he no one at trance tower was faster around him the growing crowd began to chant his name and the smile snapped off time to finish this before the noise drew the wrath of the sergeantatarms down on them he pressed forward sixteenyearold ander harrow had been born in the garrison his mother had died in childbirth and his father and three others had been caught in a rockslide when he was nine jem and karl harrows remaining squadmates had raised the boy together bringing him into the guard at twelve protecting him teaching him but mostly just trying to keep him out of trouble garet barns had joined the garrison two years before and although they were not friends at eighteen he was the closest to andys own age which meant that when andy was bored or just itching to cause mischief he either sought garet out to manipulate him into some scheme or goad him into a fight garet had a quick temper that could always be counted on to flare up with the right words and andy always knew the right words now his blue eyes narrowed garet watched the other youth weave back and forth in a parody of feints and counter feints then struck out his fist connected right where he planned andy went flying into the crowd the blood on his face gleaming as brightly as his dark eyes andy showed his teeth to his opponent in recognition of the blow then leaped up only to be jerked off his feet once again what the blue blazes do you think youre playin at her fist wrapped in the back of his shirt norma shook him like a dog with a rat in its teeth havent we told you half a hundred times no more fightin behind them ernie stepped in front of garet who simply wiped the blood from his nose with an even expression andy gave norma a disarming smile it was just a boxing match bollocks really something to pass the time and keep fit right garet andy turned his wideeyed gaze on the other youth who just shrugged sure whatever ill show you fit ill toss you off the north wall then well see how bloody fit you are with half them bastards out there chasin you now theres an idea all eyes turned to see the sergeantatarms leaning against the barracks his expression dark dont you lot have somewhere else to be he asked with dangerous politeness the area was suddenly empty of spectators he turned back to the two combatants barns kp harrow latrines dont he held up one thick finger as andy made to protest even think about speakin just git when the two youths were out of earshot norma gave the sergeant a sideways glance that was kinda lenient for you wasnt it lom he shrugged theres little enough to keep up morale these days might as well make use of what distractions weve got keep him outta my sight for a while though i might have a change of heart well put him on night watch ernie answered that should tire him out some good idea barns can take a turn as well that night andy stood on the north wall staring out at the nearly full moon the afternoon had been a partial success hed blown off some steam satisfied himself that garet was no better a fighter than he and stirred up everyones blood a bit since the enemy had bottled up trance tower the entire garrison was walking around like theyd already lost the air of doom and gloom was getting thick enough to cut with a knife eyes narrowed he glared down at the surrounding campfires so they were temporarily cut off from the rest of valdemar so supplies were tight bessie would be back any day with an army at her back and then theyd send this lot packing back over the mountains double quick his stomach growled and he rubbed it in rueful acknowledgment of its point all right so they were in a tight spotthe quartermaster already had them down to half rations but they werent beat yet not by a long shot the enemy wasnt so tough if they were theyd have taken trance tower already instead of just sitting out there with their thumbs upa movement below the wall made him stiffen he stared into the darkness for a long time but eventually relaxed it was probably just a nightbird he returned his attention to the enemy nobody knew who they were the standards and banners they carried were unfamiliar and the language their single envoy had spoken was gibberish even to the commander although the body hed brought with him had spoken his message clearly enough surrender trance tower andy spat over the wall in unconscious imitation of norma not in this lifetime or any other he swore silently his parents had died for this garrison and no bunch of pikewielding sons of whoevers were going to defile their memories they could sit out there until moss grew over them trance tower would never surrender no matter how hungry they got his stomach rumbled mournfully aw shut up leaning against the parapet he stared out past the dark bulk of the surrounding army the moon was low in the sky shining down on the lightly wooded foothills hed hunted rabbits in those hills with phen royn and harn anzie every year since he was ten years old they should have been out half a dozen times already this spring instead of standing on the walls watching the enemy move about like they owned the place andy grimaced their hunters had probably already stripped the hills of rabbits they were probably sitting around their campfires right now eating roast rabbit and rabbit stew and rabbit pie and something white flashed in the distant trees he frowned ground lightning it flashed again and risking arrowshot from below he leaned forward something was moving in the hills beyond the enemy moving fast he saw it again some twenty yards west of where hed spotted it the first time then again a few moments later farther still it sparkled in the moonlight for just an instant its half hidden form vaguely familiar then it disappeared again whatcha you doin boy he jumped spinning about he shot a glare at phen who held out his canteen with a chuckle lookin at somethin he growled back what someone takin a piss phen risked a glance over the edge no somethin strange there he pointed where past the troops to the west somethins movin out there like its circlin around us phen peered into the darkness i dont see nothin he turned with a grin you imaginin mountain cats again three years ago andy had been certain thered been a mountain cat stalking the garrison flocks hed even found tracks but theyd turned out to belong to a particularly big jackrabbit phen had never let him forget it of course now the enemy had the flocks as well this was no mountain cat andy replied hotly it was white late snow drift snow drifts dont move there in the underbrush tell me you didnt see that phen leaned forward again maybe he shook his head it was probably just an owl or somethin anyway youre relieved go get some sleep shouldnt i report it phen shrugged go ahead if you want everyone to say youre seein giant sheep killin jackrabbit mountain cats again drop dead just givin you a friendly warning yeah sure with some reluctance andy turned away but as he did the flash of white caught his eyes again another twenty yards to the west something was out there it was circling them and it wasnt no owl he spotted it again the next night this time to the east throughout his shift he watched it wink in and out of the trees moving incredibly quickly east to west and back again then just before phen relieved him it crested the top of a small hill rose up and pawed the air with its forelegs silver hooves gleaming in the moonlight its a horse andy made his announcement to phen as they lined up for chow the next morning not a mountain cat then i said its a horse probably one of theirs set out on a hobble to eat grass it wasnt hobbled maybe it escaped then i dont think so then i guess it musta been a ghost horse aw shut up phen ernie was no more help when he told him that afternoon mountain pony he pronounced arent they usually brown yep have you ever seen a white mountain pony nope then it cant be a mountain pony must be a ghost horse then or mebe a mountain cat eh andy gave up he watched the horse pace back and forth from west to east for another full shift then finally reported it to the sergeantatarms the older man frowned thoughtfully how long you been seein it three nights now and youre sure its a horse andy clamped his mouth closed on an imprudent reply yes sarge hm garet barns thought he saw somethin white to the east last night as well garet yeah your fightin partners been on the south wall these last three nights now he stood well theres nothin for it id better go see for myself youre sure its not a mountain cat this time andy snapped his teeth together no sarge that night the sergeant stood watch beside him as the white horse flashed between the trees finally it crested the hill again pawing the air in agitation before disappearing once again its so fast andy whispered in awe ive never seen anything move so fast hm funny how the enemy hasnt spotted it the older man mused you dont figure its really a ghost horse do you sarge andy asked trying to mask the uneasiness in his voice no so it wouldnt be there to he trailed off to what wellmy da he died in the mountains maybe ityou know maybe its come to take you off to join him maybe no the sergeant gave him what amounted to a reassuring show of teeth your da was a good man and a brave soldier but hed have rather faced that lot down there singlehanded than get up on the back of a horse ghost or otherwise and he sure wouldnt have sent one for you no that theres something else altogether what well that remains to be seen he turned keep your eyes on the enemy he ordered tersely theyre a lot more dangerous thanwhatever that is out there you understand yes sarge his jaw tight the sergeant headed for the south ramparts by the next morning everyone wanted to hear about andys latest mountain cat finally hed taken a swing at mac rellden and theyd backed off a little leaving him in the tender care of norma and ernie phen took their bowls to the chow line so whats this slop sposed to be normas brother ham glared at his bowl the garrison cook shot him a resentful look back its beans mister and you should be glad to get em stores are running low pretty soon youll be looking at yer boots and wondering how to i can cook em up phen laughed that would break the siege double quick we all die from the fumes ham glared at him as everyone about them laughed hey heads up the commander there was a hushed silence over the chow line as commander dravin strode across the parade ground those seated made to stand but he waved them down again a tall man in his late twenties dravin had been the late commander beckwins lieutenant for four years before an infected tooth had taken the old man to his reward he was not an imposing officer but rather one who carried an air of practical confidence that inspired the same confidence in others today his eyes were shadowed with fine worry lines but he smiled easily as phen and harn saluted hows the food the same sir phen replied have some no thank you mister royn ive already eaten the last of the turnips im afraid privilege of rank but ask me again tomorrow no sign of relief column yet sir ham asked bluntly none as yet corporal but bess taws got through king valdemar will be here any day now and then therell be roast lamb and fresh bread instead of beans and turnips he said loudly his voice pitched to take in the gathered soldiers they grinned back at him raising their spoons in salute have you seen ander harrow he asked in a quieter tone phen nodded yes sir andy when the youth came forward the commander indicated the north wall with a turn of his head walk with me its a companion sir a companion mister harrow one of the saviors of valdemar who came in answer to the prayers of the king himself andy squinted up at his commander ive heard stories of em sir but dont they always travel with heralds they do i didnt see no herald sir no do you thinkthey killed its herald no if its herald had been killed it wouldnt be pacing the garrison it would have returned to the companions field if it hadnt died as well no i believe its here to choose a herald mister harrow it just cant get close enough to do it the commander stared into space for a moment did you get any kind of feeling when you first saw it he asked finally sir a feeling like it was calling to you or trying to draw you away from the garrison andy glanced up at him in alarm no sir no sense of familiarity or purpose no sir hm his gray eyes cleared never mind im sure well find out who its come for soon enough thank you mister harrow sir well if its come to choose a herald out of this garrison its got bloody poor timing norma pronounced a few minutes later and bloody poor taste if it wants andy here phen added with a laugh no one said it wanted me andy snapped back with unusual vehemence it could want anyone they usually choose the young ham answered thoughtfully digging a grubby bit of wood from behind his ear after a moments scrutiny he began to pick his back teeth with it and youre the youngest weve got he finished theres garet hes even seen it and taras only two years oldern him none of them have your sparkling personality though shut up phen hey really itll look into your eyes then carry you away from all of this to haven with its soft beds and clean sheets and youll forget all about us i said shut up ernie shot him a curious glance but norma just shook her head dont you wanna be a herald boy andy jerked to his feet wants got nuthin to do with it he almost shouted its not me all right norma made to answer but ernie laid his hand on her arm sure lad its all right he sought him out an hour later andy was sitting with his back against the west barracks stropping his dagger hard enough to raise sparks hitching up his pants the older man squatted down beside him so whats what nuthin bollocks really nuthin i just dont want everyone on my back when it turns out it wants someone else why would it want someone else because theres dozens it could want garet taramac maybe even you his tone was challenging but ernie just snorted doubt that somehow still for all we know it might even want one of them he jerked his head past the wall none of thems from valdemar so so it matters no boy its one of us an if its you its you and you go why because thats what your folksd want neither one of them ever shrank from their duty and youll not either well miss you and youll miss us but youll go andy glared at him resentfully but didnt debate the unusually long speech he just dove the dagger into its sheath and stood up doesnt matter anyway does it i cant get to it and it cant get to me ernie gave him a neutral look mebe the next night everyone wanted to see andys companion they crowded the walls and betting was brisk with two to one odds on andy three to one on garet five to one on tara and ten to one on mac someone even placed a bet on the garrison cook with the hope hed be taken away finally the sergeant chased them off betting continued in the barracks and across the parade ground and discussion was heated on how to bring the companion and its new herald together most favored a breakout fight with the four hopefuls in the middle some wanted to sneak out in the middle of the night and phen suggested building a catapult and throwing first andy then the other three over the walls one at a time both tara and mac took the teasing well and even garet unbent long enough to reply that as long as andy went first it was all right with him andy however refused to be drawn into the joke hed been quiet and withdrawn all day spending much of his time alone at supper he answered normas questions with grunts and ignored phen completely when it came time for his shift he took the stairs like he was climbing to the gallows as the moon rose he watched the illusive creature that might turn his life upside down flit back and forth through the trees then turned away the next morning norma and ernie went to see the commander its about that companion sir norma began yes well sir we was wondering she glanced at ernie who widened his eyes expectantly at her the thing is sir she continued the sergeantatarms he says they the companions are smart that they can talk to each other and to their heralds like yes so we was wondering why if it is a companion and all and if its so smart how come its been pacing around the garrison for four days instead of hightailing itself off to get help we could sure use the help and that would bring it to its chosen a lot faster commander dravin leaned back thoughtfully as i understand it corporal the companions are extremelysingleminded when they search for their chosen it would likely be totally abhorrent to it to leave once it had located that chosen even to get help right sir thats what we figured also the sergeantatarms he says that theyre magical that they know things so maybe it knows something about us meaning that maybe it knows were gonna bring its chosen to it the commanders eyes narrowed go on well sir the thing is we know its here for one of us and most of us figure its andy him or one of the other three under twentyfive also she glanced at ernie also the commander prodded also ernie answered though id like nuthin more than to believe my bessie got through the truth is shed have reached haven long before now and the king would have got word back to us somehow if only to keep our spirits up dont you think sir norma prodded the commander looked away for just a moment then back his expression weary yes and were running out of food sir this time a month from now well be in a desperate place and theyll be that much stronger so normas eyes brightened we had a thought see the garrisons at full strength now decently fed and itchin for a fight you wont ever find us more determined than right now weve got it into our heads all of us to see this companion and one of our own matched up so we take the fight outside all of us in one mad rush and we bring that companion its chosen the enemyll never know what hit em the commander smiled faintly you realize they outnumber us at least five to one corporal that most of us would never survive this mad rush at least wed go down fightin sir and we know too that even if we do beat em this time theyll be back with reinforcements thats why its so important to get word to king valdemar we figured a companiond have the best chance of anyone to get through i mean its been dancin about their perimeter for nearly a week now and they aint noticed it yet true and besides ernie added a heraldd be a fine legacy for trance tower dont you think sir commander dravin glanced from one old veteran to the other then nodded slowly yes i do the commander sent for andy garet tara and mac an hour later he came straight to the point were going to attack the enemy at dawn tomorrow he said bluntly with everything weve got once outside the four of you have one objective only regardless of who might fall around you to find that companion when you do i dont care which of you is chosen youre to make for haven at once all of you obviously the one riding will quickly outstrip the others but i want you all heading south at double time is that clear the four glanced hesitantly at each other but shouldnt the others join the fight after one of us is chosen sir andy asked youll need all the swords you can get maybe so but those are my orders mister harrow butsir what if it doesnt choose any of us tara asked then its up to the companion to find its chosen on its own we cant line up for it can we no sir whatever happens the four of you are to make for haven period someone has to get through yes sir that night the five remaining members of gray squad stood on the north wall together watching the future of trance tower flit gracefully between the trees is movements were blindingly fast one minute appearing to the east the next to the west but somehow it seemed less agitated tonight as if it knew the decision theyd made word of the mornings attack had spread quickly and all along the walls the garrison watched the companion move in reverent silence finally phen stirred faintly is it my imagination or has it come closer than it was ernie nodded it has it sure is pretty yep think we should give andy here a bath first thing tomorrow we cant hardly have a grubby little scrub like him representin trance tower like that now can we leave him be phen norma admonished tonights not the time for teasin she turned you got the drink ham yeah get it out then ham pulled a dark brown bottle from his pack he uncorked it in one swift motion then passed it over norma held it up and the smell of brandy wafted out on the breeze to tickle against their nostrils compliments of the commander she said now to us eh for years of loyal service every one of us and to jem and karl theyd have been proud of the job we did on their boy whatever happens in the mornin she took a deep drink then passed it to ernie to duty ham to ander harrow phen the younger man smiled to mountain cats and to companions finally the bottle passed to andy he held it cradled in his hands for a log time until norma nudged him cmon boy finish the toast andy held the bottle up feeling the liquid inside slosh about inside to trance tower garrison he said thickly i never thought id he stopped his jaw working i never thought id have to leave it but if i do i will he took an abrupt drink then turned away so the others couldnt see his face good enough ernie answered the next day dawned cool and damp the cook doled out the last of the potatoes fried up with the last of the mutton then the garrison lined up weapons ready facing the main gate commander dravin sat on his horse before them his swords drawn he didnt speak just cast his gaze across the faces of his soldiers as if memorizing their features then nodded once the sergeantatarms gave the order the gate was flung open and trance tower garrison attacked the enemy was surprised but not for long it rallied quickly and then it was handtohand combat on the northern plain protected at the center of the gray squad andy moved as fast as he could for the foothills somewhere out there he knew the others were doing the same ringed by a circle of swords and spears they made three hundred yards then four then five before by sheer weight of numbers the enemy penetrated their defenses ham was the first to fall then phen when norma went down andy leaped forward but a great axwielding man jumped between them and with a scream andy closed with him he never saw ernie take the blow aimed for his back but he heard him fall the battle raged unabated throughout the morning trance tower had something to fight for now and they broke wave after wave of enemy troops sent against them in the face of their ferocity the enemy began to falter and when a white flash entered the fray kicking and slashing with hooves like silver lightning they broke and ran the cry went up for the herald as commander dravin led trance tower garrison after them two hundred yards from the foothills andy sank to his knees in relief it seemed like hours later than he managed to struggle to his feet and survey the damage though it was really only a few moments ham was dead ernie was dying and phen was so badly wounded that he probably wouldnt last the day but what was probably worse tara and mac lay together on the northernmost edge of the battlefield theyd almost made it to the hills almost breathing hard andy knelt beside norma taking her hand in his he squeezed her bloodied fingers until her eyelids fluttered open did we beat em she asked hoarsely he nodded his gaze blurred by tears yeah thenwhat are you waitin for git i cant leave you like this ill mend takes more than the likesof them to put an anzie in her grave i said git there was a whicker behind them and andy turned slowly twenty paces away the companion stood staring at him with its brilliant blue eyes this close it was dazzingly white in the sunlight and he could barely look at it without squinting he moved forward the companion and the guardsman looked into each others eyes for a long time and then andys mouth quirked up i told them it wasnt me he whispered his tone a combination of relief and disappointment the companion turned its attention away sweeping its bight gaze over the battlefield clearly searching then turned back to stare into andys face once again he nodded his understanding yes he said laying one weary hand on its back ill help you find that herald of yours they reached garet barns a few moments later he was lying on his back his eyes wide with shock his hands pressed tight against his side blood seeped through his uniform tunic to pool darkly beneath him his face was ashen but when he looked up into the companions eyes a bit of the color returned andy shook his head shoulda known he knelt cmon lemme see it his gaze still locked on the companions eyes garet allowed the other youth to examine the wound its not terrible andy pronounced after a minute taking off his own tunic he used his knife to cut his shirt into strips then bound up the wound all right lets get you up that lot wont keep runnin all day arms wrapped about the others chest he drew garet to his feet the companion knelt and somehow andy managed to get him onto its back it stood carefully then one hand holding the other youth by the belt andy nodded lets go they made their way slowly across the battlefield careful not to step on any of the wounded friend and foe alike watched them go in silence and the ones that could saluted as they passed they reached the south road without incident still shocky garet rode without speaking and deep in his own thoughts andy hardly noticed his surroundings until a white blur flashed between them and a stand of pine trees looking up andy stared straight into a pair of brilliant sapphire eyes the world fell away beneath the intensity of its gaze and all he could think to say was oh there were two of you the second companion whickered softly after a few moments it nudged him gently then it nudged him harder chosen the first companion pawed the ground and garet stirred andy the garrison we have to keep moving right shaking himself out of his stupor andy carefully mounted up they had miles to travel before he could pause to wonder at the sudden change in his life they had to get to the capital warn king valdemar and come back with an army to save what was left of trance tower but suddenly it all seemed possible smiling down atlillia he nodded all right im ready to go now together they headed down the south road toward haven starhaven by stephanie d shaver stephanie shaver is a single twentysomething living in st louis missouri where she works

trickling down her side and legs into the grass the mages body was acrumpled charred mess at her feet buthis soulat the instant she had killed himthe moment when shed poured everything she had left athimhe had done the unexpected he was tangled with her soul somehowburied like a jaggedblack seed she was too weak to think clearly enough to destroy him and even if she could have gottenback to the

threw herself too far into what she didbut howcould he not the mage killed her daughterand her husbandin more ways than one she had nothing left with the last of her strength she slipped the moorings of her body and plunged deep into theearth dropping like an offering into the burning node of power beneath hervess writhed in his bed screaming his body was on firehis body was firelocked in the process of agonized immolation he arched in pain and horror as his skin and bones meltedand it was gone vess sat up soaked in sweat and breathing heavily he was in a waystation inside the village of solmark it was morning he was not a woman dying alone in a forest he was a herald here on business for the crown that wasnt just a nightmare he thought that waswhat the hells was that he was shaking as he dragged himself out of bed and dressed he felt a curious emptiness within as if someone had cracked open his chest and scooped out his insides as if a part of me just died he thought unsure of where the thought came from chosen he paused momentarily disoriented by kestrics voice in his mind yes are you all right he nodded im fine i felt somethinga nightmare something like one ill be okay i need some air he straightened his collar brushing out the front i need to do what i came here for he sucked in a deep breath relaxing his shoulders on exhale right after all those days of ridingto get so little rest are you sure you dont want to try to go back to sleep im sure i dont think itll get better with more sleep he rubbed the back of his neck its the damn pelagirs i never have good dreams this close to them vess had no illusions of being the next windriderhis magegift in comparison to some of the other real heraldmages was pretty pitifulbut the sliver of active magegift he did have made him sensitive to local magic it was more a bane than a boonit was distinctly unpleasant to be able to simultaneously see magic and be completely helpless to affect it his other gifts more than made up for where the supposedly superior magegift had failed him he was one of the strongest mindspeakers in the heraldic circlestrong enough to use it as a weapon a touch of empathy coupled with a noble upbringing had also made him a viable member of the kings inner circle viable enough that for the last six months hed effectively been the kings own sans the title the senseless attacks on his reputation and jastev the groveborn stallion hed been in that uncomfortable illdefined position of kings closest adviser ever since the real kings own nadja had stopped being able to get out of bed in the mornings nadjai hope youre not hurting though i know you probably are chosen are you dwelling vess shook his head trying to disperse his brooding thoughts i am he said i should stop he opened the door the cool hand of early dawn caressing his face want to come along with me on my walk he felt a pleasant surge of affection from kestricthe closest the companion could come to a hug as if you had to ask the gate to the stockade was pushed up for the day and in the light of the new morning vess could see now why theyd needed to gather up five men last night to get it open it was composed of entire tree trunks planed caulked and lashed together to form a formidable barrier that could be dropped at a moments notice the waystation was built inside the stockadeto put it outside amid the unpredictable dangers of the pelagirs would have been suicide not to mention a constant hassle pelagir plants grew with preternatural quickness the waystation would have been overcome by greenery within a few short years much the way starhaven is he thought they passed out from under the cool shadow of the gate and down the road leading away from solmark there werent many people aboutjust one girl who waved to them as they passed by her smock pockets stuffed with herbsand the weather was pleasant and cool the quiet was as pleasant as the weather vess had become accustomed to living in haven with the daily pressure of hundreds of minds pressing on his shields he didnt usually notice it but out in the hinterland it was strange to not have that sense of others around him just me and kestric he thought as he and his companion headed down a thin overgrown trail what a change of course the pelagirs had a presence all their own something akin to a ghostly hand brushing the back of his neck he had felt it even as a child when his mother had sent him to solmark to be fostered for a summer it had not been pleasant and if solmark was enough to give him nightmares starhaven was even worse as if cuedor possibly listening in on his surface thoughts kestric said so where are you taking us i assume you have a location in mind starhaven he replied or what used to be starhaven it was solmarks sister town fifty years ago was was until everyone in it died ive mentioned this before havent i youve mentioned being fostered in solmark but not starhaven patterns of sunlight and shadow dappled kestrics pure white coat as they passed under the forests canopy the trail for all that it surely wasnt used regularly by anyone anymore was in remarkably good shape easy to discern and unbroken there isnt a lot to say about starhaven he said even without magegift its disturbing to visit a place if you know over a hundred people all died at once there one night no signs of struggle or violence and i would imagine thats why the adults told us not to go there and exactly why you did of course he smiled boys will be boys and something was waiting for us there in fact something as a child i thought it was a ghost but my adult reason says it was probably just a wandering mage he shrugged he seemed amusedthough i didnt realize it till months later when i wasnt so terrified of the memory all white robes bleached hair with what i think were crow feathers in itlooked as much like a bird as a person hunh kestric nodded leaning forward in the saddle i think it might have been an outkingdom magesome of them wear some strange costumes whats so strange about all white vess laughed aloud aside from making me a walking targetnothing really ahthe marker stone he looked down to where a crumbling stone lay to one side of the road imprinted with the letters for starhaven here it is the road emptied out into a clearing the size of solmark green hulks that had once been houses shared space with saplings and tender bushes the place was disarmingly cheerybirds sang in the trees and there was ample sunlight kestric stopped three steps in and turned his head about as he surveyed the scene vess considered dismounting but decided against it he didnt think theyd be staying long i dont know why i picked coming here he said after a while it always struck methe mystery and the sadnessso many people gone without any reason overnight youre infinitely silly you know that vess blinked in surprise at the lighthearted tone in kestrics mindvoice i am he said sure you are vess youre a herald of course you want to know what happened here not that i think youll ever knowthese are the pelagirs strange things happen all the time he nodded they do indeed like girls who people think are goddesses speaking of which we ought to go find her kestric tossed his head toward the road neh vess was about to give his nonverbal agreement when something pale caught the edge of his vision he turned his head and there off to one side amongst the trees that bordered the clearing stood a pale figure in white for a moment vess forgot to breathe as the vertigosensation of having seen this person before swept him it was the figure from his childhoodthe strange pale man with feathers in his hair in the next moment his training took over and he unconsciously reinforced his shields while simultaneously slipping open his inner eye to look at the man with magesightnothing not the power pulses that signaled an illusion nor the seamless invisibility that someone with very strong and specific shields would have just wisps of gray must sprinkled with pinpricks of light what the hells is that he yelled in panic throwing down the mental image of the mans seeming kestric swung around and backed up in the instant he brought his head about the figure raised a hand and wavedand vanished the birds had not stopped singing and the sun had not gone behind a cloud but vess could feel the bumps rise on his arms and a chill rise up his spine he felt much less safe than he had a few moments ago gone he heard kestric say damn vess said maybe starhaven is haunted after all he took a deep breath and ihave exactly enough magegift to be completely useless toward doing any good if a herald ofany sort can even helpmight be better to find a competent priest might be better to get back to solmark good idea vess looked around reassuring himself thatto his eyesthey were still alone thesooner the better heylaherald the voice came from off to the left of vess as he walked around from the stable toward the waystation looking over vess saw an elderly man crossing over to him a girl in towthe same girl we passed this morning he thought what irony if she turns out to be the onewho was the whole reason for my leaving off vacation to come out here greetings sir vess said bowing slightly how can i help you i heard you were looking for my granddaughter the man said coming to a stop with his hands on his hips and a grin on his face im sevastan and this is my famous juni you need healing well at least hes congenial vess thought no actually i dont he smiled i heard about your granddaughter while i was visiting my mother andto be honest i admit to being a bit concerned heh came all the way out to this backwater town out of concern now thats something isnt it juni sevastan looked down at his granddaughter who was smiling slightly sir if youd like to talk in private with me vess asked well sevastan said if you prefer juni its all right she said i have work to do she stood up on her toes and kissed her grandfather on the cheek then bowed to vess before strolling off and disappearing behind a house vess turned back toward sevastan to find that the mans outward congeniality had vanished replaced by a firmly set mouth and cold eyes this is a switch vess thought would you like to adjourn to the waystation he asked no actually i want to make something clear sevastan said all remnants of cheerfulness erased from his tone my wife is dead my daughter died when juni was only a few months old and my soninlaw died when she was five i dont have any familymost of them got killed in starhaven now i know about you heralds you like to take children away from their homes and families juni isnt going with you she isnt anything youd want and she doesnt want to leave anyway the faint smile on vesss face felt forced but he maintained it anyway he could point out that it was the companions not the heralds who took away childrenand he could point out that healers werent heraldsbut neither point would matter or help sevastan didnt want his granddaughter leaving him and that was the real issue you are assuming vess said that i have a choice in this matter you could choose to leave only if i was assured she wasnt a danger to herself or those around her forgive me for not asking vess said sharply but am i perhaps mistaken has your daughter been trained by a healer i taught her what i know about herbs sevastan said setting bones splints wrapping wounds im sorry vess said thats not what i mean when i say healer what i have heard of your daughters skills sounds like she is healing with a gift its not the same as applying bandages or ointments vess firmed his mouth if it goes untrained it could wind up killing someone wild gifts inevitably twist in on themselvesthey must be schooled and since he is using hers assuming sevastan interrupted an edge of annoyance in his voice that she is using a gift vess resisted the urge to sigh on one hand he sympathized with the man over his lack of familybut on the other i think the crown would not approve of me smacking him upside the head he thought with bland amusement though im sure the king would understand youre right vess said i am assumingbecause i havent seen her heal anyone yet and when i do ill know which is why im here sir vess crammed as much sincere compassion as he could into his voice i dont want to take your granddaughter away from you thats the last thing i seek but you have to understand that this is for her own good and i wager that once her training is done the healers circle would be happy to send her back hereespecially since she seems to be needed and if she does not have a gift at all sevastan asked one brow raised what if the gods have touched her and are working through her hm will the priests then be taking her away if that is the case and its bloody unlikely vess thought but ill let you have your wishfulthinking then its a matter i will leave to the priests i have no jurisdiction when it comes to religion very well then sevastan nodded his head to vess come by my house at sunset marsi is bringing her son garth by for juni to attend to ill see you then vess said sevastan snapped about moving off with a stiff unhurried gait vess waited till he was out of sight then slumped against the waystation door pinching his nose with his thumb and forefinger im sure you heard it all oh yes kestric said with a mental sigh that gusted loudly through vess mind i think you didyour best considering that he wasnt here to listen and hes not going to be happy when youconfirm what we already know thats his problem vess thought if he loves her so damned much he should move tohaven to be with her he straightened im going to go take a bath his anger faded as he stalked off toward the public house giving his mind room to ponder what he was going to do after this evening to get juni out of solmark because just then that whole idea of heralds kidnapping children sounded damned attractive it really is a shame youre the only one who can hear me the womans voice said because youre the first person in decades to show up who can and you arent listening vess blinked nothing but darkness and mist surrounded him and he realized peripherallythat he must be asleep hunh you still dont understand a sigh it seems this sort of naivete runs rampant with yourpeople perhaps you should find one of your socalled heraldmages and call them here thedanger you are flirting with is not a normal one i failedwith disastrous consequences youcannot vess sat up in bed his heart fluttering rapidly against his ribcage and his mind full of strange dreams he was thank the gods not sweating too badlyso while he was a trifle jarred at least he didnt smell like old socks how was the nap kestric asked lousy vess replied sticking out his tongue another weird dream he grasped at the fraying ends of the dreams memory but it melted away ehits gone how are the apples you mean how were the apples excellent the slightly mushy ones taste goooood tell thepublican next time you see him that i really appreciate it my companion rotten apple eater i prefer wellripened to rotten and this from a man who likes tripe stew just the one from that inn at kettlesmith vess said with a smirk and no other did i mention its nearly sunset tripeeater crumbs and i was so looking forward to a graphic description of rotten apples thanks forthe reminder vess rose from the bed lets see what we see he got back to the waystation sometime after sunset and immediately walked into the stablebuilt for companions so it was wide enough for him and kestric to stand in togetherand sat down on the stool in one corner of the stall vess put his head in his hands and curled the tips of his fingers in his hair are you going to talk now kestric asked vess took a deep breath inhaling the dusty scent of hay and leather this day couldnt havebeen stranger if the gods themselves had tried whats wrong shes not a healer vess looked up at kestric meeting the faintly luminescent blue eyes of his companion i looked at her while she was healing the boyand its not healing gift shes using that doesnt make any sense maybe this will help vess said drawing up the mental image of what hed seen and tossing it down the bond junieyes shut hand out and glowing faintly red to vesss magesight the edges of her patients lacerations drawing together and sealing up the trickles of sweat dripping down the sides of her face he followed up the wordless report with the signature of the power she had been using exercising his limited empathy to give kestric the full experience then he waited thats vess felt kestric recoil in disgust as the companion took a step back in the stall thats bloodmagic shes using it to reshape the flesh vess nodded i wasnt sure of it but if you think so too but shes not a bloodmage we would have felt it she has the magegiftand it is active he said soberly she also has empathy andmindspeechgods shes just like me except her other two gifts are dormant she doesnt evenhave healer potential kes and worsesomething happened to the boy after she healed him its like a bloodstain on his soul and his mothers just the same i took a look around the villagebefore i came back just about everyone here has the same marking oh hellfires the companion flared his nostrils we need a heraldmage i know vess rubbed his nose it just doesnt seem to make sense though i dont pick upthe least bit of malevolence from her something doesnt fit how is she doing this why is shedoing it is it possible to do bloodmagic without knowing youre doing it or does she just haveone hell of a shield around her that kestric said is what id like to know vess opened his eyes staring at the ceiling something was floating there hovering above his head and then he really woke up and realized that his mind was once again playing tricks on him there was nothing on the ceiling but shadows and no one in the room but him he was alone and maybe thats my problem he thought suddenly too many goddamn years in the courtwith an empty bed and fewer friends than a mean drunk just working day in and day out waitingfor the next crisis to strike and wasnt that the whole point of taking leave in the first place i could have told heraldbecka to find another person with magegift to investigate solmark but noi went instead if itsnot trouble finding me its me finding trouble he grimaced im pitiful he pulled himself out of bed and into his clothes a brush to kestrics mind found him to be sleeping and vess didnt see a reason to wake him in the distance he could hear the sound of the solmark gate raising he waned to walk and think and for once really truly be alone no people no companionsjust him and the forest it wasnt healthy to go walking in the pelagirs alone but the same could be said for parts of haven as well picking up his sword from the table where it lay vess stuck it into his belt and set off to be by himself it took longer to get to starhaven on foot and this time he approached it with the caution it deserved he stood silently at the entrance peering about once with his regular pair of eyes then again with magesight when he was certain things were safe he walked into the center pulled the sheathed sword out of his belt and sat down if im going to go looking for trouble he thought i might as well go all out but after a while when the birds kept singing and the sunlight grew warmer he found himself relaxing he lay down in the grass the sword on his chest and stared at the one cloud in the sky above him shaped like a fist how long he thought since ive just watched clouds the answer came easily since nadja got sick since i started worrying the companions mightmake me the next kings own oh godsif theres one thing i dont wanti dont care if id begood at it i dont want that job he sighed but if i had to id do it and we all know it herald he hadnt heard her walk up but he knew the voice and he recognized that it was close sitting up and letting the sword fall into the crook of his left arm vess looked over to see juni walking toward him good morning he said with a smile he had acted as if nothing unusual had happened last nightmaking the true excuse that he needed to think about what he had discovered he was pretty sure that she didnt suspect anything what are you doing here he asked i visit here a lot she said especially early she paused her mouth half open then took a step forward saying you seemtroubled he smiled a lot of things on my mind about me he shook his head no not you she cocked her head what about the court the king my duty she widened her eyes you know the king he nodded sure im one of his counselorsi know quite a bit about court life he winked thats my curse she smiled is the palace nice it can be she nodded this place must be strange to someone like you it would be except that i was raised not far from here my mother is lady baireschild she widened he eyes again my lord no he raised a hand dropped the titles when i got chosen he grinned never liked them much anyway he felt the smile fade youre a very nice young lady juni she bowed her head blushing a little thank you youre welcome he stood stretching and brushed grass out of his hair and off his shirt then dwelling on that last comment to her he opened his inner eye and reached out to her maybe i was wrong the redblack energy he had witnessed around her just last night was gone he pressed further delicately snaking past her natural defenses her three gifts were still there but now he saw that there was something moresomething like the bloodstain he had seen on the people of solmarkonly deeper thats odd why would she have marked herself with her own stain something slammed into him an unseen force that lifted him into the air and threw him back down to the ground in a painstricken sprawl he blinked stars out of his eyes and tasted blood in his mouthbefore hed been hit though hed felt a surge of magic coming from nearby chosen he heard kestrics panicked call im not deadyet he thought dazedly get out here quick somethings not right he rolled over shaking his head to clear it and for a moment all he saw was a pale frightened juniand then he saw sevastan sevastanbut not sevastan even when the man had been curt yesterday he hadnt looked thismalevolent the set of his mouth the shape of his eyes the way he held himselflittle pieces that amounted to a startling sinister change a different person was standing before vess one look in his eyes revealed that it is unfortunate sevastan said but necessary i meant it when i said i cant have you taking her away the blow had thrown off vess internal balancehe was seeing double the physical world layered under his magesight sinuous red tendrils wrapped sevastans arms gathering in pools in his hands a cord of red power like a leash dripped out of his left hand and connected to juni and from juni spun out hundreds of thin red threads pulsing in time with a heartbeat of their own everything fell into place with painful clarity hes the bloodmage vess thought in shock not her she has magegifthes working through her and disguising it as a giftgood gods sevastan raised his arm and shouted something and a black levin bolt cracked through the air toward vess who threw up his arms in a pitiful mockery of defense inches away from him it disintegrated in a shower of sparks as it hit invisible shields vess blinked in surprise then blinked again as a pale white form faded into sight beside him i cant keep this up a vaguely familiar female voice said into his mind if you have a plan useit well sevastan said his attention shifted off vess this is unexpected didnt i kill you vess heard the female voice answer with flat emotion by your own hand we are entangledmage i do not die if you do not die sevastan laughed a complication i will swiftly amend he said raising his hands againvess didnt give him a chance dragging up his mental energies he split open his shields threw his mind at sevastanand screamed inside his head years of anger frustration and disgust broke out of vess his empathy fueling the raw violence of his attack months of watching nadja die by inches in her bedmonths of sitting with the king as he quietly went to pieces with the agonized guilt of the latest herald hed had to send off to possible death or worse years of court deception petty politics and subterfugedeceivers and backstabbers with smiling faces and no concept of the pain they caused tragedies sorrows pain the struggle to keep from being beaten down by the very people he tried to help and past that the certainty that the thing he was fighting was the same thing that had killed starhaven the thief of life the mindblast broadened and changed to incoherent rage lost in the blinding power he had given himself over to vesss world dissolved into a solid sheet of fury and evaporated herald vess blinked finding himself elsewhere not starhaven not solmarknot the palace or his mothers manor he was somewhere where his whites seemed to glow with their own light and everything was the gray of twilight herald the voice said again i want to thank you vess sat up and saw a man standing over him his face in shadows but his hand extended out to him all my life ive been that wizards puppet the man said he used me to destroy starhaven and when he realized that i wasnt a suitable vessel for his power he worked through my daughter and grandchild for the same im sorry herald please know that anything i said to youthe mouth and the voice were mine but the words were his sevastan vess said reaching up to take the mans hand what take care of my granddaughter herald sevastan said as his warm dry fingers closed around vess hand please let her know that even with that bastards hand on my mind i tried my best to love her chosen vess came around to toobright sunlight the aura of a reaction headache was building behind his eyes and he tasted copper in his mouth chosen wake up im alive vess said his voice feeble and sweet kernos how i wish i werent a sob cut the air and grimacing vess climbed to his knees fighting nausea and dizziness his hands were shaking and his skin felt clammy he had definitely overextended himself juni had thrown herself over her grandfather and was crying hysterically vess mind was still painfully open to thoughtsjunis griefstricken regrets and stunned questioning of what had just transpired and the telling silence coming from the body of sevastan i killed him he thought reaching out to pull the veils of his shields around his mind no said the womans voice in his mind i killed him you broke his concentration longenough to give me the opportunity to throw the bastard into the nodewhich thank the god of myfathers actually worked this time a sad sigh unfortunatelythe trauma was too much forsevastan himselfdamnit vess turned slightly looking in the direction of the ghostly mage her arms folded across her chest and one slender eyebrow raised whats a node he asked she rolled her eyes naive outlanders never mind hes gone her face softened and youhave done me a great service she smiled i knew that first time i saw you that youd besomething special farewell herald im off to the place i should have been long long ago she dissolved before his eyes reforming into a broadwinged white crow that launched itself upward flying up toward the sun he tried to watch her go but the impending headache and his own physical weakness dissuaded the notion goodbye he said good rest and then there was just the matter of juni vess heard the muffled belltone of companion hooves behind him kestric no doubtthough vess wasnt sure how hed gotten behind him the companion came up alongside and vess grabbed hold of the saddle to pull himself up wait a moment how did he get his gear on vess really looked at the companion now and it gazed back at him with what seemed to be faint amusement hellfires vess thought stunned thatsthe grove stallion greetings herald he heard the contrabass voice of jastev boom in his mind i choosebrighthavens certainly not you youve got a companion vess lost his fine grip on upward mobility he fell over and landed in a sprawl on the grassbowled over not only by the fact that another companion had just spoken to him but had done so in order to tell a joke hes got quite a sense of humor doesnt he kestric said dryly in vess mind from the overgrown trail that led to starhaven the companion galloped into view slowing to a trot as he came up to vess and stood before him hes a bloody sadist vess gaspedand then the surprise faded and he realized what was going unsaid has nadjadid she finally right after you left i didnt want to tell you butyes peacefully in her sleep vess nodded tears building up in his eyes and trickling down his cheeks poor chosen youve been through so much are you going to be all right its a sadness he said watching dazedly as jastev walked with exaggerated dignity over to the dead man and juni i wish i could say it was a relief it isand it isnt it is what it is he still wasnt completely all there because he was still trying to figure out why jastev was here and not looking for a new kings own when the companion bent his head down touching the girls forehead with his muzzle juni raised eyes bright red from crying and vess felt a momentary shock as her eyes widened and her face brightened with amazement oh thank the god vess moaned much later when hed done his best to explain the sevastan situation to the people of solmarkwhen hed made sure they understood that juni was neither demon or healerwhen hed quaffed enough willowbark tea to stop an armywhen hed arranged for a heraldmage to visit solmark and ensure it was free of bloodmagics taintand when he was sure that jastev was tending to juni newly chosen but still in mourningonly then did he find himself lying in bed listening to the crickets and the crows at sunsetaching but alive juni will be a compassionate kings own he thought drowsily to kestric and a good trainee for you to teach his companion responded i do know more about the job than anyone else he subsided into silence then finding comfort in the crows as they sang their harsh song to the sunset he thought of the last glimpse of the white crow spiraling up to the sun and he smiled he slept all through the night dreamless and at peace rebirth by judith tarr judith tarr is the author of a number of historical and fantasy novels and stories her most recent novels include house of war and queen of the amazons as well as the epona sequence lady of horses white mares daughter and daughter of ur she was a world fantasy award nominee for lord of the twolands she lives near tucson arizona where she breeds and trains lipizzan horses of whom she says theyre white theyre magical they bond for life to a single human they dont think or act like horseswhen i was asked to write a story about valdemar of course i had to write about companions thats called writing what you know lord dashants forces had drawn off the battlefield marching backward in ordered retreat a ragged cheer ran down the line of what had only moments ago been a beleaguered army mathias the heraldmage from his place at the rightful heirs right hand found he could not share the armys celebration something smelled wrong in point of fact something stank his companion raised her head and fleered her upper lip in a strikingly horselike gesture she smelled it too although there was nothing earthly about it as far as his nose knew this was a battlefield like any other reeking of blood and loosed bowels rank fearsweat and the incongruous sweetness of crushed grass beside him veras own companion shook his heavy neck and snorted vera stroked him absently with a gauntleted hand the visor of her helmet was up her eyes narrowed studying the enemys retreat he was the bitterest of all enemies that a royal heir could have her own halfbrother who had killed their father the king and claimed the throne of valdemar dashant was a murderer and a traitor but one thing he had never been and that was a coward it was not like him to abandon a battle before he was well and resoundingly defeated its a feint she said hes laid a trap but i cant see neither could mathias and that was not reassuring at all mathias had the gift of seeing through any wall or veil and piercing any illusion his wards were intact his protection spells were undisturbed there was no magical threat anywhere nothing except that infernal stink he glanced to either side down along the ranks that were beginning to waver the commanders were doing nothing to stop them one or two had had the sense to send parties in pursuit of the enemy but the rest were acting as if the battle was over none of them paid any attention to vera at all even her personal guard her squires who adored her the messengers and pages who had stayed by her through exile and civil war had turned away from her as if they had forgotten her existence as ifthe spell was as strong as it was subtle mathias felt it creeping around the edges of his wards seeking out chinks and weaknesses it blurred his sight so that when he looked at vera she seemed to shimmer like a reflection in a pool but in his heart where she had been since the first day he saw her long ago when he was a callow boy newchosen and she a curlyheaded child she was as clear and strong a presence as ever he had never even asked if she loved him as he did her it made no difference she was the heir and would be queen he was her servanther herald and her mage he strengthened the wards giving her all that he was for her protection she was not a mage of any kind but she was a sensitive she felt some at least of what he did for her her hand reached across the small space between them and clasped his as warmly trusting as if they were both still children the earth boiled up with an army three four five times as large as the one that they had faced and they thought defeated it swarmed over the heirs weary forces its hordes of warriors were fresh and wellfed with unscarred weapons and bright new armor the spell that had concealed them was shredded and tattered but still fuddled the minds and hearts of veras army they had forgotten why they fought or whom they fought for swords dangled from slack hands spears struck without force arrows flew wide of the mark it was all mathias could do to hold off that mindblurring magic from himself while sustaining the wards about vera the guards were useless each of them was fighting for his own skin the enemy could see the heir the heart of her own forces blindness was clear to dashants troops they converged on her mathias was beyond desperation lytha his companion fought with every weapon and wile at her disposal he dropped his sword and bow and raised his hands the spell that rose up in him was a spell for the other side of hope it would kill him but it would break the spell on veras army and weaken and befuddle dashants horde and maybe just maybegive vera enough cover to run for safety there was no time to explain he had to hope against hope that both his companion and his queen would understand that their hearts were close enough to let them see the sacrifice he had madeand that vera at least would save herself he was not afraid fear was lost somewhere in the life that he was leaving the spell was whole inside him it was beautiful a structure as intricate as a snowflake and as deadly as the track of a viper in the sand it stirred and shimmered tugging at the edges of his control drawing power from the roots of his earthly self the horde was almost upon them vera held her sword in both hands raised above her head ready to fight to the last no grief no hesitation one more instant and the spell would be cast and his life and magic with it he let it go the world shattered all spells brokeevery one except those which guarded vera mathias body was gone and so was every enemy within a furlong of it veras forces reeled stumbling over the sudden dead he clung to the reality of them and most of all to vera but the world was whirling him away he looked down into her white shocked faceand if he had still had throat or tongue he would have cried aloud he knewhe understoodhe foresawso clear so terribly appallingly clear long waves sighed upon a shining shore the foam on their breasts was the color of moonlight and snow the sand on which they rolled was dust of jewels opal and moonstone lapis malachite chalcedony the sky was silver and the sun was gold fixed it in forever never shifting never changing somewhere in another heaven were moon and stars but not in this place here it was morning for all eternity luminous spirits walked in the jeweled sand or on grass the color of emeralds some wore the forms of men or women others chose the shapes of moonwhite horses blueeyed silverhooved mystical and magical they grazed on the eternal grass or ate the fruits of paradise or drank from springs that flowed supernally pure everywhere was a dream of peace the soul that had been mathias stood on the edge between the sea and the sand he still wore his human shape a tallish man in heralds whites broadshouldered with curling brown hair and green eyes more fit for laughter than for sorrow but they had not laughed since well before he died here in the land of laughter they knew no mirth at all a slender woman stood beside him her eyes were blue her hair was long and silverwhite drawn back in a straight and shining tail that swung to her haunches my dear she said you cant grieve here he kept his eyes fixed obstinately on the place where the horizon would have been if this had been an earthly isle why cant i grieve is there a law against it well she said no but then i will grieve he said but why she asked him your sacrifice ended the war your beloved is safe the traitors army is broken she has marched in triumph to the capital and taken her throne she is queenand by your doing you should be rejoicing yes he said dully i should dear one said the woman who in mortal life had been his companion is it that you cant be with her your two souls are bound you know that in the fullness of time you will both be reborn and be together again if i know the laws that constrain the gods in your next life you will have her and you will reap the reward of your sacrifice he shook his head no thats not what it is i know how the gods parcel out their favors itsi cant speak of it please by the gods dont make me try she was relentless she was a blessed spirit he reminded himself but she was not omniscient she was not a god or even a mage with a deathbed gift of prescience she had not seen what he had seen tell me she said tell me why you grieve but he would not after a moment or an age she went away her sadness stung him with guilt but he could not tell her the horror that he had seen they were all the blessed dead here they were all ended done with rewarded anything that they had left behind was left forever some would go back to the mortal world yes but never soon enough not within the lifetime of anyone they had known that was his grief and the core of his terror by the laws of the cycle of death and rebirth he had withdrawn from earthly cares he would return to them of that he had no doubt but the life he had given up was gone he could never get it back again yet what he had seen in the moment of dying the vision that he had had tormented him even in these blessed havens he spoke it aloud though only for his own ears to hear soft beneath the sighing of waves if i dont do somethingif i dont take some actionshe will never come back there will be nothing left of her her self her soulgone never again never he sank down in the sand sobbing like a child he did not even care that the blessed souls stared or that the more compassionate or the more curious gathered to wonder and whisper one of them came to stand over him it was not lytha this one he did not know it wore companions shape with some quality about it that made him want to bow low before it the blue eyes were mild the brush of its mind as soft as gentle as sleep little one it said what troubles you i cant tell you he said though the core of his resolve was crumbling fast the companion bent its beautiful head come to us it said in the hidden country the hiddenbut where but the great one was gone only then did mathias realize how very strange it had been it had been neither male nor female nor known any distress for its lack of gender he straightened slowly the semicircle of the curious drew back he looked from face to shining face where is the hidden country he asked them what did the great one mean no one knew or would admit to knowing only one of them came forward to say go inland follow the light she would not explain herself perhaps she could not it was as good advice as he was likely to get he would not have said that he had hope but his despair was a little lighter he was doing something he had a place to go a riddle to ponder maybe it was mere distraction or maybe it would show him the way to save veras souland with it the soul of valdemar if he had still been in mortal flesh he would have found this journey tedious if not particularly exhausting inland away from the sea was a sea of grass greener than any earthly meadow rolling monotonously into the luminous distance he began to think that he had been deceived that this was a punishment for bringing grief into the blessed land to be condemned to wander forever in the featureless green not a soul stirred there not single sentient thing living or blessed dead then he realized that without knowing it he had been following the light little by little as he went onward the sun was brighter the grass more vivid he was never blinded but he was inundated in light he came at last to a wall of living fire pure white without heat rising up into infinity standing there contemplating it he realized that it was not a barrier he walked toward it it took it to itself it was somewhat like passing a veil of fire and somewhat like ascending a mountain of living coals the dead knew no earthly weariness but certainly they knew pain it scoured away all that was impure in him and all that was of earthsave only those memories which he clung to with implacable persistence that was the price of passage he paid it as freely as he had paid with his life to save verabut in so doing he had doomed her soul with this the powers willing he would save her he pressed on it was more like a mountain and less like a veil the farther he traveled and little by little the pain faded in time it dwindled to nothing he trod stones underfoot following a path up a steep slope rising into a bank of luminous cloud there were trees impossible if this had been an earthly peak but all things were possible here these were slender and tall their leaves were deep green blossoms opened on the branches pure white enfolding a spark of gold the scent that drifted from those branches was ineffably sweet it tempted mathias to delay to slow to drift and dream in this hall of trees but he was armored in memory and armed with terror he climbed onward and ever onward the heart of the wood was a space of light the grass there was so dark a green as to be almost black the flowers in it were stars the companion was waiting for him as he approached it the circle widened immeasurably expanding into infinite space he stood in a field of stars beneath the orb of a sun the great one was not alone here there were others like him legions of them as numerous as the stars all revolved around the sun singing a song of pure praise mathias voice was a lone small dissonance can you help me save my world your world is safe the great one said he shook his head even you cant see before i died i saw dashant works a spell to win back what he lost that spell will destroy the queen and enslave every soul in valdemar but her soulher soul will be gone unless i do something unless i find some help some hope for her that is no longer your world the great one said there is nothing you can do to save it he clenched his fists there must be where is the quality of divine mercy where is the care the light takes for its children it is where it has always been said the great one all that is is meant yes child even this then why did you bring me here he cried why did you let me hope what use is there in any of you his outcry died into the silence of eternity the stars shone undimmed the suns light burned as bright as ever it was not mortal to know pity nor human to know sorrow it knew nothing but the glory of itself the great one said there is nothing that you can do that is not the truth said mathias almost spitting the words there are stories memories tales of powersavatars there is nothing you can do the great one repeated this is ordained you are forbidden if i am forbidden why was i allowed to see why except to torment me sometimes said the great one in extremity a mortal can see where no mortal eyes should ever see that vision was not meant for you yet it came to me he said i will save her i must even if it costs you your soul if it saves hers he said yes the great one bent its glimmering head the field of stars shrank to a field of grass and flowers under a silver sky mathias stood in it with a creature like a companion surrounded by blossoming trees you are forbidden the great one said but in its eyes was another word he held that stare for a long moment lost in an infinity of blue what will they do to you he asked if the great one shook its head infinitesimally peace is yonder it said on the shores of the havens but mathias was listening to what it did not say he looked around him and recognized this place this circle of trees this grass this spring that bubbled forth from the great ones feet just as it must have done in the morning of the world do not drink from this spring said the great one mortals who drink of it are doomed the hounds of heaven will hunt them and the powers will condemn their souls but you he said you children of heaven who drink of it what does it do what powers does it give you that is forbidden the great one said go seek peace forget this place even as it spoke it turned its back the spring had bubbled into a pool it seemed perfectly harmless a pool of clear water reflecting the sky mortal skyblue as a companions eye and mortal sun in it looking down on living earth the great ones tail switched another instant and it would return to its guardianship mathias bent quickly and cupped water in his hands it was cold as spring water should be it numbed his fingers he did not pause to marvel at so earthly a sensation in this unearthly place he lifted it to his lips and drank it was like liquid ice like living fire it was the wine of angels his mortal spirit was not made to imbibe such potency it rocked him with agony it tore him twisted him rent him asunder darkness took him even here in this land of perpetual light mathias lay winded on bruised grass but he thought grass did not bruise here the dead did not breathe he was nothe staggered up his body moved strangely his head was too heavy his neck his hands and feethe had no hands when he scrabbled at the grass long white legs responded and silver hooves his neck twisted about impossibly long white mane flew as he whirled white body spun when he cried out a shrill whinny pierced his ears his forefeet tangled he fell to his knees it hurt earth was hard he heaved himself erect through the whirl of confusion still he recognized this place he was in the companions grove he wore that alltoo familiar shape and it was not that of a newborn foal either he though mortal had drunk from the well of the powers it had done to him what it must do to the great ones the shining spirits it had given him companions form such a thing was forbidden to mortal soulimpossible he would have said he had defied the will of heaven he wore flesh again with full capacity of the body and full memory of the life that he had lived before and it was stillgods it must still be the time in which he had lived as he paused to will his gratitude toward the one who had shown him the way a shudder ran across his skin something was rising in the grove some force of wrath the hounds of heaven were coming to hunt him down he must run with all his magical strength and find her before they found him then it did not matter the hounds could rip him into nothingness he did not care but first he must save her soul his body knew how to run he had only to let it go there was glory in speed and joyhe had thought never to know joy again behind him the earth heaved and the spring boiled he heard faint but drawing nearer the baying of hounds he ran for veras life companions field was full of white almosthorses and their heralds in white and the usual scattering of attendants gawkers and hangerson they were all gaping at him he hardly needed to hear the word that ran even faster than he groveborn theres not been a groveborn since since before his human life began intentionally or otherwise they were gathering clotting blocking his way he darted around and through them and sometimes over them but said someone who sounded young his eyes are green that checked his stride and nearly sent him sprawling he got his legs under control again the road from the field was not so crowded the sight of a companion at full gallop parted the stream of passersby and left them murmuring in his wake she was not in the palace he had known it before he came there in his heart that was like a needle quivering toward the lodestone yet he had to go had to seehad to prove to himself that those halls though full of people were empty of her it was a long and desperate while before he found someone who could hear when he mindspoke his throat would not produce a human voice nor would his lips or tongue shape even the few words he needed to say where is she where is the queen the child in the servants smock blinked hard he was frightening her with his intensity he tried to control it a little but he did not succeed very well she was very young and he was desperate thank the powers she mustered her courage and said steadily enough shes gone out riding sir withwith the consort the one whos to be i mean after the wedding consort she blinked even harder yes sir lord terrell dont you knowyou arentare you new here sir newer than the morning he said with a sudden wry twist here get on my back show mewhere they went her eyes went wide i ride a companion for answer he folded his long legs and knelt pressing lightly against her so that she had to swing her leg over his back and cling to his mane he rose as smoothly as he could she squeaked a little in alarm but the fear was fading fast before incredulous delight her weight was negligible and she balanced well enough once he was upright she knew how to ride she guided him as if he had been a horseodd sensation to be on the receiving end of it his mind was racing down too many tracks at once he focused in on two the childs guidance and the news that she had given him vera and terrell if he could put aside the stab of pure green and completely unreasonable jealousy he could see it even force himself to approve of it terrell was not too young but not too old his family connections were impeccable and much more to the point mathias had known him to be an honorable man he was both warrior and mage and equally accomplished in both he had been loyal to vera during dashants war he had served her well he would make a more than adequate consort mathias young rider guided him out of the palace and into the city she held on tighter there tensing when people stared he soothed her as he could and thought calm at her her gratitude was like a warm hand slipping into his the crowds of the city made their own joyous mortal noise but he heard that other sound beneath the baying that would pursue him until he was caught and made to pay for what he had done he was tiring a little even the body of a groveborn companion was mortal and its strength was finite he slowed his pace a fraction he was almost through the city the gate was ahead and open country beyond it they cant be far said the child on his back they only left a little while ago he resisted the urge to quicken his stride the sun shone blandly down upon him the road was level underfoot until at his riders urging he turned to follow a narrower track this had been veras favorite way when she was younger it led up a long hillside to a stretch of wood where there was fine hunting in autumn and where in spring the ladies liked to go amaying it was a pleasant ride on a warm afternoon ending in a little lake beyond the wood where a rider could stop to rest and water her horse and swim if she were minded he left the child by the road with such blessing on her as he had to give and a word of warding that would bring her back safe to haven she did not want to be left behind there was no time to explain he bucked her off as gently as he could pausing to see that she was unharmed before he went on alone as he ran through the wood his nostrils twitched that scent beneath the scents of living greeneryhe knew it from another life in this body the senses were keener the scent was stronger it was cold like the breath of graves and all around it was woven the sicksweet stench of death dashant mathias could not hold himself in not now vera was ahead dismounted by the lake he could see her in his minds eye walking along the shore handinhand with a tall darkhaired young man her face had grown somber since mathias had died but it was as beautiful as ever lord terrell bent his head to hear what she said his smile was so warm his glance so tender that mathias need have no doubt of it this man loved this woman with all his heart behind them unseen and unnoticed the waters of the lake had begun to stir darkness was rising the spell was keyed to this place where her heart was it would set hooks in her soul and draw her down into itself and swallow her his lungs were burning his legs were beyond pain and still there was the last ascent to face and the steep twisting track down to the lake he would never come there in time the thing in the lake dashants conjuring would rise and devour her deep within he found a last surge of strength he sprang to the top of the ridge and skidded down the track to the lake its waters were heaving the dark thing was close to the surface the two on the shore were still oblivious lost in one another there should have been an escort mathias could detect no sign of them it was eerily like the battle in which he had died the same cloud of deception and the same utter abandonment this time vera was warded to his eyes it was like armor of light but even that would no be proof against what rose to take her dashant had awakened something very very old and very very black it loathed the light living flesh to it was abomination the wards warned hertoo damnably late she turned in her lovers arms her eyes went wide it was like a towering wave it was darkness absolute it reached for her she did not cowernot vera her only weapon was a dagger but she drew it and set herself between the darkness and her consort he was a fraction slower to understand but his wits were quick enough once he saw what fell upon them he summoned up a spell a bolt of light against the dark it guttered and went out like a candle in a whirlwind nearly taking terrell with it the darkness took no notice of him at all mathias whole heart and soul screamed at him to leap between his lady and the thing that would destroy her but it only had volition through the one who commanded it dashant was nearhe had to be power of this magnitude needed a mages fullest strength and focus there on the far side of the lake in a ruin from the older days legend had it that had been a sorcerers tower during the mage wars mathias in this incarnation knew that for truth dashant was drawing up the dregs of power that had gathered there feeding his own strength he had paid a high price for his ambition he was skeletally gaunt his face was twisted with scars one hand was a claw his own spellmongering had done it to him but in the darkness of his bartered soul he held vera to blame mathias had no magic to match his and next to no strength he had only the weight of his body driven at the speed of desperation he hurtled over the broken wall there were wards protections his flesh charred and crackled at the touch of them he ignored the pain ignored the barriers ignored the slow and excruciating dissolution of his mortal substance he fell on dashant bones snapped like dry sticks his own the sorcerersit did not matter dashant screamed mathias had no breath left for such a thing silver hooves battered the writhing body his nostrils filled with the iron scent of blood on the edge of awareness he knew that the darkness had collapsed upon itself terrell drove it back with a barrage of firespells this world would believe that terrell had saved his queen from dashants last assault that was fitting she would never know who had broken the laws of heaven for herwould never suffer that guilt mathias knees buckled he was dying again he made certain that when he fell he crushed the sorcerers remains beneath him the last of his sight saw the blue of the mortal sky and the brightness of the sun and a pack of pale gleaming shapes drawing in the baying of hounds was painfully loud they were almost upon him he let go the world whirled away sky and sun and companions all of iteven the hounds of heaven he knelt on grass that never faded under a sun that never set his form was a mans again he was rather surprised to feel no pain no broken bones no bruises not that it would have mattered if he had his heart was as light as air the grief was gone from it he knew at last the peace of this blessed country he knew also that he had no right to any such thing three judges stood over him they seemed to be companions white horseshapes supernally beautiful their eyes were not blue but dark like the night full of stars their hounds lay at their feet panting like mortal dogs none seemed to bear him any malice for outrunning them he was caught after all he had come to face his judgment whatever you do to me he said to his judges let it be enough no one else should pay for what ive done no said the judge in the center who was perhaps the chief of them its eyes flickered toward one who stood not far from mathias the great one now much shrunken and its light greatly dimmed it could have been a mortal horse standing with head low ears slack as if exhausted his heart went out to it he rounded on the judges if that one has any guilt let it be on my head let me pay for whatever sins it has committed you would pay a doubled and trebled price the judge asked him even if that price should be the dissolution of your very self even so mathias said without hesitation the judge stood motionless there was no breath here and no heartbeat to mark the passage of time only the stillness of eternity mathias existed in it in perfect peace without fear without apprehension whatever sentence was laid on him he would accept it he had done what he was set in the world to do the rest as the singers sang was silence after a moment or an eon the judge spoke all things are possible under the eyes of heaven what you did you were permitted to do by the one who is above the gods and you did it for love of another that mitigates your sentence yet sentence there must be for you broke the laws that divide mortal from immortal and did violence to the barriers between life and death mathias bowed his head that is true he murmured you did it knowingly said the judge and in full knowledge of the consequences therefore we grant you justice since the world of the flesh is so dear to you we condemn you to return and to live life after life in human form each time anew each time without memory of the life beforesave only once in each life in utmost extremity when you will know what you are and why you have come into that life and because you would have surrendered your very soul for the queen and the kingdom of valdemar we charge you to serve it forever in life after life until with the passing of time you shall have atoned for your transgression mathias sank down under the weight of that sentence on his face in the undying grass and yet his heart was incorrigibly light to live for herto live for valdemar he dared to speak though it might damn him even further and she will i stand beside her in life after life in every life said the judge you two shall be bound you shall never have her as mate or consort nor shall your love ever be requited but we will be together mathias said that is enough the judge was silent mathias did not care what any creature or power might think it truly was enough his soul knew it deep within itself where joy was rising like a lark in the morning go said that dreadful and merciful judge live out your sentence man of valdemar serve it forever as you served it in these lives of yours both that to which you were entitled and that which you stole in her name mathias rose he kept his head bowed in respect but he could not keep the smile from his lips maybe the judge saw it if that was so it said nothingand that was divine mercy already mathias felt the pull of the living world it drew him down out of the land of peace it enfolded him in a scrap of flesh the barest beginnings of a human being memory was too expansive a thing for this mote in eternity all that was left was a spark of joy it would grow as he grew and fill him always however dark the world about him the queen of valdemar bent over the cradle in which her son lay burbling softly to himself she smiledshe could not help it there was something so light about him so irresistibly joyous look she said to her consort his eyes are changing color already i think theyll be green lord terrell took her hand and kissed it have you decided yet what youll call him she did not answer at once even as besotted with new motherhood as she was she knew that this was an ordinary enough baby he ate slept and filled his diaper as monotonously as any other of his kind and yet sometimes she could have sworn that someone she knew and had loved before was watching her out of those blurred infant eyes she held her finger in front of them his hand reached up to clasp it yes those eyes would be green mathias she said his name is mathias terrell shot her an odd look but he did not object not for the first time vera was glad of her choice of consort she stood with him looking down at this new mathias and knew in her heart that she had chosen the name well and maybewho knew maybe it was her dearest friend come back again to be heir and eventual king of valdemar that was justice she thought and mercy too it seemed that he agreed the nurses all said that he was much too young to smile but a smile that certainly was curving his lips as he slid contentedly into sleep brock by tanya huff tanya huff lives and writes in rural ontario with her partner six cats and a chihuahua who refuses to acknowledge her existence her latest book out for daw in may of was the third in the keeper chronicles called long hot summoning and shes currently working on the first of three books spinning the character tony off from her blood series daw spring in her spare time she gardens and complains about the weather ids just a code trying not to smile at the same protest hed heard for the last two days jors set the empty mug on a small table healer lorrin says its more isabel she says youre spending the next two days in bed the older herald tried to snort but her nose had filled past the point it was possible and she had to settle for an avalanche of coughing instead she cud heal me she muttered when she could finally breathe again she seems to think that a couple of days in bed and a couple of hundred cups of tea will heal you just fine gibbing children their greens that was half a protest at best and as jors watched isabels eyes closed the lines exhaustion had etched around them beginning to ease leaning forward he blew out the lamp then quietly slipped from the room oh shes sick the healer assured him exasperation edging her voice what could have possessed her to ride courier at her age at this time of the year yes the package and information she brought from the healers collegium will save lives this winter but surely there had to have been younger heralds around to deliver it jors opened his mouth to answer lorrin gave him no chance if she hadnt run into your riding sector she might not have made it this far she needs rest and im keeping her in bed until i think shes had enough of it jors didnt argue he wouldnt have minded an actual conversationlorrin was young and prettybut unfortunately she seemed too determined to run this new house of healing the way she felt a house of healing should be run to waste time in dalliance with the healthy have you good as new you see good as new soft and clean jors stopped just inside the stable door and stared in astonishment at the young man grooming his companion the stubby fingers that held the brush the bulky body the round face angled eyes and full mouth told the herald that this unexpected groom was one of those the country people called moonlings he wore patched homespun the pants too large the shirt too small both washed out to a grimy gray his boots had seen at least one other pair of feet hed already groomed the chirras and isabels companion calidathe sleeping mare all but glowed in the dim stable light gervis his name is brock the stallions mental voice sounded sleepy and sated can wetake him with us no and how do you know what his name is he talks to us and he knows exactlyoh yeswhere to rub companions were not in the habit of allowing themselves to be groomed by other than heralds hands jors found it hard to believe that theyd not only allowed brocks ministrations but were actually reveling in them he stepped forward and at the sound of his footfall brock turned his face broke into a broad smile radiating welcome arms spread he rushed at the herald and wrapped him in a tight hug staring up at jors their faces barely inches apart he joyfully repeated brother herald over and over while a large gray dog leaped around them barking gervis the dogs name is rock hes harmless glad to hear that brocki cant breathe sorry sorry releasing him so quickly jors stumbled and had to grab the edge of a hay rack brock shuffled back still smiling sorry i brushed one shortfingered hand gestured back at the companions good as new soft and clean you did a very good job jors stepped around the dog now lying panting on the floor and ran his fingers down gervis side there wasnt a bit of straw a speck of dust a hair out of place on either companion better than very good gervis sighed jors smiled and repeated the compliment did you say thank you you fuzzyhedonist in answer the companion stretched out his neck and gently nuzzled brocks cheek receiving a loud smacking kiss in return okay we go now brock bent and picked a ragged gray sweater out of the straw and wrestled it over his head we go now he repeated placing both hands in the small of jors back and pushing him toward the stable door or we come late and mister mayor is mad and yells late for the petitions gervis mental voice sounded more than a little amused and jors remembered hed intended to merely look in on the companions on his way to the town hall heading out into the square he realized brock was trotting to keep up and he shortened his stride does the mayor yell a lot yes a lot do you know why brock sighed deeply one hand dropping to fondle the ears of the dog walking beside him mister mayor wears the town he said very seriously after a moment the town swings heavy heavy okay that made no sense maybe we should try something less complex is rock your dog hes my friend they were hurting him iwait uncertain of just who had been told to wait jors watched brock and the dog run across to the town well where a pair of women argued over whod draw their water first ignored in the midst of the argument brock began to draw water for them he had no trouble with the winch but while pouring from bucket to bucket he splashed the older womans skirt suddenly united they turned on him by the time jors arrived brock had filled another bucket in spite of the shoutingalthough his shoulders were hunched forward and he didnt look happy the older woman saw him first shoved the other and the shouting stopped ladies herald they said in ragged unison let me give you a hand with that brock you bring the water up and ill pour pouring is hard brock warned herald you dont have to one of the women protested we never asked this when jors turned a bland stare in her direction she reconsidered her next word boy to help i know his tone cut off any further protests and neither woman said anything until all the buckets had been filled then they thanked him far more than the work hed done required hed turned to go when at the edge of his vision he saw one woman lean forward and pinch brock on the arm hissing now thats a real herald herald jors across the square the mayor stood on the steps of the town hall chain of office glinting in the pale autumn sunlight both hands urging him to hurry well hell just have towait lips pressed into a thin line jors turned back toward the well had his elbow firmly grabbed and found himself facing the mayor again mister mayor is yelling brock explained moving jors across the square let him i saw what happened back there i saw that woman pinch you yes he turned a satisfied smile toward jors never lessening their forward motion i made them stop fighting heralds do that yes they do theyd almost reached the hall and jors had a strong suspicion that digging his heels in would have had no effect on their forward motion youre stronger than you look have to be ill bet jors thought as he caught sight of the mayors expression brock get your filthy hands off that herald hands are clean i dont care he doesnt need you hanging around him i dont mind jors swept through the door brock caught up in his wake both moving too quickly for the mayor to do anything but fall in behind heralds work together brock announced proudly he clapped his hands as heads began to turn be in a good line now heralds are here heralds a male voice jeered from the crowd i see only one herald moonling heralds brock repeated throwing his arms around jors waist in another hug me and him o h havens trouble heartbrother i just realized something that should have been obviousbrock believes hes aherald so youd rather he believed he was a pickpocket thats not the point but he couldnt let the townspeople chase brock from the hall as they clearly wanted to do and brock wouldnt leave because it was time for the heralds to hear petitions so jors ended up sitting him at the table and hoping for the best he realized his mistake early on brock had a loudly expressed opinion on everything up to and including calling one of the petitioners a big fat liarwhich turned out to be true on all points unfortunately short of having him physically carried out of the hall jors could think of no way to get him to leave have him check on isabel how youre worried youre projecting and im only across the square if he wants to bewith a herald send him to check on isabel shes sick and she needs company thats a terrific idea gervis mental voice sounded distinctly smug i know it worked jors only wished the companion had thought of it sooner a heralds office protected him or her from the repercussions of a judgmentno matter how disgruntled the losing petitioner might be few would risk the grave penalties attached to attacking a herald brock didnt have that protection good thing hes safely tucked away with isabel no brocks not here healer lorrin continued rolling strips of soft linen he left at sunset for the tavern the tavern hes there every evening he fills their wood box and they feed himhim and rock he works there lorrin nodded there and the blacksmiths whenever theres a nervy horse in to be shoedanimals trust him i tried to have him deliver teas to patients but if hes carrying something theres always troublemakers who try to take it from him im surprised jors rubbed his elbow at the memory hes quite strong is he she set the finished roll with the others and picked up a new strip of cloth hes bullied all the time but ive never seen him defend himself did you know that poorer mothers have him watch their infants if they have to leave them ill tell you something herald when i came here a year ago i was amazed to discover this town has almost none of those horrible accidents that happen when a baby just starting to creep is left alone and burns to death or drownsthats because of brock where does he sleep this far north the nights were already cold in various stables when the weathers good by someones hearth when it isnt has he no family his parents were old when he was born old and poor they died about three yeas ago and left him nothing why doesnt someone take him in he doesnt want to be taken the healer snapped hes not a stray cat and for all he can be childlike hes not a child hes a grown man probably not much younger than you and he has the same right as you do to choose his life but she sighed and her tone softened there are those who try to make sure he doesnt suffer for those choices but thats all anyone has a right to do besides one corner of her mouth quirked up he tells me that heralds never stay in one place so no one thinks they like some people more than others simpler language but pretty much the official reason jors allowed how long has he believed himself to be a herald as long as ive been here im surprised you havent heard about him from other heralds you cant be the first hes latched on to he wasnt in the reports i read and i about to say he doubted brock would come up in casual conversation between heralds he frowned at a distinct feeling of unease i should go now theres no need to go to the waystation tonight ive plenty of room her smile edged toward invitation i doubt anyone will accuse you of favoritism if you stay here no thank you i need to the feeling was growing stronger um go he doubted shed be smiling that way at him again but personal problems were unimportant next to his growing certainty that something was wrong taking the steps two at a time he hit the ground floor running and headed for the stables gervis we can feel it too calida says its close it wasnt in the stables or the corral but when jors opened the small door a pair of huddled figures tumbled inside brock lifted a teardrenched face up from matted gray fur and wailed heralds dont cry says who jors demanded dropping to one knee people when i cry people are wrong im a herald and i cry he stretched out a hand keeping half his attention on the big dog who watched him warily heralds whites meant nothing to rock and he didnt lower his hackles until gervis whickered a warning of his own what happened did someone hurt you heralds dont tattle his various tormentors had probably been telling him that for years if someone does something bad we do no yes if we cant make it right on our own we tell someone who can bad things should never be hidden it makes them worse brock drew in a long shuddering breath and slowly held out his arm below the ragged cuff of his sweater was a dark bruise where a large hand had gripped his wrist is that all rock came the man ran away who was it a bad man no argument there do you know his name a bad man brock repeated wiping his nose against the dogs shoulder you catch him and ill kick him the companions mental voice was a near growl calida says shell help its a bad bruise but it is just a bruise healer lorrin wrapped it in an herb pack and she says hell be fine he wont stay says hes not sick enough but i cant just let him wander off into the night coors you cand and i cant take him to the waystation and i cant stay with him because that would be seen as losing impartiality so do you mind if he spends the night with calida isabel managed a truncated snort fine wid me bud youd bezd ask her leading gervis and the chirras out of the stable jors turned for one last look at brock curled up against calidas side the elderly mare had been pleased to have the company and had positioned herself in such a way that brock could pillow his head against her flank rock had snuggled up on the young mans other side and although his face was still blotchy jors had never seen anyone look so completely at peace why do you two care about him so much he asked as he mounted he believes he is a herald yes but and he acts accordingly the next day during petitions the mayor tripped over rock sprawled by the table jerking his chain of office down into place he snarled that dog is vicious and ought to be destroyed jors pushed brock back into his chair who says this dog is vicious the mayors lip curled i heard he attacked a man last night i heard that too herald called out one of the waiting petitioners brock show everyone your arm the bruises were dark and ugly against the pale skin the man rock attacked did that and would have done more had the dog not come to his masters defense this dog is no more vicious than i am weve only your word on that herald you cant truthspell a dog no but i can truthspell the man who made the accusation if hes willing to come forward no one was surprised when he didnt mid afternoon as jors was returning to the hall after a privy break the town clerk fell into step beside him and apologized for the mayors earlier behavior its just he feels responsible for the whole town and it weighs on him and makes him shorttempered believe me herald hes a whole different man when he can take that chain off mister mayor wears the town the town swings heavy heavy brocks explanation suddenly made perfect sense it had been arranged that brock would spend another night with calida companions need heralds lady herald is sick i am not sick i am here he threw his arms around jors i see you tomorrow brother herald no not tomorrow brock tomorrow im going to see the tanners tanning was a smelly business tanners set up their pits downwind of towns far enough away they could work without complaint but not so far they couldnt get skins or find buyers for their hides these particular tanners had chosen distance over convenience and had settled nearly a full days travel away the townspeople hed spoken to about them had made it quite clear that the animosity was mutual no one went near the place unless they had to ill stay overnight then go back to the waystation the next day the day after that ill be back in town thats why i brought my chirras in today so he wont be left alone at the station no its okay gervis travels very fast i wont be gone long no brock released him stepping back just far enough to meet jors eyes dont go pulling the hair back off his face with one hand he grabbed the heralds wrist with the other see an old scar ran diagonally from the edge of a thick eyebrow up into his hairline the tanners did that i bumped mean ladys cart dont go his eyes welled over mean lady is there jors pulled free of brocks grip and squeezed his shoulder ill be fine really the mean lady wont do anything to me the sort of people whod strike a frightened moonling were unlikely to be the sort whod strike a healthy young man in heralds whites but i have to go and check on them they havent been into town for a long time and its almost winter not alone dont worry ill have gervis he gave the trembling shoulder another squeeze then swung himself up into the saddle you stay with calida and ill see you in two days he supposed hed been half expecting it when jors came out of the waystation early the next morning there sat brockwhich was the half he supposed hed been expectingon calidawhich was a total surprise it wasnt often a companion would choose to bear anyone but her chosenand those exceptions were almost always heralds good morning brother herald actual heralds brock what are you doing here the young mans crestfallen expression insisted on better manners jors rubbed a hand over his face and sighed good morning brock the smile returned its early yes it is what are you doing here so early i go with you to tanners no you dont yes i go with you no yes jors hated to do it but what about the mean lady the smile faltered as brock sucked in his lower lip you dont want to see the mean lady dont want you to see mean lady alone he took a deep breath and squared his shoulders i go with you thats very brave of you and he meant that courage was only courage in the face of fear but even though i know you mean well you cant just take a companion brocks eyes widened indignantly didnt take calida says if she hadnt wanted him to ride her he wouldnt be here gervis scratched his cheek on a post and added thoughtfully hes very bad at it at what riding no doubt what does isabel say about this herald isabel trusts her companion thats not very helpful it should be one more try brock by taking her companion youve left herald isabel alone no he leaned carefully forward in the saddle and stroked calidas neck left rock jors reached for calidas bridle but the companion tossed her head moving it away from his hand calida you have to take him back the mare gave him a flat uncompromising stare she says make me gervis translated helpfully yeah i got that what do you think i should do help him down you think this is funny dont you jors demanded doing as the companion suggested i think this is inevitable chosen you might as well make the best of it even with jors help brock stumbled as he hit the ground fell rolled and bounced up declaring im okay now get ready gervis shoved at jors bare shoulder well be moving slowly andcalida says its going to rain and wont that make this a perfect day no she says its going to rain hard and i dont like to get wet i want to be therebefore it rains that began to look more and more unlikely as the morning passed and the clouds grew darker brock managed to stay in the saddle at a fast walk and calida refused to go faster once or twice jors was positive he was going to fall off but at the last instant hed shift weight and somehow stay mounted his balance is bad but calidas helping why is calida doing this one ear flicked back so he wont fall off no i mean why is calida allowing any of this why is she allowing brock to rideher why is she allowinginsistinghe come along today she has her reasons jors sighed he knew that tone and youre not going to tell me what those reasonsare are you hes very happy i can see that happy was an understatement for all he held the pommel in a death grip brock looked ecstatic this is really not helping his delusion that hes a herald jors realized something would have to be done about that and since the two of them were spending what was likely to be a full day traveling together now would be the time to do it maybe that was why calida had brought him thered be no point in bluntly saying brock youre not a herald the townspeople said that all the time shaded in every possible emotion from amusement to rage and it had no effect brock do you know what makes a person a herald heralds help people heralds can cry heralds tell when bad things happen he beamed proudly i remember the new things yes all those things make a herald but im a good herald but theres other things brock twisted in the saddle to look at him and calida adjusted her gait to prevent a fall heralds wear shiny white yes he looked down at his gray sweater then looked back at jors smiling broadly clothes are on the outside and a herald is on the inside i get it a sapphire eye rolled back at him distinctly amused just trying to help brock all those things are part of being a herald but the most important part is being chosen by a companion you dont have to be a herald to be a really good person but you do have to be chosen do you understand brock nodded companions have heralds you dont have a companion yes he bounced indignantly lost a stirrup and nearly went off have calida he continued when he was secure in the saddle again but shes herald isabels companion herald isabel is letting you ride her no calida is letting hes got you there jors sighed riding a companion isnt the point brock youre not calidas herald not her herald brock agreed his smile lighting up his whole face a herald between the less than successful conversation and the glowering sky jors had picked up a pounding headache they rode without speaking for a while brock humming tunelessly to himself finally more to put an end to the humming than for any real desire to know jors turned in the saddle and said so you were going to tell me how you saved rock kids were hurting him brocks placid expression turned fierce at the memory i made them stop although he wouldnt defend himself he seemed quite capable of defending the helpless he was hungry i counted his bones one two three four where did he come from jors interrupted unsure of how high the other man could count and not really wanting to find out dont know now he is my friend the broad brow furrowed as he searched for words some mean people arent mean now because he is my friend that was hardly surprising rock was a big dog probably a hunting dog of some kind whod gotten separated from his pack and managed to finally find his way back to people why did you call him rock so when kids are mean it doesnt matter i dont understand brock stared down between calidas ears and chanted brock brock dumb as a rock then he grinned and turned just far enough in the saddle to meet jors gaze rock isnt dumb i fooled them he looked so proud jors found himself grinning in return yes you did that was very smart i am a smart herald it was a good thing he didnt need affirmation because jors had no idea of what to say and now he sighed quietly as large drops of cold water began splashing against his leathers its raining i know im getting wet so am i im bigger theres more of me so im more wet in a very short time all four of them were so drenched there was little point in comparisons fortunately as they crested a rise in the trail the tanners holding came into sight on the other side of a small valley neither companion needed urging toward the river running through the valley center although they both stopped well back from the bank the water was brown and running fast the log bridge nearly awash what do you think is it safe gervis stepped cautiously out onto the edge of the logs if we move quickly but calida hesitated what is it calida says the rivers already undermining the bridge supports that the bridge isgoing to wash away tell her that if it does better were all on the side with shelter im half drowned andhalf frozen and brocks got to be colder still shes got to get him out of this weather eyes wide the mare stepped up beside gervis who took her arrival as his cue to leap forward one stride two three as jors watched anxiously from the other shore calida slowly followed placing each hoof with care wood screamed a protest as the bridge supports caved the huge logs dipped and skewed out from the bank dragged by the river calida halfreared as her front hooves scrambled for purchase in the mud brock bounced over the cantle and disappeared no jors threw himself to the ground stumbling to the companions side he grabbed the mares saddle and heaved step by step as she managed to work her way forward he worked his way back until to his amazement he saw a very muddy brock holding on with both hands to calidas tail his feet in the river a heartbeat later with solid ground beneath all four of them he dropped to his knees and gathered brock up into his arms are you all right he looked more surprised then frightened and returned the hug with wet enthusiasm i fell i know the bridge broke brock twisted around to look and clutched at jors arm im sorry its okay it wasnt your fault his heart slamming painfully against his ribs jors grabbed a stirrup and hauled himself onto his feet come on were almost there the tanners holding looked deserted as they stumbled up to the buildings jors called out a greeting but the wind and rain whipped the words out of his mouth brock grabbed his arm smoke he said pointing to the thin gay line rising reluctantly from a chimney im cold me too all thoughts turned to a warm fire as they made their way over to the building the companions crowding in close under the wide eaves well be right back as soon as we find someone hurry chosen gervis sounded completely miserable covered in mud almost to his withers his mane hanging in a tangled sodden mass he looked very little like the gleaming creature whod left the waystation that morning calida if anything looked worse jors considered leaving brock with the companions but the other mans breathing sounded unnaturally hoarse so he beckoned him forward as he tried the door the sooner he got him inside the better the door opened easily it hadnt even been latched hello stepping inside wasnt so much a step into warmth as a step into a space less cold it looked like theyd found the familys main living quarters although the room was so dim it was difficult to tell for sure the only light came from a small fire smoldering on the fieldstone hearth and a tallow lamp on the floor close beside a cradle no brock charged across the room trailing a small river in his wake no fire beside baby remembering what lorrin had told him about brock and babies jors held his position by the door the younger of two what he knew about babies could be inscribed on the head of a pin with room left over for the lyrics to kerowyns ride squatting brock picked up the lamp no fire beside baby he repeated began to rise and paused baby leaning forward he peered into the cradle is it all right the lamp and the fire together threw barely enough light for jors to see brock he couldnt see the baby at all setting the lamp down again brock stretched both hands into the cradle when he stood and turned he was holding a limp infant across both palms his broad features twisted in sorrow baby is dead jors jors spun around as the door slammed open and five people surged into the room they froze for an instant then the man in front howled out a wordless challenge and charged bending jors captured his attackers momentum then he straightened throwing the other man to the floor hard enough to knock him breathless the immediate threat removed he faced the remaining two men and two women i am herald jors who is in charge here i am the older woman snarled the hate in her eyes nearly drove jors back a step he didnt need brocks whispered mean lady to know who she was it took an effort but he kept his voice calm and understanding as he said the child was dead when we arrived dory came to say the babe was sick not dead she spat as the younger woman ran silently forward and snatched the body from brocks hands the moonling killed him he did not youre here and hes there she sneered you cant see what he did spreading his hands he added a mild warning to his tone and you werent even in the building i understand this is a shock you understand nothing herald she placed a hand on the backs of the two remaining men and shoved have the guts to support your brother they sprang forward looking like nothing so much as a pair of whipped dogs jors he ducked an awkward blow outside brock now if anything happened to him the companions would get brock to safety theres two of you and one of him you idiots dont let him protect the halfwit chosen its all right fortunately neither man was much of a fighter jors could have ended it quickly but as theyd just suffered a sudden terrible loss and werent thinking clearly he didnt want to do any serious damage after a moment he realized that had it not been for the old woman goading them on neither would have been fighting maybe i should have gervis deal with hed forgotten the first brother the piece of firewood caught him on the side of the head as he started to fall he felt unfriendly hands grab his body no then the hands were ripped away and he hit the floor two bodies hit the floor after him closely followed by the third never hit a herald get up you cowards thats a moonlingnot a real man but ma he killed my grandson hers jors thought muzzily not grief anger anger at the loss of a possession you never loved him apparently the childs mother agreed you always complained about him you said if he didnt stop crying you were going to strangle him if anyone killed him dont you raise your voice to me you cow if you were a better enough the doors slammed open again hooves clattering against the floor boards the companions moved to flank brock from jors position on the floor it looked as if there were significantly more than a mere eight muddy white legs dont lie there with your idiot mouths open theyre just horses theyre not just horses you stupid old woman gervis im here heartbrother jors felt better about his chance of recovery gervis was angry but not frantic a baby is dead is time for crying not fighting a herald is hurt you hurt a herald is that brock standing up to the mean lady it is good for him you will cry and you will make the herald better i will not no mistaking that hatefilled voice then i will nor the voice of the childs mother for the first time brock sounded confused you will cry no i will help the herald out of spite you need help heartbrother your head is bleeding spiteful help is still help jors got one arm under him and tried to rise if you say chosen his companions cry went with him into darkness jors woke to the familiar and comforting smell of a stable for a moment he thought hed dozed off on foalwatch then he moved and the pain in his head brought everything back gervis im here a soft nose nuzzled his cheek just open your eyes even moving his eyelids hurt but he forced them up fortunately the stable was dark the brightest things in it the two companions he could just barely make out brock tucked up against calidas side wrapped in a blanket and nearly buried in straw how long from almost dark to just after moonrise long enough i was starting to worry he stretched up a hand and stroked the side of gervis face sorry the young female made tea for your head theres a closed pot buried in the strawby your side the tea was still warm and tasted awful but gervis made him drink the whole thing itake it were in the stable because you and calida wouldnt leave me the old woman said the young woman could do as she pleased but not in herhouse i do not want you to be in her house the obvious distaste in the young stallions mental voice was hardly surprising even on short acquaintance the old woman was as nasty a piece of work as jors ever wanted to get close to brock told two of the youngmales to carry you here he just told them what to do and they did it they are used to being told what to do good point jors acknowledged and gervis continued i think they were frightened when they realized they hadstruck down a herald they knew i was a herald knowing and realizing are often different had the blow struck by the childs fatherbeen any lower they would have killed you and that frightened them too they werethankful brock took charge he saw you were tended to he was assured you would livewithout damage he groomed us both and then he cried himself to sleep poor guy good thing he was there if he hadnt been i wouldnt have put it past themean lady to have finished the job and buried both our bodies the circle would know wed still be dead is this why calida insisted on bringing him she has told her chosen we need no assistance and convinced her not to ride tothe rescue the herald isabel agreed but only because she felt the townspeople would laythe blame on brock thats ridiculous gervis sighed blowing sweet hayscented breath over jors face there is alreadymuch talk against him taking a companion all of which he needed to know but didnt answer his question about to ask it again he stopped short calida can reach isabel from here i couldnt reach you from here nor i you he sounded so put out by it jors couldnt prevent a smile never mind heartbrother calida and her chosen have been together for many years when weve been together forthat long ill hear you if im in sorrows and youre in sensholding id rather we were never that far apart jors wrapped one hand in gervis silken mane me either sleep now chosen it will be morning soon enough when jors opened his eyes again weak autumn sunlight filtered into the stable an attempt to rise brought gervis in through the open door he pulled himself to his feet with a handful of mane and throwing an arm over his companions back managed to get to where he could relieve himself the old woman made them bury the child this morning theyre only a days ride from town they cant wait for a priest the bridge is gone the priest cannot come he pawed the ground with a front hoof and added i dont think the old woman would send for a priest even if he could come do you know where they are yes jors took a deep breath and holding it managed to swing himself up on gervis bare back lets go then the tanners had a graveyard in a small clearing cupped by the surrounding oak forest when jors arrived the three men had just finished filling in the tiny hole as jors stopped half hidden by a large sumach brock wiped the tears from his face on calidas mane and stepped up to the grave there is no priest i will say goodbye to the baby im not listening to a halfwit say anything the old woman snarled she turned on one heel and started down the hill i only came to see the job was done right enric kern simen back to work theres hides to be sammied two of the three moved to her side the third looked toward the young woman and hesitated he was my son ma he was my son ma she threw it mockingly over her shoulder look around you simen ive buried a son two daughters and a husband besides and it dont make hides tan themselves stay and listen to the halfwit if you want dory she lifted stony eyes to simens face better do as your ma says she sneered cause you always do as your ma says scarred hands curled into fists but they stayed at his side fine ill go i dont care fine but when he turned brock was in his way jors tensed to urge gervis forward but at the last instant for no clear reason he changed his mind stay and say goodbye a heavy shove rocked him in place but didnt move him stay and then gently say goodbye to baby simen stared down into brocks face then wordlessly turned back to the grave brock returned to his place and rubbed his nose on his sleeve sometimes he said babies die mamas and papas love them and hug them and kiss them and feed them and they die nobody did anything bad everyone is sorry the baby wasnt bad babies are good goodbye baby his name simen said so quietly jors almost missed it was tamas brock nodded solemnly goodbye tamas everyone is sorry he lifted his head and stared at tamas parents standing hunchshouldered carefully apart now you cry dory shook her head crying is for the weak you have tears brock tapped his own chest in here tears not cried go bad bad tears make you hurt you heard aysa she buried a son and two daughters she never cried she is the mean lady brock said sadly you cant be the mean lady he opened his arms and before dory could move wrapped her in one of his allencompassing hugs jors knew from experience that when brock hugged he held nothing back it was a new experience for dory she blinked twice drew in a long shuddering breath then clutched at his tattered sweater and began to sob after a moment brock reached out one hand grabbed simen and pulled him into the embrace cry now he commanded i simen shook his head and tried to pull away brock pulled him closer pushing dory into his arms and wrapping himself around them both simen stiffened then made a sound very like his son might have made and gave himself over to grief all three of them sank to their knees these people need help gervis shifted his head it seems theyre getting it with the funeral over jors pulled himself into something resembling official shape and sought out aysa your son attacked a herald his son just died he was mad with grief you goaded his brothers to stand by him she sneered triumphantly i never told no one to hit you and now im givin you and that halfwit food and shelter you cant ask for more herald given that he and brock were trapped on her side of the river he supposed hed better not about the bridge without the bridge there was no way back the river wasnt particularly wide but the water ran deep and fast you come out here to stick your nose in on us then youre stuck out here till we head in to town and we aint headin nowheres until them hides is done we wasted time enough with dory having that baby you want to leave before that then you and the halfwit can rebuild the bridge yourself thats fair i cant expect you to drop everything and assist me his next words wiped the triumphant sneer from her face ill have them send a crew out from town you cant get word to town he smiled hoping he looked a lot more confident of the conversations outcome than he felt theres a herald there and i already have by this time tomorrow therell be a dozen people in the valley liar heralds cant lie ma shut up aysa half turned and kern winced away as though he expected to be hit lip curled she turned back to jors i dont want a dozen people in the valley and it dont take a dozen people anyway and the water wont be down enough tomorrow then ill have them come when the water goes down you wont have no one come my boysll rebuild then the townspeople can help my boys dont need help they aint got brains for much but they can do that you let them know in town im hostin you and the halfwit till then it was a grudgingly offered truce but hed take it jors wasnt surprised that aysad refused help the last thing shed want would be her sons exposed to more people to people whod make them realize they were entitled to be treated with kindness over the next few days while they waited for the water to recede she proved that by keeping him by her side keeping him from interacting with anyone else at the holding brock she considered no threat which was a mistake because brock treated everyone with kindness you call that supple i could do better chewin it how could you be doin this all your life and still be no damned good youre pathetic enric and kern leaped back as she threw the piece of finished leather down at their feet pathetic she repeated and stomped away mean lady calls me names too brock sighed coming out from behind the fleshing beam and picking up the hide enric ripped it out of his hands we aint halfwits mean lady calls me halfwit not you you are a halfwit are you pathetic kern jerked forward face flushed you callin us pathetic no it hurts when people call names brock looked from one to the other doesnt it hurt if your halfwit falls in a liming pit aysa snarled as jors caught up my boysll stand there and laugh you taught them that im all they got theyre terrified of you good dory isnt you think one of my boys is stupid enough to pick up a weakling aysa nodded toward the garden where dory heaped cabbage into a basket but she does what i say like the rest if she doesnt like it she can leave any time while they watched dory lifted the basket gave a little cry and let it fall aysa snorted course that baby left her stupidly weak jors took a step toward the garden but stopped as simen came out of the chicken house and hurried across to his wife simen you get back to work you lazy pig his mothers voice froze him in his tracks then he shook himself and began retrieving the spilled cabbages simen he ignored her this is your fault herald turning a womans family against her muttering under her breath she strode toward them dory looked up saw her coming and stood hands on hips you think you can face me down girl simen get up he stood now get back to work he took a step forward and put his hands on dorys shoulders when im finished here ma aysas mouth worked for a moment but no sound emerged finally she spun on one heel and stomped away the corner of simens mouth curled youd best help here herald i wouldnt follow her right now the river was low enough the next day the bridge took only a day longer to rebuild and for the most part involved fitting the original pieces back into place jors stared the completed bridge in amazement thats incredible nothin incredible about it herald enric snorted damned thing goes out every other season easier to build it so it breaks apart clean his bare torso red with cold kern shrugged into a sheepskin coat supports slip out so they dont shatter logs end up in the same place we float em back and rebuild any idiot can do it trust me ive crossed a hundred riversor maybe a couple of rivers a hundred timesbut ive never seen anything like this ma says its not simen paused frowned and looked up at the herald its really good its really good the brothers exchanged confused looks and jors had the horrible suspicion this was the first time theyd ever been praised for anything the next day while jors was checking calidas girth strap for the trip back to town dory came out of the house with a bundle its for brock she said folding back a corner i want you to give it to him for me at first jors thought it was white leather made sense they were tanners after all then he realized the leather had been cut and sewn into a fair approximation of heralds whites dory had clearly taken the pattern from his and sized it to fit brock i saw he didnt have none of his own oh help dory you know hes not brother herald we go now what you got his hands and dorys together closed the bundle its a surprise dory said her cheeks crimson for later not for now no okay he took calidas reins and stood waiting patiently while jors tied the bundle behind gervis saddle you seem upset chosen i cant tell her brocks not an actual herald while hes standing there hell say he isi say he isnt and im not sure that in this place at this time id win the argument you shouldnt argue oh thats helpful thank you the whole family went with them to the bridge jors didnt know why the rest came but he was certain aysa just wanted to make sure they were off her land he wanted to say something something that would convince them they didnt have to live inside the darkness of an old womans anger but before he could think of the right words brock hugged dory and simen and enric and kern then he scrambled up into the saddle and from the safety of calidas back took a deep breath looked aysa in the eye and spoke directly to her for the first time why dont you love your babies her lip curled i buried my babies halfwit he nodded toward the three young men standing to her right not them she turned looked at her sons looked back at brock and muttered halfwit but there was little force behind it jors had no idea he was going to do what he did until he did it jors you hugged mean lady yeah i know although he still couldnt believe it everyone else got hugged i just shed pushed him away with such force that hed slammed back into gervis shoulder you are the bravest herald ever ever thank you then shed snarled something incomprehensible turned and stomped away hed probably accomplished nothing at all by it the bundle dory had given him pushed against the small of his back the weather remained clear and cool and just as the sun was setting they stopped outside the village gate will close when sun is set brock warned i know brock i think you should go back to haven with isabel lots of heralds in haven yes brock sighed and shook his head no i have to stay here i am the only herald brock youre not he couldnt say it brock waited patiently for a moment then smiled is it later yes whats dorys surprise umits um both companions turned their heads to look at him their expression said this is up toyou he believes he is a herald yes but and he acts accordingly i couldnt do it isabel theyre just clothes and i know that but if i gave brock those whites then thered be fake heralds showing up all over the place a bad precedent to be sure the older herald agreed there has to be a line and that line has to be the companions sometimes it seems like were barely keeping order in chaos now i couldntno matter how much jors ran both hands back through his air he couldnt believe how much the decision the right decision had felt like betrayal it wouldnt make any difference to brock he knows who and what he is but for the others in the village those who made fun and called him names come here i want to show you something isabel took his arm and pulled him to the window what do you see jors squinted down into the stable yard brocks grooming gervis again while you four were gone i talked to a lot of people seems that whenever a herald comes into this village the companion manages to spend time with brock even if its only a moment or two they watched as calida crossed the yard and tried to shoulder gervis away brock laughed and told her to wait her turn you were right not to give him the whites isabel continued but you were also right when you said it makes no difference he couldnt be chosen because as heralds we have to face dangers hed never understand but the companions know him all brock needs from us is our love and support now since healer lorrin has finally allowed me out of bed what do you say you and i go down there and give our brother a hand with the fourfoots jors grinned as brock gamely tried to brush both tails at once heralds wear shiny white brock wore his whites on

variable number of pets and guitars it had worked again the sun was well up as rin rode out of goldenoak summer light filtered through the trees dappled the white coat of his mount and sparked off the hilt of the sword bouncing gently at his side it also showed the grimy spots on his white tunic and leggings it had been a good visit good for rin that is the take included four solid meals road rations several pots of the local beer and a few kisses stolen from the hamlets daughters theres something about a man in uniform he mused fineboned even features blond hairand blue eyes helped too if you cant be big and burly slight and handsome will have to do toobad i couldnt manage some coin but coinage was almost as scarce as heralds among the tiny settlements scattered along valdemars northern border out here the forests dangers combined with distance to isolate the villages other than infrequent sweeps for brigands people this far out never saw much of the militia let alone valdemars regular guard especially since the recent problems in the south even less often they might glimpse a legendary herald they and their spookywhite horses were nearmythical heroes rin figured folks should get to meet their heroes on occasion and show a little hero worship it wasnt his fault if the real heralds were too busy saving the kingdom to take time to share a few meals drinks and kisses with the salt of valdemars earth two months back hed made his break from tortos traveling show a ratty handful of stickmen peep shows and crackthroated minstrels ruled by the beefy sadistic torto the show had about as much resemblance to a true traveling troupe of gleemen as a weed does a rose in tortos show you rarely saw the same town twice after swindling and stealing everything that wasnt nailed down on one end they packed up in the night and moved on to fresh marks rin ran shell games with the best of them developed a healthy contempt for the townies and never stopped hating and fearing torto the night hed made his break they were between towns in western iftel rin hoped hed truly cracked the drunken tortos head with that tent stake but with tortos thick skull he doubted it rin had started this herald game less than a month back after crossing iftels border with valdemar it wasnt much but it beat being a cupandball man in the towns with luck it would get him somewhere more comfortable where constables didnt know him and torto couldnt trail him he didnt know a great deal about heralds but apparently neither did the locals his story of being a special auxiliary herald worked well enough and explained why he only talked with them took mysterious coded notes and moved on rin was sure his code was unbreakable his scribblings were just that as much as hed wanted hed never learned to read or write the story also let him get food and other necessities from the villages rather than the waystations normally used by heralds and other servants of the crown the heralds rode regular circuits and rin simply made sure he was somewhere else that wasnt hard this far out he was safe enough so long as he picked the right villages and didnt stay too long or take too much it was simple as games went but not bad for an eighteenyearold stickman it kept him fed equipped and admired of the three he liked the admiration best the morning warmed as he rode through patches of sunlight and shade scarlet flashed as a bird took wing and a woodlarks song piped through the trees he remembered the woods like this out with his family hunting wild berries it was one of his few memories of a time before brigands hit his village and took him fourteen years ago this summer he didnt remember the villages name even though it had been somewhere in this region he barely remembered the faces of his parents but he remembered the look and feel of the woods rin fingered a townchit given him by goldenoaks headman the small brass plate was stamped with a crude stylized tree representing the villages name he gathered they expected him to turn it in at haven to get the village a tax break for feeding and sheltering him interesting how trustful folks could be of a government maybe it came from not constantly pulling stakes and moving he shook his bead chuckling softly and leaned back to slip it into his saddlebag adding to the pile of townchits already there at midday rin stopped to rest the mare watering her at a shaded brook before he took his own drink he was as good to her as he could manage she was a good horse and his only real friend in tortos show no princes charger but not a plug either rin thought of unsaddling her and letting her roll but here he had to move fast if needful so he only loosened the girth strap she was white mostly but that was just good luck and the graying out of age shed been tortos but rin was the one who cared for her it didnt really bother rin that hed stolen her though a slickman with pride in his craft wouldnt resort to outright theft unless there was no way to swindle for what was needed which was also why hed later stolen the heralds whites the flashy sword was from tortos prop box taken with no thought of this particular game he just liked having the sword even though the slim heavy knife in his boot top was probably a better weapon a sword made him feel more like a heroic servant of the crown and half of any game was feeling the part he dug into a saddlebag and came up with a small cloth sack rin peered in laughed delightedly and popped one of the golden brown slices into his mouth he rolled his eyes and nearly cried the taste of the lightly seasoned dried apple brought back a wave of memory and feeling for rin that taste whispered of another time and a loving mothers special treat for a small boy rin munched road rations while the mare grazed he drank deeply from the brook and topped up his water bottle after a halfhours rest he cinched the mares girth strap and set off again in late afternoon he rounded a turn and glimpsed two small figures perhaps a hundred paces ahead on the narrow uphill road the taller darted into the brush the shorter seemed frozen holding something the taller figure reappeared to drag the other back into the bushes they didnt seem big enough to be a threat but this region was never entirely free of brigands with one hand on the reins and the other on his sword rin edged the mare on up the hill reaching the spot he heard voices whispering fiercely the brush rustled and a small boy stumbled out onto the path he was four or five dressed in homespun tunic and breeches the boy stared roundeyed up at rin clutching a battered toy stick horse the head of the horse was cut from split wood and painted white its eyes were blue valon the bushes behind the boy hissed get back here more rustling and a girl of about nine years came out on the path she was dressed in the same material as the boy with similar features her hair a darker shade of blond sister and brother probably she pulled the boy behind her natli piped the boy peering around her hes a herald may be she said eyeing rin an may be not if youre a herald whats your name an how come your horses eyes haint blue rin gave the girl his warmest smile feeling as if he were stepping onstage i am special auxiliary herald rincent mlady at your service rin let his voice ring with easy authority time for fast answers and distractions as for my companion the regular heralds around the big cities have the ones with blue eyes they dont all have blue eyes you know but serena here can do other things she can read minds read minds the girl looked less wary and more interested and talk without words hmf the wary look was back in the girls eyes but rin was on familiar ground here the few tricks hed taught the mare always came in handy he cocked his head as if listening and tickled the mares neck on the side away from the girl the horse snorted and shook her head slightly she says natli that you and your brother valon shouldnt be out in the forest especially with your family worried about you the girls eyes widened but we had to run valon had edged out from behind his sister we had to we cant go back to the village you had to run thats rightherald rincent said natli mum said to run an run an not stop till the bad men werent followin us no more bad men rin didnt like the sound of this what bad men the ones that came to our village mum said they wanted food an gold an people mum said to run till we found someone to get help brigands robbers and killers with a taste for slaving they were hunting these children if they hadnt given up the same sort whod attacked his home killed his parents sold him to be adopted by that greasebucket torto rin was very sure he wanted nothing to do with these bad men he hadnt planned on returning so soon if ever to goldenoak but it was far better than meeting the outlaws he hoped the kids could keep up if not he could tell the villagers they were on the trail while he rode on to get help youll help us wont you herald rincent valons eyes pleaded along with his voice wont you rin had been about this boys age when the raiders came how far back are these bad men asked rin a shout snapped his attention up the trail where the hill crested a big broadshouldered man stood there he stared at rin and the children then turned shouted again and waved behind him it was too far for rin to make out his face but rin could guess who and what he was not very far said natli gravely pulling valon back to her she looked back up at rin staring eye to eye you have to help us now rin looked back up the hill two more men appeared one after the other the last seemed to be breathing hard leaning over to rest his hands on his knees the outlaw catching his breath might give them a few seconds the sight of the heralds whites and horse a few more but these were hard cases men marked and hunted by the law they wouldnt be put off for long by the sight of one herald the brigands were here to steal him again a dark closed part of rins mind flashed a bright jagged series of memories racing with his panicked thoughts got to get away just ride off he smelled the choking reek of burning thatch the brigands will take the kids they wont bother chasing me he heard his mothers screams the boy and girl wont be killed he glimpsed his fathers bloodied legs sprawled outside the doorway theyll just grow up without parents without lives like me inside rins mind something broke free stood up on its hind legs and snarled no by the nine hells they will not hand him up he told natli as he reached down then get up behind me move as rin hauled valon up an arrow hissed past his face the mare jerked and danced but rin kept a taut rein and turned her to face downhill he glanced back the slow brigand at the hills crest fumbled another arrow onto his bowstring his two ugly partners were running downhill the first well ahead of the second closing fast if rin could get the girl up quickly they should make it even the three of them would load the horse little more than a large man and rin had past experience running from angry people he shifted the reins and settled valon with his right hand and leaned down to help natli up with his left another arrow whistled past the mares eyes and nose frightened from the first arrow and the smell of fear the mares neighing sounded like a childs scream she reared rin fell with valon atop him the toy horse still in the boys fist the packed earth of the path was better than rock but landing still hurt the mare ran headlong back downhill away from them all rin had survived enough street fights to know you checked hurts only after getting clear he untangled himself from valon and lurched to his feet cursing himself for choosing now of all times to be good and stupid he put himself between the children and the oncoming brigands and hauled out his sword run he said grimly and faced his attackers the first outlaw a big man with scarred face and matted hair reached him and swung rin ducked a side cut to his head and jumped back to avoid the return slash to his stomach no they werent awed by the uniform he had to attack before the second thug reached him rin put all his strength and speed into an overhand cut at his opponents head the man shifted fast and blocked the blow solidly rins cheap show blade twisted and folded over the outlaws tarnished steel rin had one dismayed glimpse of the blades rightangle bend before a kick caught him at the top of his stomach just under the breastbone it knocked him back to land buttfirst the air driven from his lungs feeling like hed never take another breath which was likely correct he didnt know where his sword was but it wasnt in his hand the second outlaw a short man in dirty gaudy clothes arrived on the scene and looked down on rin who was making raspy squeaking noises that were a poor substitute for breathing the outlaw grunted and grinned huh id heard them whiteshirts was pretty tough in a fight i always thought these heroes was overrated the big brigand leered and stepped up to rin raising his sword gnight whiteshirt a short figure in homespun rushed in and the head of valons toy horse was a white blur as it swung the solid wooden horsehead whacked the outlaws knee and he bellowed and swore the blow had to hurt even if it didnt really injure the big man spun and caught valon by the back of his tunic lifting the boy flailing and kicking attention off him for the moment rin still gasped vainly for air as he clawed at his boot top bugger this ones too much trouble we aint takin him back the outlaw hefted valon up as if serving a game of shuttle cock but the arm he cocked back held a sword instead of a paddle rins knife flickered silver as it flew and turned it made a muffled thack as it hit the outlaw in the back of his thigh just above the knee he dropped both valon and his sword and went down holding his leg and cursing the second outlaw moved grimly at rin his sword raised to strike his other hand up shielding against the stones natli threw at him the first stone had drawn blood on his cheek the second missed and then natli was out of stones there was still no sign of the third slower brigand aughh damnit the downed outlaw continued cursing from where he lay gripping his injured leg forget captives kill em all rins lungs still wouldnt cooperate he tried feebly to get to his feet but the sword was up and rin could see his death he closed his eyes there was a hissing a loud chunk and a louder scream rins eyes flew open to see an arrow standing out of the mans sword arm hed dropped his sword and wasnt looking at rin on the downhill trail a rider pelted up toward them on a mount so white it hurt the eye behind him an identically mounted figure fitted another arrow to bowstring the outlaw turned and sprinted back up the hill the arrow still in his bleeding arm his downed comrade tried to drag himself up and run cursing and gasping but fell after two clumsy limping steps the running outlaw sped up the hill but now men in steel caps and leather armor filled the roadway seeming to rise up from the hills crest long blue shields locked edge to edge and spears leveled over the rims the running brigand turned without breaking stride and plunged into the woods muffled commands were shouted as the militia broke ranks some chasing the running outlaw others coming down to seize the other who was still trying to drag himself into the brush a few mounted militiamen rode into sight at the hills crest holding the horses of their dismounted comrades the horses like some of their riders appeared past their prime rin on hands and knees looked back again at the two whiteclad figures now riding abreast toward him nice shot he thought his lungs worked but he was in no shape to run even after valon and natli helped him up his next thought after seeing the two riders mounts close up was how couldanyone ever mistake them for just horses it wasnt just the sheen of their coats the rippling muscles beneath or their regal easy grace the blue eyes had intelligence behind them and more the heralds were an older man and a tall darkhaired young woman the woman still had an arrow on her bowstring and a look for rin that said she knew exactly where she wanted to put it rin noted that she and he were about the same size and had an uneasy suspicion she was the original owner of his stolen whites the man was muscular looking with a closecropped beard and hair shot with gray he looked first at the children are you injured did those men hurt you his voice was a soothing baritone they wanted to blurted natli but we fought em she looked at rin then back up to the herald well we helped herald rincent fight em so we saw from about the time this young man a nod to valon ordered that fierce companion of his to defenduhherald rincent i think you have a solid career if you ever join the guard lad valon had retrieved his hobbyhorse its ear was broken off unhunh the boy shook his head solemnly as he looked up dont wanna be a soljerim gonna be a herald the older herald grinned broadly even the grimfaced young woman smiled that might also be possible responded the herald he turned to the woman wed best split up to help the militia the woman nodded never taking her eyes off rin the older herald dismounted in the usual way but the woman pulled her left foot free of the stirrup raised her right leg over saddle pommel and her mounts neck and slid smoothly to the ground her hands never left bow grip or arrow nock the heralds companion snorted and both left the road and cantered into the woods following the sounds of shouting running men rin felt the hair on the back of his neck stand up the senior herald looked grim as he turned back to rin as for you herald rincent his eyes flicked over the children and back to rin we have a great deal to discuss they were an odd parade as they came into the childrens home village the militia officer rode first leading a stubby packhorse straddled by the big outlaw with the injured leg the outlaw was bound and neckroped to the other two brigands who walked also bandaged and bound on either side of the horse any escape attempt would likely strangle all three next came rin leading his mare she had been found wandering in the woods by the companions and the children now rode her with the two heralds and their companions to either side the senior herald who called himself terek had warned rin to keep his mouth shut and maintain the game until they could talk privately terek made it plain bad things would happen if rin tried to get away rin was sure this was true even without the tooknowing gaze of the companions and the ready bow and hard looks of trefina the other herald they were followed by the militia pleased with themselves and riding in smart order shields up and spears braced upright late sunlight catching red gleams off spearheads and bridle fittings at the edge of the village a young woman with disarrayed hair and reddened eyes rushed up to the mare laughing and weeping at once the childrens mother pulled the children fiercely to her for a long moment and then recovered her composure she gave fervent but dignified thanks to the heralds and rin rins feelings were jumbled he felt proud for his part in the childrens return but oddly confused about how to receive thanks and praise he for once partly deserved he felt happy about the children returning to their mother and family and profoundly sad that hed never had the same chance himself and probably never would too it bothered him that hed so long regarded people like this with amused contempt at best the summer night was soft and warm and the waxing moon cast pale light on the villages cluster of homes and outbuildings added to by lamps and a fair number of bonfires the surviving outlaws both those chasing the children and three others captured that afternoon after the militias sudden appearance at the village were locked in the smokehouse the stale smell of charred wood carried from the one cottage partly burned by the outlaws before the militia arrived five fresh graves at the edge of the wood held neither villager nor militia wounds of militia and villagers were bandaged people were quietly celebrating the end of the brigands the return of their children the survival of their friends and families after tending his mare rin helped terek bring water to his companion whom terek introduced as coryandor the companion much more then a horse rin now knew drank deeply then nodded briefly to rin as if in thanks rin didnt know where the other companion was but he was glad it wasnt here the young womans mount made it clear she disliked rin as much as her rider twice bumping rin roughly and looking as if she wanted to do more terek brought out a currycomb and began running it over the companions coat coryandor closed his eyes and sighed with sheer bliss time to talk said terek to be specific time for me to talk and you to listen as if your life depends on it which it does rin nodded he felt very uncomfortable impersonating an officer of the crown is a serious offense usually a capital crime serious enough to drag me from haven to find you people must be able to trust their herald and impersonating a herald is unthinkable well almost unthinkable you obviously thought of it rin thought of running but gave it up when he saw coryandor staring at him as if the companion knew his every thought in your defense theres your protection of those children even after meeting you the boy still wants to be a herald from the direction of the houses came the cheerful sound of voices singing with more enthusiasm than skill something about drunken crows they sounded much happier than rin felt weve been following you for three weeks terek continued apparently you never stole anything outright while posing as one of us and you have no history of violent crimes terek straightened up from brushing coryandors front leg at least none we discovered another small point in your favor is that cory says you took good care of your horse rin wondered how the companion told terek that because of these factors you have a choice between two options one is to go back to haven with us where after unpleasant interrogations even more unpleasant things will happen to you how unpleasant asked rin feeling unpleasant already very said terek perhaps hanging if youre lucky if youre not wellas much as heralds despise someone posing as a herald theres a group with even stronger feelings you could be turned loose in the exercise yards with a dozen young companion stallions rins spine chilled it got worse as coryandor turned his head to give rin a hard unblinking look and rin caught not words but a feeling as if pressed into his mind from outside the feeling said rin would be much better off hanging ill take option two said rin better hear it first understand that if you dont deliver on any part of option two option one becomes the only option and never think we cant find you coryandor turned slightly so terek could get to his flank but the companion still stared at rin rin simply nodded go on if yours was a lesser crime and these less pressing times continued terek id have you go back to each and every village you visited and work off every morsel of food every piece of equipment and every courtesy terek shifted and curried the companions other side but these are special times so the crown will honor that pile of townchits in your saddlebags and give the village their tax credits in other words valdemar will buy your debt from the villages and then rin asked though he didnt much want an answer you return to haven with me that reminds me change clothes as soon as we get away from here wear any combination of tan or brown or purple spots or anything except white or gray if anyone recognizes you as a herald tell them youre on a philosophical leave of absence developing your humility and service heralds do that they do now at least you do after we reach haven you will go through training ethics for a start and weapons tooyou can certainly use it mathematics reading and writing too along with somespecialized classes reading and writing but rin still grimaced that could take years option number one then said terek umnever mind said rin quickly forget i said anything so i go to school on the crowns coin thats the punishment terek smiled as nastily as any brigand thats the preparation understand that any shortcoming any shirking any attempt to disappear or go back to your old ways and its option number one coryandor was looking at him again with those scary blue eyes the man who said theresalways a choice was a liar thought rin i uh accept he said even with herald wizardry watching there was always the chance he could slip away later what happens after i get educated terek smiled like he meant it you come to work for me and valdemar what why me terek rubbed his companions neck because if you dont youre back to option one he said cheerily coryandor snorted and bared his teeth at rin rin blanched also youre reasonably intelligent if not always smart gods know youre lucky youve traveled around both in and outside valdemar you can gain peoples trust quickly and convince them youre something youre not and if needed you can think the unthinkable any monarch who cares about valdemar and her people can use a few knaves fighting and conniving for the right and the good you likely wont be a herald that choice is out of my hands but with time you may equal one in service to valdemar its up to you rin being of service to others without being forced the idea was a new one still you think i can do all this he asked with my job you have to be good at reading a persons potential and seeing his true colors replied terek im very good at it you might even call it a gift rins smile grew slowly to a huge grin as he thought about it here was a chance to be admired for himself to learn to read and write and to use a sword to adventure to defend a kingdom using a slickmans stock in trade and maybe most importantly a place to belong it might even be worth school valon stuck his blond head in the doorway behind terek and smiled shyly at rin the boy still had his wooden companion with him valons mother appeared behind the boy put a hand on his head and smiled for the tiniest moment rin tasted dried apples rin looked down at his torn dirty whites back at terek and valon grinned crookedly and spread his arms looks like its time to change he said tereks chuckle said he knew rin wasnt just talking about clothes touches the earth by brenda cooper brenda cooper has had stories published in analog and asimovs with collaborator larry niven and her own work has appeared in analog a longtime fan of valdemar brenda loved doing a story for this anthology she lives in bellevue washington works in kirkland city government and loves to run read write and enjoy family thats right locate the energy line below you goodnow draw it up through your feet through your center and feed it out slowly tims voice teased the edges of anyas focus as she drew a mental picture of energy flowing floor to flank to fingers earth becoming light she fed the tiny flame she had conjured in the bowl in front of her the fire flared from the size of her thumb to something that would engulf her palm and she drew in a sharp breath her calf muscles quivered pain shot through the small of her back and the bright glow winked to nothing you lost it what happened tim asked ii dont know all of a sudden my back hurt and then it was gone tim frowned and what happened last time my fingers quivered and didnt point the right way hed been there when she caught the edge of a tablecloth on fire anya heard the defensiveness in her voice and labored to find another tone itit seems like i can only hold so much energy and then something happens its not always the same thing but its always something physical in my body i dont know what to change now it sounded to anya like shed exchanged defensiveness for despair im sorry she mumbled you can hold more energy i can feel your potential you arent even near your capacity tim tugged on his graying braid and frowned then he looked intently into anyas eyes youre fighting it theres a point where you have to surrender you have to feel itthere are no words and ive been told its different for everyone its keeping focus maintaining control but its also surrendering all at once he was pacing his words more insistent than usual anya knew better than to interrupt himhe could be harsh when frustrated your focus is clear but i cant feel your surrender youre trying to be a warrior spouting flame at an enemy but healing isnt warriors work surrender and your body will be able to hold energy much longer now try again anya breathed into her belly tucked her hips and refocused on her shielding then she started again conjuring the flame feeding it to fistsized holding it holding it and then her forehead flashed with pain and she blinked opening her eyes to an empty bowl tim didnt comment instead he said ill go catch us some supper while im gone think about what might be between you and your full abilities feeding flame is a small trick but its handling the same energy youll need for any major healing tim stood glanced at her and walked out the door grateful for the respite anya allowed herself a long sigh as soon as tim was out of sight tim expected her to be good enough to replace him as the troubled villages healer soon if only they could have a real healer from haven she had been studying for two whole years now and while shed started out learning fast the last year had felt like stepping backward or at best sideways shed learned new things but hadnt made any real progress at the beginning tim had expressed surprise at how quickly she started to cure simple maladies like headaches and sniffles and to make a tiny flame since then shed added the ability to formno collectballs of light and to lessen stomach cramps she knew how to shield to ground and center to focus it wasnt enough real healing eluded her tim had to step in every time shed seen tim repair multiple burn wounds last year when a halffinished sheep barn had burned and then have the bad grace to barely look tired after just two hours of much less difficult work every muscle along her back was tense calves to shoulders she wanted to close her eyes and sleep instead she looked around struggling for alertness tims home was an ingenious cave campfire stories whispered that the mysterious hertasi had built it secretly when northend homestead was only a few families struggling to feed themselves if so the hertasi were masters at their craft anya had never seen one but they had been described as lizardlike with hands that worked more cleverly than human hands fashioning and shaping and building for the hawkbrothers shed never spoken to a hawkbrother but anya had seen them twice before riding fast on graceful dhyeli warning homestead of a storm once and a dangerous hedgewizard another time she wanted the mysterious and beautiful people to stay to talk to her but of course they were busy nevertheless shed watched for them on woods walks but they were as elusive as true healing all the best magic in the world except her teacher himself was hiding from her everything bright and positive was hiding ever since shed moved here and left her home searching for work tim had identified her gift he was a good thing the best thing in her life his regard for her was bright but she was so far from his expectations she might as well have become the village sheepherder homestead was one of a handful of towns in the far north of valdemar land the hawkbrothers had reclaimed for safe human habitation only a few generations ago lately raids had come with no warning and the town was now smaller and more indrawn afraid now townspeople only came to tims cave in the light of day and even then they often sent anya to fetch the healer in the past three months ten men had disappeared with no trace ten more had left to find them disappearing as well light spilled in through the door and fell from two clever round openings in the roof illuminating the large open space with midafternoon sun a few carefully crafted items lined the walls leaving a large clear area where tim struggled twice a week to teach her anyas gaze fell across the small altar in front of her a wide burled maple trunk had been sawn flat and polished to a bright surface that glowed when the lightlike nowhit it just right a fine handsewn cloth two handspans wide sat in the center it shimmered when sunlight hit it somehow twisting from black and gray to purple and blue the work was so magnificent that anya couldnt imagine the weaver in the center of the cloth rested a candle and a drawing of three figures the drawing showed a woman a man and a small boy anya was sure tim had drawn them although they looked somehow less alive than pictures he drew of wolves and deer and sometimes of townspeople anya closed her eyes pulling her focus inward trying to release the tight muscles along her spine then suddenly they clenched again the peal of the town alarm bell screamed for attention and in two heartbeats anya had grabbed her backpack and was pelting down the trail toward northend homestead this time it wasnt a direct raid there was no noise of fighting staining the town nevertheless anyas landlady elena was crying quietly a group of women gathered around her hovering at the edges of the crowd anya was able to glean that elenas oldest nineyearold justine had left before dawn to deliver eggs and had not returned after half a day she should have been gone just a candlemark justines father was one of the men who had followed the raiders ten days ago elena and justine had not seen or heard from him since after anya moved to town three years ago justine had become a frequent visitor to anyas room just last night anya had prepared a tea of comforting herbs to ease justines bedtime fears the girl had stammered and thanked her then anya had held her close for almost a full candlemark while she cried for her father until justine fell asleep in a tangle of bedclothes and blond hair only a handful of candlemarks remained until dark teams split up in the four directions agreeing that the town bell would call them back if anyone succeeded in finding justine tim insisted they go east the same direction as his underground home they stopped there to provision but rather than helping anya tim sat down in front of the small altar and just stared at his drawing well she looked at him he didnt respond at all just picked up the picture of the three people and held it in his hands his eyes closed anya gathered cheese bread and an herb kit into packs she stared at tims unmoving back after a few moments she said we need to hurry justine could be hurt tim ignored her and slipped into his bedroom closing the door anya waited drumming her fingers and then pacing when he finally emerged anya raised her eyebrows at him theyrefrom how i lived once before a quite serviceable sword was buckled around his waist and a long knife stuck hiltup from his boot in his right hand he held out a short dirk toward her he looked unfamiliar different somehow he fit the mood he had been in all day stern and serious butbut youve always told me you werent a fighter i didnt say i wasnt one just that im not one now so go on take it ill feel better i made you stop practicing with the young men at guard but that was to hone your focus on healing skills tim said ive seen you use a weapon youll pass you may need one today go on puzzled and a little alarmed anya palmed the blade and stuck it in her waistband they left climbing up the rise behind tims cave a stream ran down the hill on the other side and there they walked with just the water between them searching for tracks but close enough to talk so tell me about it anya said i used to be a fighter i can see that a mercenary i thought it was a good thing to be i loved the actionloved being so strong but then i went too far and i killed people for money sellswords do that tim stopped for a minute and bent down to look at the ground then he shook his head not justines track someone bigger but not necessarily an enemy he shrugged anyway i went too far and one day i woke up sick and tired of it all i had done somethingwrongterrible the day before at first i drank it off but in the morning my head became crystal clear and i got up and walked away that wouldnt have made him popular with his troop what did you do wed been hired to clean out a bunch of thieves from someones holding that sounds pretty normal anya said yeah but it turned out we were the thieves does this have anything to do with the pictures on your altar anya asked they were the rightful owners tims voice clamped down and he walked a while before he spoke again they were defending their home i killed the man with my own hands i broke his back and pulled his head back and snapped his neck i threw the firebrand that caught the houses roof on fire the woman and the boy burned alive i did it just because i was told to i didnt think anya had no response they walked as quickly as they could and still watch the ground at one point they found a bit of red string stuck to a low branch about waist level there was no way to know if it was justines but it kept them following the stream as the sun touched the treetops the temperature dropped shadows lengthened and anya felt fear building so when you left when you walked away from being a mercenary what did you do i got lost tim stood still and looked around we should stop soon we may spend the night out here i havent heard the town bells you wont im sure were going the right way i thought you said farseeing wasnt a gift of yours its not but sometimes i just know things i have ever since i was a kid i think thats what made me good at fighting in the first place three forest tracks converged near the bottom of the hill gold light dappled the paths and a rabbit flashed its white at them as it dove into the safety of the underbrush tim pointed out shallow hoofprints these look fresh probably made today at least he gestured at her to stay close to him did you think about what is stopping you anya bit her lip fear i guess of course but what are you afraid of anya let the question hang in the air for a bit she was so absorbed in trying to read the faint tracks that her next words surprised her healers are people in stories and songsnot me im just anya you dont know how good you are anya smiled tim was always saying she was good and complaining at her for failing all in the same conversation but still i cant do half of what you do how will i ever take over for you when you have to you will an owl screeched it was close to dusk but still earlyowls shouldnt be hunting yet and the sound wasdesperate anya looked at tim he was standing completely still i think well know something pretty soon follow tim took off to the right toward the sound the owl screeched again sounding at once angry and frightened they ran two hundred yards farther along anya heard the sounds of fighting tim gestured to her to stay back and he kept going running low tugging his sword from its scabbard as he went he disappeared down the edge of a ridge anyas breath tangled in her lungs as she worked her way quickly and silently to the fir trees at the ridges edge a shadow passed over her head she looked up the bird was impossibly big twelve feet or more wingtip to wingtip and it was diving down silent and deadly the owl arrowed directly at a man tim was fighting the man flinched stepping back to avoid the wings and talons directed at his face tim ran his sword through the attacker whirling to hold off a second man anyas fingers clenched the dirks hilt fear and confusion anchoring her feet her eyes swept the scene trying to make sense of the movement a wagon sat in the middle of the path twisting dangerously as two horses danced and kicked with their back legs the spooked horses were unable to run leather hobbles bound their front legs a small figure lay in the wagon covered by a blanket justine a dead man lay near the wagon another man no two men rolled on the ground one of them was covered with twigs and mud and colored like the forest it was so hard to see him anya had to focus hard to keep him in sight even though he was moving he must be a hawkbrother scout then the owl was his bondbird the scout slashed a knife across the throat of the man he struggled against now free the hawkbrother stood quickly running toward tim anya wanted to move but couldnt tell where to run her eyes found tim there was a new slash across his shoulder and blood ran down his bicep and dripped from his elbow still she had never seen him move with such speed and sureness tim circled using the long knife that was in his boot keeping his attacker from the sword that now lay gleaming dully on the ground his challenger came in low and tim blocked with his damaged arm pushing the man off as tim himself fell new blood bloomed where the mans knife had gouged his thigh a flash of silver light caught the last rays of the sun and the hawkbrothers knife thudded into the neck of tims challenger who crumpled tim waved thanks he tried to stand and made it to one knee his right leg dragging he reached for the sword holding it out in front of him as blood dripped from his arm and from the edge of the sword as well no one else moved anya finally leaped into motion running down the small hill toward the rocking wagon she was only halfway there when the wagon tipped and rolled over knocking one of the fractious horses off its feet the other one planted a solid kick on the wagons side anya scrambled to the front of the wagon banged her knee and used the dirk to saw the leather traces loose from the tongue hooves sliced the air one quite near her head she backed up talking softly to the frightened animals trying to calm them enough to see if justine was under the wagon abruptly both horses stilled their attention focused on the hawkbrother walking carefully toward them he bent and expertly cut the hobbles now free the big animals stood placidly all of the chaos had disappeared from the scene and the path and forest became silent and still the owl glided in landing on a branch at the edge of the clearing watching with the same quiet that had settled on the rest of the forest the hawkbrother looked directly at anya paused and then simply said well met im nightsinger thank you she replied then offered im anya and that is tim he grinned i know who tim is you must be his student how could the man grin at a time like this nightsinger helped her turn the crumpled and staved wagon over it was justine under the wagon legs twisted sideways both arms splayed wide as if she had tried to break her fall blond hair spilled out from the blanket dark with blood nightsinger ran toward tim gesturing that she should stay and tend to the girl justine anya called out kneeling by the still form placing one hand on justines chest she had a heartbeat but her skin was chalky her scalp bleeding as anya felt along the top of her head one part felt mushy as if the business end of a horses hoof or a board had knocked into her anya looked around frantically for tim he was still thirty feet away and nightsinger had rolled him onto his back the new wound on the back of his thigh was bleeding extremely fast staining the earth around it she had to go to him she leaped up and ran to his side pain swirled like a live thing in his bright wet eyes and he clenched the knife tightly let me she began justine tim croaked justine first butbut you might die im tougher than i want to bethis wont finish me tims teeth ground into his lip sweat stood out on his forehead and anya could hear noises dying in his throat as he refused to cry out how could he survive this defiantly she placed her hands on his thigh near the worst of his wounds he raised the knife made as if to slash at her with it justine first anya felt like she was being severed in two the little girl clearly needed her but tim was the real healer not her not yet if she helped tim he could help justinebut justine could die without immediate attention it was beyond her to save one and they both needed her what if tim died she felt anchored in placethe way she had been when she was watching the fight unable to choose a direction because all of the choices needed doing but nightsinger was with tim and justine was a child turning away from tim was like spiraling through a physical wall her legs shook as she walked away from him anya forced herself to look only at justine to hear and taste and sense only things surrounding the little girl justines head wound was threatening by itself enough to explain why the girl was out stone cold her legs were bound together badly chafed the skin deeply raw around the ropes anya thought they could be broken her arms and torso looked unmarked except her left hand was gashed and bleeding anya cut the ropes around justines legs and straightened them now how could she ground herself she had always worked in homes or in the main room at timsand always with tim coaching her here there was no comfortable place to stand rooted to justine was in an awkward spot and anya didnt think it safe to move her she chose a kneeling pose and probed for earth energy the way tim had taught her it was there a breath a stream and available she pulled it up into her setting shielding to keep her focus to close out the woods and the path and the wounded healer behind her her body gained life her mind focus and she began to see things more clearly as she prepared to transfer the energy filling her to the wounded girl she needed tim it felt like so much like more than she had ever felt tim should do thisshe wasnt up to it the energy poured away lost like water over a cliff and she put her head down and hid her face in her hands she shivered cold and frustrated a croak rose from far behind her tims voice i can see you do this start over a softening of his tone surrender anya let go she looked back nightsinger sat quietly next to tim the hawkbrother nodded at her can you help tim she pleaded only a little you must help him by doing your work tears stung the corner of her eyes she touched the earth tapping the stream of energy again it was weak and she reached and reached and barely gathered a warm trickle it wasnt enough she was going to fail she let go started over ignoring her first touch of darkness whether real or not she heard tims voice in her head saying surrender surrender she touched and reached and this time the line of power felt focused less diffuse she filled herself with each breath establishing the stream into her as a river seeing it as light she could channel through her palms it was more than she could take and still less than justine needed she wanted to scream necessity pushed at her until something inside crumpled away something thin but important loss swept into trust and anya realized how afraid she had been totrustherself power earth energy filled the places where fear had been now she was part of it and it was part of her and the outcome no longer mattered just the work she placed her hands on justines head directing the energy into the prone form it was warmth flowing down her arms and through the center of her palms into justine overwhelming the cold of her wounds acting on them like sun on ice melting pain slowly ever so slowly anya could feel it almost see it and it was exquisite like spring colors and stored sunshine flowing into justine from the earth it used anya like a vessel and a map seeking direction and amplification in her focus warmth spread through anya into the girls head burning away pain and harm healing her broken skull warmth began to flow down justines shoulders and anya felt almost as if the two of them were one being then suddenly it was too much her back was freezing anya shuddered the connection lost now it was only her own empty hands on justines head every muscle in her arms quivered and shook anyas body demanded rest sleep she fought for strength to see to justine the girl was breathing better more regularly her skin wasnt quite the right color but it was somehow less white anya probed justines head gently and it felt normal justines legs were bleeding where the bonds had been and still swollen and bruised so she hadnt finished but it would be enough justines youth would heal the rest quickly anya sighed and then in a tiny flash of energy she remembered tim nightsinger sat immobile by tim hands on her teachers thigh wound tims head was turned away from her but nightsinger looked directly at her and said you did well little one let go she wanted to go to tim but blackness caught her and she barely felt the ground slap the side of her head as she surrendered to it anya woke to the sounds of many people she was bundled in a blanket by the side of the path her mouth was fiercely dry she licked her lips and tried to sit up but her head was so dizzy and painful she simply fell back again she heard the rustle of clothes and a cup of water appeared in front of her eyes an arm propped her up and another held the cup to her lips she sipped greedily when the cup was empty nightsinger rocked back on his heels and let her sit on her own surprisingly she found she had the strength if barely she watched him refill the cup from a water bag he slung over his shoulder all of her focus on the precious water on quenching the desert inside of her nightsinger grinned at her as she got partway through a third cup of water and finally

poughkeepsie new york it was midwinter festival in talastyre and the younger children were gathered in the square to watch the traditional midwinter play before heading home to spiced cider and oranges and the family feast elidor stood at the edge of the crowd unwilling to admit at fifteen that he still liked to watch the play but this was a day of rare liberty for him elidor was one of a dozen copyistapprentices at the great library of talastyrewhen other libraries around valdemar needed a copy of one of their books it was copyists like elidor who would write out the text in a fair hand when he was fully trained he might seek work at any library or in a lords household or even at the collegium in haven itself he had been brought to talastyre at the age of six on a winters day even colder than this one he remembered crying and clinging to his uncles coat begging and pleading not to be left here among strangers to be let to go home to his parents to his brothers and sisters he remembered the fire of course he had gone into the attic to play at heralds and companionsthe carved wooden toys had been his midwinter gift and when hed told his brothers that someday a companion would come to choose him for a herald theyd laughed at him and teased him so badly that hed decided to find a place to play undisturbed the attic was cold but hed taken his cloak with him and later it had gotten so warm that hed taken it off he remembered how his eldest sister marane had come running in she smelled of smoke and her face was streaked with tears hed started crying too because she frightened him even more when she told him he mustnt cry he must be brave he was still clutching the white painted companion when she pushed him out the tiny attic window too small for an adult to get through he screamed as he fellsuch a long waybut the snow was deep that year and he wasnt badly hurt he crawled away through the melting snow clutching the carved white horse shouting for his mother for marane he understood later that the house had burned and the townsfolk had come to try to put out the fire and see if any of the houses inhabitants might be saved and found him the only survivor at the time all elidor knew was that strangers took him away and would not tell him where his family had gone when his uncle finally came elidor hoped he would be taken home again his uncle was a silent distant man who rarely came to visit his brothers family but he was elidors closest kin he had no experience of children and spoke to elidor as if he were an equal simon left his affairs in order ill give him that and i can get a good price for the land even though theres nothing left of the house it will all come to you boy never fearno man can say that jonas bridewell would cheat his brothers kin it comes to a tidy sum ive taken steps to secure your future and an enviable one it is too you need have no fear of toiling in a shop or a mill for the rest of your days folk will look up to you young elidor there was little about this speech that made sense to elidor beyond the knowledge that he was not to go home again his uncle hired a coach and after a long and tiring journey they reached talastyre there he discovered he was to be abandoned it had been the master of boys who dried his tears who gently explained to him what his uncle had assumed he understood that his parents were dead and that talastyre was to be his home now in the dark days that followed elidor clung to only one hope that a companion would come for him to take him from this terrible place every chance he got he slipped away from his duties and hurried to the woods at the edge of town watching for the flash of shining white through the trees that would mean a companion was near he told no one of his dream in his thoughts the fire and his last midwinter gift were tangled up together in a way he couldnt explain at first slept with his painted horse beneath his pillow but he got into such terrible fights with the other boys when they tried to take it away from him that at last the master of boys said he would keep the toy safe for elidor in his own office where elidor could visit it whenever he wished the weeks passed then the months then the years and no companion came and slowly rebelliously elidor settled into the routine of the library and its school first he worked as a runner delivering messages between the offices of the great library then as a page reshelving books and bringing volumes when they were asked for along with the other children sent to talastyre to learnto elidors astonishment most of them had families his uncle had been telling the truth when he said he had secured for elidor an enviable positionelidor was taught to read and write his first lessons were in the common tongue and to scribe a simple fair hand but they would be followed by courses in other older languages and the clear difficult copyists hand that training would be the work of years for it took decades to make a fullytrained scribe not everyone completed it some lacked the aptitude others were there only to learn the basic lessons before returning to their families or passing on to other training elidor hated and envied them while clinging to his secret hope that he would be chosen that he would be more special more loved than all of them in the end he made no friends and wanted none and the work he could not avoid he did grudgingly and only if watched literacy was elidors salvation here is something that might interest you the master of boys said he sat down beside elidorwho was being detained as punishment while the other boys were sent out to play in the spring sunshineand set a book upon the desk it was large bound in blue leather stamped in silver elidor hated everything about booksthe way they looked the way they smelled their weight their pages filled with incomprehensible symbols he turned his head away but the master of boys didnt seem to notice he simply opened the book a flash of color drew elidors attention and he looked there painted on the page was a brightlycolored painting of a companion and its herald every detail was clear and in the spring sunlight the silver bells on the companions harness shone like stars elidor grabbed for it but the master of boys drew it back are your hands clean he asked gently elidor inspected his palms they were gray with the slate of the pencils the boys had been using to practice their letters go and wash them then elidor hurried to the back of the room and rinsed his hands quickly in the basin there leaving most of the dirt on the towel but his hands were clean when he returned he held them out for inspection the master of boys passed him the book quicklyand carefully as he had been taughtelidor turned the pages but there were not many pictures though many of the pages had a large bright initial letter each one in herald blue some with a tiny picture of a companion twined around it it is a great pity you cannot read this the master of boys said thoughtfully for it contains many tales of the companions and their brave heralds he gently drew the book away from elidor and closed it there are other such books in our library perhaps someday you will be able to read them if you apply yourself to your lessons from that day elidor worked hard at his lessons and harder at any task that brought him among the books soon he could read as well as many of the older boys and when two more years had passed the master of boys made good on his promise and elidor was given a pass that allowed him free access to any book on the open shelves of the library at first he was only interested in works about the heralds and the companions their history and their deeds but as the years passed and he had run through all of those his interests broadened until a books subject hardly mattered all of elidors adventures were lived through books and most of the time he was resigned to the fact that this was how it would always be his friends were the books of the great library and his teachers spoke approvingly of his abilities elidor they said will be a master copyist someday and a great credit to our training but deep inside the unacknowledged spark of resentment at how life had cheated him still burned dully and the hope remained grown faint and dim with the passing of years that a companion would come to make his life magical in the town square the play was getting to the part that he liked best and unconsciously elidor rose up on tiptoes trying to see better there was a jingle of bells onstage as the actor dressed as the companion appeared from the wings the horselike body was woven of light wicker covered with white velvet and its flashing eyes were made of bright foilbacked blue glass slowly the companion danced forward pausing in turn before the raggedy woodman the greedy taxcollector and the karsian wizard before stopping at last at the feet of hob the orphan boy something soft and moist touched elidor on the back of the neck he turned and stared only dimly realizing that everyone else was staring too it was a companion real and live and in the flesh no more like a horse than the carved wooden toy of his childhood was its coat was white almost more like duck down than horsehair and from its blue eyes shone such a sense of calm majesty that elidor nearly wanted to weep it was so close to the moment hed dreamed of all his life that it seemed unreal as if he ought to be reading about it not living it a companion had come for him at last but somehow it didnt seem right all the stories agreed that the candidates knew when theyd been chosen though the stories never managed to describe the feeling he reached out a hand to stroke that downy muzzle and the companion took a step backward still watching him with grave wise eyes he wants me to follow elidor realized he nodded not really sure if the companion could understand and took a step forward immediately the companion turned and took several steps away and waited almost fidgeting he hadnt known something in the shape of a horse could fidget but there it was you elidor said to the nearest boy go and tell them at the library that a companion has come he didnt know what else to say but surely that would be enough then he hurried off after the companion trotting to keep up with it he realized he felt no impulse to even try to mount the stallion and that too wasnt as things went in the stories some of the townsfolk followed themat a prudent distanceas far as the edge of the town but it became obvious that the companions destination lay further and elidor began to wonder if he was going to have to walk all the way to the collegium as they left the shelter of the buildings and passed through the town gate that stood open from dawn to sunset the winter wind struck with renewed chill he pulled his cloakdark red with the arms of the library of talastyre sewn in a badge at his left shoulder as befit a journeyman such as himselftighter and hurried even faster to keep up with the companion if youd let me ride we could get there faster wherever were going elidor muttered under his breath the companion stopped dead turning its head to regard him with an affronted expression apparently it had heard him it stood so still not even the silver bells on its harness jingled swishing its tail dangerously hesitantly elidor approached hed made the suggestion and it seemed he was to be taken up on it hesitantly he set his foot into the stirrup the librarians and scribes of talastyre had little need to learn horsemanship and certainly elidor had learned no equestrian skills before he came here nine years before but he could not resist the demand in that arrogant blue gaze any more than he could have turned back in the first place hesitantly elidor set his foot into the silver stirrup and heaved himself ungracefully onto the companions back it was the moment hed dreamed of the dream hed lived in and for so completely that the real world around him had seemed dim and unreal by comparison but now when he had it in his grasp it all seemed wrong as if he were straining to squeeze his feet into a pair of boots that didnt fit the companion hardly waited for him to settle himself before it took offat a much faster pace than before it was the companion rather than any skill of his own that kept the saddleleather beneath elidors rump the trees whipped past him in a blur and the wind that had been cold before turned to a thousand needles of ice seeking every opening they could find in his good wool tunic and heavy trousers he knew better than to reach for the reins and clutched with one hand at the edge of the saddle and with the other at his wildlyflapping cloak he barely had time to realize how acutelymiserable he wasand only think this was a heralds job to ride out in all seasons and all weathersbefore the companion stopped once more and again elidor had that sense of barelyrestrained impatience he scrambled from the companions back without even looking around and then saw he was in the middle of nowhere what he said aloud snow covered the ground but this was the main road and usually remained passable unless there was a major blizzard a few yards down the road he could see one of the shelterhuts built for emergency shelter in winter he frowned something about what he saw wasnt right the companion shoved him in the back ow elidor yelped staggering forward hed thought that in person companions would be the way they were in bookskind and loving and faithful but this one seemed a lot more like some of his teachers firmminded and impatient then he saw it something went off the road he saw the wheelruts in the snow they stopped short and went to the side of the roadnot the inside where anyone familiar with the countryside would pull off but the outside of the road where a screen of trees concealed the sloping hillside that led down to a little stream with the winter snow the extent of the dropoff and even the stream were hard to see elidor ran forward to where the tracks stopped he could see a coach down there lying on its sidea small one far too light for the road and the season there must be something down there though some reason a companion would come all the way into town and lead him back here you stay here he told the companion firmly speaking to it as if it were a large dog if you go down there youll break your neck theres ice and a stream understand he didnt stop to see whether hed insulted it but plunged down the hillside moving carefully through the snow he slipped and slid holding onto the trees for support and finally reached the bottom the snow was deeper here all the way to his knees and he moved through it carefully there was someone under the coach a man in heralds whitesthat was why elidor hadnt seen him before his spotless whites made him invisible against the snow elidor could see now that the coach had landed on a rock propping it up though his eyes were closed and his cowl pulled up covering most of his face so elidor couldnt see him clearly the man might still be alive herald sir elidor said hoarsely when he spoke the herald opened his eyes and pushed the cowl away from his face his skin was dark and his hair and eyes were black ah the herald said he managed to smile though elidor could see it cost him youre from the library yes sir herald sir im elidor your uh companion brought me i told him not to come down here and did he listen that would be a great marvel darrian rarely listens to anyone but i forget my manners im jordwen i am very pleased to make your acquaintance librarian elidor oh no sir herald jordwen sir im only a scribe and a journeyman anyway but you must be cold sir lying there in the snow he was babbling like an idiot and elidors ears flamed with the embarrassment of it and the shame of having thought even for a moment that the companion had come for him of course the companion was already bonded to a herald and of course if any companion were to come looking for elidor it would only be to seek help for its herald but in the strangest way mixed in with his feelings of humiliation and wild embarrassment was the oddest sort of relief we have to get you out of there ah there lies the difficulty jordwen said regretfully im afraid that when the blessed contraption fell on me it managed to tangle itself up with me in a way i havent yet unraveled id resigned myself to lying here until spring came and the birds built nests in my hair theres beauty in a meadow of course he was rattling on a little breathlessly and it occurred to elidor that whatever had happened to him it must hurt very much somehow that made his own fear and awkwardness go away look here herald sir do call me jordwen i dont think our discourse can survive many more heralds and sirs do you im small and theres space under the carriage elidor said ignoring the interruption i think i can get under there and see how youre pinned if youre willing i might be able to get you lose i think you must jordwen said and for all his languor there was steel beneath his words elidor pulled off his cloak and draped it over the herald like a blanket kneeling down beside him where the gap beneath the coach was deepest he began to dig and burrow tunneling his way beneath the coach alongside jordwens body he soon saw what was wrong when the coach had fallen jordwens foot had slipped between the spokes of one of the wheels it was twisted far to the side swollen to shapelessness the white leather of his boot ugly with blood elidor gulped swallowing bile he couldnt begin to imagine how much that hurt he slithered back out again jordwen was watching him and will i ever dance again on moonlit nights on green lawns with fair ladies ah for the perfumed air the gentle music of the harp your foots caught between two of the spokes of one of the cartwheels elidor announced trying not to listen to what either of them was saying i think the ankles broken i can work it free and then you can just slide out but its really going to hurt then give me a moment jordwen said i may seem to sleep but i assure you i wont be since i may be somewhat incapacitated may i beg a further favor yes of course herald siuh jordwen elidor stammered theres a shelter by the side of the roadyou will have seen it when darrian brought you here elidor nodded the driver and his passenger and the two coachhorsesdarrian will have brought them there for safekeeping after my disastrous and illconsidered attempt at coachrepair you will see them safe to talastyre if i cannot how could jordwen possibly think hed be doing anything after elidor got him out from under the coach elidor wondered aloud he said of course i will jordwen smiled then in just a few moments we will begin as elidor watched jordwen seemed to fall into a light sleep his eyes closed and his breathing deepened until once again he was as elidor had seen him first only the ache of cold roused him to his own task and once more he squirmed beneath the coach desperately careful not wanting to hurt the herald any more than he must he took the leg in both hands and eased it forward toward the edge of the wheel where the gap between the spokes was widest he still had to turn it to get it through though he was as careful and as gentle as he could be in the cramped and awkward space when at last he could lower the mangled leg gently to the snow he was trembling and covered in sweat now to get jordwen out from under the carriage when he crawled out from under the carriage again it was to confront darrian standing over jordwen nuzzling gently at his face elidor had the sense hed somehow intruded on a very private moment that he was watching something forever beyond his reach as if feeling automatically for a broken tooth he probed for feelings of jealousy and resentmentthe same feelings hed had when hearing the other children at the talastyre school speak of their families and their futuresbut for the first time they werent there but they ought to be there shouldnt they because this was a companion with his herald he was looking at what hed always wanted most wasnt he he put those thoughts aside there was work to be done jordwen was starting to rouse as his eyes fluttered open he gasped and grimaced then set his teeth against the pain yes i know he said answering a comment elidor hadnt heard but we cant always choosecan we he turned to elidor thank you for your help you were very brave me elidor shook his head we arent done yet i need to pull you out of there as to that jordwens voice was slightly breathless with the pain i think its time for darrian to start earning his keep if you can get my hand to his stirrup be careful elidor said quickly not sure to which of them he spoke theres a stream right behind you and i dont think its frozen through darrian shook his head and all the bells on his harness jingled he stepped daintily through the snow behind the herald onto the frozen stream the ice groaned beneath his silvershod hooves then gave way the companion turned and stamped until he had cleared a safe place to stand on the streambed then came up the bank again standing over jordwen so that his stirrup dangled above the heralds face carefully elidor guided jordwens hands to the stirrup though his own were nearly numb with the cold okay he said now darrian backed carefully into the stream again and elidor pushed making sure that no part of jordwen stuck or caught the heralds clothing had frozen to the snow and elidor winced in sympathy as it tore free but then jordwen was sitting up his good leg drawn up to his chest leaning against darrian who had come forward to support him wellserved for my vanity he said shakily regarding the bloodstained leg here journeyman elidor your cloak winter whites are much warmer i assure you when one is not lying in the snow you look blue with cold and only think if someone had to come and rescue you in turnwhy it would be like the tale of mistress masham and the goosegirls daughter by spring we would have all of talastyre here one by one each coming to rescue the one who had come to rescue the one before elidor grinned at the image as he took his cloak and wrapped it around himself again but the seriousness of their situation quickly sobered him he was strong for his age but he could not carry jordwen up the slope to the trailhut or even lift him to his companions back and there was no way under heaven the man could walk even a step but what now you may ask well if my good darrian will consent to humble himselfa great concession i do assure youand you will give me some trifling assistance we shall ride in style back to the road collect our dependents and be on our way yes of course elidor said dubiously the companion regarded him sternly elidor slipped his arm around jordwens back for support and the great white stallion moved away then slowly and carefully knelt in the snow a foot or so away now i to my feet jordwen said elidor scrambled around to his other side where the bad leg was and squatted beside him he got an arm beneath jordwens shoulders knowing how this was done and knowing he must do it well he must not slip he must not fall he must not fail now jordwen said softly and elidor rose to his feet cold muscles screamed with cramp but he ignored them he clutched jordwen hard against his side pulling with all his wiry strength a strength honed by years of working among the heavy volumes of talastyre to his surprise he and the herald were much of a height notmuchfarthernow jordwen gasped his bronze skin had an ashy tint elidor shifted his grip to the heralds belt and half lifted half dragged him through the snow to his companion the bad leg scraped against the drifts there was no way to stop it and elidor heard jordwens breath catch in ragged sobs starting tears in his own eyes when they reached darrian it was all elidor could do to deposit jordwen upon his back sideways as if the saddle were a chair this wont do jordwen said after a long moment with a brave attempt at his usual light tones ififif he puts his head down elidor said amazed at his own presumption i could lift your bad leg over i think but but it will hurt jordwen finished for him with the ghost of a smile still i think it will work what say you my friend the last remark hadnt been addressed to him elidor realized darrian stretched his neck out as far as it would go and laid his head against the snow the position looked awkward elidor hurried around to the companions other side and gently reached for jordwens leg he slid his hands beneath it above and below the knee and raised it high flexing it like the joints of a doll and swiveled it toward him across darrians neck until jordwen sat astride the saddle darrian raised his head quickly with a huff of relief you have good hands the herald said gentle and deft scribes have to have good hands elidor said still holding jordwens leg so that the heel didnt have to rest against the snow he was proud of being a scribe he realized he was good at it and it wasnt something everyone could do he put the thought aside for later consideration i dont think you should try to put your foot in the stirrup he said gravely that surprised a shaky laugh from jordwen bless you i am through with rash mistakes for today darrian got carefully to his feet there was a line of snow melted into the companions coat as even as the waterline of a boat elidor stared at it with a scholars fascination they really are whiterthan snow and now to our charges jordwen said but i can no they are my responsibility jordwen interrupted sharply again there was that sense of a conversation elidor couldnt hear and jordwen shook his head youre right of course my apologies journeyman elidor my incivility is precious little thanks for all your aid if you are jordwen then i am elidor elidor said trembling at his own amazing boldness at speaking to a herald so ill meet you at the top he said to cover his embarrassment he turned quickly away and hurried back along his own tracks up the side of the hill darrian took a longer path finding a gentler slope so they reached the trailhut at the same time since jordwen was manifestly unable to dismount it was elidor who pushed open the door two carriagehorses stood placidly in one corner gazing at him incuriously in the other sitting on a bench was a large man in a heavy driving cloak and beside him a small child of perhaps four or five her face red and swollen with tears are you with the rescue party the man demanded truculently its about timeive been cooped up with this squalling brat for hours and you are elidor asked meachum jobcoachman hired to deliver mistress vonarre to the library at talastyre and ive had a time of it i tell youfirst one of the horses went lame then the coach lost a wheel and then some fool of a herald came along and made matters worse you havent had as bad a time as mistress vonarre or that fool of a herald has had ignoring the man he went over to the girl and knelt before her hello sweetheart are you mistress vonarre she looked at him blue eyes made enormous with tears and nodded lip trembling im elidor i live at the library there are a lot of little girls there who want to be your friend ill be your friend too and right now theres a herald outside i bet hell even let you say hello to his companion darrian would you like that and then well go to talastyre what about the rescue party meachum demanded there is no rescue party elidor said over his shoulder his attention focused on the little girl got no parents vonarre said hiccupping on a sob and its cold well it wont be cold soon elidor said and do you know what i havent got any parents either but there are wonderful things at the library books with beautiful pictures all full of stories ill show you now come on he scooped her up into his arms and carried her outside her eyes widened when she saw darrian again and she reached out to touch him though hed been standoffish with elidor darrian lowered his muzzle into her hand and allowed her to stroke him she seemed to forget most of her troubles at the sight of the companion and elidor could understand why they were wonderful magical creatures but he didnt want one he wanted the life he had he was proud of the life he had he looked up at jordwen the herald smiled as if he could guess most of elidors thoughts its not for everyone you know jordwen said softly i do now is that why darrian came for me in a different way than a companion would come for his chosen but one that had made just as much of a difference to elidor could be he had to get someone before i froze to death and oddly enough not just anyone will go off with one of us and i assume you sent a message to the library sure it might take a while its midwinter ah you lose track of things on the road well give her here wed best go and meet them sweetheart how would you like to be able to tell your children you once rode a real live companion elidor asked this is herald jordwen jordwen here is mistress vonarre i am most pleased to make your acquaintance mistress vonarre jordwen said in his most courtly tones no one would have guessed that the man was freezing and injured elidor handed vonarre up to him then went back into the shelter as he did he heard the faint jingle of silver bells as darrian started down the road at a slow walk come if youre coming elidor said with determined cheerfulness to the unpleasant coachman as he gathered up the horses bridlereins its a long walk to town and better with company you cant expect me to walk the man said in astonishment its freezing out there and were miles from town if that fool of a herald hadnt put my coach over the cliff we could ride in comfort ill sue the college for damages you see if i dont sharp words rose to elidors tongue but he didnt say them if jordwen could be kind and forgiving to a journeyman scribe while lying cold and injured elidor could certainly keep his temper with a blustering fool im sorry perhaps you can ride one of the horses they should be sending someone to look for us but if they dont at least well reach talastyre by dark they had gone less than half a mile when they were met by the master librarians own coach and a dozen outriders and elidor jordwen vonarre and meachum finished the journey safe and warm several of the outriders went on ahead so everything was waiting for them when they reached the city gates suddenly shy elidor slipped away in the confusion before anyone could think to speak to him and hurried to his rooms as one of the journeymen he had a semiprivate room of his own and caleanth was home with his family at festival time it was odd to think now that he had grudged his fellow journeyman that when he had all of talastyre for his own as much his kingdom as any princes no one is too young to be a foolor too old either he thought thinking of meachum but surely the coachmans greatest crime had been only that he had been thinking too much of his own troubleshe had gone quite satisfyingly white when the outriders from the library had lifted jordwen into the carriage to finish out the journey his leg in a makeshift brace and bandage and there had been no more talk of foolish heralds he stood for a while gazing out the window at the buildings of the library and scriptorium its stone dark silver in the winter twilight imagine being on the road so many days you didnt know it was midwinter and then having to spend most of the festival pinned beneath a broken coach only to be halfrescued by a weteared journeyman with a dreamstuffed head elidor smiled ruefully at the thought then went to the chest at the foot of his bed opened it and withdrew his oldest and longestprized possession the white paint was worn away in spots showing the wood beneath but the tiny blue glass eyes were still as bright as were the tiny beads that stood in for the silver bells on the painted harness of the carved wooden companion he kissed the small wooden toy gently on the forehead saying goodbye to a dream that had served him well then tucked the toy into a pocket in his cloak and went to do something he should have done long ago he walked across the quadrangle to the infirmary the herald would be in the hands of the healers of course but mistress infirmerer was a reliable source of all gossip at the library and he hoped to find where little vonarre had been taken but to his surprise the first person he encountered upon entering the infirmary precincts was the mistress of girls lady kendra as he lingered in an outer room uncertain of how far to go exploring she came through a doorway and advanced upon him heavy skirts swishing so here is our hero she said keeping her voice low elidor ducked his head feeling awkward it was one thing to do what was needed he realized and quite another to hear about it later i came to see mistress vonarre he said lady kendras expression softened poor mite to come such a long way and at this time of year and sent like a parcel of old clothes to the ragman her that wasnt to come until a year springyou may be sure that yon coachman will have a better care for the next child he must bring such a distance and a pox upon him lady kendras eyes flashed and she took a deep breath but a hot bath and a bowl of soup mends much and i will sit with her until she sleeps she will soon settle in tomorrow we will send someone to the wreck to bring back her things and the letter that will undoubtedly explain all from her tone it was clear the mistress of girls doubted the explanation would satisfy her i can go with them i know where it is elidor said but ive brought her a present its midwinter can i give it to her ill stay with her if you like lady kendra looked surprised but the expression passed so quickly that elidor wasnt quite sure hed seen it well then do but mind she drinks her milk theres a sleeping posset in it i will elidor promised he went through the door the mistress of girls indicated there was a table with a small lamp burning on it and a wooden cup beside it beside the bed that took up most of the space in the room was a wooden stool vonarre was sitting up in bed she had been scrubbed and her hair brushed out and dressed in a thick flannel nightshirt just as any traveler whose things had been lost might be elidor loosened his cloak and sat down beside her bed she smiled when she saw him hopefully as ifjust perhapsthe world was not terrible after all the books hed read spoke of breaking hearts and of the pain they caused and its curious joy but in all their stories never once had elidor read of the comforting pain of a heart that mends though he knew he felt it now thank you jordwen thank you darrian he reached into his cloak ive brought you a midwinter present he said offering the carved companion to the child this was mine when i was little i think youll like it his name is darrian vonarre said firmly clutching the wooden horse against her chest shall i tell you a story elidor said he picked up the wooden mug and held it out drink your milk and i will once long agoa long long time ago there was a companion named darrian who was the partner of a herald named vonarre sun in glory by mercedes lackey mercedes lackey is a fulltime writer and has published numerous novels including the bestselling heralds of valdemar series she is also a professional lyricist and a licensed wild bird rehabilitator sunset was long past the light in his study came from the lanterns high on the wall behind him the floortoceiling stainedglass window on the other side of the room was a dark panel spiderwebbed with lead channels it formed a somber backdrop behind the two men seated across from herald alberich the weaponmaster to the trainees of all three collegia at haven in the kingdom of valdemar coughed to punctuate the silence in his quarters he regarded his second visitor who was ensconced in one of his austere but comfortable wooden chairs with a skeptical gaze his first visitor he knew very well dressed in his robes of office saffron and cream mildmannered balding gerichen the chief priest of vkandis sunlord here in haven not that anyone knew gerichens temple prudently called only the temple of the lord of light was of vkandis sunlord at least not unless you were a karsite exile of which there were a surprising number in valdemarsurprising at least to alberich even now gerichen had been born here but most of his fellowship had not been and karse did not easily let loose its children even if all it wanted of them was to reduce them to ashes yet year by year season by season for decades it seemed karses children had been slipping over the border into valdemar beating down their fear of the demonlovers because real death bayed hot at their heels and the possibility of demons seemed preferable to the certainty of the fires of purification some couldnt bear the fear of the things that the priestmages in the name of the god of course sent to howl about their doors of a night some came because the redrobes had taken or had threatened to take a child or spouseeither to absorb into the priesthood or to burn as a protowitch and amazingly enough to alberich some of them came because he had dared to so many years ago alberich had met gerichen longer ago than he cared to think about when he was first a heraldtrainee and gerichen a mere novice both of them were older than they liked to admit except over a drink in front of a cozy fire late of an evening gerichen was one of a very small company of folk who had supported alberichs presence in valdemar from the very beginning the other visitor sitting beneath the left eye of the stainedglass image of vkandis as a sun in glory that formed the outer wall of alberichs study was someone that alberich knew not at all though he knew far more about this fellow than the man probably suspected he was here at gerichens request he was also here if not illegally certainly covertly for he was a priestmage of vkandis sunlord in karse there had not been one of those on valdemaran soil in centuries there had not been one on valdemaran soil as anything other than an invader in far longer karsesworn enemy of valdemar for so long that very few even knew it had once been a peaceful neighbor had been alberichs home karse was ruled in fact if not in name by a theocracy who called the heralds demons and were pledged to eradicate them and of that theocracy the ruling priests the priestmages and the priests who had clawed their way up through the ranks were the true aristocracy of karse answerable only to one authority the son of the sun whountil very recently at leasthad called alberich himself the great traitor for not only deserting his post as captain of a company of vkandis holy army but for turning witch and joining the ranks of the demonriders of valdemar and worse rising to a position of such trust that witchqueen selenay counted him among her most valued advisers the priestmages were not only the voices of vkandis they had the power to summon and control demons themselvesnot that they called such creatures demons not even among themselves preferring to refer to them as the dark servants or vkandis furies all in vkandis name of course or so they said all at the behest of vkandis himself or so they claimed one of those voices had condemned alberich to death by burning and all because hed had the temerity to make use of a witchpower and save the inhabitants of a karsite border village from certain slaughter by a band of outlaws never mind that hed had no more control over that socalled witchpower than he had over a raging storm had never asked for that power and would have given it up without a moment of hesitation but the current son of the sunthe newly chosen son of the sunwas not of the same stamp as all of those who had preceded her and the voice that sat beneath vkandis left eye was not at all like the arrogant cold priest who had pronounced sentence on alberich that day he was young surprisingly so it would hardly be politic for him to be clad in the red robes of his office here in the heart of a land that was his enemys but in ordinary clothing that would not disgrace a moderately prosperous merchant he had an aura of calm authority that set him apart even from gerichen he was short stocky cleanshaven his whiteblond hair was as closecropped as that of all sunpriests with keen eyes as blue as those of any companion set in a face whose planes might have been cut by a chisel and yetnot cold that face alive and curiously accepting beside alberich on the other side of the fireplace sat heraldchronicler myste she regarded the two priests with a gaze as penetrating as that of the visitors and perhaps more uncanny at least to the stranger since her hazel eyes looked at him through a pair of round glass lenses that magnified what was behind them giving her an owllike stare myste was the official historian of heralds collegium the heraldchronicler and had been since she finished her internship she had a facility with words that would have suited her to the job had she not had other handicaps that kept her out of the field myste had been as odd a herald in her way as alberich she had always from the moment she arrived been shockingly shortsighted and had never been assigned to field work on account of itnot the best notion to put someone in the field whose precious glass goggles could be lost or broken rendering her the next thing to blind perhaps that was why she had always been alberichs friend when you cant see what people are like on the outside shed once said in her blunt manner you stop even considering appearances and concentrate on everything else that was among other reasons why myste was here tonight alberich coughed again and exactly it is to what that i owe the honor of your presence he asked stressing the word honor in such a way that implied it was anything but he spoke valdemaran not karsite the stranger cast a mild glance at myste could one ask why the lady is present he repliedin karsite not valdemaran i am the heraldchronicler and i am here to record this meeting at the request of herald alberich myste said for herselfin flawless karsite not valdemaran shed learned it from alberich of course but she owed her accent to her own exacting ear for languages to alberichs surprise the stranger smiled excellent he said with every appearance of approval would it be too much to ask for a copy for myselfand to conduct this discussion in my own tongue my command of yours is in nowise as good as yours clearly is of mine his smile was sudden charming dazzling evenand apparently genuine alberich and myste exchanged more than a glance i dont sense any falsehood myste mindspoke her unique gift was a strictly limited ability to truthsense without the use of a spell she could only concentrate on one person at a time and had to be within an armslength or two of him though which again rendered it less than useful in the field but their socalled priestly attributes are no more nor less than our gifts he reminded her what if he can block you a purely mental shrug then what i sense is meaningless on the other hand howmany people know my giftand of those how many are outside the heraldic circle orwould guess id be here at your request not many he had to admit that surely no matter how good the karsite spies were they didnt know that about myste or would think to warn this man against her i think if only for the purposes of clarity we should conduct our discussion in karsite he replied and i will be pleased to provide a copy myste added smoothly the visitor smiled again before we begin then will you introduce me to the lady herald alberich the word herald sounded strange in the middle of a karsite sentence they didnt have a word for herald it sounded even stranger spoken without a curse appended heraldchronicler myste this is magepriest hierophant karchanek alberich said solemnly he couldnt resist a slight smile of his own as karchanek started just a little while poor gerichens eyes practically bulged out of his head i assume i have given your title correctly quite correctly karchanek replied recovering since he hadnt given alberich his title and gerichen didnt know it he must be wondering how alberich got itand from whom your borders are not as secure as you think alberich told the man silently but of course one single karsite priest would not have come here unescorted into the heart of the enemys capital if he was not the equivalent of a oneman army karchanek probably could fight his way out of this room using his own deadly skills wreaking considerable havoc as he did so and might even escape if he could outrun the alarm he definitely could slip out of his quarters at gerichens temple be they ever so closely guarded and make his way past just about anything alberich could throw at him to get home karchanek commanded magic real magicthe magic that valdemar hadnt seen for centuries until this current war with hardorn he might be the most powerful priestmage that karse had seen in centuries save only the son of the sun and the son of the sun had sent him here to speak with alberich the great traitor karchanek pursed his lips i find myself wondering if i can tell you anything that you do not already know he said at last alberich leaned back in his chair i am a man of great patience he replied i have no particular objection to hearing something more than once begin at the beginning the beginning mused karchanek then smiled again ah then you will have to have great patience for the beginning the true beginning lies with the son of the sun may vkandis hold her at zenith solaris who has been and is my friend as well as my superior alberich was very glad of his ability to don an inscrutable cardsharpers face for he surely needed that mask to hide his eagerness solaris now there was a person no one knew much about here in valdemarand someone whom they all desperately needed to know everything about but he kept his mask in place the new son of the sun he observed dryly the female son of the sun just to pair female with son of the sun would have been a blasphemy so profound a few years ago that the speaker would not only have been burned but his ashes mixed with salt his lands plowed under his wife and children sacrificed his ancestors dug up and reburied in a potters field and every trace that he had ever lived at all utterly eradicated karchaneks smile broadened and he spread his hands wide even so and so crowned by vkandis sunlord he made the sign of the holy disk himself with his own hands perhaps you had heard of this some alberich admitted rumors tales that seemed particularly wild not so this i witnessed along with thousands of others and do believe me herald alberich it was no delusion no trick of magic or mind no clever artifice with a moving statue though the statue did move it was no mere trumpery with a cleverly hinged arm the image arose from his throne walked lithe and manlike and took the crown from his own head to place it upon that of solaris which shrank as he put it there to fit herexactly i saw it i have held that very crown in my two hands and he paused again there is a thing not many would know about save the handful of novices sent to polish the image entire one of which i was and the only one among them to polish the crown which task i owe to my habit of squirreling up the cloister walls into the cloister orchard round about when the plums were ripe his eyes twinkled and myste hid a grin at the back of the crown upon the image there was a lozenge no bigger than my palm and quite invisible from below where the sculptor the gilder and the jewel smith set their marks that lozenge and those marks are upon the back of the crown that solaris now wears interesting alberich began still skeptical for a truly clever fraud would have taken that into account and made sure to replicate every oddity and imperfection in the crown worn by the great image and someone who was solaris friend as well as her supporter would probably swear that the sun had stood still in the heavens for a day in order to lend more strength to her claim to the sun throne but karchanek was not finished nay there is more for has the sunlord in his wisdom not granted her direct counsel in the form ofa firecat karchaneks brows arched and well they might a firecat the words were almost forced from him alberich had not been a scholarly man but even children knew all the tales of the miraculous avatars of vkandis and most karsite children played at reulan and the firecat the way valdemaran children played at heralds and companions butfirecats are legend merely karchanek shook his head emphatically no more one walks by her side and sits at her council table and when he chooses which is seldom lets his thoughts be known to those around solaris as well as to the son of the sun herself karchanek sat back just a little a smile of satisfaction playing on his lips he has in fact deigned to address a word or two to me it was a remarkable experience hearing someone speak inside ones head although i imagine that you heralds are so used to such a thing from your own companions by now that you take it as commonplace that was a shrewd shottelling them that he knew not only that companions werent horses or demons but that they mindspoke to their heralds is he saying thisfirecatmindspeaks myste asked incredulously well if it was a real firecat that would be the least of its talents if there was no reason to doubt it without a firecat the living breathing and very present symbol of vkandis favor solaris could not have lasted a month like a companion yes andpresumably gets its wisdom from the same source there have been reforms of late in the ranks of the sunpriests alberich ventured solaris reforms it is said now karchanek actually laughed reformsyes one could call them reformsin the same way that one could refer to the razing of a robbers stronghold as a little housecleaning not even solaris can root out all the corruption of centuries but the cleansing has begun then he sobered the fires the summoning of demons the terrorizing of our own people all these are no more and there is something that should die with them the enmity between karse and valdemar well there it was the offer that alberich had been hoping for but was still not certain he should trust we seem to be facing the same enemy he pointed out ancar of hardorn hardorn can devour us separately united we will be too tough a morsel to swallow agreed the other and there is no surety on your part that once he is disposed of we will not turn back to our old ways and warfares but but hear the words of the son of the sun karchanek brought out a thin metal tube from within his sleeve in diameter no larger than an arrow shaft he opened it and removed a sheet of paper so thin that alberich could see the writing on it from the opposite side greetings to captain alberich now herald of valdemar loyal son of two warringlands karchanek read aloud i solaris son of the sun by the grace of vkandis sunlordsend these words to you and not to the queen who holds your allegiance because thecounsel of the sunlord is that one with a heart divided will be more like to lend heed to thatwhich promises division will be healed than one who is singlehearted to you i say thiswithout karse valdemar may fall and without valdemar karse may perish yet to uniteour peoples more than words on a treaty are needed all overtures were like to come tonaught or be concluded too late so i brought my prayers to the sunlord and the sunlordhas said this unto me bring me a herald of valdemar that i may make of her a priest ofmy order in the sight of all that none may doubt or dare to prosecute a war which isabomination in my sight alberich suddenly found it hard to breathe and myste gasped openly with karchaneks eyes on him he forced himself to take a breath forced himself to think think about this offer so strange and so unexpected and when he managed to get his mind focused one thing leaped out at him you read solaris words exactly he demanded his voice harsher than he intended exactly karchanek averred and there is just a little more he cleared his throat and went on and when the sunlord had said this to me i bowed before his will i shallsend my trusted envoy with all speed i pledged but he had not finished not any herald for so great a trust not any herald can bridge this gap between our peoples he said untome send thou to the one they call the great traitor for only his tongue will be trusted and say that i require they send the one who stands at the queens right hand say that i call upon the queens own to join my service and be a bridge between our peoples and so he leftme and so i have done by my hand and seal solaris son of the sun the last words fell like pebbles into an abyss of silence as alberich gave over any effort to keep his face expressionless his mind was a total blank if anyone had told him that these words would ever be spoken between karsite and valdemaran hed have sent for the mindhealers insane impossible gods dont ask for much myste said into the silence do they i will leave this with you karchanek said solemnly rerolling the neartransparent paper and inserting it in its metal tube handing it to alberich who took it numbly there are other sureties i have that i will bring to you later i understand that you have a kind of magic that can determine if one is telling the truth and i beg that you will tell your queen that i submit to such willingly this is no trivial thing we ask of you he stood up and gerichen belatedly did the same you will know where to find me when you are ready without asking leavenot that alberich could have given it at the momenthe and gerichen walked out alberich stared at the metal cylinder in his hands foresight myste said firmly we need someone with foresight she started to get to her feet but alberich shook his head at her eldan and kero these are who we need first of all he countered his own foresight limited as it was hadnt even warned him that this was coming then again would it it only tells me about disaster looming not if something goodis going to happen small wonder he was a pessimist by nature i shall get themif they are where i think none other would be paid heed to he continued handing the cylinder to myste if you so kind would be would you with a scholars eye look this over for tampering i can try myste said dubiously but i dont exactly have a lot of karsite documents to compare to itor anything in solaris hand either but she unrolled the document and bent her lenses over it much to alberichs relief he didnt want her haring off to the collegium in search of someone with foresight and letting fall any hints of this evenings revelations at least not until she had gotten over her own shock and regained a chroniclers necessary dispassion for the situation heraldcaptain kerowyn was the logical choice to be informed since she was practically in the lord marshals back pocket and as for herald eldanwell that worthy was alberichs source of information on karse and the goingson there not to put too fine a point upon it eldan was a spy and but for a single slip had never once alerted even the priestmages to his true identity kero wasnt in her quarters neither she nor eldan were particularly pleased when alberich interrupted them by pounding insistently in a coded knock on eldans door i dont smell smoke and the collegium isnt on fire so this had better be at least that important alberich kero growled cracking the door only enough so that alberich caught a glimpse of tousled hair and an angry blue eye in the light of a hall candle it is he said a friendly visit i have had fromgerichs outkingdom visitor kero blinked friendly she said dubiously very friendly unbelievably friendly this cannot wait until morning i think it should not wait a candlemark right i heard that said eldans voice from deeper in the room give us a little well be right on your heels and meet you in your rooms at the salle outside of the queens suite youve got the most secure quarters in the complex alberich nodded and left them to put themselves back together in peace poor kero eldan was only just back from his latest covert foray into karsewhich was how alberich had known just who karchanek really wasand already business had interrupted their time together but when had that not been the case with a herald add to which kerowyn had been the captain of her own guild mercenary company so she should be used to being interrupted by now she might not like it but she should be used to it shes been amercenary for twice as long as shes been a herald business always comes first for them he told himself in fact when they arrived at his door he doubted there would be a single word said about what hed just interrupted nor was there and the pair were as eldan had said just about on his heels he wasnt more than half of the way back to the salle when he looked back and saw the two whiteclad figures emerging from heralds wing hed barely gotten inside his own door and heard from myste that if there had been any tampering with the missive she couldnt find it when they arrived at his door as neatly turnedout as if theyd just come from standing guard at a court ceremony alberich explained the situation to them in a few terse sentences and handed over the letter and its tube kero examined the tube eldan who was second only to alberich and myste in his mastery of karsite scanned it quickly and whistled well that explains something he said why on this last time even the most reactionary of the oldguard were being very careful to be good little boys and if they had any complaints about the new son of the sun keeping them behind their own teeth alberich shook his head understand i do not he confessed its quite simple and a bit scary old man eldan replied handing the letter on to kero as they both took the seats so recently vacated by the visitors from karse id heard all the stories about solaris but i hadnt talked to any eyewitnessesnot that it would be likely i could since my contacts dont reside in such lofty circles still the stories were all of a piece and the sunpriests were suddenly all acting like theyd put heart and soul into the reform movement karchaneks eyewitness account just clinches it he glanced over at kero doesnt it love kerowyn nodded no doubt in my mind wherever hes been for the last couple of hundred years vkandis is back now in karse and hes cracking heads and taking names just like the stareyed remember ive seen this before in my grandmothers shinain clan she pursed her lips thoughtfully mind the stareyed usually operates through her spiritriders and avatars but maybe thats what this firecat is a spiritrider equivalent alberich went very very still of all the things he had hoped for to happen in karse this if true was the best and the least likely it might be frightening for valdemarans who had no history of direct intervention by their gods but for a karsite this would be the return of things to their proper ways ways long since lost beneath the centuries of rule by a corrupt and cruel priesthood you are certain he asked carefully ive heard all of keros stories and factoring in the atmosphere down there right nowwell im as certain as i can be without walking into the temple there and demanding solaris conjure up a miracle to prove it to me eldan said firmly not that id give that approach a try from what ive heard of the lady shes got a pretty dry sense of humor and might decide to ask vkandis to teach me a little proper humility alberich closed his eyes for a moment what exactly is one supposed to do when the prayers of a lifetime are so fully answered be properly grateful said his companion kantor and dont question why it hastaken the god so long to act that wouldnt be a good idea kantors reply startled him further this statement from a companion had a weight that went far beyond the simple words there was probably something about free will involved alberich replied voicing the thoughts that had occurred to him in the dark of the night and making our ownmistakes free will figured largely in the theology of the older textsthe ones dating from before the son of the sun became the tacit ruler of all karse and the priesthood began conjuring demons to enforce their will and just possibly there was something about waiting to be properly asked to stepin prayers of the faithful and all that kantor amended gods dont go where they arentinvited not the ones wed call good anyway after all as long as people seemed to becontent to putting up with things as they were there would be no reason for vkandis tointervene that would be the free will part alberich reminded his companion kantor ignored the interruption vkandis i suspect has been dealing withwrongdoers on an individual basis once they died and were in his hands and in noposition to dispute the error of their ways i suppose even a god who intervenes regularlyin the lives of his people cannot build a paradise in the world since everyone would havea different idea of what paradise should be but then again i could be wrong alberich found that last statement difficult to believe oh perhaps another companion could be wrong but kantor had never so much as missed a single hoofstep in all the time alberich had known him kantor never spoke unless he had something of import to say and companions were not unlike firecats could they as it was said of the firecats be able to pass the sincere prayer directly into the ear of a god his prayer his god what was it that kantor had saidthe prayers of the faithful was this in part due to him no he would not even think that coincidence merely and he would confine himself to rejoicing that things had changed in his lifetime events had turned to the redemption of his land a new son of the sun more like in spirit to those of the old days sat on the sun throne and if he could trust this overture then perhaps there would be peace between valdemar and karse as there had been in the old days the times he had read about in longforgotten histories in the queens library if it wasnt all a cunning trap if he could somehow convince herald talia who had already been through more than anyone should have to endure to walk into the wolfs mouth a second time it isnt talia youll have to convince observed kantor shrewdly but her husband and the queen oh yes there was dirk to convince as well and selenay neither of whom were going to be as ready to agree to this as talia if you and kantor are quite finished kerowyn said with heavy irony interrupting his thoughts the rest of us would like to actually discuss this out loud eldan added alberich leveled a glance at them that would have made any of his pupils quiver where they stood but of course eldan wasnt a trainee anymore and hed faced worse than alberich over his breakfast fire day in and day out for the past five years and of course kerowyn never had been his pupil so there went that particular hold out the window with a sigh he sat down and the discussion began in earnest it as going to be more than a discussion when it finally got to the queenit was going to be a battle and alberich was not going to go to that battle less than fully armed in the end it was karchanek who won the battle which was shorter than alberich would have been willing to believe perhaps things were more desperate than he had thought where hardorn was concerned he made his case to selenay to hear karchanek out supported by kero and eldan then didnt learn anything more until karchanek himself came to tell him that selenay had agreed alberich didnt hear as much of what went on in council sessions anymore now that kerowyn with young herald jeri as her assistant was taking over many of the duties he had performed but for selenay and for her father that had only meant he hadnt needed to sit through the candlemarks of arguments for and against the invitation rightly or wrongly this had been one session that selenay had decided he especially should not participate in no matter karchanek had been his own best advocate once selenay actually heard him out perhaps his two most persuasive points had been that he himself would remain in selenays hands as a hostage and that alberich himself and one other herald should go with her kero had objected to that putting herself up as alberichs substitute but this was one duty he had no intention of giving over to kerowell for one thing as she assumed his role he became more expendable and she less so for another there was no one living in valdemar who could read his fellow countrymen as well as he could he stood now beside karchanek who was arrayed in one of gerichens borrowed robes beneath a slightly overcast summer sky in of all places companions field beside a hastily erected archway of brickwork it lacked only two days to midsummer the longest day of the year and so the most auspicious for vkandis the day appointed forwell alberich didnt quite know what solaris hadnt given anyone any indication of just what was going to happen other than talia being invested into the ranks of the sunpriests maybe solaris herself didnt know but midsummer was when it was going to happen and somehow karchanek was going to get them there for it talia had been here for a candlemark rolan beside her both of them arrayed and packed for traveling kantor stood beside rolan calm and serene as usual and in nowise intimidated by the presence of the king stallion of the companion herd beside him was dirks companion with dirk fiddling nervously with girth and stirrups there was also a crowd of heralds companions and interested parties surrounding them in a rough circle that was a prudent distance from the innocuous brick arch no one knew what karchanek was going to do they only knew that it would be the first real demonstration of magic within the city of haven forcenturies and when the holy firecat senses that i am reaching with my signature power toward him karchanek was explaining to jeri as he had already explained to talia dirk selenay and everyone else who was involved in making this decision he will open the gate between us exactly as if he was burning a tunnel through a mountain to avoid having to climb and descend to reach the other side and you cant do that alone jeri asked he shook his head only one of adept power can open a gate alone and then well it is better that it be done by two or more such adepts and then only to a place that has been prepared as i have prepared this archway one cannot simply make a gate into nothing or into a place where one has never been and the farther one is from the place where one wishes to gate to the more power it takes to make the gate i cannot do that no ten adepts in karseif we had ten and not merely myself and solariscould do it i provide only an anchoring point it will be the firecat who creates this gate i suppose jeri brooded thats the only reason why youve never gated in behind our lines with an army karchanek shrugged power lack of familiarity with the place and that there are very very few adepts the order as it was distrusted mages and the more power they had the less they were trusted those who manifested great power and demonstrated an ability to think for themselves often met with unfortunate accidents or fell victim to the white demons so it was said and ancar jeri asked soberly could learn this has he those who will teach him karchenek replied grimly never doubt it he as were some of the worst of the sunpriests of the past is not limited in power by what he can channel naturally he can and has and will channel bloodmagic which has no limits other than the number of people that one can kill yet another reason why this alliance is so vital vital enough that i will remain here whatever it costs me hostage to the son of the suns good behavior although he didnt have to finish that statement karchanek looked like a man haunted by his own personal set of demons in a way apparently he was according to kerowyn whod had mages in her skybolts company that hadnt been able to bear what happened to them when they crossed into valdemar the reason why there were no real mages in this land was because they couldnt stand being here the moment anyone worked real magic heresomething happened somethinga lot of somethings evidentlyswarmed over the mage and gathered around him night and day and stared at him now that didnt sound too dreadful to alberich until hed had a chance to see what the experience was doing to karchaneks nerves and thought about it himself what would it be like to have dozens perhaps hundreds of people around you all the time never taking their eyes off you glaring at you by light and dark sleeping or waking nerveracking that was what it was and when the creatures were invisible to everyone else there was no equivalent to the queens own in solaris court but karchanek was closelifelong friend and supporter powerful mage on whom she depended for able advice that he pledged to remain as hostage was probably the o nly reason why in the end this plan had been agreed to and what do we do to keep you from spiriting yourself away selenay had asked sharply when he first made the proposition himself he had shrugged whatever you please bind me blindfold me keep in me a darkened room drug me if no other solution presents itself whatever makes you certain of me selenay had taken him at his word there was a small cup of some drug or other waiting in a pages hands for the moment when the gate came down again karchanek would be drugged until the morning of the ceremony then watched like a hawk until the moment when the firecat would call him and use him reopen the gate to valdemar this time in the full presence of every important person in karse at the high temple itself and send talia and her escort home he didnt seem at all unhappy about that the truth he said to jeri when she asked him about that herself i will welcome it to sleep oblivious to all the vrondi eyes upon me i could ask no greater boon at this moment they do not just watch you know they talk at me sometimes but mostly among themselves it is not just the eyes upon me it is the chatter the droning babble that never stills and never ends that i cannot understand he shuddered and alberich saw with an easing of his worries that a faint expression of sympathy flitted over selenays face sympathyfor a karsite other than alberich a good omen but one he didnt have time to contemplate already karchanek approached the brickwork archway and he had warned alberich that not even a firecat could maintain a gate at this distance for too long they would barely have time to get through it as a lowly captain of the border guard he had never actually seen any priestly magic being performed other than the simple act of kindling fire on vkandis altar hed only heard the howls of the spectral creatures conjured to harry witches and evildoers through the night he couldnt bear to watch it now perhaps one day when hed had a chance to become accustomed to the idea of magic being used for anything other than harm but not now not when his nerves were singing with the need to act and he feared that if he watched karchanek a man he would like to think of as a friend one day he might see the priestmage calling a demon so he busied himself with kantors tack and when the signal came he mounted in a rush and drove through the gate with his eyes closed hard on rolans heels there was a long long moment then of terrible cold then boneshaking nausea and the horrible sensation that he was falling through a starless endless bottomless night it seemed to last forever but kantors steady presence in his mind held him as it had held him during the long slow agony of healing from his terrible burns when kantor had rescued him and brought him here to safety and a new life then he was not here anymore but therein karse sun blazed down upon him and the others a sun fierce and kind at the same time they stood their companions bridle bells chiming softly as they fidgeted in the middle of a bonewhite courtyard surrounded on all four sides by enclosing walls before them waited a cat and a woman the cat was the size of a large dog with a brickred mask ears paws and tail shading to a handsome cream on the body and piercing blue eyes a firecat indeed i am said a voice in his mind with a touch of satisfied purr behind it myname is hansa and this of course is solaris welcome home herald alberich i second that sentiment echoed the woman she had presence that entirely eclipsed her appearance if alberich had not already known that her eyes were a goldenbrown subject to changing as her mood changed and her hair a darker goldenbrown he would not have been able to tell anyone that if he turned around and took his eyes off her yes the firecat was impressiveany feline that came up to his knee would be impressive much less one like hansa and the faint golden glow that surrounded each hair certainly didnt hurt but solaris had that same golden glow about her and a great deal more measuring by eye she was certainly no taller than selenay and much shorter than alberichbut she somehow loomed larger than that you i do hope herald talia are she said in slow and deliberate valdemaran to talia who had dismounted she held out her hand and talia stepped forward and took it and both of them smiled identical warm smiles that managed to humanize solaris without diminishing her impressiveness by a whit and this the formidable herald dirk would be she inquired with a slight lift of one eyebrow that somehow had the effect of making dirk flush there were no servants no lesser priests there was no one but solaris and hansahansa who solaris scooped up with an effort and held draped over her arms for despite the firecats aplomb he seemed exhausted it was solaris who escorted them to their rooms indicating with a simple nod of her head that the companions should come also she brought them down quiet white corridors lit from above by skylights and ornamented at intervals with great suninglory disks on walls and inlaid in the floors the rooms were simple probably priests quarters dirk and talia shared one with alberich in the nextand most interesting a kind of rough boxstall hockdeep in fresh straw took up about half of each of the rooms kantor went directly to his with a shake of his head after a long and searching look at their chosen rolan and dirks little mare went to theirs and here my own suite is said solaris throwing open the next door which differed not at all from theirs some changes i made when they were mine alberich could well imagine solaris predecessor had been one of the worst in the long line of corrupt and venial leaders he could see that the plain door was very new and could only imagine the sort of gilded monstrosity that had once stood in its place something had certainly been scoured and sanded from the wall now painted a plain pale wheat color furnishings were just as simple as those in the rooms he and the others had been given two long couches three lounging chairs and a desk and working chair solaris put hansa down on a low couch and straightened up again we in the heart of our great temple are solaris said gravely my handpicked servants a brace of trusted priests these all that know of your presence are come here none else shall butisnt there some preparation we should make talia asked what are weam isupposed to be doing that i know not myself solaris said ruefully surprising all of them the sunlord has not told me herecome and sit and tell you what i know i shall she took a seat on the couch beside hansa leaving them to choose seats for themselves now no longer quite so dazzled by her presence alberich noted that her robes were as simple as her rooms and just as deceptive for the chair he chose was carved of tigerwood comfortably cushioned with soft doeskin tanned to a golden hue and solaris robes might be simple in cut but they were a heavy golden silktwill subtlety embroidered with the sun in glory in a slightly darker shade no matter what else she was solaris was not ascetic this much i know solaris told them one hand on hansas back stroking as she spoke at the solstice ceremony some few chosen novices made priests are here in the high temple she made a face those with families of wealth and influence most generally some times of outstanding ability one or two among them you are to be last you will be announced and made priest a simple ceremony it isrepetition of vows which i will show you so that you know i do not bind you to more than i claim more than that i know not but there will be more than that alberich stated as talia bit her lip solaris traded a glance with hansa of a complete certainty there will be more muchmore than that the firecat said but the sunlord does not choose to impart to usprecisely what he has in mind trust you must to him and to me solaris said it could be a trap it could be something really horrible alberich knew without bothering to try and read his expression that all manner of grim possibilities were running through dirks mind whether talia suffered the same concerns he couldnt say but he rather thought not talia couldnt read thoughts but she could as an empath read emotions and those often spoke more clearly and unambiguously than thoughts her expression showed no sign of worry on the contrary she seemed as comfortable as she could be with the news that a god had decided to spring some sort of surprise not only on his own people and chiefest priest but on her whatever she read from solaris it gave her no concerns on that score solaris sighed inscrutable the sunlord is and unknowable his mindbut a wish i have in my weakness that he be somewhat less so hansa made a sound between a purr and a cough that sounded like a laugh and solaris bent her golden gaze upon her firecat and you also she added with a touch a bare touch of sharpness i am a cat hansa reminded her with supreme dignity and a cat is nothing if notmysterious it is our charm to alberichs surprise it was dirk who chuckled weakly well radiance he said having learned the proper forms of address from alberich and karchanek were used to this sort of behavior out of our companions they seem to have a proper mania about keeping secrets from us mere mortals that relaxed solaris alberich read it in the lessening of the tension of her shoulders when divine intervention requested is and received it is then churlish is must be to cavil at how it comes one supposes she offered talia uttered a ladylike snort and solaris hid a smile behind her hand if god understandable becomes need him we no longer should solaris observed after a moment for we would be as he an interesting observation and an intelligent one kantor said with approval but no surprise alberich could only wonder how this woman had managed to survive in the cutthroat world of temple politics with a mind like that well tell us about this ceremony talia said after a moment of silence in lieu of any other comments and solaris hastened to tell them what she could when talia and dirk retired solaris motioned to alberich to stay i would like to introduce you to my chief friends and supporters aside from karchanek she said switching to karsite with obvious relief and i wish to learn to know you alberich and through you the land i wish to make our ally he resumed his seat warily as she continued after summoning a silent servant with a double clap of her hands and issuing orders for food and drink you have been a herald of valdemar for longer now than you ever lived in karse she observed shrewdly would you return to dwell here permanentlyif you could he shook his head he had already considered this from the moment that he was convinced karchanek could be trusted no holiness he replied with all respect even if i were to be accepted by those who called me traitor i am a herald he half expected her to be insulted but she smiled as if she understood then from time to time karse will come to you she said and at that moment the servant entered with another both bearing trays now scentas alberich well knew since he had now and again used it as a weaponis the sense that strikes the deepest and at the most primitive parts of a man and he had not realized just how much he missed his homeland until the scents of the foods of his childhood arose from the dishes that the servants uncovered and brieflybrieflyhe regretted giving the answer he had she must have read that in his expression for she laughed now you see how fair i am with you she told him and at that moment she showed her true age which was less than this and perhaps less than selenays for had i wished to have my will of you i should have asked you that question with the scent of spiced sausage dumplings and gravy and apple cake in your nostrils the servant handed him a filled plate which he took eagerly this is not the fare i would have expected in the palace of the sun holiness he said prevaricating for she had come far too close to the truth with that comment hmm larks tongues and sturgeon roe braised quail and newborn calf stewed in milk she gave him a sardonic look my cook is appalled by my tastes but my people know that i eat what they eat and i have made it certain that they have heard this from the palace servants there has been far too much of larks tongues on golden plates while babies wail and children have the pinched faces of hunger on the other side of the temple wall she took the plate that the servant offered her alberich observed that both plates were of honest ceramic the golden plates went to replenish granaries the furnishings and precious objects i found in these rooms bought new herdbeasts to strengthen bloodlines oh i hardly gave all away she admitted and paused for a hungry mouthful herself much has gone into the decoration of the temple and i will not strip the sunlords sanctuary of its glory but the wealth that i did was the loot of centuries come straight out of storehouses and has restored if not plenty then at least sufficiency to my land plenty will come in time sunlord willing and with the work of the people and the border alberich dared to ask there are still bandits there that prey on karse and valdemar alike she smiled grimly i have recalled the corrupt troops put guild mercenaries in their place until i can train young fighters who will serve and not exploit and she paused significantly i have distributed arms to the border villages alberich was in significant shock over the news that karse had hired guild mercenaries he wondered how she had managed to convince the guild that karse was to be trusted and had winced at the thought of the size of the bond she would have had to post but to hear that she had distributed arms to the common people i doubt that they will be effective it is more a matter of improving their morale and bolstering their courage she continued theyll likely be frightened of the guild fighters until they realize that they are trustworthy and being armed will make them feel more secure still one never knows they might surprise me and take over their own defense arming the villagers if nothing else this was the clearest indication that the fires of cleansing had been extinguished no redrobe priest would dare to enter a village on a mission of cleansing where the villagers were armed she ate in silence until she had cleaned her plate then set it aside accepted a cup of goodbut commonwine from the servant and sat back let me tell you the rest of my reforms in brief the village priests have been reassigned to new villages unless all or almost all the villagers themselves protested and demanded that their priest remain with them it might surprise you to learn that a good two thirds did just that alberich shrugged he hadnt seen that much widespread corruption among the village priests when hed been a captain those who abused their authority were attracted to the real seat of power in sunhame there are no more forays by troops and priests into the villages to cleanse or to test and gather up children if a parent wants a child tested they must take the child to the village priest who will call in a blackrobe priestmage she sipped her wine i surmise you already know that there are no more redrobes and no more demonsummoning and you suppose these changes will endure past your lifetime which may be ashort one he added mentally change is generational but i intend to outlive all those who oppose me until there are no sunpriests in karse that i have not overseen the training of she retorted i am young enough sunlord permitting there should be no reason why i cannot do this if you survive assassinshe thought when hansa coughed politely and he met the firecats sardonic gaze that is why i am here the firecat replied with casual arrogance i believe that the sunlord plans to ensure that the son of the sun survivesassassinsand everything else kantor observed since he had quite left that consideration out of his calculations he felt a wave of chagrin which he covered by handing the servant his empty plate and cup the servant left with the dishes and her orders to see that talia and dirk were also offered a meal with her attention no longer on her meal solaris proceeded to interrogate him was too strong a word for what she did since she was polite interested and deceptively offhand in her questions and remarks but interrogation was what it amounted to he had been prepared for it and answered with all due caution wondering if she hansa or both might not consider putting the equivalent of a truthspell on him they didnt though or at least not that he could tell and kantor didnt say anything about it she only broke it off when the servant returned with three more sunpriests one older than alberich two young all male ah good you managed to get away she said genially as the three bowed to her before taking seats at her wave of invitation this is herald alberich i wanted you to meet him without the other two in attendance alberich this is my dear friend and mentor ulrich and my fellows in the novitiate larschen and grevenor the older man ulrich smiled broadly and nodded the one that solaris had called larschen widened his eyes and said so seriously that it could only have been a joke i expected someone taller with horns and hooves grevenor tsked what a disappointment his teeth arent even pointed and after i spent all that time filing them flat so i wouldnt alarm you alberich replied with the same mockseriousness and was rewarded by a smile from solaris and a withering glance from hansa a typical feline kantor observed he only appreciates jokes when he makes them the atmosphere relaxed considerably now that solaris friends were here and even though more questions came at him he was able to ask as many as he answered and within a candlemark or so he had a very vivid picture in his mind of the first days when solaris had come to power it seemed that many of those in the temples outside of sunhame had rallied to her after the miracle of her coronation but before the miracle she had spent years in garnering the support of her contemporaries solaris was no reulan to come to the sunthrone without opposition and that was intensely interesting she had been prepared for this miracle and when it came she had everything in place to ensure that she simply wasnt escorted off and quietly done away with so that the running of karse could go back to business as usual yes that was interesting very interesting so she had known for years that she was going to be the chosen one but instead of biding her time quietly she had created a support base that ensured she could not be gotten quietly out of the way and which gave encouragement to others to fall in with them she was remarkably quiet about how she had known however and alberich could only wonder for all that she was amazingly downtoearth among her supporters there was still something about her a sense that she probably did spend the hours in meditation and prayer that the son of the sun was popularly supposed to do and that she probably always hadthat here was a person for whom the service of vkandis truly was a vocation alberich was not overly familiar with the aura of sanctity but he thought that it surrounded solaris and therein lay her greatest difference from selenay although in many many ways the two were very much alike selenay was warmly and completely feminine solaris was warmly and completelyneuter it was very much as if some cloak of power lay lightly on her shoulders and sent out a wordless message i am for no man in that she was not unlike the shinain swordsworn alberich had met one some distant relative or other of kerowyn whether that was by choice natural inclination or necessity mattered not that solaris would have cut her own breasts off if vkandis had required it of her was something that no one who sat in the same room with her for a candlemark would doubt and perhaps after all this was why she now sat in the sunthrone perhaps this was why vkandis had taken so long to manifest himself to his people someone like solaris was rarer than someone with the special gift that qualified her as queens own someone who had that much raw faith and still remained human and humane was rarer still only a god would have the patience to wait for such a servant to be bornbut a god could afford to take a very long view indeed alberich and dirk sat silently side by side high above the crowded sanctuary in a concealed alcove that no one below would guess existed the cunningly pierced carving gave them an excellent view without revealing that there was anything behind it the air in here was cool and a little dank enclosed entirely in stone as they were even the cunninglypivoted door was stone it was also dark any light would show through the stone lacework of the panel behind which they sat the temple sanctuary beyond that screen was a blaze of white red yellow and precious gold sun gems winked from the centers of carved sunflowers gilding was everywhere and there were so many windows besides the great skylight over the altar that the place seemed as open as a meadow down there arrayed in a semicircle in front of the altar were the novices about to be made priests only a few were ever endowed with their holy office standing before the sun throne fewer still were granted the honor of one of the major festivals and of hose few only the highest took their vows on the summer solstice the day when the sundisk reigned longest in the sky four and twenty of those stood down there today talia was the last and the otherswho knew each other by sight at leastmust surely be wondering who she was and why she was among them censers fuming incenseperfectly harmless undrugged incense of a pleasant spice scentstood at either end of their semicircle the incense drifted up to alberichs hiding place relieving the slightly stale scent of the air one and all the novices wore simple robes of black without ornamentation one by one by they were summoned before solaris who administered their vowssurprisingly simple vowsand arrayed them in their blackandgold vestments solaris herself was a glory in her robes of office and crown covered with bullion medallions even plaques of gold and what wasnt sewn with gold was embroidered with sun gems alberich couldnt imagine how she could stand under the weight of it yet she moved effortlessly calling each priestly candidate forward taking hisor her for half of the candidates were womenvows and with the aid of two acolytes arraying them in their new vestments so far there was no sign that solaris had made any special announcement about taliaher core group of supporters knew of course but no one else seemed to why was she keeping it all so secret if this was supposed to be the start of a new alliance perhaps shes hadadvice kantor suggested his tone suggested that the advice might have come from a higher authority well that was certainly possible but alberich worried that she had been left to her own devices to orchestrate this and was playing her game too close or perhaps she didnt intend to announce talias origin at all that actually made him feel a lot less nervous about this perhaps she just intended to invest talia without making any fuss about where she was from and only after theyd gone home would she announce it there would be no prospect of enraging anyone while the heralds were still in karse that way that plan would make alberich a great deal happier than facing the possibility of a riot in the temple when solaris announced just what talia was dirk was equally edgy actually fidgeting peering through first one then another of the pierced holes in the stone screen that covered their hiding place alberich wished he could fidget but discipline was habit now and there was nothing he could do to relieve the tension that made him feel as if he vibrated in place the narrow stone bench on which they sat bit into his thighs and he wished devoutly that this was all over one by one the candidates approached said their few wordsand he was grateful that nothing in that vow interfered with talias pledges to valdemar and its thronewere bedecked with their heavy trappings and departed again and now at last it was talias turn the sun was at its zenith and the rays poured down through the skylight above the altar this was the holiest moment of the holiest day of the calendar and now i summon the last candidate solaris called in that peculiar carrying voice of hers that sounded no louder than a simple conversation and yet could be heard in the last rank of worshipers at the rear of the temple even though there was a steady murmur of praying and talking i call herald talia of valdemar reaction rippled over the crowd like a wave dirk went rigid and alberich gripped the stone with both hands a silence fell that was as heavy as a blanket of lead hundreds of heads suddenly swiveled up and forward hundreds thousands of wide shocked eyes stared at solaris at talia as the latter bent her head calmly and accepted the vestments of a priestess of vkandis shock still held them as solaris took talias hand and turned her to face the crowd so that all of them could hear her take her vowsand could see the firecat pace slowly down from behind the altar and place himself protectively at talias feet purring the sound being the only thing other than the two voices that pierced that silence it did not escape alberich that hansa was between talia and the crowd of worshipers then solaris spoke and hansa muted his purrs up until this moment there had not been real silence in the temple now there was an empty hollow silence waiting to be filled the few words of the vows spoken in a tone hardly louder than a whisper echoed at the farthest corners of the temple then as the last of talias words died away in the awful silence solaris spoke again before the silence could be filled by any other the time has come solaris said in a voice like a clear silvery trumpet call addressing talia but also the crowd the time has come for the ancient enmity between our land and valdemar to be burned away it is time for hatred death and the taint of spilled blood to be burned away will you come with me and trust to me and to the god to whom you made your vows herald talia i will talia replied in a voice as firm if not with the same clarion sound and she put her hand in the one solaris stretched out to her together they turned to face the altar as they turned to the altar flames sprang up upon it all in an eyeblink with a roaring sound golden flames as high as a man and seemingly born of the rays of the sun falling on the white marble the crowd gasped then stilled again no one had been there to kindle those flames there was nothing there to feed it no wood no coal no oil and yet the flames leaped and danced and even from here alberich could feel the heat of them hear the crackle and roar solaris and talia approached the altar hand in hand as dirk shook like an aspen leaf there were stairs built onto the side of the altar had they always been there alberich hadnt noticed them before but now solaris led talia toward themtoward the flamesthey were climbing the stairs they were standing in the flames the golden flames lapped around them and alberich stared waiting for talia to start screaming waiting for their robes to burst into flame waiting with his throat closed with horrorthe flames enclosed them gently like loving hands or a shower of flower petals the flames caressed them but did not consume them talia was smiling solaris was not smiling but on her face was an expression that alberich could not put a name to something ineffablesomething beyond his understanding and the same stillness that filled the temple entered alberichs heart wait watch all will be well feelings not words a peace deeper than anything he had ever felt before even when in profound communion with kantor from talia perhaps she was a projective empath and strong enough to have sent this out to the entire temple if she thought it needful or talia might be the channel for something else his tension vanished and something else took its place out of the corner of his eye he saw dirks hands drop from the stone screen and knew that his fellow herald felt it too cradled lovingly in the heart of the flames solaris remained unchanged in her golden robes but something was happening to talia no not to talia but to her robes he vestments they were changing he couldnt say they were bleaching because there was nothing in the transition to suggest the process of bleaching there was no fading to grayno talias robes were lightening not fading they were becoming full of light growing lighter and lighter until they glowed with a white intensity that outshone the flames then all at once the flames were gone solaris and talia stood atop the altar talia looking a little embarrassed as if she had been given some incredible honor all unlookedfor that she felt unworthy of talias priestly vestments the robes of a sunpriest were no longer black and gold they were white and silver heraldic colors in the long ago solaris said her voice floating above the crowd like a subtle melody there was a third order of sunpriests these were the whiterobes whose duty was to serve as healers to solve dissension to keep the peace whose duty was also to serve the goddessbut she wont mention that at themoment said kantor absently goddess what goddess when had there ever been a goddess in karse whatare you talking about he demanded but kantor wasnt answering and more than half of his attention was on the two women anyway vkandis has chosen this woman to be the first of the new whiterobes solaris continued her voice stronger as in a call to arms vkandis has burned away all the hatred all the death all the evil that has passed between our lands vkandis has sent his purifying fire to show us the way to give us this new living bridge of understanding between his land and valdemar i son of the sun now charge youcry welcome to talia whiterobe priest of vkandis the cheering that erupted vibrated the very stone beneath alberichs feet and left him momentarily deafened but that was all right for the cheers went on so long that no one would have been able to hear anything anyway the three heralds and their companions stood in front of the arched doorway into solaris private courtyard that would serve as the framework for the gate hansa stared fixedly at the arch presumably in the little clearing in companions field karchanek was doing likewise alberich was as tired as if hed been running training exercises for a day and a night without a rest dirk looked stunned as if all of this still hadnt quite sunk in yet well alberich didnt blame him he didnt feel as if it had all quite sunk in yet either talias new vestments and robes were packed up into a saddlebag on rolans back on the whole given all of the bad blood between karse and valdemar solaris deemed it wise for them to leave now before this first flush of good feeling faded and people began looking for the demonriders and their hellhorses to have a few choice words with them few even among the priestmages knew that a gate was even possible and those few were in solaris ranks the arrival and departure of the queens own would seem miraculous as miraculous as the transformation of talias robes from black to white was it magicor a miracle alberich knew which his heart wanted it to be and he wished he could recapture a little of that wonderful stillness that peace that had come over him but that was after all the nature of miracles they were evanescent and left little or nothing behind to prove where they had come from it all could have been magicillusory flames and talia projecting that stillness under solaris guidance it could have been a wellorchestrated series of magic spells set up by priestmages in hiding just as alberich had been who knew how many of those little niches overlooking the sanctuary there were alberich didnt want to question it though his rational side said he should and when he got home myste almost certainly would want to know why he hadnt and he didnt have a good answer for her and you will continue to believe in the face of her questions eventhough at times doubt overcomes that belief kantor said that after all is the nature offaith and perhaps that is as it is intended to be and the reason why miracles so seldomleave tangible evidence of their origin behind what alberich replied so that we have nothing to rely on but belief that would be the free will part i think kantor replied with just a touch of impishness there was no time for further discussion the gate sprang into uncanny life the stones of the archway began to glow the brightness increased and suddenly instead of the room beyond the door there was an empty blackness within the arch that made alberichs eyes ache then crawling tendrils like animate lightning crept across the blackness tendrils that crisscrossed the darkness and multiplied with every heartbeat then with a jolt he felt somewhere in his chest the blackness vanished and the arch opened up on companions field on the twilight and his waiting friends and karchanek in front of them all time to go said dirk and suited his action to his words riding straight through without a backward glance poor dirk this had not been easy for him thank you for your trust solaris said to talia and held her in a momentary embrace that talia bent down from her saddle to share and you for yours radiance talia replied smiling some of the peace that alberich wistfully wished for still lingering in her gaze then it was her turn and she rode through to the welcoming committee on the other side alberich would have followed but a restraining hand on his stirrup made him pause here solaris said handing him a basket that smelled of home i told you that karse would come to you all of thisand she remembers sausages and herbbread for me she smiled up at himonce again the ordinaryextraordinary woman that she was when she was not encased in the sunlords gold this could not have been done without your trust as well he coughed it was little enough for so great a result radiance he replied shifting the basket uneasily it was greater than you will admit she retorted and i think you had better not say anything more that would indicate you disagree with your spiritual lord i might arrest you for heresy the day you arrest anyone for heresy will be the day that the sun turns black radiance he responded earning another smile from her he hesitated a moment poised on the brink of asking all those questions that quivered on the tip of his tongue but she was having none of it go she said with a playful slap to kantors rump hansa wearies and karchanek cannot wait to quit your soil and its plague of eyes kantor leaped forward without any urging from alberich and as he fell through the arch in that moment of eternal darkness he felt something brush past his legkarchanek taking advantage of the fact that the gate would not close immediately to escape back into his own land and place then kantors four hooves thudded on solid turf and he was surrounded by friends and fellow heralds and he realized that the basket he held did not smell of home after all it smelled of childhood memories yes and of things he thought of as comforts that he had not enjoyed in a very long time but not of home home was here in a land whose language had become his in dreams among people who were dearer than bloodkin who would gladly give him anything they had including their lives as he would for them and as for his godwell vkandis had shown more clearly than in words that a border was nothing more than an artificial boundary and names were just as artificial vkandis had been here all along cloaked in the hundred names for deity that the valdemarans had for him alberich just hadnt known it in his heart until now welcome back said eldan relieving him of the basket so that he could dismount the relief on his face said all that he would not say aloudthat despite all of the assurances the guarantees the others had been wound as tight with worry as he had been in the temple i hope it all went all right better much than all right alberich replied the cadences of valdemaran coming strangelyfor just a momentto his tongue he looked around and saw that all of the council as well as selenay and the princeconsort had surrounded talia and dirk to get their version of the story his own friends including myste surrounded him many tales have i to tell he continued and tell them i shall when we settled are with good wine in hand how are you feeling myste asked taking his hand and looking into his eyesperhaps looking for a sign that he regretted leaving well more than well he smiled down at her it is good to be home
