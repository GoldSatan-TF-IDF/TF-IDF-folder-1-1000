marion lennox his miracle bride prologue blake connor sam darcy dominic and nikolai and pierce her selfcontained sons ruby looked along the long line of men and she sighed shed tried so hard but they didnt get it the gift in her pursetheir combined gift for her seventieth birthdayspoke of failure more than anything else but her sons were wonderful she thought blinking back tears as she tried to see the happy side of the equation each one was making a difference in the world what a transformation from the waifs shed rescued from so many forms of neglect they were listening avidly to the speaker so should she the earl of loganaich was speaking at the opening of his refuge for disadvantaged children as the past head of foster parents australia ruby had been asked for advice shed been overjoyed at the concept a place where kids could regroup advice for ruby was never enough shed talked her boys into contributing with expertise as well as funds theyd agreed without hesitation today theyd flown in from round the world taking time out to share her pleasure and using the occasion to give her their special birthday gift rubys birthday had been the week before they hadnt forgotten theyd told her but theyd said they knew she hated family gatherings but it wasnt ruby who hated family gatherings she thought sadly it was her boys her men they saw emotion and they ran a mile the castle at dolphin bay was a family enterprise on stage now was the earl of loganaich and his ladylord hamish and lady susan with them was their extended family kids friends dogs the whole domestic muddle these people had come together to build something they believed in and the joy of their shared enterpriseplus the joy of belonging to such a closeknit familyshone through the earls speech was coming to a close for the family on the stage it was hugs all round ruby looked sadly along her line of grownup foster sons and there was none of that joy about them todays gift had been as unexpected as it was unwantedthe deeds to a sydney apartment overlooking one of the most glorious views in the world butanyone who wants to stay with you for more than a couple of weeks needs our consent her sons had told her were protecting you from yourself its time you stopped taking in the strays of the world they didnt understand she thought again sadly an errant tear slipping down her wrinkled face shed fought so hard for all of them and theyd succeeded but theyd succeeded on their terms she sniffed trying desperately to focus again on the owners and employees of this extraordinary castle they seemed so happy she just knew this place would be successful would her boys ever be successful on her terms successful in love pierce had seen her tears he was frowning reaching across to take her hand at thirtysix pierce was a brilliant architect lean craggy and confident in his dealings with the world but to ruby pierce would always be the starving illused kid shed rescued over and over again pierce more than anyone had contributed to this day designing the extensions to the castle buildings free of charge so it could more easily accommodate those it was designed to help she knew pierce had enjoyed the work but still he held himself distant and where was this baby hed told her about the things hed told her this morning had left her stunned hed been married but now his wife was dead he was caring for a baby she hadnt heard any of this until now and it was only because shed overheard pierce talking to his foster brothers that hed been forced to tell her what is it ruby he asked her now its justim so confused i so wanted you to have a proper family he gave a rueful smile i do it nearly killed him to admit even that much ruby thought and family ha one baby youre hiring a housekeeper to look after you wont even let me near its not as if this childs mine and youve done enough i cant let you but i want to no you dont pierce was a professional in charge of his world and she was a frail old lady who didnt know any better beloved but past her useby date you need to rest ive got all the time in the world to rest she whispered but nowall i want is to live she looked again along the line of her boys her outstanding men not one of them knew how to live she thought sadly not one shed failed chapter one shed psyched herself for farm terrorsbut not for this shanni steered her car onto the verge but she didnt drive in the gate no way shanni wasnt a farm girlin fact her best friend had burst out laughing when shed divulged her destination but jules had grown up on a farm so shed talked shanni through what she might face cows will ignore you as long as you dont interfere with their calves calves are curious but harmless and most modern farms employ test tubes instead of bulls check if a cow has a dangly bit and if it does dont go near it horsesbig doesnt mean scary say boo to a horse and itll take itself off most farm dogs are all bluster look them in the eye and shout sit oh and watch for cow pats theyre murder on stilettos so shed left her stilettos at juless chic sydney bedsit shed rehearsed her sit command and she was ready for anything anything but this there were kids sitting on the gate multiple kids one two three four they were watching her well why wouldnt they shannis car might well be the only car along here in a week the meandering gravel track followed a creek that came straight from the snow melt distant mountains were capped with snow even though spring was well under way undulating paddocks were dotted with vast red gums the beauty of new south waless high country was world renowned but the cows looked safely enclosed in paddocks she couldnt see a horse or a dog what she saw was far more terrifying girl boy boy girl she decided running down their ranks matching grubby jeans tshirts sensible boots siblings maybe though there was a redhead a blonde and two brunettes forget the hair they were sitting on the gate of the farm where shed agreed to work shed stuck her aunty rubys letter on the dashboard so she could read the directions ignoring the kidswho were clearly waiting for her to do somethingshe reread it now holding it like she was handling a scorpion aunty rubys letter read like she talkedso fast she hardly paused for breath pierce wont let me help him he was always the sweetest boy im sure you thought so too and hes had such a bad time and now this his wife died six months ago his wife he didnt even tell me he was getting married thats how much he doesnt want to bother me and now shes dead and the boys are worrying about him they say hes falling behind in his work hes cutting corners the boys say and theres a huge contract hes risking losing mind i think losing a wife makes any other loss irrelevant but the boys wont talk about that no one will they treat me as if im ancient not to be bothered anyway dear i know michael broke your heartat least your mother said he did though how you can love a man with a ponytailbut worse youve lost your sweet little london gallery if you were thinking about coming homecould you bear to help with a baby for a few weeks until pierce gets this contract sorted hes been looking for a housekeeper but the boys say hes having trouble i could gobut of course they wont let me rubys frustration sounded through the letter beloved ruby whod spent her life helping others was being held at arms length by her foster sons but she could no sooner resist sticking in her oar than she could breathe if she couldnt help then she was sure that shanni could and shanni just might housekeeper to a sortofcousin and his motherless baby on a farm on the other side of the world from her life in london in the normal scheme of things shed laugh at the suggestion but this was pierce maclachlan pierce was one of rubys many foster kids at any family celebration thered always been three or four of rubys waifs there were three things affecting shannis decision to help him number one was sympathy she did remember pierce twenty years ago pierce had been fifteen to her almost ten shed met him at her uncle erics wedding and shed been shocked ruby had just taken him infor the fourth time shed told shannis mother hed looked far too skinny far too tall for his clothes far toodesolate and now hed lost his wife that was awful shanni was a soft touch and okay admit it twenty years ago shed thought pierce had the makings ofgorgeous her hormones had just been waking up pierce was a tall dark and mysterious fifteenyearold all angular bones and shadows in truth hed probably just been excruciatingly shy and malnourished but hed run rings round the rest of her rowdy cousins so added to sympathy waslust yeah right she was a big girl now pierce was probably a fivefeettwo midget with a pot belly and she was supposed to be broken hearted but then there was number three and that was the biggie she didnt have enough money to stay in london shed lost her gallery and her lover ruby said pierce had a farm she could just pop in and see what the setup was and if it wasnt suitable then she could retreat to her parents spare room and lick her wounds only the option of her parents spare room was no longer available so she was here facing four kids four kids she was scared enough of one baby she couldnt stay she thought staring again at the four kids but where to go where she hadnt done her homework before shed headed home shed received rubys letter and suddenly shed just come to find that her parents were overseaswell shed known thatbut to her horror theyd sublet their house hadnt they known their daughter was intending to need it they might have guessed shed flee to australia without asking questions to be met by strangers having a barbecue in their back yard she sniffed but she didnt cry when had she ever she should have cried when shed found mike in bed with one of his stupid modelsbut even then shed come home midafternoon with the beginnings of the flu and had walked in and found them just like in the sitcoms they hadnt seen her well theyd hardly been looking shed retreated to the laundry and filled a bucket then while her whole body had shaken with suppressed rageas well as the first symptoms of a truly horrid dose of influenzashed decided water alone wasnt enough shed stalked into the kitchen and hauled out the ice even then they hadnt heard her though her hands were shaking so much shed dropped two ice trays it had taken five minutes before enough ice melted to bring the bucket of water to almost freezing but it had definitely been worth the wait throwing it had been a definite high point though in retrospect maybe tears would have been better for although shed been ruthless with the ice bucket she hadnt moved fast enough with the shared credit card by the time shed emerged from influenza and betrayal mike had revenged himself the only way a lowlife creep with the morals of a sewer rat knew how it had been enough to tip her over the edge financially her tiny mortgagedtothehilt art gallery had ceased to be but she was still irrationally pleased that mike hadnt seen her cry if i can cope with mike without tears i can cope with this she told herself staring out at the kids on the gate while her stomach plummeted as far as it could go and then found a few depths she hadnt known existed the kids were puzzled that she wasnt turning in the oldest kida preadolescent girl with short copperred hair that looked like it had been hacked with hedge clippershad jumped off the gate in preparation for opening it surely shed got it wrong she wound down the windowjust a tadadmitting nothing is this two creek farm she called yes the oldest boy called are you shanni yes her voice was so faint it was barely a squeak finally the girl with the bad haircut hauled the gate wide while the three kids still sitting on the top rail swayed and clung dad says we cant go inside until you get here what are you doing parking over there your dads expecting me you rang didnt you umyes the girl looked right looked left looked right againhad there ever been another car up hereand crossed the road to talk dad said thank god rubys come up trumps weve got a babysitter i see she swallowed and looked again at the kids on the gate i guessyour dads name is pierce hes pierce maclachlan the girl poked her hand in the open car window she was all arms and legs and a mouthful of braces im wendy maclachlan im eleven i see shanni said faintly while her hand was firmly shaken the others are bryce and donald and abby wendy told her bryce is nine donalds seven abbys four theres bessy as well but shes only eight months old so she doesnt talk yet and shes away with dad shes actually elizabeth but shes too cute to be an elizabeth bessy the baby one true thing wheres your dad he had to take bessy to the doctor we think shes got chicken pox she hasnt got any spots yet but shes grizzling so much she must be sick dad didnt get any sleep last night when you rang he looked like he might cry oh shanni said even more faintly she looked over to where the other three children were swinging on the opened gate have you all had chicken pox oh yes wendy said blithely i had it first and then donald and abby and bryce got it all together dad said he was going round the twist but i helped im sure you did we didnt want bessy to catch it but she did anyway dads buggered she blinked whoops im not supposed to say that dad says but when you rang and said you were coming dad said thank god im so buggered ill pay half my kingdom for decent help and then he looked at all of us and said hed pay all his kingdom a lesser woman would turn around right now shanni thought a lesser woman would say whoops sorry theres been a dreadful mistake and go find a nice homeless shelter rather than face this we shouldnt be here by ourselves wendy admitted her voice faltering just a little but the station wagons got a flat tyre and when dad pulled out the spare it was flat too mum must have had a flat tyre and not told dadshe swallowed before before she died anyway dads cars only a twoseater and he really needed to take bessy to the doctor and we wont all fit so i said wed be fine only he worries about abby cos she keeps doing stuff like getting her toe stuck in the sink so i promised wed sit on the gate and not move until you came abby promised faithfully not to fall off ruby shanni said to herself under her breath dear dotty aunty ruby how could she cope with this what she wanted was breathing space time to get her head clear paint a little take time to think about where she wanted to go from here a bit of wandering on a farm taking in the sights maybe with a cute little baby in a pram winning the gratitude of a boy shed once felt sorry for and solitude solitude and more solitude there was a shriek from the other side of the road the boys had swung the gate hard and despite her promise abby had fallen backwards the fouryearold was hanging by the knees her blonde pigtails brushing the dirt her hands were dragging on the ground trying to find purchase while the gate swung wildly to and fro help she yelled wendy heeeelp wendy sighed she looked to the right looked to the left looked to the right again and stomped back across the road the kids boots look too tight shanni thought her feet looked like they hurt wendy yanked abby backwards into her skinny arms staggering under her weight the gate sung wildly again with its load of two little boys are you coming in wendy called across the road still staggering abby was far too heavy for her shanni met her look head on it was a strange look for a child she doesnt think im coming in shanni thought it was a look of a child whod needed to grow up before her time despite herself her heart lurched oh help stop it she told herself stop it youre such a soft touch her friends told her and she knew they were right before shed left london shed had to find homes for the three cats shed taken in against her better judgement plus twenty cacti her elderly neighbour had persuaded her to water when shed gone away for the weekendonly the weekend had turned out to be a decision to join her son in the riviera for ever a lesser woman would have ditched the cacti she hated cacti shed boxed them up and taken them halfway across london to a batty cactus lover shed found on the internet even mikehe hadnt had anywhere to stay and hed been such a promising artist had she mistaken sympathy for love so dont you dare feel sorry for this family she told herself leave now but wendy was watching her her small face closed she wasnt expecting help and then she stopped looking at shannidecision made it doesnt matter what dad said she told her little sister ill take you inside she hugged her little sister in a gesture that was pure protection turning her back on shanni youve scraped your fingers well find a plaster oh heck what did you say your names were shanni called bryce the oldest boy called bryce and wendy and donald and abby and bessy at the doctor okay bryce shanni said wearily where do i park definitely chicken pox the doctor told pierce in a tone of deep disapproval that makes the whole family the older children should have been immunized we do standard immunization at twelve months bessy will be paying the price of your failure to get that done if he was less tired hed slug him pierce thought wearily but slugging would involve energy and energy was something that was in short supply heres a prescription the doctor said still cool twice a day just like the older children can i rely on you to give it yes pierce snapped maybe he did have enough energy but bessy was clinging to his neck it was pretty difficult to slug when holding a whimpering baby the child welfare officer says you seem to be struggling the doctor said he peered at pierce as if he wasnt too sure i can call them in if you want i told you that when their mother died i dont want and i have help coming excellent i hope its somebody competent these children have suffered enough the doctor closed bessys patient file with a snap consultation over let me know if you change your mind i can get welfare in tomorrow the house was a tip shanni walked into the kitchen and nearly walked out again it was a vast farmhouse kitchen one wall almost taken up by a huge green aga the cupboards and benches were made of a deep rich wood and the floor was planked with something that looked like oak an enormous wooden table dominated the rooma table big enough to to hold every eating utensil in the house shanni thought incredulously when had they ever washed up itsits a bit messy wendy said following shanni in she hadnt put abby down she was still staggering under her weight bessy was really sick yesterday the two little boys were bringing up the rear they at least looked like brotherscurly black hair matching freckles matching expressions of distrust the kitchen was cold it was a glorious spring day but the place felt damp we ran out of wood last night wendy admitted as she touched the cold stove dad ran out of time to chop it but dad said just as well cos he wouldnt have gone to the doctors and left the fire burning we had cereal and orange juice for breakfast so we didnt need the stove i see shanni said she didnt see wendy staggered forward and plonked her little sister on a kitchen chair ill find a plaster this at least was a place to start abbys finger was grazed we need to clean it she told wendy can you find me a face cloth and some soap i think so wendy said cautiously are you going to look after us i have no idea shanni told her or not in the long term but for now it looks like i need to look after you at least until your father gets home lets start with one sore finger bessy went to sleep somewhere between the doctors surgery and the pharmacy finally shed sobbed practically all the previous night shed sobbed in the doctors waiting room and in the surgery the silence as she slid into sleep was almost deafening pierce was lucky enough to find a parking space just outside the pharmacy yes there was no way he was going to wake her but here was another occasion where he could be censured by child welfarenever leave your child alone in a car it wasnt like this was a closedin car his cute little sports coupéa bright yellow mx he loved almost more than life itselfwas open to the sun it was a gorgeous spring day hed be able to watch bessy though the window of the pharmacy as he dived in and grabbed the prescription but there were ten prescriptions before him itll be twenty minutes the pharmacist said and pierce almost groaned ive got kids at home and the baby in the car dont leave your child in the car look can you fast track twenty minutes fine he sighed he couldnt slug everyone in this town even if it was starting to feel like everyone was conspiring against him ill sit in the car and wait he tried to stalk out but his legs were too tired to stalk as he walked past the window on the way out he caught a look at himself in its reflective glass he hadnt shaved for two days hed slept in these clothes he looked like death a little old lady entering the pharmacy gave him a wide berth and he didnt blame her he slid into the drivers seat of his cool little car beside him bessy was still soundly asleep twenty minutes bess he said but she didnt stir he empathized he sighed he closed his eyes the warm spring sun was a balm all by itself it was quiet so quiet twenty minutes he could just fold his arms on his steering wheel and let his head droop it was so warm how long did you say your dad would be he said an hour the appointment was for half past ten its now well after eleven shouldnt he be back by now shanni said cautiously yes wendy said and her bottom lip trembled just a bit she caught herself almost before the telltale quiver happened but shanni had seen she felt like quivering herself uhoh she was only staying here until pierce got home she told herself then she was out of here fast but these kids were starting to look more scared than she was she couldnt leave them nor could she sit round in this appalling mess worrying about where pierce was they were all staring at her and wendys poorly disguised quiver was reflected on each of their faces theyd lost their mum pierce was late their world wasnt as stable as they might like right she said ill ring the doctors surgery shall i yes said wendy sounding relieved so she rang yes hed been at the doctors surgery he has to collect a prescription before he goes home the receptionist told her and hes probably taken the opportunity to go shopping has he left those poor children by themselves there was enough censure in her tone to make shanni back off no theyre with me if theres a problem why would there be a problem the child welfare people arent all that happy about the way hes coping her voice was loud enough for wendy clinging to shannis side to hear tell her were coping fine wendy said her face flushing yeah dadll just be shopping were okay were okay shanni said and put the phone down they want to take us away from dad wendy said maybe they whoever they were had grounds but meanwhileshe could hardly phone the police and report pierce missing not yet shed give him a bit of leeway but there was still fear on four little faces theres no earthly use looking like that she told them mentally rolling up her sleeves girding her loins doing whatever a girl had to do before launching into battle if youre worried about child welfare then we need to show them were coping how are we coping wendy asked by cleaning she stared at the mound of dishes first thing first this is a big job so we need a major battle plan ill chop enough wood to light the fire and get some hot water lots of hot water a sink isnt going to cut it lets fill the bath donald can you find us a pile of clean towels the rest of you carry every dirty dishexcept the knives well leave the knives for meinto the bathroom boys wash and girls dry i want the whole bathroom filled with clean plates so clean they sparkle ill clean in here and then well bring the clean things back in we cant donald said were not old enough to wash dishes only wendy nonsense shanni said with a lot more briskness than she felt big doesnt mean clever take your boots and socks off so if you get wet it doesnt matter washing in the bath is fun do you have a sound systemfor music pdad has one wendy said hes got lots of cds then lets put on a bouncy work cd she said something like abba do you know dancing queen yes abby said her eyes lighting up our mummy liked abba thats why she called me abby then well put on abba i dont know whether dads got abba said wendy huh no matter questions could wait lets look then shall we shanni said sounding a lot more decisive than she felt cos this house looks like it needs about a hundred abba cds to lick it into shape at four oclock the sun slipped behind the craggyburn post office clock tower and pierce and bessy lost their sunshine bessy woke first she wiggled in her car seat reached across to pierce put her pudgy hand into his mess of unkempt brown curls and pulled pierce woke like hed been shot mmmphf bessy said in deep satisfaction at the results of one small tug bess pierce said coming to and trying to stop his eyes watering boy you dont know your own strength he winced and rubbed his head he stirred and he stretched he gazed sleepily up to the clock tower the world stilled surely he hadnt surely oh god he had hed been away for over five hours almost six he reached for the ignition his fingers fumbling in haste a woman from the pharmacy was restocking shelves in the window she saw him backing out of the parking space and she waved to him frantically to stop he paused and she came to the door your prescriptions filled she called we wondered when youd wake up you should be more careful mr connelly the pharmacist says the babyll probably be sunburned not bad at all shanni stood back and surveyed the pencil sketch shed just done with a tinge of admiration her very first cow it even looked like a cow its leg looked a bit funny she checked her line of kids four kids four boards with paint four brushes four makeshift easels intense concentration good four oclock how long before she called someone in she looked across at wendy who was working with almost desperate absorption donald bryce and abby were silent too damn him what was he playing at she should call wendy looked across at her her eyes pleading not yet pierce was struggling to stay under the speed limit as he and bessy flew homeward bessy was rested and cheerful crowing in delight at the soothing feeling of wind against her increasingly itchy skin pierce might have rested but he didnt feel rested hed left them for an hour hoping the womanwho was it shannon no shanniwould arrive even if she had arrived shed be long gone by now the kids would be terrified he turned the last curveand there was a police car in the yard the police itd be the pharmacist he thought remembering the prissy set to the mans mouth as hed handed over bessys medicine the whole town thought these kids would be better off in care and now ive stuffed it big time he told bessy as he lifted her from the car i dont deserve to have you guys where was everybody two policemen appeared from behind the hayshed accompanied by a redhead a woman small slim faded jeans bright red windcheater splodged with green paint a yellow bandana catching back shoulderlength flaming curls green paint smeared on a snubbed nose freckles memory stirred one of rubys family weddings a nightmare of being alone a kid the same age as him taunting hes one of aunty rubys strays hes a bastard bastard bastard bastard then a skinny little girl dressed in a scarlet party frock and with a huge pink bow in her flaming hair marching up to her big cousin and stomping hard on his foot so hard the kid had yelped gee im sorry mac shed said and she hadnt sounded sorry at all then shed turned to him and smiled hi my names shanni whats yours hed remembered that tiny piece of kindness and bravado had stayed with him to be used as an inward smile at need could this really be her pierce dear were over here she said smiling brightly and waving to him like he was her longtime cousin hows our darling bessy did you get the things i wanted from the store umhi he said weakly and the memory of the stomping was suddenly crystal clear amazingly the cops were smiling as well pierce recognized theman older cop who had family in the town and a younger guy whose stock in trade was aggression theyd been here two weeks ago with the child welfare officers theyd left then looking grim they werent looking grim now the younger guy was smiling almost fatuously and the older guy was looking on with benign amusement so friday night the young cop said to shanni can i let you know shanni said i need to sort out rosters with my cousin it wouldnt do to leave the kids by themselves ouch well see you round then the older cop said benignly good luck with that cow miss im sure youll get that leg right in the end ill ring you on friday the young cop said waving a slip of paper thanks for your number i wont lose it they waved to pierce in friendly salute they climbed into the police car and they were gone leaving pierce with shanni chapter two umyoure shanni he said and he sounded dumb you think shanni said arching her eyebrows shed stopped walking toward him the minute the police car left the yard she didnt come one inch closer you might want to check after all its important to be sure who you leave in charge of your children look i the bouncing smile and the charm were put carefully aside what the hell are you playing at wendys terrified i came within an inch of telling those policemen that these kids would be better off in foster care what sort of a father are you where the hell have you been he focused on the one tiny thing he had control over do you mind watching your mouth im teaching them not to swear she took a deep breath you are kidding she said at last abandoned starving kids being taught not to swear theyre not starving so what did you leave them for lunch i dont know he said forcing his dazed brain to think theres eggs steak sausages frozen chips all of which require a stove she said dangerously weve got a stove and the kids were going to light it how shanni was looking at him like he was something that had crawled out of cheese look i went to sleep really she raised one quirky eyebrow you had a little nap so your kids starved kids dont starve from missing lunch she glared dad said a small voice and it was wendy approaching from behind shanni she stayed behind shanni she didnt come near it was like she was using shanni as a shield the weight around his heart grew heavier hed let wendy down this puny kid who had the weight of the world on her shoulders hed been gaining her trust a little hell wendy dont swear in front of the children shanni said icily look i fell asleep he said desperately i didnt sleep at all last night wendy tell her i didnt sleep i had to take bessy to the doctors and then i had to wait for the prescription to be filled i sat in the car and waited because you cant leave kids alone in the car and i just slept he spread his hands he might never convince shanni he thought but it was wendy who was important there was a lengthy pause while wendy considered shanni remained silent he really didnt sleep last night wendy said at last talking to shanni maybe he didnt sleep the night before either she added i had a nightmare and woke up he made me hot chocolate shannis iciness thawed just a little youre saying he has an excuse he looks awful wendy said he does shanni agreed when did he last shave he looks okay when hes shaved wendy said or when hes a little bit bristly hes too bristly now this sisterhood thing was getting scary but they were coming down on his side maybe oooohh it was bessy beaming at wendy wendy walked forward and snatched bessy from his arms then she retreated behind shanni again they werent completely on his side wendy must have been terrified im really sorry he told her while shanni practised her glare some more i thought youd run away wendy said i wont i told you men tell lies mum said that men always tell lies there was another lengthy pause worse than the last pierce tried to think of what to say nothing came the silence extended the three of them were gazing at him like he was a maw worm wendy and shannieven bessy then you know my dad doesnt tell lies shanni said thoughtful honest and ive known my dad for twentynine years he makes mistakesonce he even left me at the ice rink for five hours cos he was reading a really good bookbut he doesnt tell lies are you hungry she asked him food was the last thing he was thinking of though come to think of it i guess i am a bit theres cold sausages wendy said we cooked a lot for lunch cos we thought youd be home and shanni made chocchip cookies shannis made chocchip cookies he stopped looking at wendy yep hed betrayed a trust and somehow he had to figure out a way to retrieve himselfbut there was nothing he could do about that right now but somehow shannis icerink story had lessened the tension and sausageschocchip cookies theyre my specialty shanni said modestly you didnt have choc chips so we had to squash a block the fires not lit we lit it wendy said we had to light it to get hot water to do the dishes and ive eaten five chocchip cookies you lit the fire but the wood shanni chopped it the boys stacked it the wood box is full shanni had chopped the wood shed lit the stove shed made chocchip cookies he stared i know she said pseudomodest call me wonderwoman ruby said youre an artist his tone was almost accusatory he heard it and tried desperately to retrieve himself i mean i think im converting to wood chopping shanni said ive failed cows legs and chopping vents anger anger now why would i be feeling anger she said to wendy rather than him to be brought here under false pretences whoa things were spinning away from him false pretences he said weakly one baby she said and tugged wendy against her in another display of the power of sisterhood men the gesture said the despicable species one baby does not equate to five kids ruby told me one baby i rang you from my friends and you said one baby uhoh i didnt say one baby he said weakly but yeah ruby would have told you one baby to be honest when you rang i thought id get you here any way i could and try and bribe you into staying once you got here beam me up now scotty he thought bleakly im an outright bastard but suddenly they had a diversion bessy had been nestling against wendys shoulder content from her drive but bessy was eight months old she hadnt been fed since breakfast she was a young lady with chicken pox bessy suddenly recalled all this in one huge momentous wash of outrage she opened her mouth and she yelled can you stay at least until weve fed bessy pierce asked over the yells im staying until youve done some explaining shanni said grimly i need to murder you or i need to murder my aunty ruby and i cant figure out which she should leave since bessys initial howl thered been no time to do anything but run there certainly hadnt been time for explanations bessy had needed feeding bathing soothing more soothing more feeding the kids had needed baths and dinner the cattle had needed feeding okay pierce had done that one on his own shanni had stayed in the kitchen and supervised the kids dinner while watching pierce out the window there was a huge cowa bullin the paddock closest to the house pierce had wheeled a vast bale of hay to the gate on a hand cart opened the gate and spread the hay wasnt that dangerous the cow had lookedlooked cute shed decided as pierce had scratched it behind the ear the big creature had almost purred leaning its big body against pierce until he staggered really cute actually not as cute as pierce he was tall and lean and angular his deep brown curls were unkempt and too long he hadnt shaved for a couple of days and he had shadows under his eyes his jeans and windcheater looked like hed been sleeping in them he looked almost gaunt her impression of pierce aged fifteen had been that the guy was hot nothing had changed what wasnt hot was five children but she did feel sorry for him to be stuck with five kids it was his choice it was hardly his fault that his wife had died no but what are you thinking wendy asked shyly the kids were tucking into scrambled eggs like there was no tomorrow im thinking you guys have hollow legs what have you been eating piedads not a very good cook do you call him pierce yes but not in front of people bryce told her scooping up another mouthful of scrambled egg and closing his eyes in bliss this hasnt got a single bit of black on it scrambled eggs is my second specialty after chocchip cookies pizzas dads specialty wendy said but the last time we ordered it dad forgot we didnt have any cash and the pizza guy wouldnt take a cheque or credit card and now he wont come back i can make pizza youre kidding it was pierce standing in the doorway surveying the domesticity before him with amazement you cook pizza she means she gets those boxes in the supermarket and thaws them out bryce said wisely i do not she said taking umbrage i can cook them from the ground up will you cook us one abby asked maybe tomorrow if i get the ingredients will you stay then donald was the quietest of the kids hed hardly spoken since shed arrived hed simply watched her even when shed set them all to painting shed been aware that donald had never stopped watching her now he asked his question and it was like a challenge for tonight she blinked yeah okay she was committing herself but where else was she going to sleep tell me you have a spare bed we have a spare bedroom pierce said its mummys bedroom donald said still gazing at her with that unwavering stare mummys bedroom oh heck um doesnt daddy sleep there he sleeps upstairs in bessys room abby said she keeps waking up bryce added wendy used to get up to her when mummy was sick donald said tilting his chin cos mummy didnt want pierce to but pierce does it now didnt your mummy die when bessy was born just after donald said this was stuff she didnt understand she wasnt sure that she wanted to try isnt it bedtime she asked weakly and pierce nodded it surely is will shanni tell us a bedtime story abby asked i will pierce said gruffly we want shanni wendy said im washing up shanni was feeling completely confused what was going on here pierce looked defeated battle weary and exhausted and hed slept today your dad reads you bedtime stories she managed thats his job im the housekeeperi keep house its up to pierce to keep kids pierce took almost an hour to read them their stories when he finally came downstairs shanni was sitting on the kitchen floor surrounded by stuff the more he looked at her the more he remembered that tenyearold shanni shed made him smile then and she had that power still just by sitting in the middle of his kitchen floor which was dumb dangerous even what you doing he managed this isnt a fridge its an ecosystem she carefully didnt look at him instead she held up a jar where purple fuzz fought with green slime didnt fleming invent penicillin this way are you searching for a patent cure for chicken pox leave it hand me a rubbish bag she said left to breed this could take over the world he found a rubbish bag and held it out she scooped in so much stuff that even he was hornswoggled im usually neat he said defensively and she nodded i remember you at fifteen you wereneat he glowered i believe i was wearing a suit blue pinstripe if i recall that the rest of the boys thought was poncy yeah i remember you were teased he gazed down trying to figure things out where did she fit he couldnt remember ruby had simply referred to her as our shanni our shanni would love to come and help out all he could remember was the oversized bow and the stomping foot and the smile mostly the smile i cant exactly remember the connection he said apologetically my dad is rubys younger brother so you are lucy and wills daughter theyre academics theyre currently in switzerland i dont remember lucy and will but i remember you gee thanks you stood on macs toe i did didnt i she said and grinned at the memory hes grown up to be a usedcar dealer ruby says he married a woman whos a real harpy good old mac why did you come aunty ruby asked me she held up something greenish courgette cucumber a bit past its useby date wouldnt you say iyes why didnt you tell me you had five kids i dont believe i told you anything but ruby didnt say ruby doesnt know ruby doesnt know you have five kids no you didnt tell ruby i barely see ruby theres no need to tell her everything yeah so omit a little something like four kids somethings rotten here and i dont know what shed been foraging in the rear of the fridge and now she emerged triumphant no this is dried out im sure its a courgette could we cut this out cleaning the inquisition he raked his fingers through his hair and will you get off my floor i hardly know you you know me enough to trust me with your kids i had no choice i had a doctors appointment and there was no other available appointment until tomorrow i loaded the kids in the car then realized the tyre was flat and so was the spare you were coming ruby said you were trustworthy so i trusted you left me alone deliberately no he roared so loudly that there was a whimper from above their heads youve woken bessy shanni said shush they both shushed bessy whimpered again and then settled take that outside shanni said motioning to the rubbish its disgusting he did it gave him room to take a few deep breaths he stared up at the night sky and counted to ten then he decided to count to a hundred finally he figured hed better return shanni was still cleaning his fridge all he could see of shanni was one very cute denimclad butt emerging from his refrigerator he took a couple of moments to admire the view hell he missed women twelve months now of enforced celibacy twelve months down and how many to go not months years what had he let himself in for you want a whisky he asked the butt and the butt stilled a whisky dont say it like im the local lush he said i allow myself one whisky when all the kids are in bed surely a man can have that without being accused of child neglect hey i didnt say she was backing out of the refrigerator butt wiggling you didnt have to say you were implying actually i wasnt she said sitting up and wiping a strand of wilting lettuce from her nose i wasnt implying anything i was about to say that a whisky would be very nice indeed and if it turns into two then im not going to report anyone to social welfare just so long as i can share she smiled he stared it was the cutest smile wide and white and cheerful green eyes dancing behind it hey cut it out this was not appropriate hell hed lost sense of what was appropriate or not he ran his fingers through his hair againyeah hed meant to get a haircut but when was there ever time then he decided he was staring at her and wondering about haircuts when he should be pouring whisky he turned on his heel and headed for the living room he poured two decent tumblers decided ice was for sissies and headed back to the kitchen she was still on the floor you want to sit at the table if i get up i might never get down again the fridge can wait youve done so much cleaning im feeling like a he hesitated he didnt know what he felt like he thought out of control yeah maybe even more out of control than when his house had been full of dirty dishes you must really miss your wife hed reached down to give her a hand up he stilled and shanni stared at his hand shrugged and heaved herself up he shook himself sorry hey dont apologize i only lost my boyfriend and im doing dumb things like not contacting my parents and making sure they hadnt changed the locks before i come all the way to australia theyve changed the locks and put in tenants she said grimly youd think a daughter would know youre not close see theres the thing she said sitting at the table and taking her first sip of whisky she wrinkled her nose in appreciation i thought we were i phone once a week youd think changing locks would be something theyd mention ii guess sorry she took another sip we were talking about you your wife you lost your boyfriend he didnt die she said darkly mores the pity right he said distracted she looked really cute when she talked darkly so you just lost him he went to bed with a model she glowered some more in my bed and then when i threw ice water over the pair of them he went out and spent our shared credit card to the hilt and he isnt even sorry she glowered at the absent boyfriend and model but were talking about you you and the five kids and the dead wife and social welfare ive never seen such a mess thank you she blinked then she put the whisky very carefully on the table im sorry she said ive had a long day i landed in sydney at five this morning i took a cab to my parents and found theyd absquatulated so i took my dads car and drove to my girlfriends apartment to find a bedsit smaller than a shoebox then i remembered rubys letter and rang you and asked if you still wanted a housekeeper and you said yes itd be fine if i came straight away so i ended up here to find youd absquatulated as well absquatulated he said distracted taken yourself off to points unknown generally leaving a mess behind my mothers a linguistics professor get over it right he said feeling dazed i didntabsquatulate you just went to sleep ive said im sorry the kids were terrified they were thinking theyd get carted off to care she wrinkled her nose some more perplexed see thats the part i dont get why is welfare so interested in you have you done something awful i mean today was appalling but that sort of mess happens in the best families if i told you how many times my parents forgot meanyway thats beside the point i understand your wife dying was awful but social welfare isnt usually a monster she paused thinking things through you know unless things are really dire the authorities dont take kids from parents i cant see them dragging children off to foster care just cos their dad went to sleep in the sun after a night with a sick baby no i so have you done something ghastly i mean not that youd confess but ive been scrubbing the fridge and thinking that i should just leave except that im broke and i dont have anywhere to go except aunt rubys you dont want to go to rubys he was having trouble keeping up ruby has macramé meetings in her kitchen every weekday morning shes offered to teach me and she says she has to get your permission anyway if she wants to have me for more than just a couple of weeks which is weird she hesitated but youre sidetracking me i keep thinking of wendy wendy like she was when i arrived terrified expecting the worst there must be something horribly wrong for her to look like that i dont know what it is and maybe i should leave but ive decided i need to figure it out because now im hooked if youre hurting these kids ill youll what i dont know she confessed i cant figure out why theyre terrified because the way you cuddle bessyyou even seem nice thank you you know what i mean you look normal yet i was a fifteenyearold in a pinstripe suit when first you met me youre distracting me she looked at his whisky glass he looked at it too you do think im a drinker hey i just wondered i mean if i had five kids and a dead wife i might crack as well and it would explain it explains nothing then you need to give me some other explanation she said because i want to know why your kids are terrified he stared into his whisky glass tell me or i retreat to macramé his eyes flew to hers he expected to see laughter but he didnt she was deadly serious she really cared he thought she was worried about these kids the sensation was so novel that he blinked theres a simple explanation he said meeting her look head on which is these arent my kids theyre nothing to do with me until twelve months ago id never seen any of them before in my life chapter three there was a long pause shanni had pulled open the fire door of the oven to let the warmth of the flames give comfort to a kitchen that was only just warming up the fire crackled behind them he should put music on or something he thought inconsequentially the atmosphere was too intimate maybe music would make it worse theyre not your kids she said at last she wasnt taking her eyes off him seemingly ready to judge by how he looked as well as what he said no he said there was nothing else to say i did wonder she said mildly they dont look like you they keep forgetting to call you dad and they didnt know if you had abba abba never mind i thought maybe theyd been calling you pierce and youd made them change for the welfare people i made them change for the welfare people but she sighed she downed the dregs of her whisky looked at the bottle and sighed again ive got jet lag and a muddled head she confessed dont give me any more whisky and bessys likely to be up in the night he rose and took the whisky bottle into the next room returned and closed the door firmly behind him they both looked at the door with longing but no they were mature adults and there were no answers in a whisky bottle ill make coffee he said and she nodded mature adults coffee right youd better tell me she said while he fiddled with cups and kettle and instant coffee instant shed come from the coffee centre of the world agh i married their mother he said right she thought about it so bessys yours no so bessys not yours theyre none of them mine so when did you marry their mother seven months ago just after bessy was born three weeks before maureen died oh she said in a small voice i see do you he sounded angry he had his back to her but she could hear tension and angerand resentment hey i cleaned your fridge she said im the patsy in this setup anger faded his shoulders shookjust a little the patsy the pig in the middle the girl with the soggy cucumber shoot around me but not at me im sorry thats better she said approvingly as he carried mugs of coffee across to the table he really was good looking she thought absently and that hair was so ruffled she could just reach over and touch it cut it out she told herself fiercely what is it with you and longhaired men tell me about maureen she said instead and took a mouthful of coffee swallowing regrets about a magnificent coffee maker shed left behind in london okay it was michaels but it had been bought with her credit card and it made the best coffee and that rat she wasnt thinking clearly maureen she said again and pierce looked confused look im jet lagged she said im not making sense to me you suddenly looked a long way away i was mourning coffee tell me about maureen she was my foster sister sort of there was a pause sort of foster sister hmm ruby only fosters boys you think im telling lies im not thinking anything she said thinking hurts shes great your aunt ruby shes lovely to everyone i guess whoops im sorry shanni said repentantly i dare say you and ruby have a lovely personalized meaningful relationship and i wouldnt dream of disparaging it he choked on his coffee shes a bitbatty he said and shanni grinned were together on that one but youd better tell me the rest its not much use you want me to finish the refrigerator i okay ill finish the refrigerator anyway she said and gave him a rueful smile im a sucker for a job well done but tell me or ill bust she pulled up a spare kitchen chair put her feet up had a couple of sips of coffeeughand forced herself to relax youre one of rubys strays that must have been hard i guess he shook his head no i had a mother who didnt want me but wouldnt put me up for adoption the times with ruby were not the hard times you come from a nice normal family are you kidding well a family with a mum and a dad and id imagine you were wanted she thought of her eccentric parents and she grinned yep they wanted me they werent quite sure what to do with me when they got methey still arentbut they wanted me i was a mistake she looked at his stern face there was a curl dripping over his left eye she could just cut it out you were a mistake my mother got pregnant during an affair with a very wealthy man she thought getting pregnant would force him to marry her she was wrong oh and he denied everything i can imagine my mother might have been a bit he sighed anyway there wasnt dna testing back then she was screwed so she put me into foster care but every time she started a relationship she pulled me out again to play happy families and one of those relationships included maureen i dont understand no well he shrugged you have no idea what drop kicks my mother used to fall for jack was maybe the worst but he had a kid too maureen he ended up abandoning her but when he met my mother maureen was nine and i was seven so shanni prodded he looked like he was a long way awayremembering he was staring straight through her now he gave himself a slight shake as if tugging himself back to now okay dreary story jack was a sadist but my mother thought everything he did was wonderful so we were at his mercy but maureen was older and a bit harder than me and for some reason she decided she liked me he shrugged okay lets be honest i loved the idea of having a big sister and she thought having a brother was cool it wasnt like we had anything else the words chilled her and she winced but pierce didnt notice he was seeing back a long time ago she was there for me he said softly it was the longest of any of my mothers relationships we were together two years and every time he once more a shrug well she was always there for me shed fly at jack like a tigress biting scratching yelling shed end up as badly beaten as me but it got sowell he knew when he raised a hand to me he had us both to contend with and it helped oh hooray for maureen shanni said shakily and pierce nodded faintly smiling she was great and then then my mother and jack split and we were put in different foster homes we tried to stay in touch he said sadly maureen used to write every six months or so id get a scrawly letter telling me what she was doing in her life then when we reached adulthood the letters ceased the last letter said shed met the man of her dreams and was moving to perth but he wasnt the man of her dreams whod know pierce said bitterly all i do know is that maureen was wild as be damned from what ive learned since she seemed bent on selfdestruction drugs shanni thought of the five children no she didnt do drugs that would have been suicide she was diabetic oh she just wanted kids pierce said wearily all her life she wanted a familymaybe that was why she was so defensive of meand she was going to get a family no matter how much it took but the diabetes thats what i meant about selfdestruction every time she got pregnant her body seemed to disintegrate only she just couldnt seem to stop herself he hesitated shed meet some lowlife and think he was the answer to her prayers and end up pregnant but not with you shed been in western australia he said wed lost touch completely only then just under a year ago she came to find me i was doing very nicely as an architect in sydney id bought this place as a weekender im a confirmed bachelor and i was pretty content with what life was dealing me but but maureens kidneys were failing she was pregnant and refusing to terminate but shed been told the pregnancy would destroy what was left of her kidneys she sat in my office in sydney and she told me everything about her life she spelled it all out and she asked for my help she hated asking but she was desperate oh pierce maureen was so ill she was facing having to have the children fostered she couldnt bear subjecting them to the life shed had shed brought it on herself but well maybe i could see what was driving her and while she was talking that timethe times she took the beating for me came back i didnt have a choice theres a dialysis unit at murribah half an hour north of here i offered her a home here for as long as she needed silence she stared across the table at him for a long long moment then she smiled i always thought you were a nice boy she said warmly despite the pinstripes he smiled back but it cost him a bit that smile it was hard for him to tell this story she thought okay moving on you asked for the whole story so youll get it i was already having trouble with the neighbours here what i didnt realize when i bought this place was that one of the bidders was a huge dairy corporation theyd been looking for a site for their new factory which would have meant the locals didnt have to pay cartage for their milk but id fallen in love with the place and paid more than it was worth so the factory went somewhere else then id no sooner taken possession when along came four kids and a mother who looked desperately sick and was pregnant again i drove a bright yellow sports car when the kids looked starving maureen wouldnt talk to anyone about her background and no one ever asked me ive been judged and found wanting in just about every respect she swallowed im so sorry dont be im sorry enough for myself anyway maureen had bessy and she grew even more ill we were hoping against hope for a transplant but it didnt happen somarriage you see social welfare had taken care of these kids before in periods when maureen was desperately sick so the kids were on file its not hard to understand there are good people in the department who were genuinely worried then we had the community badmouthing us maureen started believingand maybe she was rightthat as soon as she died theyd send the kids to foster homes regardless of what i wanted there are some good she started cautiously but he was before her you dont need to tell me there are some great foster homes pierce said explosively foster parents are some of the best people in the world generous big hearted taking on all comers even though getting attached comes at the price of having their hearts ripped out over and over goodness she said did i hit a nerve he managed an apology for a smile yes he said consciously lowering his voice sorry if i hadnt had ruby id be in such a mess now but i was on my own and these kids arent despite maureens often incompetent care they love each other and theyll defend each other to the death they should never be separated and theres the problem you think therell be a foster parent wholl take on five kids i guessmaybe not theyd be put into a group home he said the welfare people told maureen that as if it was something good a house in the community with paid carers thats what maureen couldnt come to terms with a series of people employed to care maureen hated the idea and by the time she became desperately sick i hated the idea as well youve seen wendy shes been maureens principal carer for years it took so long to teach her that i could help even now she doesnt completely trust me why should she but i couldnt beari just couldnt bear so you married their mother yes we moved fast in the window of opportunity before maureen became too ill we married i applied to legally adopt them maureen filed everything saying she approved and she assigned me as their legal guardian oh pierce its not noble he said at least it wasnt supposed to be noble im paid ridiculous amounts for the work i do i thought id house the kids employ a housekeeper someone to run the farm and come down here on weekends but have you any idea how hard it is to find a housekeeper for five kids in this community i found a woman who did intermittent babysitting for a while but the kids hated her and she quit two weeks ago and now weve had chicken pox followed by school holidays im going round the twist i see that you are and then ruby said shed contacted you and persuaded you to give us a try hence ive had one day of child care a clean kitchen and a sparky clean fridge and kids who werent taken away from me today for which im eternally grateful he hesitated shanni dare i ask that youll stay im not a housekeeper youre excellent at scrubbing thats only because im suffering severe loss of pride i need to vent my spleen scrubbing works ruby says youre an artist im not no i love dabbling with paints did you see my cow this afternoon perfect except for one leg looking longer than the others i measured it its not its perspective but i cant work it out so youre an abstract artist i did a degree in fine arts i worked as a curator for a tiny gallery here and an even tinier one in london then i scraped up enough money to open my own it was miniscule but it was devoted to one particular kind of art that i love my parents lent me money i didnt eat i put everything into it that i had and and like i said i caught my artist boyfriend in bed with one of my models i tossed ice water on them and he retaliated by using my credit card to spend a fortune i had the choice of risking my parents money and keeping on trying or bailing out i bailed out ouch he hesitated you never tried recovering your money he said hed have me for assault i see he said cautiously so you fled home yep to you and now ill go to rubys ill get a job somewhere and move on but itd help if you could stay here for a bit while you regroup it might she admitted but i dont intend to fall in love with these kids of course not so dont even think i might be a longterm proposition im not looking for a longterm proposition i dont fall for kids i dont fall for you uhoh why had she said that it had come from nowhere but suddenly it was important that she say it he so needed a shave he looked so vulnerable stop it she gave herself a sharp metaphoric slap to the side of the head do not fall for pierce maclachlan because you feel sorry for him just because im a soft touch she whispered and he smiled two of us two soft touches were doomed speak for yourself there was another whimper from above his head but this time it didnt stop it built fast to a wail he winced set his coffee mug down with a sigh and rose she slept for three hours i cant expect much more what will you do now cuddle her until she goes back to sleep ruby said youre not getting work done the yells from upstairs were getting more insistent define work but i guess it doesnt matter i just take one dayone momentat a time he walked to the door and then paused shanni youve helped me enormously today and im deeply grateful if you leave right now ill still be grateful i wont put any more pressure on you but you do need a bed for at least tonight wendy showed me her mothers bedroom shed already made up the bed wendy wants you to stay he put up his hands in mock defence i know i said no pressure he raised his gaze to the ceiling okay bessy im coming well leave shanni here to make up her mind iill think about it please chapter four she cleared the dishes she finished wiping out the fridge and replacing the few things that were actually edible then she made her way through the darkened house to her bedroom she could hear footsteps upstairs pacing back and forth there was a soft male rumble pierce was comforting bessy he was a bachelor hed taken on five children he didnt know the enormity of what hed done left her gasping hes a very nice boy she told the dark and she giggled but then her giggle faded this was deadly serious pierce was fighting to keep these kids together the least she could do was help but she didnt do kids and she had a career to resurrect youve stuffed up big time she told the dark she walked over to the bed and gave a tentative bounce this must be the master bedroom pierce had let maureen have the master bedroom why had he bought a house with so many bedrooms had he thought of having a big family himself he really was a hunk the thought of him pacing back and forth above her head with a baby cradled against his shoulder it was a very very sexy image whoa thats exactly the attitude that gets you into trouble over and over again she scolded herself and thats the scary thing about staying hes extraordinarily attractive and hes up to his eyeballs in domesticity and you feel sorry for him and if youre not careful youll be installed as chief cook and bottle washer with your only payment a bit of snogging on the side he hasnt got time for snogging just as well she said it out loud his footsteps paused right above her head i know it itches she heard him say but we all need to sleep a whimper in with me again bess we need to cut this out he was more than a hunk she decided he was gorgeous and up to his neck in kids so go to bed and stop thinking about him she told herself and crossed to the window to pull the blind there was a cow six inches from her nose she managed to stay silent the cow gazed in and she felt extraordinarily pleased with herself that she hadnt yelped the last thing she needed was for pierce to come racing downstairs because she was scared of a cow the cow was outside and she was inside fine it was a very large cow its face was enormous and its eyes looked sort of wild it wasnt placidly gazing its head was moving back and forth as if it was terrified did cows get scared upstairs bessy started howling again obviously not even the enticement of sleeping with pierce could placate her there was a moments silence as bessy paused for breath to start the next yowl git out for a moment she thought she was imagining things who git out of our garden it was a childs voice yelling it sounded like an attempt to be commanding but there was an edge of fear showing through she pulled up the windowjust a littlenot so much that the cow could put its head in the cow had shifted aside turning to face whoever was shouting the moon was almost full she could see clearly into the garden it was sevenyearold donald the skinny one with the scared eyes and the look that said he distrusted the world the rest of the kids had enjoyed painting this afternoon but donald had painted like he was performing a duty he looked like a kid who was waiting for the axe to fall what are you doing out there she called and the cow turned to look at her still with the wild eyes it was a really big cow huge it shouldnt be in the garden donald said struggling to sound brave someones left the gate open i saw it out the window itll eat the rose pierce planted when our mum died he hiccupped on a sob bravery disappearing im shooing it out the gate but it wont go donald youre too little be shooing cows ill get pierce hes busy with bessy she saw his small shoulders stiffen in resolution and im not too little i can do it but git on out donald said but hed moved backwards behind a camellia bush and she could no longer see him despite his defiance he sounded terrified cows are harmless she told herself recalling the words of her farmingtype friend right shed go upstairs and offer to take bessy while pierce sorted this she thought but bessys howls were becoming frantic two perils crying baby or cow each equally daunting shoo donald yelled but the cow didnt move she could do this shanni jefferson cowgirl right donald hop up on the veranda she yelled out the window ill cope with the cow she sounded decisive she thought pleased with the way her words had come out in charge a new life skill coming up it was lucky she was still dressed in jeans and windcheater cowgirl gear she headed through the darkened house towards the back door she wouldnt mind a torchbut donald was on his own finding a torch would take time torches were for wusses outside the garden was rambling and overgrown but the moon was almost full rounding the house she could see the vague shape of the cow framed against the light from her bedroom window it still looked seriously big gigantic how big did cows get she couldnt see donald the veranda at the front of the house started just past her bedroom window donald wasnt on the veranda she could see where the cow had come from there was a gate leading to the paddocks it was wide open where there was one cow there were likely to be more cows she looked round nervously expecting more shadows nothing soone cow and donald shoo donalds voice came from the camellias the cow was looking away from her it was moving towards the sound of donalds voice pacing shaking its head it was so bigso big something winged past her ear and stung whatever it was must have struck the cow as the creature jolted rearing back as if terrified donald she yelled finally admitting to herself that she was really really scared whatever jules had told her about cows being harmless suddenly she didnt believe a word of it and what had hit her ear donald the creature was lowering its massive head it was concentrating every inch of its enormous being on something behind the camellias it was pacing shshanniit was a terrified whisper and to the creature it seemed like a starters gun the creature heaved itself forward donald she screamed and she launched herself blindly out of the darkness lashing out at the shape in front of her afterwards she couldnt believe shed done it the creature was launching itself at the sound of donalds quavering voice shanni hit it side on walloping into it with such force that it was shifted off course get inside she screamed run donald run pierce the child screamed pierce good call she thought but she wasnt actually thinking all that clearly the creature was swinging aside snorting rearing back dear god what did bullfighters do they ran if they had any sense they ran but the creature had a onetrack mind it was swinging back to face donald again donald was trying to scramble onto the veranda but the veranda was almost three feet above the garden and the steps were too far away hed never pull himself up it was moving again no she launched herself forward again screaming smashing her fist into the side of the creatures head it flung round so fast she couldnt move to avoid it pierce donald screamed again it had horns she grabbed a horn and clung stupidly crazily it swung so wildly she let go tossed aside landing in a limp heap four feet from the creatures head it backed to see what was attacking it finally deflected from donald she rolled sideways trying to find her feet it was moving it was moving no she pushed herself fiercely sideways rolling into the undergrowth oh god a horn hit her shoulder with a sickening thud she felt a crash and a fierce jabbing pain but she kept rolling no but suddenly there was another player get get get get it was a mans fierce shout pierce he was launching himself down from the veranda yelling at the top of his lungs his yells were filling the night she was flinching for the next impact but it didnt come get get get she rolled again deeper into shadow and dared to look out the creature was staring in at her hitting the ground with its hoof gathering momentum for another rush but pierce was beside it silhouetted against the moon swinging something that looked like a rifle shoot it she thought but she was too dazed to think more move move move pierces yells could have woken the dead he was powering into the creatures path putting himself between shanni and everything else lashing out like his rifle was a scythe the creature swung to face him get get get pierce was giving it no time to think he was right in its face swinging his weapon smashing forward he was yelling hitting pushing the creature backed backed some more pierce was following it right on top of it giving it no quarter back back out of the garden back the creature turned confused beaten lumbering towards the gate and as it did shanni sawa dangly bit underneath as if shed needed confirmation it was through the gate now the great wooden gate swung closed with a crash the rifle was tossed aside donald are you okay donald pierce was striding through the garden hauling himself up on the veranda tugging donald into his arms what the hell shanni donald quavered are you okay she could see their shapes on the veranda huddled together yes it was a whisper it hit shanni shes down there shanni he put donald away at arms length where it was trying to hit her ii think it did stay there mate dont move he was jumping down from the veranda crashing through the undergrowth searching in the direction the bull had been aiming for shanni shanni where are you shanni his voice cracked in desperation she had to speak im here she managed but she had to try again because her voice didnt quite work hhere then as he swore and swore again as he dived beneath the undergrowth as he knelt beside her and swore even more as he put his hand on her shoulder and felt the warm stickiness of blood and stopped swearingstopped even breathingshe asked the question she most wanted to know why dont you use test tubes they were all in the kitchen everyone wendy was sitting in the rocker by the fire cradling bessy donald was standing about as close to wendy as he could get abby was at donalds feet hugging his legs bryce had decreed everyone needed cocoa and was making it very slowly his hands were shaking shanni was doing a lot of shaking herself pierce had ripped her windcheater even more than the bull had hed exposed a long shallow graze that ran from her underarm almost to her throat he had a bowl of soapy water and he was washing it and swearing under his breath not in front of the children she whispered i locked that gate he muttered towelling her shoulder with care it was padlocked im not a fool the chains been cut clever bull the bulls sausages he told her then he shook his head no i dont know whats going on but clydes normally even sookier than the cows he services theres things going on i dont understand he was inspecting her wound his face grim i dont think this needs stitching but maybe we need to get you checked out youre thinking of leaving the kids while we go to the nearest hospital if we need to we dont need but just put a bandage on it she said bandages will make me better she looked down into abbys huge eyes dont bandages make things better and jelly beans abby said theres bandages in the bathroom she hugged donalds legs a bit more and then rose stoutly to her feet almost offering herself as personal sacrifice ill get them but i dont know about jelly beans it was a big deal for abby going through the house by herself shanni thought these kids they were the bravest kids she could see exactly why pierce didnt want them separated do we have jelly beans she demanded no pierce said ruefully omission on my part no jelly beans she was watching donald what sort of a dad is this who doesnt supply jelly beans hes okay donald said diffidently yes but he needs help she swallowed her shoulder was in truth really painful but this was no time for whinging donald looked so white he appeared to be about to pass out he needed a mum she thought he needed someone to cuddle him until the terror passed but there was something about the set of his small shoulders that said he wouldnt be accepting cuddles not from her not from pierce he was holding himself aloof pen and paper she said donald fast whatwhy abby reappeared with elastoplast pierce started cutting and sticking ouch ouch and ouch thought shanni a list she said stoutly top of the listjelly beans next on the listbroom pierce said and she blinked we need a broom i broke the top off slamming the gate home you had a broom i thought you had a rifle a broom my hero she muttered hero with broomstick what a man sorry but he was smiling shed made him smile she thought and it felt okay so broom she told donald and the makings of hot dogs why hot dogs pierce asked because i feel like a hot dog and im wounded wounded people can ask for whatever they want i like hot dogs donald said cautiously i think theyre made from bulls she told him and she grinned double rations of hot dogs just as soon as we can get to the store that might be next week pierce warned her i get groceries delivered on monday mondays too far if the stores were open now id want my hot dog now she sighed but im willingat great personal sacrificeto wait till tomorrow wendy and i can take care of the house you can take donald and do a shopping expedition a hot dog hunt does that mean youre staying for a bit wendy asked and it seemed like the whole room held its breath was she she gazed round the room and saw five needful faces six if she counted pierce who was looking like he was trying to look uninterested needful too she thought but then that was suddenly a dangerous thought ware sympathy she told herself sternly but she was still staying if its okay with you she said diffidently and not looking at pierce ive come here nursing shattered pride and now i have a broken shoulder to recover from as well recovering might take some time it took time to settle everyone shanni sat in the big rocker by the fire while pierce put his brood to bed the childrens bedrooms were upstairs as well she could hear them talking in muted tones kids questions pierces rumbling answers bessys plaintive whinging more rumbles a childs voicewendyssounding bossy she should go to bed shanni thought but she was still feeling shaky the gentle rocking of the old chair and the crackling of the flames inside the stove were infinitely comforting silence fell upstairs she might go to sleep where she was and that didnt seem a bad option preferable to going to a strange bed but some plans were doomed to failure why arent you in bed it was pierce standing in the doorway staring across at her in concern im going she said without much conviction as soon as im warm its a warm night i guess it is i just got cold he looked worried but he was standing in the doorway not coming further you want more of that whisky no ii shouldnt me neither but its scary how much i want some he shook his head hell shanni im sorry you said the gate was locked thats what i cant understand he hesitated but he still wasnt coming further into the room ive just double checked the chains been cut with bolt cutters and someones stirred clyde up im not threatening to turn him into sausages any more hes standing against the fence trembling almost as much as you are theres a series of tiny puncture wounds along his flank id suspect something like a peashooters been used to hurt him normally if you opened clydes gate he wouldnt even notice it was open but if you opened it and started shooting pellets at him hed get terrified hed lumber into the garden and if he kept hurting and he didnt understand why then hed be likely to attack anything that moved she was staring at him horrified but thatsthats criminal thats awful theyll be aiming at me he said grimly theyll assume itd be me whod go out and check on cattle loose in the garden theyd never assume itd be a sevenyearold do they hate you that much its not hate he said grimly its just they dont know me im a weekend millionaire who stopped a factory going ahead that the community needed the fact that no one warned me is irrelevant and now as well as being rich and stupid and forcing the community to lose its factory im a single dad who social welfare has in its sights for child neglect yeah theyd like me to pack up and leave so why dont you she asked cautiously i you could go back to your architecture in the city the kids could go to school and to day care you could hire a housekeeper easier in the city it wont work he shook his head or im not sure itd work maybe itll come to that but maureen badly wanted these kids to have space she hesitated and then she said wise for now well at least you have me for a bit there was a baffled pause at least it was baffled on shannis part why the silence i think i just offered to be housekeeper she said at last cautiously if you want me i do want you it was said with such force that she blinkedand then managed a smile well thank you i can see ruby in you that made her blink again little and dumpy and wide astern he smiled at that grimness easing id never have said wide astern but im little and dumpy what you did tonight was the bravest youre saying that makes up for little and dumpy he grinned if i was in the market for a woman little and dumpy would be the last way id describe you youre not in the market for a woman what do you think i guess youve got five kids so youre not in the market for any more family i never wanted this much i sure as hell dont need a wife as well how had this conversation happened just lucky you told me she managed i was already planning the bridal it brought him up short hell shanni i didnt mean its okay she told him relenting ive done enough bridal planning for a lifetime with icewater mike thats the one i thought i was in love how stupid can you be no more relationships for me but youve told the kids that ill stay for a bit yes i have she took a deep breath trying to sort things out in her head i really am in trouble she confessed deciding to lay it all out i used every cent i had getting back to australia to find my parents had sublet their house my best friend has a bedsitter smaller than your broom closet ive been out of the country for eight years and theres no one else i can crash on except ruby and her macramé ladies its some penthouse shes in pierce said forty squares of luxury overlooking sydney harbour shanni frowned suddenly thinking sideways rubyruby of the gorgeous sons ruby who didnt have a cent to her name suddenly swanning in a penthouse in sydneys most exclusive harbourfront suburb you gave her the penthouse we all did hasnt ruby told you about the rest of her boys of course she has she remembered the photograph ruby carried with her everywhere ruby dotty old ruby whod never had a penny to bless herself with whod spent every minute of her life devoted to her boys blake connor sam darcy dominic nikolai and pierce she whispered do i have them right thats us rubys boys she took us in and she hauled every one of us up by the bootstraps she was left with nothing for her seventieth birthday we gave her the apartment the stipulation is that she doesnt sell it or give it away to freeloaders and shes no longer permitted to take in strays not permitted its time we started protecting her from herself if we hadnt stipulated it would you be in her guest room no she sighed well if it wasnt for the macramé maybe she does have the reputation of not turning anyone out you really are desperate i can get a job i guess the art worlds so small though people know my gallery failed so youll accept this job i guess for a bit why didnt he come into the room she wondered he was standing at the doorway as if afraid to come further i wont bite she said but he didnt smile no what are you afraid of youre rubys niece by marriage yes then were practically related family she agreed and waited maybe i should say right nowi dont want any sort of relationship her shoulder was hurting it had been hurting all this while but shed forgotten about it for a little now it slammed back and it was like hed slapped her what are you saying i didnt mean you did mean thats the second weird comment are you expecting me to jump you no i thats good because im not she snapped im nuts to be here seriously totally barmy id be best throwing myself on the mercy of the parish or whatever indigent people do these days its not really as bad as that she glared no she conceded all i have to do is contact my parents and ill be fine but im offering to stay here why because donald was going to tackle that bull all by himself rather than haul you away from his baby sister because wendys looking older than her years because this house is a messthis family is a messand i need a job so i might as well do one thats worth doing you say youre wealthy it was such a change of tack that he blinked iyes could you afford to take us all to the beach the beach you see these kids look like theyre expecting the weight of the world to descend on their heads any minute or maybe its already descended have they been away from this place since their mother died no but theyve been sick yes but and its school holidays yes there you go then she said take us away to the beach how the hell am i going to take five kidsincluding one chickenpoxed babyto the beach ill come too she said patiently i like the beach the kids are recuperating from pox im recuperating from mortification and you need to work he blinked work hed practically forgotten about work i cant of course you cant work here she agreed and the kids are so spooked that i cant see things changing so what i suggest is that we hire two apartments for a couple of weeks two one for you and one for me she said right on the beach somewhere luxurious see how good i am at spending other peoples money how would that work at night ill share with the girls and you share with the boys she said during the day the kids can stay with me and well play at the beach if we stay at a decent resort therell be babysitters as well and if we find one whos had the pox then we can leave bessy a little i could really use a week or two at the beach whoops until now it hadnt been about her shed tried really hard to couch this in terms that said she was doing this out of the goodness of her heart but shed let it out she heard it the moment her words left her mouth and she saw pierces face change you want to go to the beach i had the flu she said ruefully the morning i found mikewell it was the start of three weeks of being sick and every single day since then ive thought of the beach mum and dads house is on the beach north of sydney thats where i was headed then tonight i was under that blasted camellia waiting for clyde to turn me into sausages and all i could think of was that i hadnt made it to the beach his face softened for a momentfor just a momenthis face changed he smiled a lovely gentle smile that made something inside her twist i could lend you money to go the beach by yourself then he shook his head no after all youve done for my family today its not a loan you deserve to have a holiday without us i may be dumb she said with dignity shaking her head but im hooked now all or nothing you dont want a longterm commitment to these kids are you kidding of course i dont but a week or two at the beach while we recover it does sound he dug his hands deep in his pockets and considered what must he be seeing she thought a waif a dumb failed art curator with skin that was too pale after too long in england and three weeks of the flu a woman whod been rolling round in the garden fighting with a bull bloodand dustspattered tear streakedokay there might just have been a few tears when no one had been looking i really do need to work he said at last i mean yeah im wealthy but its not bottomless theres a project i was going to have to renege on if i could get time on that we could stay here she admitted but we all need to bounce a bit you mean you do she tilted her chin yes she said its pure selfishness on my part but then she shook her head no im looking at wendy too she needsshe needs to be a kid you think i dont know that so can we go to the beach how the hell can i organize see heres the thing she said apologetically i might be a failed art curator but i have a splinter skill its called web junkie you put me in front of an internet connection and ill have us at the beach this time tomorrow promise he stared at her she stared back her shoulder hurt she thought and pierce could see it he was watching her but there was something behind his eyes that said he was seeing further than skin deep the beach focus on the beach youre onhe said at last so softly she hardly heard him so when the kids wake up in the morning well be packing for the beach youd better get that tyre fixed though ive got my dads car ill follow behind im not relinquishing my independence that much well talk about it in the morning at last he left the door crossing to where she sat huddled before the fire let me help you to bed im fine youre still shaking im just not used to bulls she said with as much dignity as she could muster no ones used to a bull like that he could have killed you if you hadnt gone out he may well have killed donald gee thats the sort of thing to say to stop me shaking she muttered shanni youre beat he hesitated for a moment and then shrugged seeming to shake off whatever scruples he might be feeling before she knew what he intended he bent and scooped her up into his arms holding her close what the im taking you to bed he told her but not downstairs yeah thats maureens room no ones been in it since she died theres a spare bed in wendys room i think youd be better off sleeping with the kids im a grown woman she protested hey pierce im an independent career woman are you putting me to bed with the children too right i am he told her you need company to get you to sleep he gave a rueful grin id like to offer my services but my beds already occupied me and bessythe woman of my dreams she didnt protest he carried her into the spare bed in the girls room he helped her off with what remained of her windcheater he would have helped her more but she suddenly woke enough to be independent im fine she said and suddenly the atmosphere changed shed let him cradle her against him as he climbed the stairs shed seemed to need his warmthhis strengthbut suddenly there was tension he retreated leaving her to it she was confused he could see she was confusedand so was he back in his bedroom bessy slept which was a mixed blessing when im awake you might as well be awake too he told her when i go to sleep thats when youll wail but bessy wasnt listening she had her chubby fist pressed into her mouth and she was seriously sucking her tiny knuckles as she seriously slept he should sleep himself but too much had happened too fast his heart rate was still up there and it wasnt going to slow down soon when hed put his hands under the camellia searching hed felt the blood and for a couple of awful moments until hed carried her to the veranda and been able to see the extent of the damage hed thought the worst well his heart rate hadnt yet settled i do not need someone else to worry about he told the sleeping bessy a waif whose boyfriends duped her out of her livelihood whose parents have left her stranded are you kidding shes a mature woman pushing thirty she has to be did you see the way she organized the cleaning shes not a kid its the way she looks at me bessy stirred and grunted and waved her small fist in the air he took it and she wrapped her fingers around his middle finger and clung domesticity closed in from all sides i should never have bought this house so sell it no well get out of here at least take miss bossy boots to the sea give us all a break he sighed sleep was nowhere miss bossy boots was right before him that awful moment when hed dragged her out from under the bush before hed seen thats what this is he told himself its horror and gratitude she saved donald shes some woman see that was just the route his thoughts didnt want to take hed made one mistake in the past or two he admitted being ruthlessly honest one was buying this place it had been a dumbass romantic gesture his brothers had made him see how stupid it was the second was his response to maureen maureen if youre dyinghell of course you can bring the kids here ill take care of you and now his life was down the toilet his work was a disaster if he didnt get this project in miss bossy boots had a point two apartments but the kids would want to be with him or hed worry if they werent there had to be a solution beach kids castle he sat up so fast that bessy woke and glared then grinned in the moonlight and held up her arms for a cuddle right he said hugging bessy obligingly and throwing back the covers lets go look on the internet only im looking for a very specific place a place i already know about a place where i can back off and leave the emotion to trained professionalism including how he felt towards shanni how he might be feeling but he was admitting nothing its a package deal he told bessy ruby says its a place of miracles lets hope shes right chapter five shanni went to sleep in a skinny kids bed with wendy and abby sleeping almost within touching distance she woke and the kids beds were empty she could hear voices from downstairs the room was empty she lay and stared at the ceiling watching early morning sunbeams flicker on the wooden beams of the ceiling this was the loveliest old farmhouse she could see why pierce had wanted it it was a home the home hed never had but he didnt want attachment he didnt want marriage it was like hed bought the place just so he could bring up stray kids maureen must have been so relieved to find him pierce a nice boy he was nice she thought still half asleep drifting in the warmth and comfort of her tiny bed he was really nice yeah and shed thought mike was nice she told herself harshly as she realized where her thoughts were taking her she needed to haul them right back under control her judgement in men was seriously flawed she needed time outat least a year or so before shed even think about dipping a toe in the water again and thered be no dipping of toes with someone like pierce he had five kids itd be like jumping over niagara falls right so stay sensible she gave herself a mental shake and rolled onto her side preliminary to getting out of bed mistake last night shed had what she thought was a grazed shoulder nowmaybe it was a compound fracture plus gangrene or something worse she whimpered and rolled onto her back ouch said a voice from the door she looked over and there was pierce he had a couple of kids behind him he was smiling hed shaved she thought inconsequentially he was wearing linen pants and a green polo shirt with a little alligator icon on the chest he looked like hed stepped straight off the cover of vogue he made her feel its nine oclock wendy said from behind him pierce said its time to wake you ive made a doctors appointment for you in half an hour pierce said apologetically or we would have let you sleep longer a doctors appointment the man from the garage brought a new tyre for mums wagon bryce said so we can come with you theres a little seat in the back wendy added so its a sevenseater isnt that lucky cos theres seven of us abby added importantly you want to hear me count hows the arm pierce asked that was the only thing that she could make sense of she lay back and looked at him solidly looked at him at his anxious face at the amazing good looks of the man at his worried frown and the way his brow just puckered at the edges i feel like i need painkillers she confessed but then i already feel like ive taken them giddy you do need to see a doctor maybe she said cautiously right then will you stay in bed i can carry you to the car im getting up she said indignantly youre sure yes do you need help to get dressed no in factand she wasnt admitting this for quidsshed gone to sleep in her bra and knickers it had hurt too much to take her bra off wendy stay and help her pierce ordered the rest of you breakfast bryce is on toast duty therell be half a ton toasted by the time you get down he smiled at her that heartstopping smile that made her heart well not stop but it was a nearrun thing take care of her wendy i oh and weve organized the beach he added as if it was an afterthought your offer of internet hunting was noted with gratitude but weve found our own place were going to a castle bryce said sounding awed a castle at the beach the castle at dolphin bay so were having hot dogs today and beach tomorrow as soon as pierce has found someone to take care of the farm she felt like she was caught in a tidal wave washing her along with a momentum that didnt allow her time for breath not that she wanted to breathe her shoulder hurt boy did it hurt it hurt all the time she dressed and all the time she had breakfast and it hurt as she walked out to the car she was aware of pierces eyes on her every step of the way so she fought it she grinned at the antics of the kidsshe tried to keep up with the backchatbut in the car she subsided into blessed silence she didnt speak again until they pulled up outside the doctors surgery pierce was out of the car almost as soon as they stopped hauling open the passenger door helping her out his expression grave well done you he said softly and he put his finger under her chin in a gesture of reassurance we should have called the ambulance last night what a hero im not a hero she managed but she whished he wouldnt do this look at her like this touch her shed thought he was fabulous when he was fifteen hed grownfabulouser did you get any sleep at all i was jet lagged she managed i would have slept if id been on the rack and thats how you feel this morning like you spent the night on the rack a bit he was helping the kids out of the car now um where are you guys going were coming to the doctors with you bryce explained you have to be kidding she stared at them like they were out of their collective minds if you get an injection you need someone to hold your hand abby said and put out her hand in offering ill be fine shanni said backing away what was she getting into okay well fetch our mended tyre and do the supermarket shopping while we wait pierce told her grinning but i want the truth about what the doctor says there was no way shanni was giving him the truth about what the doctor said because after a cursory glance at her armbadly bruised lacerations youd expect it to be painful for a few days ill prescribe painkillersthe doctor started in on a subject he cared about more than shanni what the hell is that idiot about letting cattle wander the mans a lunatic there was such dislike in the doctors voice that she flinched the bolt to the paddock was cut she said confused its criminal negligence or worse but its not pierces fault pierce should be calling in the police its criminal negligence he agreed but its not mr maclachlan who should be calling the police its you if he let bulls graze without protective barriers he grimaced its the last straw theres no way im letting those children stay at risk he reached for the phone something was seriously screwy she put her hand firmly on the telephone forcing him to replace it indulge me she said slowly charge me for a long consultation if you must but ive been employed as a nanny for pierces children i need you to be honest as one professional to another tell me why you think pierce maclachlan is a bad parent supermarket shopping was pierces least favourite pastime not that these kids were ill behavedon the contrary theyd had such a hard time while their mother had been ill that every time he put anything but bread and pasta in the trolley it seemed an occasion for general rejoicing but supermarkets in small country towns were full of small country people thats what they were he thought as he passed one matron after another with her nose raised in sniffy disapproval small minded and mean where was the legendary country hospitality nowhere it was a great idea of shannis to go to the beach maybe he should move the whole lot of them there permanently though wherever he went hed probably get this level of disapproval he thought single dad with a gaggle of disparate kids can you tell me where the hotdog rolls are he asked a middleaged woman stacking shelves and she practically bristled aisle ten she snapped its aisle three shannis voice shocked them all it was so loud it stopped everyone in their tracks he swivelled to see where the voice was coming from shanni was at the end of their aisle and she was holding a microphone the mike was obviously the one used for messages such as gimme a price on the broccoli shanni seemed to have purloined it for her personal use i can see bread from here she boomed hotdog rolls in aisle three the ladys telling lies i never the shelfstacking ladys jaw dropped almost to her ankles theres a lot of that happening shanni said conversationally and then as the girl at the checkout counter made a grab for her microphone shanni shook her head smiled sweetly and stepped sideways i need it theres a pet she said i have a very important announcement what the girl demanded but she was too late shanni was in full flow she was standing in front of the middle register giving her a clear view of almost everyone in their various aisles which was a lot of people this must be pay day or something pierce thought bewildered the supermarket was packed many of you know pierce maclachlan she said conversationally and he had a frantic urge to surge forward and grab the microphone but he couldnt quite get his legs to work he bought a local farm shanni went on for those who dont know its a neat little farm with a fabulous farmhouse pierce is a city architect im assuming he saw the farm advertised in a city paper he made an appointment with the agent he liked what he saw and he bought it no problem except there was a corporation negotiating to buy it so they could set up a factory here the factory then had to be built on a site near the next town which means many of you now have to pay an additional cartage to get your milk there pierce is sorry about that but its not his fault he didnt know if youre blaming him then its totally unfair unchristian really there was absolute silence customers in pierces aisle turned and stared at pierce and his brood of kids everyone else stared at shanni so pierce moved in she said and while everyone was tuttutting in disapproval he invited maureen to stay maureen was pierces foster sister she had four kids and was pregnant with the fifth she was also dying there was a general intake of breath an assistant managera guy of about nineteen wearing more grease than a fish shopwas striding towards shanni looking as if he knew what to do with anyone who was interfering with his microphone but an older woman grabbed him by the arm and held him back leave her be dwayne mum she cant shush i want to hear anyway shanni said ignoring dwayne as insignificant to her story here was maureen with her kids in desperate trouble her background is irrelevant im not asking you to judge maureen we cant for maureen died eight months ago we know this someone called out then if you do you should be ashamed of yourselves shanni snapped i gave you the benefit of the doubt that you didnt know the facts so im repeating them these kidstheyre fantastic kids you cant imagine wendys eleven shes held her brothers and sisters together like the little mother hen she is all the kidswendy and bryce and donald and abby and bessyevery single one of them deserves a medal for the care they took of their mother and the care theyve taken of each other but of course there are five of them when maureen was ill there was no one to look after them social welfare knew maureen was dying they were rightly concerned maureen was terrified theyd be separated she begged pierce to help not being the childrens father pierce could do little but pierce has a big farm and a bigger heart he thought if he was the kids stepdad then he might just be able to keep them together so he and maureen married there was silence the locals hadnt figured this part of the story theyd preferred juicier versions pierce thought various kids with various parents kept for whatever nefarious purpose they might like to imagine do you really think social welfare would let pierce keep the children if they dont think he has the best interests of the kids at heart shanni demanded and there was even more silence you know i was brought up in the city shanni said my mum got glandular fever when i was seven and she was ill for months i remember that time as scary but you know what my dad and i never had to cook our local communitycity folkused to turn up at our place with food my school organized a roster it makes me cry now more than twenty years on to think of all those bighearted people but you she said lowering her voice she didnt have to worry about it so much now she had the absolute attention of every single person in the supermarket these kids go to your kids school youve known pierce was in trouble but all he gets from you his community is more and more reports forcing social welfare to keep on checking she took a deep breath all these kids have had chicken pox now bessy has it i know shes in the supermarket when she shouldnt be but theres no choice even with me helping yesterday pierce stayed up all night with an ill child but he had to take bessy to the doctor he was so tired he went to sleep in his car while waiting for a prescription the kids were safe at home with me but he got reported he got home to face yet another check then last night someone decided welfare werent doing their job the job someone here seems to want which is running pierce and the kids out of town so they decided to help things along shanni pierce said and started forward but wendy grabbed his shirt and clung let her say it dad she said these people dont like it so someone let our bull into the garden shanni said her voice was strained now like she was having trouble going on not only that but whoever it was stirred clyde up wounding him with a peashooter over and over again until he was vicious and uncontrolled i guess whoever it was imagined that itd be pierce who went outside when he heard a bull in the garden but we still have a sick baby pierce was upstairs with a howling bessy so donald she motioned to donald our sevenyearold who like every one of his siblings is brave and resolute and desperate to do the right thing went out to tackle the bull on his own there was a general gasp horror but the lady whod been stocking the shelves was looking at them differently appalled im an old friend of pierce and ive come to help i heard donald in the garden shanni said into the silence i got there just before the bull charged him she motioned to the sling the doctor had put her arm in i ended up with a wounded shoulder but if i hadnt been there she broke off but i was she said softly shanni leave this pierce said he put wendy aside and started walking up the aisle towards her oh im leaving it she said and she managed to smile at him were all leaving were going to the beach for a holiday pierce has had this place up to his ears and i dont blame him but in a couple of weeks well be back to put the place on the market shanni you cant keep the farm if these people keep demonizing you she said softly so all im doing is laying the facts before everyone she took a deep breath and then beamed switching channels okay everyone enough from me you were in the middle of a riveting announcement of a redhot special in laundry detergents dwayne over to you and she handed over the mike just as pierce reached her he stopped just before her she was smiling but her eyes were wary worried i had to do it pierce she whispered when the doctor told me what scum you were what everyone here thought i damn near slapped him her smile firmed a little but then i would have had to slap everyone here too and id probably end up in jail and i want to go to the beach can we still go to the beach pierce or are you mad at me im mad at you how badly is your shoulder hurt miss it was dwaynes mother she looked whitefaced and frightened there were a few white faces around pierce thought how many people had been in on the clyde plan its mostly just bruised shanni assured her when are you going to the beach tomorrow then youre not to cook tonight the lady said and suddenly shed turned and grabbed the microphone from her son im on casserole tonight she boomed into the microphone dora can you make one of your apple strudels and ill make a hamper they can take with them someone called we dont need i think we need dwaynes mother told the supermarket grimly i think a whole lot of us need a lot more than you do they drove home in silence shanni in the front passenger seat and the kids packed into the back for the life of him pierce couldnt think of what to say shed blown him away shed been a virago protecting her young with every ounce of her being she was a failed owner of an art gallery how could this woman fail at anything for a moment he almost felt sorry for the stupid exboyfriend whod betrayed her mike was lucky hed only got a bucket of iced water he grinned whats so funny i was thinking of mike of mike and iced water and microphones im thinking maybe we need to get you boxing lessons slugging might be easier not half as satisfying she said and she smiled back there is that he hesitated shanni im really grateful i know you are she said smugly thats why i did it her smile faded you know its occurred to me that if youre taking the kids to the beach then you dont actually need me pardon this castle i asked the doctor about it after i yelled at him he started being a sweetie we looked dolphin bay castle up on the internet its a refuge where disadvantaged kids get a holiday and their carers do too theres more than enough staff to take the kids off your hands while you get your work done i could she took a deep breath i could go find somewhere else to stay but then she brightened or i could stay at the farm by myself i could paint someone has to babysit clyde but you have to come said donald from the back seat what if there are bulls abby demanded we need you to look after donald yes said donald we certainly need you and ive found a clydesitter pierce said with a sidelong glance at his passenger she was looking weary itd been a hell of a day yesterday the bulls attack must have taken its toll yet her behaviour in the supermarketit had been amazing ruby would have fought like that he thought and he smiled you keep having private jokes shanni complained and he tried to stop smiling but she sounded so righteous that he wanted to smile all over again you remind me of ruby i love my aunty ruby she said warmly but then she frowned but i told youstop saying that shes short and dumpy and youre short and cuddly it was out before he realized what hed intended to say he hadnt intended to say it had he i dont do cuddles she said no why not asked wendy cos i had a boyfriend who was a rat and ive promised ill never cuddle anyone again our mum said pierce didnt do cuddles abby piped up we had to teach him kids cuddles are different to adult cuddles pierce knew he sounded desperate but that was how he was feeling why didnt you do cuddles shanni asked interested then she remembered something ruby says all her boys are emotionally crippled gee thanks theres one thing i cant understand whats that he sounded cautious but who could blame him why did you buy your farm the question caught him unprepared he had no answer you didnt know about maureen and the kids before you bought it did you she asked um no you hadnt heard and decided to be supernice im not supernice no she screwed up her nose deep in thought you were working in sydney on your super architect projects that earn you megabucks you decided you wanted a weekend getaway so you looked around here and loa fivebedroom farmhouse two living rooms three bathrooms three dog houses have you ever owned a dog no there you go then do you have lots of friends and relations he hesitated only ruby and the boys your foster brothers rubys boys she smiled a little at that ruby thinks the world of you guys though youve blotted your copybook with the apartment what do you mean buying her a fabulous apartment that she cant share whose corkbrained idea was that not mine he admitted there was a lengthy silence the kids didnt understand where the conversation was going but they were good kids they were content to listen so shanni said at last she sank back into her seat and he had the feeling she would have crossed her arms if she didnt have an arm in a sling judgement had been pronounced you sound like the secrets of the universe have been revealed they have she said in tones of satisfaction aunty ruby always said you were a nice boy i bet she says that about us all no she had tags i dont know you all but she has you categorized the silent one the dangerous one the wild one the deep one and im just nice she said it in the kindest way she thinks the world of you she hesitated aunty ruby says you see nothing of your own family no short clipped brusque intended to give her a message which she clearly didnt receive okay she looked sideways at him so you bought your farm for ruby i didnt no not specifically cos shed never have taken it but if you had a great big farmhouse that was rattlingly empty and ruby knew it was there and some kid or other was in trouble shed have filled it up i bet thats what you were thinking only maureen got in first and filled it before ruby could it wasnt for ruby but he knew he didnt sound convincing maybe it was in your subconscious but i bet it was there but then the rest of the boys had their great idea about giving ruby an apartment for herself but you knew shed hate it i didnt know of course you did because youre the nice one but you were stuck then cos of course you couldnt be the only one who wouldnt give ruby the apartment and youve got five kids who you know ruby would adore to have as pseudograndkids but of course the rest of rubys boys would think you were lower than the low if you foisted them on her whats foist bryce asked let ruby near you pierce said desperately i cant which is why you told her you had one baby and only one you knew shed never be able to resist more she couldnt resist one i had to practically straitjacket her to stop her coming i didnt want to tell her that much but i needed my foster brother blake to help with the legal stuff we were staying with ruby at the time and she overheard she knew i was hiding something so i told ruby one baby and you told ruby you didnt want her this is too damned convoluted he growled plus its not your business i dont want to meet any more bulls she explained no more unpleasant surprises but meanwhile you dont need me at dolphin bay i do he insisted why because you need a damned good rest any fool can see that im your employee she said gently not someone you have to fuss over no but you dont have any place else to go you could sign one of rubys dumb visitor agreements and i could stay there i could put up with the macramé youd tell her all about me i might she admitted not that id want to but no one can tell lies to ruby she sees right through you so come to the castle maybe you can paint maybe i can she said cheering up i need to conquer cows legs you studied art at university i did and all she said mournfully but it hasnt fitted me very well for an alternative career i can discuss with gravitas the powerful influences affecting postmodern gothic pastoralism on twentiethcentury neoconservatist abstractsbut i cant paint a cows leg wendy does a neater one maybe i should become the worlds best housekeeper and be done with it she swivelled round and grinned at wendy but im trying painting first so its a contest if i get to go to the beach well see who paints legs best at the end well paint fish at the beach abby said fish legs then mermaids wendy said and giggled wendy giggling it was such an astonishing sound that it almost had pierce driving off the road he hadnt heard wendy giggle since her mother had died this woman was a godsend nothing more he told himself suddenly finding he needed to give himself a stern reminder of barriers she was great for the kids she was cuddly he didnt do cuddly he didnt do relationships except maybe with ruby rubys husband had been a foster kid himself physically scarred from years of childhood neglect when hed died young ruby had declared her life mission was to rescue boys there were too many children in the world to take them all she declared so she restricted herself to gawky adolescent males and she loved them to bits hed spent three years of his life with ruby his mother never abandoned him completely so his childhood was made up of intermittent placements after he met ruby she took him every time shanni had rubys grin she had rubys way of greeting life head on that was the only reason he was reacting to her like he was he told himself because she was like ruby yeah right she wasnt the least bit like ruby she was shanni they lapsed into silence pierce turned onto the gravel track leading to the farm and realized that he didnt want this journey to end which was weird he who held his independence as his most important asset had found a short journey with five kids a pile of supplies and a woman with a wounded wing great so were setting out tomorrow shanni said and he thought okay they could keep this businesslike yep we didnt go today because because you need time to recover im supposed to help you not the other way round you saved donald she thought about that so i did she said at last theres a silver lining to every cloud i might be stuck here you think youre stuck of course i do she seemed astonished i mean she caught herself i mean you all seem very nice but im an art curator this is a career blip im here to regroup and then im out of here so if you find someone else feel free to employ them thank you he said gravely only not tomorrow cos even though i shouldnt come it was my idea to go to the beach and i really really want to stay in a castle so do i said donald me too said wendy and to a chorus of me toos he turned into the farm with his temporary housekeeper temporary childminder temporaryrelationship he didnt do relationships even temporary ones chapter six shanni woke at three in the morning her shoulder hurt actually it throbbed wuss she told herself but her shoulder wasnt in the mood to be told it was making too much fuss she needed painkillers the doctor had given her lethallooking nighttime pills with instructions that shed need them to go to sleep but hed said theyd make her dozy and she was a bit wary of being dozy in this house what if there was another bull shed taken a couple of milder analgesics and had managed to go to sleep but now those bright blue suckers shed put in the kitchen medicine cabinet looked pretty inviting the house was in darkness she was still in the girls bedroom wendy and abby were fast asleep carefully she threw back the covers winced as the movement hurt her arm then padded her way downstairs to the kitchen pierce was sitting at the table a sheath of plans spread out before him he looked like a man whod been working for hours he was wearing bright blue pyjamas he had seriouslooking glasses perched low on his nose hed been raking his hair with his fingers his curls had separated into rake marks he needed a shave again he was seriously cute he looked up and she jumped hey he said sounding as startled as she was its me whos supposed to jump did i scare you if youre asking whether the sight of five feet three inches of woman with pyjamas covered in pink pigs and with one arm in a sling is enough to terrify meyou could be right he stretched like a big cat and rose lazily to his feet your arms hurting iyes maybe the pink pigs werent such a good idea she thought theyd been a kris kringle christmas gift from the gallery staff shed shoved them right to the back of her bureau but when shed been packing to come home shed thought why not no ones going to see me in bed ever again but she wouldnt have minded a bit of feminine lace right now or even plain flannelette just not pigs theyre great pierce said and grinned there it was againthat grin he could make her heart do somersaults she was his temporary housekeeper and after mike your selection criteria is seriously flawed she told herself do not think cute theyre all the fashion in london she said defensively i believe you his smile widened whoa stop it stop it stop it sit by the fire he told her he walked round and pulled the fireside rocker forward im all right sit before she knew what he intended he caught her round the waist picked her up and deposited her in the chair just as if she was one of his kids she didnt feel like one of his kids she felt imperiled theres a dumb thing to think she told herself crossly just because hes somale ill make you some cocoa he said turning his back to her which was a relief when he wasnt smiling the pressure dropped just a bit you shouldnt take those pills on an empty stomach cocoa and chocolate cookies coming up i can strongly recommend the cookies and theres nothing like a nice hot cup of cocoa to make you sleep thank you grandpa hey we both have pyjamas on he retorted if im grandpa youre grandma she should make some smart retort she should but the first six retorts she made in her head were all classified dangerous after the very barest of examination she subsided into what she hoped was dignified silence while he filled the kettle we can go to the beach tomorrow he told her ive had no less than five phone calls offering to take care of the cattle any time i need a break thanks to you he was smiling at her too warmly much too warmly she was starting to colour what are you working on she asked as much for something to fill the silence as for interest in truth her shoulder was hurting so much she shouldnt be interested in anything but pain relief the fact that despite the pain she was very interested indeed in a man in blue pyjamas was a bit of a worry actually it was a very definite worry and it was growing more definite every second a railway station he said want to see iyes she went to rise but he was before her hauling the table sideways so it was in reach he lifted the first set of plans and laid it on her knee this is the overall concept the rest is detailed working plans he went back to his cocoa making she tried to turn her attention to the plans which suddenly wasnt difficult these were amazing this is huge she whispered a major metropolitan hub a whole new network i think i saw this advertised in london didnt they run a competition for ideas they did we won we my company she whistled this was almost enough to make her forget her shoulder she lifted plan after plan looking at the meticulous detail as well as the truly astounding master plan but youre brilliant she whispered at last i know he said laying cocoa chocolate cookies and two blue pills before her and handsome and rugged and strong and heroic and so humble you wouldnt believe she choked take your pills he ordered yes sir she did ruby says youre no halfwit yourself he said ruby says the nicest things she does doesnt she oh and speaking of ruby and her boys he turned and rustled under the pile of papers on the table i rang blake tonightblakes another of rubys boysabout the dreaded mike and his use of your shared credit card hey what was he doing interfering in her life you have no right i dont he said regretfully thats what blake said he says maybe mike acted unlawfully but he wouldnt know unless you let him have access to your details he faxed me a permission form for you to fill in if you want to sign it hell look into it theres nothing blake can do hes a rubys boy pierce said modestly between us ruby says were going to rule the world a ruby dynasty its no good establishing dynasties if none of you intend to have families she said absently she ate a chocolate cookie absently read blakes form thought what the heck filled it in signed it and went back to considering pierce she shouldnt but he really was well worth considering but maybe you could form a foster dynasty she suggested a world run by people without mothers she thought about her own and glowered it might just work hey he said guessing where her thoughts had gone they only sublet their house only she said darkly i have a doll called susie belle i keep in my bedroom if any kids messing with susie belle you want us to organise a susie belle hit armed men at dead of night sweeping in nobody move the dolls ours she grinned you want to try sam works for the sas wed put him in charge sam as in rubys sam i told youwere a dynasty so you are she gazed at him for just a moment too long suddenly flustered she turned away gazing into the flames through the open firedoor much safer she was awareor she thought she was aware but there was no way she was checkingthat pierce was looking at her but she didnt look back flames right concentrate you should go back to bed he said and his voice sounded a bit strained she should but this was great the room still smelled faintly of the wonderful beef curry dwaynes mother had appeared with at dinner two cakes and the remains of an apple strudel sat on the bench waiting for tomorrow this was a lovely warm foodladen kitchen with a fantastic firestove and a man working at the kitchen table on plans that were amazing a really nice man ill go back to bed as soon as the tablets work she said go back to your plans he did he focused on his work with absolute attention after a bit he seemed to forget she was there which suited her she could watch him surreptitiously taking stock he really was the strangest mix he was about as different from mike as it was possible for a man to be mike would have jumped her by now she thought despite the pigs pierce seemed totally oblivious which was just as well she thought if she had to spend the next couple of weeks with him she shouldnt go to the beach he wouldnt need her at the castle i will need you he said and she blinked he was writing on the side of the plans his hand didnt pause how could he know what she was thinking why will you need me because donald trusts you donald hes a strange kid hes been watching me for a year now and yet i dont think he trusts me hes waiting for me to ditch them or something he tries to take care of them all himself and he tries to pretend they dont need me but in one fell swoop hes figured that youre okay clyde was good for something i guess he was he sighed poor old man clyde you mean yeah hes quiet as a baby tonight i put him in the girls paddock its a bit early for joining but i thought a bit of sex might take his mind off his trauma you worry about them all she said softly even clyde yeah some bachelor he said grimly and went back to his drawings the pills were kicking in a little or maybe it was the warmth and the cocoa and the company she felt sleepy and warm and like she didnt want to move for a hundred years youre not a bachelor she said sleepily youre a widower there was a pause so i am he said cautious widower is much sexier than bachelor i wouldnt know its true she said labouring a point that suddenly felt important a widower is very very sexy widower with five kids hmm she thought about that its a hitch she said but im prepared to overlook it there was a long drawn out silence she was watching the flames they were forming shapes i can see a bull in there she said a bull a sort of bull in the inferno a little something from dante i think i might paint it whats in those pills pardon nothing he grinned and rose joining her in the lovely warm haze radiated by the stove bedtime i want to stay here i can see that you do but i have work to do and youre distracting me youre distracting yourself thank you he said gravely is your shoulder still hurting my shoulders lovely then its bedtime for you princess he said and he bent and lifted her with the effortless ease hed used before she should take umbrage she should she wound her arms round his neck and held on nice so ruby tells me rubys right she says youre the nice one youre certainly the one with the sexiest pyjamas have you been on the whisky she thought about that no she said at last should i have can we have one if i give you a whisky youll be out for the count he told her i have a feeling you dont take painkillers too often pain thats what i mean sweetheart he was climbing the stairs she was cradled against him he had the nicest pyjamas she thought hazily they were made of the same soft fabric as her pink pigs she put her cheek on his shoulder and it felt really really soft do you mind he asked in a voice that was none too steady do i mind what not taking any more of those damned pills he said im having a word with the doctor tomorrow the doctor was really really sorry was he yes cos he thought the children were yours and he thought you should have got them inoculated but i told him you were a hero thanks its true theyd reached the girls bedroom he pushed the door wide with his foot and strode across to the last bed in the row the empty bed her bed its a very very good thing youre not sleeping in maureens big bed he said setting her down on the pillows then as she clung he reached up and carefully unentwined her fingers from behind his neck why it just is shanni let me go she let him go just widowers are very very sexy she whispered so are artists in pyjamas with pink pigs he smiled that magic smile that warmed places within her she hadnt realized were cold goodnight shanni he said he placed a finger on her lips goodnight yourself she whispered she lifted her hand to his finger and held it where it was trapped against her lips shanni very very sexy she whispered are you going to kiss me goodnight he nearly didnt she saw him retreat just a little but he couldnt resist she knew it with the same cosy certainty that said the night was safe and life was good and this house was the most splendid house shed ever stayed in and this was the most comfortable bed and he kissed her it was meant to be a feather kiss over before she knew it but she wasnt interested in a feather kiss she put her arms around his neck and tugged him close finding his mouth kissing him long and languorously and wonderfully it felt so rightan extension of the warmth and the wonder of the night he felthers her man she held him close and kissed and kissed and felt him respond as she knew he must pierce but he was pulling away unlooping her arms forcing her back onto the pillows and moving back no he said yes she whispered what did i tell you sexy as hell he was backing to the door kiss me again she pleaded and he shook his head he smiled but his smile was strained you need to sleep dont he grinned then yes you do princess he murmured she could still see his face he hadnt turned the light on so the only light was the moon but she could see his features he didnt want to leave as much as she didnt want him to go pierce his smile faded goodnight he said and he turned and walked out of the room closing the door behind him chapter seven the drive to the castle took three hours and shanni blushed the whole way part of the problem was she had too much time to think she was driving her fathers car unwilling to join the mob in maureens wagon and be trapped with no transport at a place she didnt know pierce had fretted about her driving with her bad shoulder but shed ignored him her shoulder was better shed decreed donald elected to go with her pierce was driving maureens wagon and she and donald followed she was never touching those blue pills again if the pills had made her act out of character the least they could do was erase the memory so she didnt know what a fool shed made of herself the next morning stupid pills shed forced him to kiss her and there was the hub of the problem the kiss was replaying in her head over and over donald was no help her small companion hummed a tuneless little ditty over and over refusing to talk refusing to help her divert herself so she blushed and she gave herself lectures and she blushed again she was supposed to be following pierce but even seeing the back of his car did her head in so she fell back so far that she ended up in dolphin bay with pierces car nowhere to be seen she had to stop and ask directions the lady at the post office was working on a garish piece of macramé macramé followed her everywhere shanni thought despondently what was there a world resurgence but as soon as she asked for directions the postmistress set aside her macramé and beamed how many kiddies this time five oh my dear oh youre all going to have a wonderful time i cant tell you it was a positive note shanni returned to the car and headed off again vaguely worried that pierce would be worried she rounded the first bend out of town and there was pierce parked in a layby yes he was looking worried but then she saw the castle she eased off the accelerator and pulled to a stop astounded donalds small jaw dropped open and shannis jaw dropped in consensus wow said donald wow is right she whispered its a real castle donald said im scared said shanni donald cast her a doubtful look i dont think its scary no its just big and pointy and like abbys storybooks there probably arent any ghosts abby will like this place what wasnt to like shanni thought stunned the place seemed straight out of a gothic novel the castle itself was set high on the cliffs above the sea with purplehazed mountains ringing the rear built of gleaming white stone it was all turrets and battlements and vast stone walls flags flew from the battlements any minute now shed see warriors with spears and tubs of hot tar preparing to see them off her car door was tugged open where the hell have you been pierce demanded and she jumped about a foot dontdont do that what you scared me and you scared me i was imagining car accidents just because i drive sedately when i have children in the car she managed prim and then she gazed at the castle again youve seen this before i helped with the renovations isnt it great iits unbelievable whats a castle doing on the coast of new south wales the original loganaich castle was in scotland it got bombed in the second word war the last earl had been wounded in the war hed suffered a gutful of midges and fog and he craved sun so he rebuilt here isnt it fantastic fantastic she said cautiously as an architect oh i disapprove he said and grinned talk about an environmental white elephantbut now its built im just as gobsmacked as the next man and helping with the renovations was great talk about preserving kitsch its fantastic he peered in to donald what do you reckon donald shanni says its scary donald said whats to be scared of there arent any dungeons the old earl thought they could safely be left in scotland he pointed to the highest turret that turret contains the kids bedrooms you want to sleep in a turret with donald gulped with wendy and everyone yes donald cast an uncertain glance at shanni and with shanni yes shanni said before pierce could respond its an excellent idea of donalds that i sleep with the kids thank you for inviting me donald still scared pierce teased and grinned and she knew he wasnt referring to a few ghosts i was on pills last night she said with as much dignity as she could muster so youve told me five times today already you want to come into the castle he had to stop smiling she thought desperately he must she was falling falling falling and here was a crazy medieval castle looming before her telling her she should leave reality outside and indulge in makebelieve yeah right fairy tale or not she had to keep her feet firmly on the ground forget last night and yes please she managed the owners and the staff of loganaich castle were as stunning as the castle itself shanni had expected some sort of institution thered be kindly staff shed thought efficient but ordered here though there seemed to be chaos it hit from the moment they drove into the castle foregate there were three small girls sitting on the front step twin girls aged about six and a toddler between them they were concentrating on very large pink icecream cones at their feet was a dog a weird dog the dog was brown white and furry with long floppy ears a stretchedout body about the size of a cocker spaniel a tail that added another two feet in length and legs that were about six inches long the dog was looking at the girls adoration mixed with the intense concentration of a dog expecting a dropped icecream at any minute pierce pulled up first and shanni pulled up behind they emerged from the cars and the three girls on the steps waved their icecreams dangerously hi said one of the two twins are you mr maclachlan yes said pierce susie said there was a daddy but not a mummy the other twin said and she looked at shanni as if shed been sold a pup she said the mummy died im shanni shanni offered im thehousekeeper is there anyone hello as if on cue a woman came flying out the front door looking flustered she was dressed in soilcoated overalls and she was covered in mud she flew down the steps beaming holding out her hands in greeting pierce and rubys shanni welcome then as pierce took an instinctive step back she looked down at her hands and winced whoops i should have washed sorry ive been digging spuds spuds isnt that right im american but im learning she wiped her hands on her overalls collecting as much mud as she was discarding im susie lady of loganaich isnt that a weird title it makes me think i should be wandering the halls moaning and clanking chains hamish has gone into town for supplies so im the reception committee but were having a bit of a disaster with the pumpkin patch its too wet and weve rot rot this early spells ruin im building it up with pea straw jodies making beds and kirstys helping she shouldnt be but shes insisting which of you has the chicken pox bessy pierce said sounding dazed motioning into the car where bessy sat in her baby seat gazing out with interest she was miserable before the spots came out but only three spots appeared and now shes cheered up but youve all had them susie said as the kids started piling out of the car you guys deserve a medal did it really itch it was horrible abby said tucking in behind pierce and regarding the muddy susie with caution pierce said we were making him itch just to look at us wendy added well you guys have come to the right spot here for postitch therapy susie declared this is the best place in the world for getting rid of any recalcitrant itch you lie in the surf and soak for hours you guys ever been to the beach nno wendy said gripping abbys hand hardly any kids have seen the beach when they come to us a rangy young man dressed in work overalls and bearing a crowbar emerged from a side gate susie turned to him and waved nick the poxy tribe are here and theyve never seen the beach shall we show them immediately she glanced at the twins and the toddler who was coated in pink after youve been armed with icecreams of course excellent nick said dropping his crowbar hey jodie he yelled up to an open turret window kirsty the poxy tribe are here were going to the beach not without us a womans voice yelled in response from an open window above them anyone who wants to do something boring like go to the bathroom or tote luggage gets to stay behind and come down with jodie and kirsty susie said kirstys really pregnant and shes as slow as a snail the rest of uslets collect our icecreams and hit the waves shanni and pierce were left staring at each other stunned the kids susie nick and jodie and taffy the dog with a very pregnant kirsty bringing up the rear could be heard descending the track to the beach bessy doesnt go to strangers wendy was explaining to susie im not a stranger susie was saying im susie im roses mum bessy you like me dont you nick are you carrying rose sure nick called from behind he sounded as american as susie me and the twins and donald are guarding your backs whats the setup here shanni asked dazed though pierce looked as dazed as she felt this place is geared up to give kids holidays he told her they were standing in a now deserted castle forecourt the action was all over the road and down the cliff path but whats its story whos susie is she really alady the new earl of loganaichhamishwas a new york financier before he inherited the castle hamish is married to susie hamishs exsecretary is jodie jodies husband nick is a social worker they invited to come out from america to help them set this place up susies twin kirsty and her husband are local doctors in dolphin bay the twins are theirssusies nieces rosethe toddleris susies he grinned dont look like that itll become clearer i came here to do renovation plans and for the opening but im still trying to match dogs and kids to grown ups its chaos but its great chaos it looks fabulous and you never thought of bringing the kids here before to be honest ive been too busy to think past the nose on my face since maureen arrived he confessed it wasnt until you suggested we all go to the beach that i thought of it he hesitated and then admitted yeah and rubys known here even if i had thought of it id have worried itd get back to her me not coping with five kids you dont mind her knowing now susie swears it can stay in confidence and susies fine with the chicken pox there arent any other kids here at the moment they keep two weeks of every six open for emergencies and we slotted into that everyone here has either been poxed or inoculated so she swallowed more than ever she thought she wasnt needed shed wanted time at the beach but this was starting to seemdangerous where was the excuse to stay i should just slope off why im hardly needed the kids had reached the beach now their astonished cries could be heard from where they stood youre hardly needed and im needed even less the kids have disappeared without a backward glance ill be doing some work here as per your suggestion by the look of it youll be able to even bessys gone with them so i can justgo but the whoops and cries from the beach were enticing she wanted to walk over to the edge of the cliff and look to rubys pierce asked to the macramé i can find somewhere im not exactly friendless im sure youre not he hesitated looking across the road as well the kids voices floated up delirious with excitement we need to go and see you need to go and see we both need he said suddenly decisive youve just promised youll sleep in the kids wing and i dont see you breaking that promise he put his hands on her forearms fixing her to the spot shanni you suggested this this was your idea and its a fantastic one i employed you to look after my kids and youre doing just that in bringing them here youve had a rotten time in londonanyone can see that youve also been a lot sicker with your influenza than these kids have been with their chicken pox how do you know youre washed out i am not and you have bigger shadows under your eyes than i do the accommodation here is booked for two adults and five children i intend to play with the kids and do some work i think you should spend the next two weeks lying on the beach getting your colour back i am not washed out so you normally look like susies moaning and clanking lady of the castle i she floundered wishing for a mirror or an exit i dont im sure i dont he grinned youre sure you normally dont look as pale and wan as this thats what i thought youve two weeks at the beach get used to it nowyou dont happen to remember what case we packed our swimming gear in the red one there you go then youre useful already lets go join the troops oh and shanni what she said trying to figure whether she was being railroaded against her wishes or whether she really did want to stay he placed his finger on her lips the movement was so unexpected she took a step back the kiss last night he said and he was smiling im not taking it seriously so neither should you she shouldnt be here shanni lay in the dark in her fabulous bedroom and stared at the moonlit ceiling wondering what on earth she was doing staying in a castle for disadvantaged children things had moved so fast in the last few weeks she feltweird one moment she was running a struggling but hip art gallery in london the next she was recuperating from flu in a castle on the coast of new south wales she had a velvet canopy over her bed she was surrounded by gold embossed wallpaper there was a fireplace at the end of the room so big and so ornate it looked like a work of art in its own right the bathroom down the end of the hall had a picture of queenvictoria staring sternly down at her a chandelier hung from the ceiling and an aspidistra dangled over the cistern shed giggled when shed seen the picture first but when shed gone back later queen vics matriarchal stare had seemed disapproving ill make a donation and pay my keep shed told the monarch but victorias disapproval had only seemed to deepen she could go and stay with ruby she was sure pierce would sign rubys dratted consent form or she could camp on juless floor but for how long and suddenly it all seemed overwhelming grey and heavy and hard it had all happened too fast finding mike and his horrible floozy had been dramatic and sordid and shed been too ill with influenza to think straight but strangely now in this fabulous bedroom with five needy kids within calling distance with pierce just down the hall it was the first time shed seen clearly the mess her life was in she was twentyeight years oldtwentynine in three weeks shed lost her gallery and her apartment she had no money and no career and no one will employ me she whispered im qualified as a curator of an art gallery yet the only one ive ever owned went bust some qualification ill never get another job as a curator and i know it maybe a provincial gallery its too small a world mike will have badmouthed me and he has powerful friends i lost my head and my careers kaput she sniffed dont you dare cry she told herself not shanni it was a childs voice hauled out of the indulgence of a good sob shanni made do with a bigger sniff and sat up in bed she reached for the bedside lamp or should she make that the bedside chandelier there was more crystal here than in the royal palace of versailles imitation crystal she told herself susie had given them a grand tour giggling at the ostentatious furnishings deidre thought it was a hoot making this place as kitsch as she could dont you just love ernst and eric ernst and eric were the two suits of armour guarding the stairs made in japan ersnt and eric are the loganaich keepers of secrets susie had told them deeply earnest as she introduced the children to the suits anything you say to these guys theyll take it to the grave but right now wendy seemed to want a warmer audience than two tin warriors shanni are you asleep her voice was trembling nope shanni said sniffing again and trying to sound cheerful im sitting in my royal bed waiting for a few minions to cater to my every whim and my whim is that you talk to me as wendy ventured tentatively into the room shanni tossed back her covers and moved to one side come on in its warm in here wendy didnt need two invitations she practically bolted over to the bed dived in and pulled the covers to her chin hey shanni said startled youre not scared of ghosts are you nno well what i hada dream i thought it was real she was trembling all over shannis selfabsorption disappeared in an instant she should have slept with the girls tonight she thought but wendy and abby had chosen a room just above her head a turret with two bower windows and a bed in each bower the girls had taken one look and whooped with joy and there was only room for two the boys had a similar room on the other side of the turret shannis and pierces bedrooms were right underneath so they could hear anyone call pierce had bessy in a crib in his room and shanni was in solitary splendour but it had felt wrong shanni thought as she hugged the little girl close why what was she thinking that she ought to be closer to these kids problem she glanced up and pierce was in the doorway he was still in jeans and pullover what was he doing wandering the castle at night still dressed at this hour he must be tuned to the kids with extrasensory perception she thought to have heard wendys soft call wendys here she said wendy wendy was about as close to shanni as it was possible to get huddled under the bedclothes her whole body shaking nightmares shanni said and pierce winced again he took a couple of steps into the room and wendy shrank tighter against shanni no pierce stopped as if struck hell wendy dont swear shanni said automatically hey wendy its only pierce the child was shaking so much shanni was starting to be seriously worried go away wendy whispered i dont need shes had these nightmares before pierce said staying where he was theyre awful but she never lets me near i took her to a child psychologist but she wont talk about them nightmares are ghastly shanni said i know pierce looked lost shanni thought and suddenly she thought he did know this man had had his nightmares too was he still having them what was your nightmare about she asked wendy hugging her close a fierce shake of her head was the only response i used to have nightmares about frogs shanni grimaced great big slimy frogs frogs taking over the world horrid frogs are cute wendy whispered not my frogs silence and i bet you had nightmares too she said to pierce what were your nightmares about the silence lengthened i dont he said at last and shanni sighed so if we sent you to a child psychologist you wouldnt tell us yours either this is wendy were talking about it is she hugged the little girl so tight she felt their ribs collide wendy was too thin a waif wendy we need to talk about this pierce said heavily i know youre scared i know the dark seems awfully lonely he hesitated once upon a time i felt like that maybe sometimes you still do shanni whispered sometimes we all do no grown ups are sometimes scared too she told wendy the thing to do is to talk about it honest i talked to my mum after my frog nightmares and she took me to the zoo and we learned all about frogs we learned that the worlds biggest frog is the goliath and its bigger than my dads foot which is pretty huge but it still only eats insects mum took me to a pond on our friends farm and we collected frog eggs dad dug a pond in the garden and we filled it with all the things frogs love the eggs hatched into tadpoles and the tadpoles turned into frogs i called them names like hoppit and cassidy so then i started dreaming about real frogs and my nightmares juststopped your parents loved you pierce said softly they abandoned susie belle shanni retorted my beautiful doll she explained to wendy lets not be too nice about my parents wendy what are your nightmares about i want what do you want pierce to go away wendy whispered the words were so shocking that shanni froze she glanced up at pierce and she saw something on his face that shocked her further pain pure unadulterated pain whatever was happening here it wasnt pierce wendy was afraid of she thought that look pierce is our friend she whispered pierce loves you hes what are the nightmares she pressed dark wendy murmured but it was too much pierce was backing out the door he looked stricken ill leave you he said woodenly stiffly ill be up on the battlements too far away to hear shanni wanted to call him back but she knew she mustnt wendy was still pressed tight against her was she fully awake from the nightmare or were traces of it still lingering was wendy afraid of pierce this didnt make sense wendy seemed desperate for this oddly constructed family to work she must have had plenty of opportunities with the social welfare people to say pierce wasnt treating her well that she wanted to leave orabuse that didnt bear thinking of but shanni took a deep breath swallowed and decided she had to be an adult here she needed to wipe any preconceived ideas out of her head and tackle this like she knew nothing which she did pierce is gone she said i know so you can tell me what the nightmares are now ino wendy i saved donald from the bull she said deciding a bit of bossiness was in order ill save you from your terrors too but i need to know what they are there was a long silence then dark wendy whispered dark iyes theres a night light in your room isnt it light enough for you justwhen i go to sleep its dark when you go to sleep the cupboard wendy said and shanni held her breath what cupboard he puts me in it he hates me cos if he hits the kids i tell mum mums in bedshes always sick and every time is this pierce shanni interrupted appalled the nightmare obviously was mixing past with present horrifically no it was barely a whisper the other another man we were with him for ages mum said we had to stay with him cos she didnt have anywhere else to go so i didnt tell her about the cupboard id tell her if he hit the kids but she got upset when i told her anything i told the kids it was okay i didnt mind i pretended it was aa game but it wasnt then one night he hit donald really hard he made donalds eye swell up and i kicked him even harder than he hit donald but then he locked us both up only donald cried so loud that abby went and told mum mum got up and yelled and yelled and donald said i was always in the cupboard even when i told him not to say it then mum cried all night the next day mum put us all in the car and we went to pierces dear god im not qualified to deal with this shanni thought desperately i dont know what to do but she was all wendy had apart from pierce who wendy was obviously mixing in her head with her mothers ghastly partner only in her sleep she thought but it was enough to mean pierce couldnt help her now wendy thats a dreadful story she said its awful how dare he treat you like that i he ought to be arrested she was angry and she decided it couldnt hurt to let her anger show of all the ghastly scary thingsoh wendy how could you bear it and you had to look after the other children too it wasdark and your mother didnt know once i tried to tell her but she got so upset she got out of bed and fell over he told her id been naughty and he said hed only put me in there for a minute but it was for hours and hours and it was over and over again all night sometimes until donald i tried not to say oh wendy love shanni whispered oh my brave wendy youre the bravest kid i know bar none i hate the nightmares she said you know pierce isnt like this man ii know shanni took a deep breath then swung her legs out of bed got up and turned on the overhead light this suddenly seemed of immense importance you know i saved donald from the bull wendy nodded not sure where shanni was going wendy i swear to you if anyone else were to hurt you id react exactly the same as if they were the bull no matter who do you believe that she put her hand under the little girls chin and forced her to meet her eyes wendy you have to believe it ii do so are you afraid of pierce she was holding her breath surely she couldnt be wrong about pierces character she thought but this child was trusting her and suddenly shanni knew the enormity of what was being offered trust please she whispered under her breath but she forced her face to stay absolutely clear absolutely empty nonjudgemental not likely to react to the worst no wendy whispered you didnt want him to come in just now no i you what its just the dreams wendy said desperately our mum said pierce was a friend she said we could trust him for ever she said wed be safe and we are and hes nice as nice and sometimes i even hug him like the other kids but at night i have dreams and he gets all mixed up withwith the other one has pierce ever done anything to you in a way you dont like anything at all was this shanni asking these sort of questions she was a city girl with no responsibilities with her head in the art world what was she doing asking questions like these but she must no wendy said and there was something about her that told shanni she couldnt lie about this it was too important for some reason shed decided to admit shanni to her confidence and she was going as far as she could so theres no reason to be afraid of him except the dreams i cant stop dreaming wendy said desperately i try and i try but the dark comes oh sweetheart shanni said trying not to cry youre safe now youre absolutely safe im protecting you pierce is protecting you so is everyone in this castle and tomorrow were going for a swim at the beach before breakfast ii know who cut your hair shanni asked suddenly the childs crop looked as if it had been attacked by a pruning saw ragged and uneven it ranged from almost touching the collar of her pyjamas to being almost scalpshort i did wendy said distracted from nightmares for a moment when we had the chicken pox abby spilled her drink and i was mopping it up under the table when donald spilled craft glue it went into my hair i tried to wash it out but it wouldnt wash so i cut it what did pierce say when he saw he phoned the hairdresser but she wouldnt cut it cos of the chicken pox she put a hand through her ragged curls its okay its not shanni said here at last was something she could do girl stuff after your swim tomorrow what say you and me go into town and find a hairdresser and a clothes shop youre wearing the same clothes as abby mum said it was easier yes but your mum was sick and i like a challenge she grinned theres nothing like a bit of retail therapy to drive away nightmares ill hit pierce for an advance on my wages if he wont pay retail therapy clothes shanni said clothes and shoes and hair pretty stuff girl stuff youre eleven years old wendy maclachlan you can be a kid and have fun all you want to but its time you had a play at being a young lady chapter eight pierce stood on the battlements and stared out over the moonlit sea this was one of the most beautiful places on earth he should be soaking in the beauty of the night instead all he could think of was the haunted face of the child hed just left shadows so many shadows haunting them all how the hell could he face them down for wendy when he hadnt faced down his own shes asleep the soft words made him turn shanni had come up beside him so close she was touching him she was wrapped in a blanket her pyjamas underneath the pig pyjamas i was going to leave her in bed with me but she wanted abby so i took her back to bed and waited till she was asleep she hesitated great view she said at last yes shes quite a kid i know that did you know shes been abused he stilled the night seemed to freeze abused not sexually shanni said not that i can figure but the last of maureens partners seems to have knocked her round shes been locked in wardrobes in the dark i guessed something like that he said heavily you guessed i took the kids to a psychologist just after maureen died they were all traumatized to some extentwell they would be when their mother just diedbut the way wendy flinched if i raised my voicebut wendy wouldnt talk to the psychologist there was nothing i could do to make her its some commitment youve taken on i never meant to he said heavily and dug his hands deep into his pockets god knows i wanted nothing to do with all this then why did you take them on i thought itd be easy he said explosively they were almost totally selfcontained before maureen died i was allowed to do nothing wendy and bryce controlled donald and abby they kept out of my way they were quietunnaturally quiet but i didnt know that im thinking now that maureen must have ordered them to leave me aloneto let me do nothing for them anyway it was only after bessy was bornafter id made my promise and my commitmentthat i started seeing the chasm id jumped into chasm i was supposed to hire a housekeeper and head back to the city he snapped how easys that id come down at weekends when i could pat them on the head feel good about keeping them all together and then leave again only now you see that they desperately need someone more than a housekeeper i cant give that sort of commitment i think you already have i havent youre their adoptive father theres no one else hell shanni i dont do commitment because look relationshipstheyre a disaster why its none of your business no butruby had you four different times when you were a kid she said cautiously sure this was none of her business but then when had not being her business ever stopped her from sticking in her oar she was too far in now to draw back she had obligations to wendy and if that meant facing down pierces ghosts then so be it shanni family counsellor right so that meant you kept going back to your mother she asked for a moment she thought he wasnt going to answer then he shrugged whenever she had a relationship so when she had a man she wanted you as well how did that work she played happy families my mother loved talking about my husband my son only she had to have them both both or nothing so when the relationship ended back id go to foster homes to ruby when i was lucky so the end of each relationship meant you went back to being safe with ruby she whistled boy a psychiatrist could have a carnival with you do you mind he demanded and she shrugged and managed a smile no cos im interested she hugged her blanket closer and ive just played psychologist with wendy so i might as well do it with you does this all mean youll never want marriage or your own kidswhich is why you offered to take on maureens maybe you even thought it could protect you even more from relationships his face was frozen blank and hard im going to bed did anyone lock you in a cupboard there was a loaded silence shed gone too far she thought whoops was she doing more harm than good that was starting to be the story of her life you did get the sort of treatment that was meted out to wendy she said softly you and maureen both which is why you had to help her oh pierce this is crazy he was staring out to sea carefully not looking at her he was big and tough and carefully selfcontainedrigidly selfcontained i will not have anyone feeling sorry for me no why would you she whispered youre a wealthy bachelor with a brilliant professional reputation and the world at your feet as opposed to me a penniless practically orphan orphan they changed the locks on my childhood home youre how old theyve locked me out from susie belle he choked his laughter made her smile that was what shed been aiming for its not such a tragedy she admitted softly as you imply im a big girl ill deal with my trauma myself her smile faded but wendy cant ill talk to nick tomorrow hes a qualified child psychologist and hes worked with damaged kids this castle has everything shanni said and went back to looking out to sea she was too close to pierce she thought but she couldnt step away without seemingwithout seeming id like to take wendy shopping tomorrow she said he blinked he looked confused she thought well why not that made two of them why do you want to go shopping retail therapy she hesitated im thinking this is a glorious time to give these kids the individual attention they crave theyve been a solid bunch until nowtheyve had to be but they also need to learn to be their own people thatll happen soon enough sorry you think learning to be your own person means learning not to need doesnt it hey im not the psychologist ask nick i dont need to ask nick anything no you stand alone only youre not able to not now youve officially adopted these kids as yours if youre not careful youll end up needing them as much as they need you i dont know what you mean says the man who walks alone she grinned even tarzan had his jane youre being silly and youre being serious she gazed deliberately out at the sea some more trying to build some emotional distance between them you know this is the most fantastic place it is so why arent you working i have been working i was out in the hall when i heard wendy then i came up here to think am i stopping you thinking yes theres a blunt answer she said and chuckled someone sensitive might take that to mean shove off but youre not sensitive nope you should be in bed you hardly slept last night im sorry wendy woke you im not its far more important to banish demons than sleep you as a tarzan lookalike should surely know that shanni i know im out of line she stared out at the moonlit sea some more it was almost getting boring but otherwise she had to look at him and looking at pierce was really really hard you and the kids are so needful will you cut it out im not very good at butting out of whats not my business she shrugged and then smiled again besides its keeping my mind off my own troublesand you are paying me for it paying you for what for taking care of the children so take care of the children he snapped sounding exasperated leave me out of it but you guys are all mixed up youre a family thats not working we are not a family it was practically a roar and she blinked and took a step back whoa i never meant you never meant youre not a family yes no hell shanni youre terrified im not the kids will recover here ill get the bulk of my work done then well set our minds to find a proper housekeeper it cant work why not because youre involved im not involved she paused not sure where to go from here this man was all macho male on the outside but inside she was starting to see he was the same battered kid shed met almost twenty years ago hey the human race isnt scary she whispered isnt it no its not she said and suddenly she reached out and took his hands it was a gesture made almost before she knew what she was doing but it felt right his hands felt good in hersbig and warm and reassuring she was reassuring him she thought getting a bit confused it was pierce who was standing on the battlements looking like he was seeing ghosts she wasnt taking warmthshe was giving it her blanket had fallen off its okay to fall for the kids she said loves not really scary says the lady with the ice bucket she chuckled see if i hadnt thought id fallen in love id never have known what it was like to toss a bucket of ice water over a naked slimeball and his floozy and thats a plus definitely a plus youre nuts i know she said gathering her dignity about her as best she couldslightly tricky when she was covered in pink pigs and her blanket was around her ankles but at least im not scared to have a go at falling in love at life she said with dignity youre saying im scared of life who knows she stared up at him for a long moment his face looked harsh in the moonlight dark and angular and stern but she knew what it was like when he smiled she wanted him to smile again badly come shopping with wendy and me in the morning she said she was still holding his hands for some reason it seemed almost impossible to let them go im not sure what the setup here is hamish and susie may have plans they do have plans their plans are to give the kids the best time they know how if that involves us absconding with one small girl to make her happy the others might get upset dont you believe it they look after each other this lot and if we explain wendy needs some tlc ill bet they wont make a single protest tlc what you need she said tender loving care shannihe pulled back with his hands but she didnt let go stop looking terrified i am not terrified are too let go of course i will she said and her stupid wayward mouth kept on working even though a lesser mortalor a more sensible onewould have pulled back long since im battered too remember no way am i sliding into another dumb relationship so youre safe with me but youre not safe from everyone pierce you cant stay in isolation for ever it doesnt even feel good i dont you dont know what it is to connect she smiled teasing not sure that what she was doing was sensible or even possible its great just close your eyes and jump and before he could say a wordbefore he could make a move to protect himselfshe released his hands she placed her own hands on the sides of his face and tugged him down and she kissed him it was meant to be fun it was meant to be different from the night beforea teasing bantering kiss a reminder to this aloof man that connecting could be fun maybe after last night she was crazy to make such a gesture but she did rightly or not and what followed her blanket had already fallen off but nowmore than her blanket fell off her prudence her sanity her dignity all disintegrated in that tiny instant when his lips came in contact with hers it was crazy it was ridiculous unlike last night this time shed meant to be a woman in control of the situation teasing him a little flirting maybe even mocking but it wasnt working because none of those descriptions of what she was doing fitted the reality of now she wasnt teasing nor was she in control she was aware of one thing only the feel of his lips on hers wow as simple as that wow shed kissed beforeof course shed kissed beforebut where had this feeling been then this sensation of heatof fusingof two halves coming together connecting as if theyd been torn apart and had been trying to find their way together long since heat the sensation of his lips touching hers sent fire right through her she could feel it coursing from her toes to her fingertips what was happening this was no longer a fleeting kiss he was holding her as if like her he was no longer cool and controlled but rather hed been taken over by a surge of feelings so strong that he could do nothing but give in to them how long they stayed like that she could never afterwards remember she had bare feet they were cold against the stones and afterwards in the privacy of her bedroom she would feel them and think shed been dumb to stay on the battlements for so long but that was for later that was for a time when she could feel her feet which wasnt now now her mouth opened under his and it was like she was melting into him pierce his kiss deepened and deepened again she was holding him tight glorying in the strength of him the arrant maleness the sheer wonder of his body against hers the fusing of their mouths was no longer enough he was exploring her body with his hands holding her close forcing her breasts to mould against his chest he was glorying in the sensation of two bodies merging just as much as she was an image crept into her mind how strange that it should have stayed with her and resurrected itself here at this time it was the vision of pierce as shed first seen him fifteen years old tall dark and malnourished all angular bones and shadows the image was so strong that it was almost a part of her had she held him in her heart all this time it was ridiculous but it wasnt it suddenly felt right the coming together of something that was almost meant to be crazy fanciful but powerful beyond belief so powerful that it almost terrified her but it didnt terrify her so much that she pulled away she couldnt for along with the terror came something else something so sweet and so strong that she felt she was changing a chrysalis shedding its outer shell to reveal a beauty that made her gasp pierce she held him close aware that part of her was kissing that bereft solitary fifteenyearold seeking to comfort seeking to warm but most of her was kissing the man hed become the man whod taken in these children when the last thing he wanted was family responsibility the man whod driven a bull from her path the man whose smile made her heart turn over and whom she wanted with every fibre of her being in another time another place they might have been so out of control that things might have moved to their logical conclusion for shanni there was no question this kiss had changed her world and her fragile web of control was so shattered that she could only savour the kiss savour the feel of him and hold him never wanting to release him only of course this wasnt another time or another place they were on the battlements of a childrens home in the building behind them were five children in their charge this crazinessthis wondermust be interrupted and it was a door opened somewhere beneath them and sensor lights flooded the battlements like searchlights blasting into their cocoon of privacy leaving them exposed and confused leaving shannibereft hey it was a womans voice yelling from below they pulled apart like guilty teenagers shannis blanket was around her toes dazed and dishevelled fighting to regain some semblance of reality she bent to retrieve it leaving pierce to talk to whoever was calling up to them from below is that you pierce it was susie lady of loganaich hi pierce called and his voice sounded as shaken as shanni was feeling maybe even more i should have told you weve got an alarm wired to sound if people are up there susie said apologetically for the kids oh heck shanni thought dumbly and did a furtive search for security cameras were really sorry we woke you pierce called and shanni thought thank god he could talk because she didnt think she could you didnt wake me susie called i was pacing the kitchen thinking wishful thoughts about dill pickles dill pickles okay there was something really grounding in dill pickles youre pregnant shanni said cautiously peering over the edge oh its shanni too susie called cheerfully hi shanni yep im just a little bit pregnant susie a deep male voice called from inside the open castle doors where the hell are you im out here protecting the battlements susie called and then as hamish lord of loganaich emerged from the big front doors she walked forward and hugged her husband she did it naturally and easily as if it was her right a woman with her man shanni swallowed the sight was suddenly almost overwhelmingly enticing this man and this woman loved each other pierce was so close whos on the battlements hamish growled kissing his wife tenderly on the top of her head and then turning to gaze upwards shielding his eyes from the glare of the floodlights shanni and pierce were lit like christmas candles or like gargoyles decorating the turrets shanni stared at pierce he looked ruffled he looked wonderful her pierce and suddenly she chuckled surprising even herself whats funny pierce demanded i was just thinking we made great gargoyles shanni said loud enough for the couple below to hear me and my blanket speak for yourself pierce growled mrs and mr gargoyle she said deciding humour was the only way to go you didnt look like you were carved in stone when i first saw you susie called up to them shannis a bit cuddly for a gargoyle pierce retorted the night was spinning out of control again cuddly shanni demanded still trying desperately to use humour to defuse the way she was feeling cuddly shed meant to lose a few poundsbut cuddly pierce was grinning definitely cuddly she glowered i guess gargoyles play at night susie called when everyone else is in bed which is where we should all be right now hamish interjected he was wearing pyjama bottoms and nothing else pierce was the only one among them decorously dressed are you guys all right were fine pierce called back and the kids asleep we were justtalking about the kids thats what it looked like susie said and grinned so why are you up hamish demanded turning on his wife again i was looking for a dill pickle dill pickle why dont we have dill pickles in the larder or sardines sardines in a can i cant find them anywhere this is going to be a very long pregnancy hamish said sounding resigned you want me to wake up the dolphin bay grocer and get a priority delivery of pickles i can live without them susie said and sighed if i must if i can get them very early in the morning id like to go into town tomorrow and get wendy a haircut shanni called trying valiantly to get a handle on a conversation that seemed to be getting away from all of them especially her i can get dill pickles then ill come with you susie said hey im coming too pierce said and the conversation spiralled again why had he said it shanni looked at him and then looked away he seemed more confused than she was we could all go hamish said no at least the lady of loganaich sounded decisive you cant actually i cant either cos we promised the rest of the kids they could spend the whole day on the beach and they dont know how to swim imagine that what a pleasure to teach them how much fun the water is and ive suddenly thoughttheres anchovy paste in the larder i think thatll do god help us said hamish were wasting time susie retorted i could be spreading toast with anchovy paste this very minute goodnight guys and she towed her husband anchovywards without another word leaving shanni with pierce alone really alone as soon as the pair below went inside the floodlights flicked off hamish and susie had obviously decided the pair on the roof needed darkness as well as solitude this wasnt altogether wise it wasnt wise at all pierce was looking blank verging on appalled wrong look shanni took a couple of steps backwards theres no need for you to come into town tomorrow she managed wendy and i will be fine she flinches when im near only when she forgetsthat youre you so maybe i should be working on that its not so important if youre going to step back she said diffidently trying hard not to think how close he was how she wanted him so much to take her hands again to no if youre really planning on finding a housekeeper and seeing them only on weekends she managed its the sensible thing to do is it i dont commit he said sounding confounded and she nodded okay a girl had some pride me either not after mike it was just as well to get that out in the open it was a declaration that what had just passed between them was an aberration nothing more im sorry i kissed you pierce said which proved he was following her train of thought and agreeing it was a very nice kiss she said cautiously trying really hard to keep her voice neutral ive never been kissed on battlements before though i thought it was me kissing you you want to do it again whoa he was asking what was he thinking when his face still had that appalled look nno best not he said gravely we wouldnt want to give the gargoyles the wrong impression right she ought to turn round and head inside she thought but she couldnt quite get her feet to do the turning so youre never intending to get married to have kids of your own was she out of her mind asking questions like this but they sort of begged to be asked thats why i agreed to marry maureen you dont think that maybe one kid might be fun her mouth seemed to be working independently of her head i have five you made that decision before being landed with five kids she said sticking to her guns no babies she hesitated why do you hardly ever see ruby i see ruby once a month i drop in and say hello or at least i did until i had the kids to look after on my own a nice formal visit whether she wanted it or not yes but she does want oh i bet she wants but do you pardon do you love ruby i owe ruby everything yet you married and adopted five kids and you didnt tell her shed get involved so youre saving ruby from herself as well as saving you you dont have a clue no she said cautiously this feeling deep within was growing stronger by the minute this feeling that somehow shed fallen for this man twenty years ago and had been waiting ever since it was dumb but it was there and it was making her throw caution to the wind but im starting to wonderdo you ruby lives for involvement you know she lost her husband when theyd only been married for three years i know that and it nearly killed her but instead of closing herself off she opened herself to every needy kid as ive done you havent opened yourself to anyone youre still talking about a housekeeper i cant cope with the kids alone you want your housekeeper to cope with them alone no i dont but youre still thinking itd be nice just to see them on weekends yet when wendy doesnt want you it breaks your heart hell shanni you dont know what you want she said sagely you bought a great big farmhouse cos you thought ruby might be able to use it to save a few more kids and then your foster brothers thought ruby needed to retire so you went along with that but its against your instincts you know your instincts were right in the first place hell i was thinking of temporary fostering not the fulltime care of five grandkids ruby would treat these kids as grandkids and pierce these kids so need a grandmother i wont do that to her its what she wants then the rest of my foster brothers are right she has to be protected from herself oh pierce your feet will be getting cold she looked down at her feet so they will if you dont want to be kissed then youd better go back to bed that took her aback if i stay here will you kiss me she sounded almost forlorn she thought she sounded as if she wanted to be kissedwhich she did with every fibre of her beingbut she knew it wasnt going to happen for the feeling was gone what shed said had been some sort of challenge and it had made him draw back i need to work he said not answering her question and she thought it had been dumb to ask or maybe it hadnt maybe it had forced the end to intimacy right she said do you still wish to stay here for the two weeks he asked suddenly unsure its a free holiday you know wed be okay if you really wanted to stay with ruby thanks but im staying maybe it wasnt wise but she was involved she thought whether she liked it or not if she went to rubys shed spend her time wondering what the kids were doing what pierce was doing three days ago shed been up to her ears in financial and emotional disaster and now here she was distracted by five needy kids and one needy male he wasnt needy he was a gorgeous hunk in charge of his world he waspierce the pierce of her childhood the pierce of now he didnt want to kiss her again i can lend you money pierce said there was a moments stillness you want me to go i never said no but do you want me to go hell shanni i just dont want you to get the wrong idea because you kissed me you mean anger came to her aid then pure unadulterated fury im not a baby if you think that kiss was something special they both knew it was but she wasnt admitting it shed rather die youre not talking even a onenight stand she said forcing her voice to sound scornful one kiss thats right he still sounded uncertain it was just the one kiss actually two she reminded him but its the same thing one swallow does not a summer make how the hell do swallows come into this beats me she backed towards the casement door clutching her blanket but it seemed appropriate im going to bed he didnt move goodnight goodnight she said she stared at his shadowy figure for a long last moment but he didnt move goodnight she said again and turned and fled to her turret bedroom one swallow does not a summer make not even any swallows she thoughtplural kissesplural but he didnt have to kiss her he didnt have to do anything for like it or not stupid or not she was head over heels in love with pierce maclachlan chapter nine it was a long time before pierce sought the sanctuary of his bedroom hed given up on sleep a long time ago practically at the time maureen had arrived needing his help hed learned to survive on snatches gleaned where he could now he stood motionless staring out over the sea trying to find answers shanni was stirring something inside him that hed vowed would never be stirred happy families his childhood had been one long attempt at happy families it had been his mothers dream hed settle in a foster home shed find a new lover shed drag him out of his foster placement and shed start the happy family routine only of course it was always a disaster it would fall apart in weeks or months but never longer then hed be abandoned again the foster placement hed previously been in would almost certainly not still be available so hed start all over again living with strangers trying to make a life once hed gone to ruby shed moved heaven and earth to get him back every time his mother had discarded him but sometimes even ruby couldnt help happy families didnt happen but now he had five children hed adopted them five children and now there was shanni a chameleon of a failed art curator who couldnt paint cows legs who made his kids smile who was orphaned herself lets not get carried away here he told himself hastily her parents were still alive theyd just sublet their house yet when shanni had referred to herself as an orphanit had made him smile but at the same time it had touched something deep inside that had never been touched until now he wasnt interested shes on the rebound from weirdo mike he told himself thats why she kissed you so why did you kiss her there were no answers and wendy had talked to her for some reason that hurt hed done his best to get close to these kidswell to get as close as hed ever want to bebut here was shanni diving in as shed done when she was ten years old boots and all tossing her heart into the ring before her it scared him to death that kiss he shouldnt have kissed her it had changed something inside him something so fundamental hed thought it was part of him to let himself go to lose control no happy families were for others not for him maureens plight had wrenched him out of his isolation but to let him be drawn further there was a part of him that was clenched tight with fear he was falling in love with five kids and that terrified him to extend it still furtherhell he couldnt take that step but shanni shanni he wanted her so much it was like a physical pain but to take that step and then lose it maybe he wouldnt lose it maybe he could take the chance but he didnt trust it this feeling he didnt trust himself over thirty years of drilledin knowledge couldnt be overcome by one kiss by one slip of a girl he shook his head doubts crowding in from all directions she was on the rebound maybe she always kissed like that shed felt sorry for him twenty years ago hell he didnt want pity now the doubts were screaming at him it was like he had six faces before him the kids and shanni all crowding into a heart that had learned early to shrivel in selfdefence he couldnt to take that last stepto admit them in and need them hed hurt them he couldnt give them what they needed hed try the best he could with the kids for he had no choice and neither did they but to take it further was just plain dumb criminally cruel for he knew shanni twenty years ago shed been just as she was todayloving bolshy demanding if he let her in shed demand more than he could ever be prepared to give his love he paced the battlements a bit longer telling himself to move on but the battlements only went so far finally defeated he retreated to his vast bedchamber bessy was still asleep maybe it was the sea air or maybe her tiny body had shaken off the worst of the infection and she was sleeping to heal he ought to sleep to heal himself theres nothing wrong with me he told the sleeping bessy but she wasnt interested he was going nuts two weeks he had to get rid of shanni he decided she was messing with his equilibrium and if there was one thing he valued above all else it was his equilibrium hed taken on five kids and hed been crazy to do that it was done it couldnt be undone and hed do his best for them but this commitment business went no further it terrified him it couldnt extend to shanni butshe needed a rest she was broke she wanted to stay hed asked blake to help at the thought of what hed ask his foster brother to do he settled a little it was three in the morning that meant it was six in the evening in london and blake was in london the international law firm blake worked with meant he had a base in every major financial district in the world sixyeah hed be still working pierce thought like the rest of rubys boys blake was a workaholic ruby had launched them with professional qualifications and past hunger had fed their ambition blake answered on the first ring hey pierce from the other side of the world pierces foster brother reacted with pleasure it was the same for all of them pierce thought like men whod gone to battle together their past meant that they were unfailingly there for each other in a world where theyd learned to trust no one else how goes the menagerie hed told blake what he was doing hed needed his legal expertise blake had reacted with shock and he had been right behind pierces decision not to tell ruby any more than shed overheard great pierce told him now without conviction are you at the farm were at loganaich castle what all of you yeah there was a moments pause then hell pierce ruby will find out about the kids the staff here have sworn confidentiality besides these people dont see ruby she was only here at the opening in her past foster parent role if youre sure im sure cos bro much as i love you if youre in trouble with those kids youre not landing them on ruby i wont do that blake heard the finality of pierces tone and backed off im sorry i know you wont so to what do i owe the pleasure of this call shanni shanni as in rubys niece your temporary housekeeper thats the one you got the consent forms i sent you i did so i was wondering where its at are we in a rush blake asked cautiously yes why shes broke pierce said and im stuck with her until shes not broke any more i want her gone there was a moments pause umi thought you needed her for the kids i dont why not because the staff here are competent to do any caring thats required and i dont want her getting any closer to the kids because hell blake im supposed to guess no shes pretty right no was she he thought back to shanni and her pig pyjamas and her blanket a bit shes gorgeous maybe whats that got to do with it nothing i just wonderedso shes at the castle with you yes and you want to get rid of her yes and you cant get rid of her unless she has money shes been running this art show in london i know that so youve been working on it i have and too soon to tell boyo blake said lazily you might be stuck with her for a few days yet but a promise might be enough to get her off my back shes really riding you no i youre in trouble blake said slowly on a note of discovery youve fallen for rubys niece i cant stand her why cant you stand her shes sticking her nose into things that arent her business meaning shes invading your personal space that too i tell you blake i want her gone i need to find a competent middleaged woman who can give these kids the care they deserve and shanni cant shes a flibbertigibbet shell have them fall for her and shell be off with the next man shes a flirt and the rest god help us blake she landed in australia worse than broke she turned up to work for me without checking the situation and now shes taking wendy shopping im missing a few bits here theres nothing to miss shes an irresponsible nuisance and i need your help to get rid of her ill see what i can do and meanwhile he paused meanwhile what meanwhile you just take care little brother something tells me youre in way out of your depth im not yeah and pigs might fly i need to get back to work see ya the problem with fireplaces was they had chimneys the problem with rooms back to back in a turret meant that they shared a wall with a fireplace with one chimney in such a situation sound travelled up chimneys but on the way it managed a detour into the room behind shannis room shes an irresponsible nuisance and i need your help to get rid of her the words made her feel physically ill an irresponsible nuisance i am not she told the dark i cleaned your house and i fed your kids and i managed to get donald away from the bull where does irresponsible nuisance come into that it had been a bit irresponsible to land on his doorstep without checking so hed lied by inferring there was only one child thats me being irresponsible anger helped override hurt a bit she indulged herself in anger a bit more and found she was so wild she wanted to storm next door and hit him which would indeed be irresponsible she should just go she wasnt wanted he hated her being here hed kissed her against his better judgement and now he was talking to some stranger telling him she was interfering in his life right shed go shed put aside her pride and ring her parents for help jules would put her up until her parents could transfer some money she was almost twentynine years old planning on sleeping on her best friends floor until her parents could rescue her she felt about six anger faded and desolation took over she sniffed she was an irresponsible nuisance so much for imagining she was in love so much for being in love her anger had helped but it had faded now she was left feelingdumb and lost bereft an irresponsible nuisance pierce thought that of her and shed been stupid enough to fall you dont fall in love in three days she told herself but what else was causing this awful empty sensation in the pit of her stomach she wanted to cry she wanted to sob into her pillow but maybe pierce would hear her just as shed heard him knowing his sense ofwhat noblesse oblige shed read that somewhere and it just seemed to fit pierce honourableexcept when he was talking to his friend and he didnt think shed hear hed probably come rushing in to comfort her and hed dont go there like barging in and confronting him in fury it might leadit might lead she sniffed again but very quietly a girl had some pride even if she was madly in love with a guy who thought she was an irresponsible twerp shed go shed promised to take wendy shopping okay ill do that she told herself and then ill go meanwhile she had to sleep she shut her eyes the fireplace was just next to her bessy stirred and whimpered and pierce whispered into the dark there were a few more whimpers a sigh and then the sounds of movement next door dont cry baby he might just as well have been speaking to shanni so immediate was his voice hush hush she whispered echoing into the dark youll be okay pierce murmured you have two great sisters and two great brothers thats enough family no its not she felt like yelling but she didnt he didnt want her input hed kissed her actually shed kissed him no matter hed kissed her back and he had no business kissing her like that when he didnt feel like she did irresponsibly attracted irresistibly attracted she groaned rolled over and buried her head under her pillow shanni his voice had her sitting boltupright yes are you okay why wouldnt i be okay you groaned i groaned in my sleep if youre going to listen in on every groan you groan in your sleep i must do i dont know i was asleep you sound wide awake now i was asleep the sound travels really well through these fireplaces it must do she said acidly if you heard me groaning there was a moments pause then a cautious you really were asleep you want a statutory declaration in front of witnesses when i phoneddid you hear im going back to sleep but goodnight shanni now she lay flat on her back and tugged her pillow back over her face sleep right what had he said on the phone he couldnt remember had she heard shed said she was asleep he didnt believe her da bessy said and pierce stared down at the infant in confusion the names pierce he said da said bessy pierce said pierce some of us are trying to sleep shanni said da fine pierce said bitterly giving up call me what you want bessy you talk to shanni shanni you talk to bessy shes your daughter shanni called da said bessy and grinned help things were closing around him things he didnt have a name for he felt trapped sleep bessy was holding her arms out pleading to be picked up the empty fireplace loomed almost ominously shanni was just through there listening to every sound he made okay bess he said wearily have it your own way ill change your nappy and well both get some sleep even if its in the same bed do paediatricians advise babies should sleep in the same beds as their parents shanni asked if youre the expert bessy can sleep with you oh im not an expert she said blithely im an independent spirit i walk alone just like you did before you adopted five kids shanni and im out of here just as soon as ive taken wendy shopping she continued you wont see me for dust so you never have to worry about me kissing you again irresponsible nuisancehuh chapter ten plans for the kids within the castle walls seemed flexible to say the least we have no fixed schedule susie said as they sat around the vast kitchen table the next morning she was making pancakes the earl was making toast taffy the dachshundcumcocker spaniel was cruising back and forth under the table waiting for crumbs every kid who comes here is different and carers have different needs as well she glanced at pierce and then at shanni you guys both look like you need a good sleep we dont they said in unison and susie grinned theres really no need to man the battlements at night she said the barbarians were seen off long since the only thing we need to guard against is pumpkin snatchers hamish said smiling at his wife how big is ours now three feet seven inches in diameter on the old scale susie said with pride we grow competition pumpkins she added for the benefit of the confused assemblage you want to see my pumpkin patch after breakfast i want to go back to the beach said abby theyd already had a prebreakfast paddle and so you will susie declared straight after pancakes shanni and i are going shopping wendy said almost whispering and shanni hauled herself out of her own misery to pay attention to the kid over the table wendy had ceased to believe in promises shanni thought this kid whod guarded her family for so long she turned and caught pierce watching wendy he was feeling exactly the way she was feeling dont look do not think you know what this man is feeling he doesnt want anything to do with you she gulped turned her attention to the justarrived pancakes and didnt look up again but he was watching her now she knew he was watching her she could feel it she was going nuts yep were going shopping she muttered mouth full anyone else want to come i have the plastic pierce said she swallowed her pancake there was a lump that wasnt pancake that refused to be swallowed she didnt want to be dependent on pierces money not this morning not ever hey shoppings a girl thing susie said breaking a silence that was suddenly uncomfortable pierce accept that youll be in the way shanni we have accounts with every business in dolphin bay put it on our tab and pierce can fix us up later thats fine pierce said he doesnt want to come with us shanni thought great whats the limit she asked him biting her lip if shed been financially independent again shed say hang the expense hang the expense pierce said spend what you need to make my daughter happy it was such a huge statement that they all blinked wendy most of all your daughter she whispered that means you honey he said and rose and ruffled her ragged curls okay you and shanni go and do your girl thing the rest of us will go to the beach okay yay the boys yelled im a girl abby said anxiously so you are pierce said my second daughter so the choice is yours do you want to go to the hairdresser and shop for clothes with wendy and shanni or do you want to help us build sand castles and learn how to ride a boogie board a boogie board its what surfers learn on bryce breathed cool can taffy come to the beach abby asked of course said susie then im going to the beach said abby me too said bryce me too said donald then thats settled susie said in satisfaction well all go to the beach except wendy and shanni pierce you drive them into town and then collect them when theyre finished well take care of bessy great said pierce and looked warily at shanni i can drive my own car shanni said if yours is the toyota then no you cant hamish said why not you left the window open last night he said apologetically did you and donald stop for fish and chips on the way here we might have she said cautiously and left the remains on the back seat he grinned every gull from here to sydney has been exploring your car theres enough bird dung on the backseat to fertilize a whole pumpkin patch just lucky we have the pumpkin patch to accommodate it susie said cheerfully dont fret she told shanni well have it clean in no time but meanwhile you need pierce to drive you cant we walk not if you want to be back by dinner time i can drive pierces car ill drive you pierce growled and susie grinned and looked from shanni to pierce and back againand grinned some more i thought you two were friends hes my employer she said tightly is he now susie said cordially and here i was thinking she broke off but hey its not my job to think my jobs pancakes but pierce will be driving you and coming straight back cos otherwise ill have to wait at least three hours for my dill pickles and some needs cant be ignored im sure my baby is growing stunted as we speak owing to a severe deficiency in the dill pickle department they drove into town in silence wendy seemed overawed pierce seemed almost grim shanni was just plain confused youre happy were doing this she demanded as he pulled up in the dolphin bay main street a dozen little shops fronted the harbour the shops seemed quiet at this hour of the morningall the action looked as if it was down at the boats i want you to do this he said butyou dont want to shop for her yourselfas if in reply wendys hand came out and gripped shannis pierce glanced down he didnt say anything but shanni knew hed seen the gesture and it had hurt girls stuff wendy whispered but pierce is paying shanni said to wendy if he really wants to maybe he could watch the grip on shannis hand tightened still further i wont watch pierce said flatly okay im off to find dill pickles you want me to pick you up in three hours at lunch time wendy whispered and there was an unspoken invitation in her words ill meet you for lunch then shall i pierce asked great here at twelve but shanni felt odd there was seemingly nothing she could say without tension she didnt understand it bye she said because she couldnt think of anything more erudite bye said wendy and tugged her forward towards the hairdresser they walked towards the shops but shanni was aware that pierce was watching them until they disappeared from sight they had a brilliant morning pure fun first the dolphin bay hairdresser gave wendy a fantastic elfin haircut and then inspired suggested streaks an hour later wendy emerged her copper red hair beautifully streaked with lighter blonde highlights it might have been over the top for an elevenyearold but wendy had watched in the mirror as her new hairstyle was blowdryed and her expression made it supremely worthwhile im pretty wendy whispered and the hairdresser beamed ive had to cancel two clients this morning she confided to shanni but the minute i see one of the castle kids come through this door i drop everything the whole town understands and nothings ever given me such pleasure then they hit the shops and here the attitude was the same wendy was a castle kid therefore shed be treated as a princess clothes were magically discounted extras were added the lady in the dress shop sent her daughter running to the haberdashery to find matching ribbons for wendys new haircut the youth in the shoe shop was serving someone else when they came in he barely spared them a glance but the customer he was serving an old fisherman lumbered to his feet gave the kid a clout across his ears and beamed across at them no you take the seat young lady he told wendy you kids come first in this townjason here just hasnt realized it they were helped every step of the way and when she and the beautiful new wendya wendy dressed in a tiny bouncy skirt and crop top gorgeous bright red sandals and with curls that gleamedpurchased double flavoured icecreams and sat on the wharf waiting for pierce shanni thought every person in town was finding a reason to peek she felt proud this was a fantastic community she thought surely the community round two creek farm could be the same and then pierce was pulling up nearby and she found she was holding her breath wendy had stilled her ice cream was held out so she wasnt dripping on her new clothes but she was no longer licking what pierce thought mattered to wendy shanni thought and she watched pierce stride towards them and decided yep it mattered to her too once the shadows were dispelled wendy would love this man shanni could too wrong shanni already did dumb she was an irresponsible pest she had no part in this embryonic family what she was feeling was a romantic yearning started at ten and never squashed it had to be squashed now meanwhile she watched pierce come towards them and she found she wasnt breathing pierce stopped dead thirty feet away he put his hand to his eyes as if shading them from the sun as if unsure what he was seeing its shanni he said sounding awed butis that wendy wendy giggled it was a tiny really nervous giggle but it was a giggle for all that youre beautiful pierce said and it was exactly right not an overblown exclamation just a simple stating of facts wendy smiled she did a coy eyelash flutter her smile turned to a beam im so proud of you pierce said and he walked the final few steps and looked down at her he didnt even glance at shanni which was great there was no conspiratorial look saying havent we done the right thing it was purely between wendy and pierce can i hold your icecream shanni said guessing what was coming and then as wendy didnt answer she took it anyway and she was right pierce was lifting wendy high and swinging her round in his arms so fast that wendy squealed a delighted kids squeal and everyone watching beamed and beamed shanni blinked this was nothing to do with her she thought frantically she was out of here lunch pierce said setting wendy down but tucking her against him unless youre full of icecream my icecreams melted wendy said shanni looked down at her hand shed forgotten the icecream yes it had melted a blueheavenandraspberry icecream was oozing down her hand oh yum somewhere special for lunch pierce said fish and chips on the beach not today pierce told them theres a great little restaurant up near the lighthouse we took ruby there the day of the castle opening they have champagne champagne wendy said cautiously we need to toast a new start pierce said smiling lazily at her starting today but first we need to find shanni a tap she appears to be more than a little bit sticky so they found a tap and then they walked along the cliff path to the lighthouse wendy in the middle one hand holding shannis the other holding pierces it feltweird pierce had booked it was a saturday so the small café was filled with tourists but they were shown to the best table in the house it had a view seemingly all the way to america bench seats were piled high with overstuffed cushions and brightstriped curtains and wind chimes were everywhere the place looked like some sort of middle eastern harem wendys jaw was down round her ankles and when the waiter poured champagne into gorgeous crystal flutes she was almost popeyed youre too young for champagne pierce told her and you probably wont like it anyway but its an important drink for an important toast he stood up raising his glass heres to a job well done he told wendy youve kept your brothers and sisters safe youve taken care of your mum youve fought off your shadows this toast is to safety its to say you can relax now you can go back to being a kid because im doing the caring and i wont let you down i promise ill drink to that shanni said and stood up and beamed down at wendy she felt surreal like things were moving without her our brave wendy our beautiful wendy pierce said and clinked his glass then as wendy bravely clinked and sipped and wrinkled her nose he grinned before we let you at the lemonade heres another toast our wendy he said heres to shanni as well for she braved the bull and more she braved the ladies of the craggyburn supermarket well done shanni it sounded like a conclusion now i can bow out shanni thought but she smiled and clinked her glass the waiters came and replaced wendys champagne with red lemonade how can you like champagne better than this wendy demanded incredulously and pierce smiled and so did shanni but shanni was having trouble making her smile work the meal was fantastic they perused the amazing menu and then somewhat shamefacedly admitted to each other that really they wouldnt mind the fish and chips so out came the restaurants version of the humble fish and chips it was a seafood feast a vast platter of tiny flathead tails in crispy batter fresh prawns juicy scallops under a bed of curling twists of lemon oysters opened in front of their eyes mountains of crunchy french fries they ate until they thought they might burst and then they sat back contentedly and watched the coming and going of boats from the harbour and shanni thought this is paradise i think its time for a swim pierce said at last as stillness descended on them and drowsiness took over that is if were not so heavy we sink to the bottom with no trace now she had to do it now im leaving this afternoon shanni said there was a stunned silence leaving pierce said cautiously you cant leave wendy said wherewhere are you going im going to visit my friend in sydney who pierce said jules i didnt think you had any friends hey i was brought up in this country she said with as much dignity as she could manage just because ive been away for the last few years you dont have any money i have enough whats enough thats none of your business she swallowed though if youd like to pay me for the last four days thatd be very welcome of course ill pay but you cant go wendy said horrified we want you to stay i know shanni said ruefully she hated doing this she just hated it but sitting between them she knew she must for wendy was already looking at her with trustand with something deeper she didnt want to hurt wendy for the world to stay here for any longer to start a relationship she couldnt continueshe couldnt to leave fast when the glories of the castle were still before them was possible to stay any longer would be selfish and there was pierce she was falling deeper and deeper in love with them all she thought desperately but especially she was falling in love with pierce and there was no way pierce would let that lead to any soppy happyeverafter ending she was a nuisance she had to get out of here you heard that phone call last night pierce said his eyes not leaving her face yes she said and jutted her chin shanni i didnt mean it no but its true im superfluous she took a deep breath she had to do this she had to be the strong one pierce i want to tell ruby about these kids you cant i can in truth she was in territory she didnt understand but more and more she didnt have a choice i know you dont want to bother her but believe me the longer you keep this from her the more shell be hurt shes already unbelievably hurt that you married and had bessy without telling her youre not going to be able to keep things from her any longer she fought for another breath and then turned her attention to wendy you know you guys need a proper housekeeper not someone like me who doesnt know the first thing about what kids need someone wholl love you to bits pierce has a lovely old foster mother called ruby who needs to meet you all rubys like any other grandmashed be caring for you in a minutebut i agree shes too old now to take you on but if theres one thing rubys good at its networking shell find you a housekeeper shell be vetted from every angle possible like you should have vetted me and youll be able to get on with your lives shanni you cant pierce sounded horrified i can tell her tell your brothers i did it she said sorry pierce but im rubys niece some secrets cant be kept in families and this is one of them you have no right maybe i dont but im doing it anyway she rose feeling shaky she knew she had to do this because even though it was tearing her in two now how much harder would it be if she left it longer wendy im your friend she said looking down at the stricken little face and flinching how could she do this how could she not do this if she was hurting wendy now how much more so if she wasnt honest when you leave the castle ill come to the farm and see you all i promise ill do the housekeeper thingill fill the house with food and make sure things are okay ill see you that day and ill see you any time i can find the opportunity and ill write to you wendy its not the same wendy muttered no but i was your temporary housekeeper she said softly my job here is done the journey back to the castle was made in silence shanni stared straight ahead shed insisted wendy sit up front with pierce she felt small and insignificant in the back seatand mean shed hurt wendy the thought tore her in two but she looked at the rigid set of pierces shoulders and thought what else was she to do she had to walk awayif not run they pulled into the castle forecourt and sat for a moment as if each was reluctant to get out theyll be waiting for you on the beach shanni said gently to wendy wont they pierce they were planning lunch on the beach when i left pierce said theyve set up a cabana for shade and they looked set there for the next month then you need to get your swimmers on and join them i want you to come wendy whispered i cant you mean you wont pierce said thats right she whispered im mean selfish i didnt mean you know very well why im doing this she snapped dont make it any harder he didnt reply shanni saw his hands clench on the steering wheel so hard his knuckles turned white fine he said at last wendy lets get our swimmers but we have to learn to stick together pierce said harshly shannis not part of our family ouch but it was true wendy i love you lots she said ill come down to the beach and say goodbye she climbed out of the car and fled into the castle before they could say another thing in the movies packing was done fast shed seen it the cuckolded husband storming in seizing his suitcase throwing in a handful of shirts slamming the lid and saying ill be back for the final stuff later shanni however was not a storming kind of person she was actually a really messy person she opened her suitcase and stared at the room and tried to figure out where to start shed only been here twentyfour hours hardly time to make herself at home damn she was crying she never cried never ever she sobbed finally she hauled herself togethera littleand marched down to the bathroom to find tissues queen victoria looked astonished and even more disapproving yeah im breaking my heart over five kids and a guy ive known less than a week dumb dumb dumb no answer well what did she expect you were protected from this sort of thing she told the queen married young one baby after another you still broke your heart though she whispered thinking back to history at school to the stories of the abyss of misery victoria had fallen into after the death of albert yeah well you should have found a career you could throw yourself into like i have didnt queen of england count as a career and shanni didnt have a career thanks to mike she had nothing and now thanks to pierce she had less than nothingbut a cracked heart i thought you couldnt possibly fall in love this fast she told victoria sniffing hard i was wrong shanni she stilled it was pierce calling from below stairs where are you he yelled talking to vicky there was a moments silence and then the sound of the stairs being taken two or three treads at a time the bathroom door was locked she and queenvic were safe come out he called why arent you at the beach i took wendy down and came back did they like her hairdo they loved it theyre currently making a sandcastle modelling it on kirsty seeing kirstys nine months pregnant its some sandcastle shanni come out im busy talking to victoria you think im crazy hell no he told her everyone in this damned castle finds a confidante somewhere susie told me shes sure ernst and eric were marriage counsellors in a former life ernst and eric the suits of armour at the foot of the stairs shed forgotten right come out i dont want to you sound younger than abby well then im younger than abby and a damned nuisance shanni im so sorry you heard that conversation last night so am i she snapped and hauled open the door which was a mistake shed thought her anger could protect her at least giving her room to get from the bathroom to the privacy of her bedroom but as soon as she saw him youve been crying he said and he put his hands on her shoulders i have hayfever she said with as much dignity as she could muster im allergic to aspidistra tell queen v its her fault i dont want you to go i have to she took a deep breath im falling in love withthe kids he hesitated then wendys breaking her heart ive been with her less than a week im a friend ill get over it she paused i mean shell get over it she amended so you feel the same about the kids maybe yes she snapped theyre fantastic youre really lucky lucky only you dont see that youre too busy trying to be selfcontained i only know that the kids think youre wonderful so you want me to stay so you can take even more of a back seat i dont think so its not just the kids she held her breath look shanni i yes i dont know he dug his hands deep in his pockets and swore you cook a mean chocolate cookie i do dont i she paused and then softened anger was getting her nowhere he couldnt see what was in front of his eyesthat she was falling hopelessly in love with him and every minute spent with him was making her more miserable for he didnt have a clue how to reciprocate such love pierce im an art curator she said gently im not a housekeeper i used you as an emergency stopgap and now the emergency is over is it yes for ive pulled myself together she gave another sniff as if to prove it so im off back to my world leaving you to get on with yours i still dont want you to tell ruby great back onto neutral ground well it was okay with herif that was all there was you cant stop me she said flatly i wont be a party to hurting my aunty ruby youve hurt her by not telling her about the kids she knows ive been with you and ill be grilled i wont lie just dont go near her my lovely aunty ruby avoid her like you have for the last year i love my aunt ruby and you have rocks in your head for suggesting such a thing shell give me a really hard time he looked so hangdog that suddenly despite her heartbreak she chuckled she will too she said i remember when i was twelve i stayed with her she was having a time out from fosteringthered been a couple of heartbreaks and she needed time so my family sent me to keep her company you remember that white poodle she had miffanwy thats the one it spent its days preening itself in front of the frontroom mirror so so i wanted to have a go at dying my hair but i wasnt game so i tried it out first on miffanwy oh god flaming scarlet the packet said though fireengine red might be a better description anyway miffanwy darn near had kittens and hid under the bed for days and i laughed and ruby took a mop to me a mop she was mopping the kitchen floor when miffanwy came flying out of the bathroombright redand hid behind her legs i was giggling and she raised her mop well i went flying out of the house and she chased me and chased me she was a little tub on legs without a snowballs chance in a bushfire of catching me finally i legged it up a huge eucalyptus in the back yard then i was dumb enough to jeer you cant catch me and so he said and he was smiling she loved his smile she thought she just loved it and so she simply smiled put her mop back over her shoulder and marched away youll be home for dinner she said as she left and i still remember the sinking feeling i had in my stomach as she walked inside but she wouldnt have hit you no oh i might have got a faceful of soggy mop and thatd be it instead of which i had to spend three hours every morning for the rest of my holidays scrubbing out kennels at the local dog shelter he grinned good old ruby the punishment fits the crime it always did shanni stay it slammed back at her he was still smiling that wobbly endearing smile that had her heart turning somersaults but she wasnt going to be drawn in she wasnt she forced herself to deliberately look behind her queen victoria in widows weeds looked sternly down upon them victoria whod fallen so deeply in love that shed spent almost half of her life in mourning and here was pierce a man she could fall for just like that a man she had fallen for no she said because because you dont understand because of the kiss he demanded kisses if you like he stared at her baffled hell shanni no i dont understand neither do i she said sadly i only know i dont have a choice ill go down to the beach and say goodbye and then im leaving please pierce dont stop me i just have togo chapter eleven juless floor was really hard they padded it with cushions even going out to the shop to buy more but as a luxury hotel it lacked a certain something its only until my parents are within phone range shanni reassured her shocked friend they keep going off to digs in the middle of nowhere then let me lend you some money no she said horrified pierce had offered her a loan too hed tried to give her far more than her few days work were worth but shed refused to take it she had enough to feed her for a few more days yet shed visited the employment agencywe dont get a lot of call for art curators dear but if youd consider waitressingtheres two positions coming up early next week so she lay among juless cushions waiting for the waitressing jobs to happen or for her parents to come down from their mountains and she tried really hard not to think of how wonderful a time pierce and the kids would be having at the castle she failed you look like youve been hit by a bus jules said as she flitted in to change on the fourth day shanni was there jules used her apartment as a base for a frantic work and social life shed invited shanni to join her but a round of drinks was higher than shannis budgetand how could she drink when she had a broken heart i have a broken heart she told jules mike was a fink jules said get over it it wasnt mike but she didnt tell jules that more questions would ensuequestions she couldnt answer on the fifth afternoon at juless the doorbell sounded she was in the middle of watching a particularly gripping episode of dallas it was rerunning for the thirtieth time but she hadnt watched it the first time or she hadnt watched it much she was in her pyjamas she nearly didnt answer the door but then got conscientious juless boyfriend was a romantic who solved arguments with flowers and they argued often there were roses in various stages of decomposition all round the apartment itd be a delivery person and surely the least she could do for her friend was accept deliveries she stalked over to the door trying not to think dark thoughts about best friends with a surfeit of roses she hauled the door open pierce i thought you were roses she said stupidly he looked fabulous she thought hiphugging faded jeans opennecked shirt with a button missing his hair doing this floppy thing over one eye he was a bit sunburned hed been at the beach of course he was sunburned he waspierce roses he asked and she flinched they keep arriving roses do yes im sorry im not roses should i fetch some and bring them back dont be silly okay he paused and took in the total package bare toes pig pyjamas hair that hadnt quite been brushed today she wasnt absolutely sure that the chocolates shed been eating werent evident up there somewhere you have a brown splodge on your nose he said there you go what of it she muttered youre doing a miss haversham for mike miss haversham dickenss bride who sits in her wedding finery for ever and for ever watching mice run through the last vestiges of wedding cake im wearing pyjamas and im watching dallas so you are can i come in its juless apartment i promise ill keep it neat he looked over her shoulder at the mound of cushions on the floor chocolate wrappers dying roses jr before someone shot him what do you want she demanded before things went any further lets get this on a business footing dont count chocolate wrappers he smiled i have good news he shouldnt smile it messed with her equilibrium the kids are happy theyre missing you they can hardly miss me when i knew them for less than a week yeah he looked hesitant i guess theyre having a great time at the castle the last of bessys chicken pox has disappeared the kids are living on the beach oh and kirsty had a baby last night a little boy they called him angus thats lovely no susie says angus is her name because thats what the old earl was called but kirsty says shes loved it for ever and she met old angus before susie did and susies baby might be a girl so so all of dolphin bay has a view on whether its right or wrong the current thinking is that if susies baby is a boy they should just call him earl and be done with it right she swallowed why did she feel he was talking for the sake of talking iwhy arent you there im surplus the kids are happy and i needed to come to a meeting in town so you drove up this morning and im going back tonight right pause jr was being icily sarcastic from the television behind them youre not depressed are you pierce asked cautious no yet another moments loaded silence she should ask him in she thought she couldnt the idea was just too dangerous scary almost irresistible would you i came to talk to you about mike he cut across her invitation before she could finish and she blinked mike theres news from blake blake cut it out with the parrot thing he said and she managed a smile right mike and blake what have they got to do with the price of eggs nothing but they have everything to do with your financial situation he told her which is solved solved hey didnt i tell you the parrot thing sorry its just youre so slow blakes got your money back she didnt parrot that she couldnt all her breath was knocked out of her you want to know how he did it he was leaning against the door jamb looking so sexy she could just melt of course he ought to sew that button back on she thought it was doing her head in you had a credit card specifically for paying your artists he said and she somehow hauled her thoughts away from that missing button almost yyes so your credit limit was huge youd buy and sell on almost straight away the bank was happy with that because your professional reputation was impeccable she found herself blushing ever since shed met this man shed felt wrongfooteda dopy adultcumkid who was relying on her parents to bail her out to have him say that everywhere blake enquired he got the same story he said gently youre brilliant but not with money or with trusting shed given mike a duplicate and made him a signatory see heres the thing he said blake used the consent forms you signed to track where the money went if mike had blown it at the casino you were up the creek without a paddle but he didnt hes astute your mike hes not my mike no pierce glanced across at jr who was still not shot surely it should be soon jr was beginning to bug her she wanted to focus exclusively on pierce what he did was buy paintings pierce said three paintings each worth a fortune so so weve got them back pierce said not bothering to hide his exultation you got them back youre doing the parrot thing again will you cut it out she was suddenly yelling the woman behind her was yelling as well daytime soapit had come to this she choked on sudden irrepressible laughter and pierce looked gobsmacked what no something on telly on telly now youre doing it oh tell me about the paintings blake got an injunction he saidwith a visible effort on those forms you signed you said the partnership was over the day of the water tossing blake cancelled the card retrospectively claiming mike had no legal right to use a card in your name once the partnership was void and anything he did buy certainly shouldnt be his on that basis blake got an injunction to seize the paintings and he moved so fast mike had no room to object the paintings will be sold on and used to pay off the card seeing mike bought astutely blake seems to think theyll more than pay off the card with quite a lot left over legally you might have to spilt the profit with mike but with records showing you were paying him a salary then theres a strong case for the entire profit being yours oh pierce she was suddenly holding onto the door jamb herself oh hes good our blake he is she wanted to cry anyway thats all i wanted to tell you he said sounding uncomfortable ill go she wanted to throw her arms round his neck dammitdammit she did throw her arms round his neck she indulged herself for one wonderful moment in burrowing her face in the lovely deep hollow above his collar bone smelling the clean salt smell of him feeling his warmth and his strength i dont know how to thank you she said her voice muffled by neck but he was putting her away from him gently but firmly setting her at arms length thats fine you rescued donald i rescued you were square right why did she feel like sobbing oh and the letters you wrote to my foster brothers whoops was this why he was holding her at arms length she was so interfering that was her life skill to butt into other peoples lives even if in the process it destroyed her own theyve accepted it he said they dont understand but theyve agreed shed written to every one of them bullied into it ruby had given her their email addresses blakes connors sams darcys dominics and nikolais shed said simply that pierce had adopted five children and had not told ruby for fear of her wanting to be involved shed said that she was rubys niece that shed discovered what was going on and that shed told ruby shed said the biggest way they could hurt ruby was not to let her share their lives and that what pierce had done was cruel shed also said their stipulation that ruby not share her home with whom ever she wanted was leaving ruby with a lifetime of macramé and no pleasure so could they please lift their stupid stipulation uhoh you read it she whispered the whole six of them sent it on to me pierce said theyve agreed the stipulations lifted but there was no pleasure in his words they dont get it they dont get it but you do she held her breath maybe im beginning to he said youve taught me a bit ruby and her niece shannitaking in the waifs and strays of the world hey its not me whos taught you anything id have hoped the kids could how do you mean if you have to ask then you really dont understand its just she took a deep breath you know being part of a family a proper family leaves you open for all sorts of hurt like when your parents change the locks exactly she said struggling to figure out what to say next she was feeling more than a little disadvantaged he was looking so damned sexy and she was in pyjamas and she was in no position to lecture him when hed just saved her financially but itd hurt worse if i didnt have them to change the locks she said thats because you havent learned to be independent i hope i never have to he didnt reply he was looking at her but he was looking through her she thought holding himself in check not making real contact what will you do now he asked and she started jolted out of preoccupation what do you mean youve lost the lease on your gallery but there are others blake has contacts in the art world the story about what happened is already in circulation i think youll find its mike whos the bad guy in all this and im just the dope the story doing the rounds is that he swindled you out of what was legally yours your artists would be more than happy to start sending work your way again you have been busy blake has wow she hesitated ill write and thank him and try and explain a bit more about ruby he still wont understand and no thanks are necessary maybe you could have a drink with him when you go back to london maybe i wont be going back to london no i dont know i have this fantastic position here starting monday no need to tell him it was as a waitress in a railway café oh but thanks she said awkwardly and he nodded my pleasure he hesitated if you staythe kids would like to see you again i have plans to see them you do was she imagining it or was there eagerness in his tone you know rubys interviewing housekeepers she told me i knew shed interfere shes loving it shut up and let her be so anyway the day you come home from the farmsaturday week yes rubys never been to the farm and she doesnt drive long distances i said id take her down to see it if she finds someone suitable as housekeeper we thought wed take her down and introduce you see if you like her maybe we could light the stove before you get homemake it a bit welcoming theres no need there is a need she said ruby wants to do it and for me itd be a better sort of goodbye are there variations of goodbye yes she snapped suddenly angry i dont want the last time you see me to be when im wearing pig pyjamas and watching dallas with chocolate on my nose i have some pride you look cute im a businesswoman she snapped a career woman not that youve noticed ive noticed then well be down there shanni what i wish so do i she snapped before he could say another word you have no idea how i wish but its not going to happen now if you dont mind i have things to do i need to wash chocolate off my nose and see whether jr gets it but thats all she said with a lot more finality than she was feeling unless youre delivering roses im closing the door and before he could respond she stepped back through the doorway she looked up at him half hoping hed lunge forward and take her into his arms and kiss her senseless or at least say goodbye nothing he looked blank goodbye then she said herself she bit her lip ill see you briefly next week for a couple of hours and then thats it it nearly killed him to drive away she was so cute she damn near broke his heart and when shed hugged him dont go there things were spiralling out of control the kids that was one area where he was out of control hed imagined that hed take the kids to the castle hand over their care to the professionals and get some real work done he was getting work done but in ways that surprised him sure susie and her army of helpers had taken over care of the kids and the kids were gloriously happy but theyd whoop downstairs on their way to the beach and their cheerful whooping would reach something inside he was trying to block off the blocking tactic didnt work what was happening was that hed stare down at his plans double or triple or quadruple his efforts do what had to be done and then somehow find himself on the beach as well sitting in the shallows with bess on his knee holding up small persons as they struggled with this new wonderful skill called swimming umpiring beach cricket or even taking a turn at the bat himself theyd come home from the beach tired and happy and sleep as theyd never slept before hed hit the plans at night and his work was sailing but all the time he was workinghe was thinking about shanni hell he couldnt ask her ask her what he knew what he wanted to ask her to be more involved than she already was to be no too soon far too soon and shed walked away of course shed walked away as he should have the minute maureen had asked him for her help and where would the kids have been then he swore and concentrated on his driving for a bit his mobile phone rang hed fitted it to the dash so he could take calls when driving his work colleagues had his number and so did the staff at the castle yes hello dear ruby i hope its not an inconvenient time to ring no i just want to know the childrens sizes sizes for my macramé club were having a working bee agh he was being sucked into a black hole he thought and there was no control at all he couldnt even clutch the edges as he slid down did you see shanni ruby asked yes did you tell her the good news about her money yes and is she going back to london i dont think so thats lovely ruby said and he could hear her satisfaction down the phone ruby yes dear dont dont what do what youre doing oh im not doing a thing dear she said and he could hear her beaming you know me i never interfere now just tell mewhat are those sizes chapter twelve the morning they left the castle was heartbreaking the kids were up at dawn for a last swim then they wandered the castle saying their private goodbyes to everything in the place pumpkins and suits of armour included pierce said his own goodbye to queen vic okay large families are fun he admitted but they didnt make you smile after you lost your albert was it his imagination or had her expression changed she lookedsomehow more pitying than disapproving weird look after the aspidistra he told her and made his way down to the breakfast room susies pancake making was well under way theyd have to learn how to make their own pancakes back at the farm shanni would have made a mean pancake cut it out he sat and ate and the kids chattered and taffy begged a piece of pancake from everyone shes going on a diet the minute you guys leave susie said sternly just lucky shes stretchy and theres lots of her to fill hed miss taffy she nuzzled his hand under the table maybe he could get the kids a dog he met susies eyes over the plate of pancakes and she beamed thats a wonderful idea whats a wonderful idea asked wendy what your father is thinking now theres one more treat treat the kids eyes lit up every morning thered been some little thing to look forward to a sandcastle competition a trip to the local aquarium kite flying two days ago theyd all trooped into dolphin bay cottage hospital to check out the new angus he was jaundiced so was spending the first few days of his life under lamps the kids had been enchanted a new little life pierce had thought of the work bessy had been and cringed but a puppy was a lot less work than a new baby maybe youll cope susie said with understanding and he blinked she read him like shanni did dratted women your today treat is dolphin watching susie said and he stopped thinking about shanni for a moment we didnt think wed get a treat today donald said he was the calculator of the family the mind it took three hours to drive here we have to be home by dark and its nine oclock now youre all packed mr ross who runs dolphin bay charters is picking you all up in half an hour with your luggage mrs ross will look after bessy you guys get to see the dolphins then mrs ross will give you a picnic on the beach and you get in the car by one youll be home by four all sorted you wont be coming wendy asked the kids had learned to love bouncy susie they loved her smiley husband and her cute tot of a daughter theyd miss everything about this place we have to get the place ready for a new lot of kids susie explained and wendys face fell special kids not as special as you susie told her and smiled kids come in and i look at them and theyre just kids and by the time they go her eyes glimmered for a moment ill miss you all you guys come back soon she turned to her pancake batter and stirred with sudden violence she sniffed here was another one pierce thought tossing her heart at whoever needed it like ruby like shanni didnt they know what the thought was suddenly unclear the argument as to why he couldnt be like that too bessy tossed a toast crust it hit him right in the face leaving a smear of jam over his left eyebrow the kids looked shockedand then they giggled they wouldnt have giggled two weeks ago this place was a gift women like ruby and susie andshanni were a gift enough he had to move on okay dolphins and then home he told the kids mocksevere and therell be no more toast tossing bessy chortled pleased with the reaction from the first piece she tossed again bulls eye will the balloons stay up until they get here the instructions say theyll stay up for twentyfour hours ruby was fitting red and gold balloons over the helium cylinder while shanni tied ribbons ill sue if they dont last that long that ones going down already thats cos you didnt tie it tightly enough do you think we have enough sausage rolls dwaynes mothers organizing the food im not keen on dwayne as a boys name do you like my boys names i do shanni frowned did you choose them for their names just luck for four of them ruby said but then it got to be sort of a joke my manly little boys with heroic names so when i got connor darcy and dominic as unnamed babies i went straight to my favourite romance novels and found their names there shanni choked your babies were named from romance novels can you think of a better way umno and at least theyre original not like two women fighting over one baby name eh susie eh kirsty dont bring it up susie said darkly kirsty stop gooing over angus and hand me those streamers there were balloons on the gate there are balloons on our front gate bryce said look at the balloons abby said do you think someones pleased were home wendy asked shed been quiet all the way home coming back to the farm wasnt unalloyed pleasure the kids would have to start school again and pierce was aware theyd been given a tough time by the local kids but what could he do maybe rubys housekeeper is here he said cautiously driving in through a gate that was already open i miss shanni abby said she was never a housekeeper she was better than a housekeeper bryce said yeah pierce agreed with that theres a car parked around the back of the shed donald piped up its not shannis car he added it looked likeit was a police car what the if he was in for another inquisition it didnt fit with the balloons on the gate he took a deep breath okay he said suppressing the urge to turn the car round and head back to the castle we need to find out whats going on do you think it might be scary abby asked not scary he said though when he glanced across at wendys set face he wasnt so sure balloons arent scary housekeepers might be wendy whispered theres only one way to find out pierce said stoutly lets go and see he parked the car silence not a sound they walked forward to the back door maybe the balloons had been left as a message of sorts maybe he went to unlock the back door but it swung open at his touch people if hed have to describe that day later on in life the only word he would find to fit was chaos he swung open the door and the place erupted there was a cacophony of noise bagpipessomeone was playing the bagpipes hooters whistles cheering someone was letting off streamer bombs someone lots of someones he backed away but people were tugging him in the kids were being picked up and carried into the room susie had abby susie hamish had donald ruby was surging forward to lift bessy from his arms blake was there his big brother blake was bending down talking urgently to bryce then swinging him up on his shoulders nikolai wasnt nik supposed to be in mexico and dwayne the kid from the supermarket and dwaynes mum and the pharmacist and the doctor the cops as well and numerous sunworn couples he vaguely recognized as neighbours and their kids and jake the dolphin bay doctor from the castle was there from the castle as well with kirsty and their twins kirsty was laughing and holding a blue swathed bundle with pride and jodie and nick the whole castle team shanni was elbowing her way through the mass until she reached wendy wendy she said in satisfaction she hugged the little girl who was clinging to pierce youre with me pierce felt her lifted away but he felt like hanging on wendy might need him he might need wendy dwayne was holding a cake on a tray before him dwayne the cake was massive vast and chocolatecoated surrounded by strawberries it had great red lettering on the top welcome home from all of us from all of them pierce stared round the crowded room there were so many people that they didnt fit they were squeezing themselves in from out in the corridor there were people on the back veranda with their heads in the window it sounded like there were people on the roof dwaynes mother gave dwayne a poke in the small of the back he gulped we wanted to welcome your family home the boy managed talking like he was strangled ummum said his mum said weve treated you like the pits his mother said stoutly from behind him all of us have we had five orphans in our midst andwell we were cruel and it wont happen again the freezers got so many casseroles in it now that weve had to borrow enid murrihys second freezer and put it in the back shed she says you can keep it she added as long as she can put things in when her second daughters due home her daughters allergic you understand so she brings newfangled food from the city enid freezes it and then buries it when brenda goes home shes buried tons and tons of wheatfree breadyou wouldnt believe mum anyway we just wanted to say welcome dwaynes mother said getting back on track weve met your olga and we think shes lovely not that shanni wasnt lovely but olgas much more suitable as a housekeeper shell always get a discount at our supermarket and you cant say fairer than that olga to say he was hornswoggled was an understatement he gazed across the crowd to shanni she was dressed as hed never seen her dressed beforein a gorgeous soft pastel dress with scooped neckline and flowing skirt that reached midcalf she looked happy he thought well why wouldnt she be happy she had her money back she had her life back shed go back to london shanni was motioning to a middleaged lady standing beside ruby olga if it was indeed their housekeeper then olga was different she was stout and rosycheeked she was dressed in jeans that were a wee bit too tight for her she was wearing an oversized gingham shirt and boots that came straight out of the wild west hi she said youre olga youre our new housekeeper i might not be your housekeeper she said smiling nervously as everyone else in the room grinned at pierces confusion its up to you ruby knows ive been at a loose end i used to foster but then i got done for shopliftingchocolate you knowit was one of the kids birthdays and my exhusband had just broken in and taken all the housekeeping moneyand i got a conviction and now im not allowed to foster but ill never shoplift again i swear there was a moments stunned silence from the assemblage dwaynes mother drew in her breath on an audible gasp i know you wont ruby said clearly into the silence thats why i said you might be suitable for pierce rubys the best judge of character i know shanni added for some reason all eyes turned back to dwaynes mother she took a deep breath recovered thats fine then she said gamely if shanni vouches for you then its fine by me its still tenpercent discount and if ever theres a birthday and youre broke then you come to me before you return to a life of crime general laughter general cheering hey he hadnt even interviewed the lady yet pierce thought yet the whole community had seemingly accepted her as a done deal give it up mate dwayne said softly still holding the cake its the women that rule they certainly did his eyes went again to shanni she was watching him she was laughing but even soher eyes said that she knew what he was feeling shed given him a replacement for her cut the cake cut the cake people were saying right speech someone else said in your dreams more laughter the cake was set on the table they cut it as a family pierces broad hand holding the knife and bryce donald wendy and abbys hands on top someone brought bessy forward to encourage her to put her hand down too da bessy said and put her fist squarely into the middle of the cake and then into her mouth the party had officially begun it wasnt just a party it was almost a fair without the profit making there were donkey rides apple bobbing face painting there were eggandspoon and sack races and tossthecaber competitions there was more food than anyone could possibly eat pierce moved through the rest of the day as if in a dream watching the kidshis kidsbeing embraced by the locals being welcomed receiving apologies and promises of largesse from so many people for a man who was used to walking alonewhod spent a lifetime perfecting the artit was almost overwhelming two of his brothersblake and nikwere here clapping him on the shoulder laughing at him but looking at him with some small concern his foster brothers had all been raised in the school of hard knocks themselves their isolation was an art they valued pierce seemed to be tossing it away and it troubled them it troubled him but but he didnt know what the kids finally wilted he took them up to bed and came down again to find clearing up had begun there was still a party happening outside but inside a team was washing scrubbing wiping gossipingthe farm was alive ruby was in the middle of it having a ball she saw him come down the stairs she laid down her dish cloth and came across to him and before he knew what she was about shed enveloped him in a huge hug her small bosomy person held him close and he felt about six again hed never let himself get too close to ruby but shed always hugged him regardless did she know how much those childhood hugs had meant to him thank you he said gruffly as she finally released him its shanni you have to thank not me you found olga shes a treasure shes as desperate for a family as you were im not not any more she beamed oh pierce this is absolute joy im not of course youre not she said deliberately cutting across a denial she maybe guessed he was about to make were cleaning up you go and find shanni did shanni organize this shanni and susie the worlds bossiest women go find her where is she she said she was going out to talk to a bull shanni said she said it was a nice bull hell he was out of the kitchen before she could say another word striding through the bunches of people congregated on the veranda seeking only one person he rounded the veranda and stepped down into the garden over to the gate to the bull paddock she was sitting on the gate post clyde was right beside her she wasnt in the actual bull paddock if clyde turned nasty she could simply swing herself off the post even so the sight of her beside the great bull made him feel ill shanni hi she said without turning round it was like she was expecting him ive just been explaining to clyde that ive forgiven him it wasnt his fault dwayne told me what happened local kids being stupid cruel listening to their parents accounts of wanting you gone and taking matters into their own hands she sighed it can happen so fast to turn you into the local pariah they never did that oh yes they did you were lucky they didnt run you out of town with the odd bit of tarring and feathering to go with it but you changed all that i just told them the truth it wasnt so hard if youd told them yourself how could i tell them any number of ways she snapped sounding irritated like for instance stopping to gossip to the ladies in the supermarket asking them for the right kind of laundry powder and admitting youd been landed with five kids and you didnt know the first thing about laundry if youd done that you would have got them behind you no questions asked months ago i couldnt open yourself to people dont i know it she leaned down and scratched clyde behind the left ear ive just been telling clyde youre a dodo a dodo a very clever dodo shanni mmm will you he hesitated she straightened and stared at him will i what there was another lengthy pause shanni had stopped scratching the big bull tossed his head and nudged her legs she gave a rueful smile and started scratching again i seem to have given myself a lifetime job she whispered will i what pierce he couldnt say the words that were crowding into his head refused to be uttered hed been sucked into a vortex that was terrifying no matter what it seemed he was going down his life was no longer selfcontained he had five kids he had a convicted criminal of a housekeeper called olga who he just knew was going to end up as dependent on him as the kids were he had ruby back on his case sometime during the afternoon shed handed him a parcelmacramé sweaters times five and tonight as hed put donald to bed the little boy had hugged him donald the last of the kids to accept him hed hugged him back and damn it hed felt like crying hed let himself in for a lifetime of macramé and domesticity the whole catastrophe did he mind maybe not so much he thought it was as if hed been hit by flood water but somehow hed managed to float now he was being swept along out of control but somehow he was even managing to enjoy the ride but shannishe had what he could no longer have independence will i what she asked again and the words that had half formed disappeared from view theyre taking orders for coffee he said and he felt her withdraw just a little you came to find me to see if i wanted coffee yes iand i was worried about you being with clyde you think id get in the bull paddock im not so dumb i dont want you taking any risks there was a moments silence you think im a risk taker she said at last yes im not you throw your heart into the ring thats risk taking yes but theres good things that can happen because of it she said so softly he had to lean forward to hear i got to toss ice water over naked people and that has to count as one of lifes great pluses i got my money back thanks to blake the sweetie you have the most gorgeous foster brothers nik has asked me out that was a kick in the gut nik you bastard youre not going im busy she said with dignity im starting a new gallery in london in sydney im going to be wildly fashionable and im buying a dog a dog like taffy i want one just like taffy you deserve something better yeah she turned to him then puzzled what could be better than taffy i having five kids she was teasing smiling down at him in the moonlight and an olga and a ruby and a community like this shanni coffee she said and jumped off the post so suddenly that she caught him unawares his hands came out instinctively and caught her steadied her held her close she smelled wonderful he thought she felt wonderful he wanted to shanni she didnt move she stared up at him seemingly bewildered and then she recovered he saw her face change as if coming to some sort of conclusion she gave the tiniest of nods she tilted her chin and looked mockingly up at him she put her hands on either side of his face and she drew his head down so her mouth could meet his for the third time she kissed him it wasnt a kiss it was a dare she held him tight against her she kissed him like it or not and who was he to argue he should but he couldnt any argument was simply kissed out of him he didnt move he didnt respond her kiss deepened and deepened some more then she was drawing away just a little but still holding his face in her hands coward she teased and kissed him again what was a man to say to that hed been thrown a challenge what was a man to do but kiss back one kiss he promised himself this night and then it was over shed retreat to her life and hed stay with his but meanwhile he kissed her as if hed never let her go he kissed her as hed never kissed a woman before letting go releasing all his pentup longing his aching to be loved his need to be a part of something that wasnt just him she must feel what he was feeling she must know she was the other half of his whole she was the partner hed never hoped to findthe woman he hadnt known existed shanni the kiss went on and on achingly heartbreakingly wonderful he couldnt release her he mustnt shanni coffee the yell was loud enough to wake the dead it was dwayne yelling into the darkness straining to see beyond the pool of light cast by the lanterns on the veranda hey guys come and get coffee and shanni ruby says are you going to drive her home cos if you dont come soon shes sleeping off the champagne here and now and mum says everyone can stay for breakfast if they want but theres not enough eggs and that was that they broke apart rational thought prevailed sort of shanni took a step back and gazed up at him in the moonlight she looked bruised he thought confused frightened yeah frightened he couldnt bear it he put a hand on her cheek lightly a feather touch if he was falling for someone with the encumbrances he had hed be terrified as well hey dont look like that im not asking anything of you no it doesnt mean anything what doesnt kissing he had to say it dwayne was still staring down into the darkness any minute now hed get sick of staring and jump down and make certain it was them its justkissing she whispered of course it is what else could it be you dont want hey i have enough encumbrances he said trying to keep his voice steady im not in the market for more the fear hed seenor had he imagined itfaded it was replaced by bleakness and maybe a little anger i guess im not either she managed youre setting up an art gallery in sydney so i am itd never he paused no it might shanni said urgently pierce it might i dont do relationships no no he said flatly and then again as if it needed accentuating no but youre father to five yeah so isnt that enough he hesitated but it had to be said he might be falling in out of his depth but he was damned if he was dragging her down with him get out of here shanni he said gently while the goings good you mean cut and run yes as youd like to do yes would you really like that to be free again of course there was a moments silence coffee dwayne called again from the veranda sounding unsure hed assumed they were out there but he couldnt hear them i dont shanni said and then she stopped pierce no he said so forcefully that dwayne heard it is you he said from the veranda everyones looking for you mum says do you want her to come back at breakfast time and bring eggs no pierce said again no dwayne sounded confused everyones going home pierce said but his eyes didnt leave shannis everyone dwayne asked olga can stay he said thats magnanimous of you shanni muttered your brothers have come from overseas you sent for them ruby did she said she was worried about you and before we could blink they were in the country she hesitated blakes been magnificent and she took a deep breath nik is cute dont you dare go out with him why not hell break your heart not possible of course mikes already broken it she flinched then you know i thought for a bit that he might have she said but i didnt know the first thing about loving and i sure as heck didnt know the first thing about broken hearts its taken an expert to teach me shanni if you really dont want me then ill go she said and she broke away im coming dwayne she called and your mum doesnt need to worry about eggs theres enough food in the kitchen to feed pierces immediate family and he has no intention of expanding it she left soon after she helped ruby into the car and the two of them headed off with only ruby looking back i hate to leave ruby whispered as the lights from the farm faded from view it seems wrong it did seem wrong shannis face was set ruby glanced at her cautiously and then looked away im sorry dear its not your fault hes a pigheaded independent bottomfeeding maw worm youve got it bad ruby whispered i have shanni agreed and didnt say anything you love him very much ruby murmured after a while more than life itself almost more than i love his kids oh shanni but ill get over it shanni muttered i have to and mum and dad get home tomorrow yay ill get my bedroom back im in extraordinary need of susie belle pierce he was back standing against the post where shanni had sat even clyde had deserted him behind him the house was in silence the partygoers had gone blake and nik were still here as was olga but hed said goodnight and left them hed assumed they were asleep but not blake blake was two years older than pierce and hed taken on the role of eldest sibling theres a beer back here on the veranda he called i dont need a beer yeah you do blake said easily youve hardly had a drink all night youve looked like you were being chased by demons everyone else has had a ball and youve looked like you were being chained and tossed into a dungeon hell i didnt oh you smiled blake said no one who didnt know you well could guess should he say he hadnt guessed himself until ruby had grabbed him on the way to the car talk to your brother hes in love with shanni and he wont admit it shed said talking personal stuff didnt come easy to any of them but for rubys sakeand for pierceshe guessed hed try so blake tugged a couple of ring pulls and they drank beer and stared into the night for a while pierce had turned off all the outside lights and blake hadnt turned them on again there was only the moonlight and silence ruby says youre in love with shanni blake said at last and pierce almost choked on his beer what the hell she says youve got it bad but youre being stubborn what does she know of all the people in the world maybe its ruby who knows us best blake says shes seen us at our worst she took us in and loved us regardless shes great shanni says we have to toss out the stipulations on her apartment she says its cruel shannis right shes quite a girl blake said cautiously mind shes rubys niece so she has a head start nik is really taken with her tell nik to leave her alone tell him yourself little brother and if you dont want her whats the problem she deserves betterthan us whats wrong with nik he scrubs up quite well youve seen him in a suit he earns a fortune some women would describe him as a catch yeah but you know us we dont dothe love bit im seeing you come pretty close blake said cautiously five kids what the hell were you thinking if youd met maureen you wouldnt ask there was no choice no he hesitated i guess there wasnt but after it was a done deal you could have packed them all back to sydney youd get housekeepers there you could have organized a crèche and afterschool care you could have stayed almost as independent as you once were but you stayed here boyo something inside must have seen what these kids needed thats ruby talking yeah it is blake agreed ruefully she said your independence is shot to hell and youre in love with shanni and why dont you ask her to marry you and be done with it because shed say yes hmm blake concentrated on his beer for a moment pierce stared out into the darkness listening to his words echo in his head hed said it the unthinkable you think she might love you back blake asked and pierce thought hes not asking if i love shanni hes assuming it was it that obvious she might pierce said at last shes a soft touch shes a nice kid she feels sorry for me hey i saw her watching you when you carried the kids up to bed blake said im pretty impervious to sentiment but what i saw on her face wasnt pity no pure unadulterated lust mate blake said with satisfaction should be more of it you think shes hot shes besotted soyoure stuck here with five kids one wifes not going to make much difference and it might make both of you happier come on bro its happy families youve got the babies now you need the bride you think id lay that on her he snapped revolted why the hell not because shes generous to a fault she feels desperately sorry for the kids she knows just how they feelshe has rubys sixth sense shes just like ruby she tosses her heart into the ring without thinking of the consequences shes a brilliant art curator to ask her to marry me and be saddled with five kids and their associated baggage she can always refuse she wouldnt she couldnt shes too dammed softhearted so youre going to protect her like we tried to protect ruby blake said yeah like that worked we made ruby miserable it was shanni who made us see surely you could give her the benefit of the doubtthat shes an intelligent woman who knows youre set up with a housekeeper and that youre not asking her to scrub and bake but she would scrub and bake i know shanni then surely she should be allowed to hell blake if you were me would you ask her to marry you im under a huge debt to her as it is i wont be obligated to her any more you think shed be doing you a favour marrying you of course she would ask her and see what her reaction is no you want me to ask her dont be daft no i mean it i could just have dinner with her and run the idea past heras sort of a hypotheticalwould you ever consider marrying a man with five kids and a chip on his shoulder the size of ayers rock no or nik could ask no then ask her yourself no to that too pierce said bleakly what sort of life would i be asking her to share a chaotic one id agree blake said finishing his beer and standing up but surely she has the right of refusal im not asking have it your own way blake said holding out a hand and hauling him to his feet ruby asked me to say all this so my job here is done but the way i see it youre in love with her and if you dont ask her to marry you someone else will someone else is welcome to nik id kill him yeah well shell marry someone blake said if you wont let me intervene talk to ruby no you dont want to marry her of course i do but im not asking she has a life silence the old house seemed to slumber but upstairs on the box seat under the girls bedroom window wendy sat in her nightdress hugging her knees her bedroom window was wide open right over the place where blake and pierce had shared their beer if you dont ask her to marry you someone else will im not asking she hugged her knees some more then she climbed back into bed and tried to close her eyes if you dont ask her to marry you someone else will im not asking the night stretched out before her if you dont ask her to

after six it was two when hed finally got to bed and hed been up once with bessy whod wanted to be entertained bessy was now sleeping with luck shed sleep for a couple more hours its really early guys

abby whispered back i woke up and her bed was made so i went to see the boys i felt her sheets donald said theyre cold dear god the bottom seemed to sink out of his stomach he stared at the surrounding children and saw his reaction mirrored in their eyes wendy the reliable one walking to sydney he dropped the note and reached for his jeans blake nik he erupted from the bedroom bellowing for his brothers behind him bessy stirred into instant wakefulness and started to roar he couldnt pay her heed what were brothers for get the hell up blake nik olga by the time he reached the foot of the stairs hed hauled his windcheater over his head he was groping in the pile of shoes habitually left in the porch as his brothers stuck sleepy heads out of the rooms where theyd been sleeping olga appeared from down the hall wreathed in curlers is it a fire nik demanded then a worse thought struck youre not heading out to milk cows are you cos if you are theres limits to brotherly love im going to find wendy pierce said and he was already heading for the door shes trying to get to sydney hell its impossible look after the kids kids ill be back the minute i find her i promise do you have your

top of the stairs its in the charger ill get it shes out there yeah and if someone finds her and brings her home we need to be able to tell you blake said nik go with him nik was wearing boxer shorts a stunned expression and nothing else im not waiting pierce snapped okay tell nik where to look do we know where she was heading shannis does shanni have a phone did shanni carry a phone hell how would he know shed still be withjules or ruby maybe ill ring ruby and find out blake snapped donald hurtled down the stairs and handed him the phone he tossed it to pierce who took off towards the car as if hed just been handed the olympic baton where will you look blake yelled shell be out on the highway this is a deadend lane if shes out there okay bro go head for the highway towards town nik will double check the lane and well search here and answer your phone when it rings will do pierce yelled bessy needs changing he was gone the drive from the farm into town was one of the longest journeys of pierces life there was no other way to get to sydneywendy would know that shed have to walk into town to reach the highway it would take her hours to get there had she had hours and then what there were buses but she didnt know the timetable she didnt have any money or did she surely she wouldnt have taken he pulled over and rang home check my wallet he demanded where bedside table its full blake reported seconds later a hundred and fifty bucks in notes it hadnt been touched so she was broke pierce drove on feeling desperate the closer to town he got the sicker he felt she couldnt have walked this far she couldnt have called a cabthere were no cabs out here anyway maybe she was hiding but this was open country huge red gums in undulating paddocks clear verges nowhere a child could duck to hide from a passing car by the town boundary he was feeling just about as bad as it was possible to feel and then some his phone rang he stared at it almost afraid to answer he pulled over and picked it up like it was poisonous shes safe blake said and the air in pierces chest whooshed out like hed been hit in the small of the back safe shes at the police station boyo blake said a milk tanker driver saw her with her thumb in the air hitchhiking hes a family man and he had enough sense to take her straight to the cops shes waiting for you there shes safe shanni shanni was sound asleep in rubys spare room she was asleep because shed paced until five am it took more than half a dozen rings before she realized her mobile phone was ringing hi she said still half asleep shanni a deep male voice she didnt recognise yes its constable bob lester here from the craggyburn police you remember you gave me your number a few weeks ago yes she said trying to focus oh great a policeman waking her at dawn to ask her for a date umwhat can i do for you i have someone here whod like to talk to you the policeman said gently here you go wendy shes all yours wendy was sitting in the back of the police station in a lounge the officers used during breaks she was drinking hot chocolate her eyes enormous over her mug the constable opened the door and she cringed pierce thought his heart would break right then and there wendy he whispered and she put her mug very carefully on the table and lifted her chin defiant only it didnt quite work her chin wobbled and sank again she was still a very little girl are you mad at me she whispered and it was enough he was over at the table kicking a chair aside as if it was presumptuous enough to get in his way he was hugging her holding her tight against him burying his face in her lovely short curls damn it he was weeping shes okay the police constable said from behind him and he fought a bit for composure hugged wendy a bit more and then managed to put wendy far enough away from him so he could see her face it was as tear stained aswell as his must be im sorry she whispered theres no need to be sorry we have you safe shed been walking for hours the constable said with a hint of reproof no one uses that road at that hour of night the milk tanker starts at six and he found her on the first run she had her thumb up like a real hitchhiker then when he stopped she ran away hei was wendy tried to make her voice work but failed she was terrified her whole body was shaking this child had learned the hard way that men werent to be trusted he didnt know what to do the policeman said but he thought well he chased her and caught her and brought her here by the time he brought her in he had her calmed down a littleapparently he has a kid in her class at schoolbut she was scared witless hell wendy i wanted to go to shanni i organized that at least the cop said before i rang your place i let her ring shanni pierce was having trouble taking it all in you rang shanni if shed gone to all that trouble and wed stopped her running away the least i could do was let her phone did shanni give you her number pierce asked wendy and wendy shook her head and buried her face in pierces shoulder again it was me the cop said a bit shamefaced he motioned to a bit of art paper lying on the desk shanni gave me her number a couple of weeks back i was going to use it too he muttered but she was so caught up with all those kids im not a family man pierce took wendy home she said little huddled into the passenger seat as if still frightened looking far younger than her years he couldnt figure out the why and she wouldnt say i just had to ask her something she whispered and that was all shed say im sorry wendy if you ever want to ask anyone anythingif you ever want to visit anyonejust ask me i swear ill take you i know but i needed to talk to her by myself even at home she wouldnt talk olga took one look and showed her true coloursborn mum the rest of you leave her alone shes had a nasty shockanyone can see that and look at those feetwalking all that way in sandals even though they are pretty into the bath with you sweetheart and abby you come and sit beside her while i wash her you she turned on pierce you make her a lovely soft egg with toast soldiers well feed it to her in the bath toast soldiers pierce said blankly hey even i know that one nik said grinning they were all grinning hell bro you have a way to go in the parenting stakes wendy soaked in her bath she ate her toast fingers and then olga popped her to sleep on the ancient divan in the corner of the kitchen for you dont want to be alone upstairs she said the rest of you shoo outside while i do some baking abby wendy whispered ill lie down with her abby volunteered and pierce thought his heart would break all over again theres naught for you to do here olga told him the way her words softened on the order telling him she understood a little of what he must be going through go round up some cows or whatever you do with cows hey teach us nik said arent you two going back to wherever you come from pierce demanded hell no blake said were waiting for the next instalment which happened approximately two minutes after theyd cleared the main course of olgas delicious roast lunch and just as she was cutting and serving the apple pie wendy was deeply asleep in the corner bessy was tossing food indiscriminately round her high chair everyone else was at the table shanni walked in she looked like pierce had that morningjeans and windcheaterand she hadnt taken time to brush her hair dazed hi she said there was an awed silence shanni pierce said stupidly shanni abby yelled as if she hadnt seen her for a year shannis here wendy wake up shannis here why are you here pierce asked trying to get his voice to work im here to ask if youll marry me pierce had been spooning creamed apple into bessys mouth his hand had locked spoon halfway to bessys mouth around the table everyone else stayed frozen but they all recovered before pierce did goody i want to be flower girl abby said in a voice of profound satisfaction donald youre not allowed to take all the cream cool said nik shifting along the bench seat to make room you want some lunch i bet you havent eaten olga rose and moved ponderously to the stove she was still in her curlers and an amazing oriental housecoat purple and black shimmering silk with deep pink tassles theres still some roast or do you want to move straight to apple pie let the boy answer first blake said and they fell silent again i dont he stared at shanni i dont understand wendy said you want to marry me shanni said she hadnt moved into the room she was standing in the doorway looking only at pierce in the corner wendy was waking she didnt move curled into a warm little ball under the feather eiderdown olga had spread over her but her eyes were suddenly wary wendy says the only reason you wont ask me to marry you is that you dont think i want the children shanni said but wendy says shed look after the kids shes offered for them all to go into a care homebut please will we visit there was an almost audible gasp all eyes moved to wendy itsits true wendy whispered from the sidelines the child welfare officers say theres houses for families as big as ours we get care workers and i thoughtmaybe we could come here at weekends sometimes how about you stay here shanni said suddenly sounding fierce and blinking a bit how about if i just move in and we keep on like it is now me and pierce and olga and wendy and donald and bryce and abby and bessy and anyone else we can think of you cant pierce managed why cant i your career stuff my career she retorted but then she grinned but in case you hadnt noticed this is a tourist district its very very trendy to come for a sunday drive and visit art galleries there are gallery owners in paddington or the rocks in sydney who are moving to the country because they get more clientele that way its not so much of a tourist district nik said thoughtful it will be shanni said and tilted her chin when people hear about the fantastic art gallery im going to open dolphin bay would be better blake said sorry distracted from pierce shanni looked to his brothers itd be better at dolphin bay blake said its screaming for a bit of culture moneys not a problem nor is commuting for pierce theres a train and he mostly works from home anyway but youd get many more tourists in dolphin bay you could buy a big home there and open the worlds best gallery while pierce keeps on with his architecture and you could use this place for holidays sorry hey it could be more than that nik was putting in his oar again i was talking to hamish at the opening of loganaich castle and ruby they had this vision of there being a network of places that could be used for disadvantaged kids or more for families in crisis single mothers who are having a dreadful time we could set this farm up to do the same thing us guys the seven of rubys boys we could put in enough to make it work we could call it rubys farm shed love it what the hell pierce was having trouble getting a word in edgeways well do it nik said enthusiastically well get you out of here and then well change a few things we might have to shift clyde further from the house and put in a few more kidfriendly animals ponies a couple of nice cats and a fat old dog and get some lovely kidfriendly housekeeper and a couple of kidfriendly helpers i could be that olga said breathlessly but then she looked at pierce but no i want to stay with you in dolphin bay i have a friend maybeline and she could come here she had a farm before her husband took off with another woman and made them both bankrupt she loves kids and ruby wants to move to dolphin bay blake added she told me apparently theres a really good macramé club there so all you need to do is find a big house there and youre home and hosed i think ruby should have her own home though nik said a cottage near your house though blake added excuse me pierce said and stood up dont you want to marry shanni abby said in a small voice and everybody hushed shanni looked at him he looked at shanni yes he said and the collective breath was let out in a collective sigh but i need to ask her he said no need blake said jobs done olga can you pass the pie down here please pierce was in the middle of the table olga handed him the pie he handed it on to blake without thinking shanni was looking confused the rest of them had moved on distracted by what looked a truly excellent pie it was a great pie leave some for us or youre dead meat pierce growled if youre going to propose then hurry up and do it olga urged blake that slice is too big nine equal portions you cut and the rest of us choose he took her out to clydes paddock the big bull was on the far side looking longingly at the cows beyond his boundary here at last was privacy pierce had shanni by the hand he marched shanni out to the gate and stopped you seemangry shanni said tentatively and he turned and faced her exasperated more like why i like a bit of control me too she said so we have something in common something more than love for five kids you love the kids of course i do she said whats not to love do you know how many times i get to sleep right through the night sleepings boring do you know what youre letting yourself in for itd be okay she whispered if if what if you loved me the world stilled what makes you think i dont love you he said at last youve never said i dont know how how to love no its easy she said and it was her turn to sound exasperated she linked her arms around his neck she stood on tiptoe she kissed him ever so lightly on the lips and then pulled away a little before he could respond this is how she whispered pierce maclachlan i love you i love you from the tip of my toes to the top of my head i love you more than i ever thought i could love anyone i love you even more than i love susie belle susie belle you havent met her you will shes about to make our wendy very happy our wendy she is our wendy she whispered our gorgeous little girl the bravest kid i love her so much how much love have you got he demanded and she chuckled it just keeps on oozing out i blame the ice water it was sort of a cathartic experience it released the inner me shanni yes my love she was still on tiptoes still within kissing distance still holding him i dont know about the love thing you dont think you can love me it seems i can he said sounding dazed it seems i do but i didnt think i could do it im still not sure okay heres a test she said kissing him again im moving in here anyway i love these kids to bits rubys met them for one night and she loves them so does olga youve just reclaimed a whole lot of money for meso i can rent a great big house at dolphin bay have an art gallery at the side and olga and ruby and i can take these kids off your hands and love them for ever we can be one huge family and you can slope off back to your independent life in sydney being the worlds best architect i im serious pierce she said and she sounded serious the laughter had gone from her voice wendy told me you wouldnt ask me to marry you because you thought id hate being tied to the kids is that true for you for im making you an offer and i mean it you can go back to your old life and well live happily ever after without you she took his breath away what she was offering was so immense that he felt dizzy his old life back independence wendy donald bryce abby bessy shanni ruby and olga living in a glorious muddle of happyeverafter in dolphin bay without him the choice was a nobrainer the thought of being without them was suddenly so bleak he couldnt bear it no no then the next alternative is the same thing only without me in the equation she said if you really dont want me then i can visit no i cant visit no i dont not want you im having a little bit of trouble here she said but suddenly it was crystal clear a man had to do what a man had to do shed done the proposing shed thrown her heart into the ring shed told him she loved him the abyss shed put before himlife without any of themmade him see what he hadnt been able to see until now he was deeply madly wildly in love with each and every one of them even olgas curlers but most of all he dropped to one knee shanni ooh she said he took her hands in his shanni i love you really she looked pleased if you make any wisecracks im stopping im not making any wisecracks though theres a cow pat right to your left shut up yes dear i love you and i want you to marry me he said and suddenly the laughter was behind them she was still smiling but her eyes were misting with tears pierce are you sure ive never been so certain of anything in my life i love you so much i cant bear to think of you giving up anything i want you to have the perfect life and here im saddling you with all of us if you werent attached you wouldnt be half as sexy really well no she admitted theres jam on your collar shanni yes will you marry me she gazed down at him for a long minute she smiled and smiled and smiled then she dropped to her knees to join him she tugged him into her arms and she held him the world shifted for pierce the world had been hauled out of kilter somewhere about the time hed been born ruby had tried her best to right it but it had taken this woman this glorious redheaded wood sprite to finally teach him how the world should be his shanni his miracle his miracle bride and it seemed she was of course ill marry you she whispered of course i will oh my love my pierce welcome home it was a honeymoon haven no person under the age of eighteen may visit paradise the brochure had said visitors to this island can be assured of a tranquil tropical idyll without the intrusion of children and their associated noise pristine beaches magnificent rainforest luxurious chalets and most of allprivacy shanni and pierce had been there for three days their honeymoon three days of married bliss with not a child in sight for much as i love our kids ill be damned if im taking them on my honeymoon pierce had decreed and hed been masterly in his ultimatum taking charge a man whod had to do what a man had to do and by the time her parents ruby olga and susie had had their way with their dolphin bay weddingtwo flower girls two page boys six groomsmen one gorgeous beaming seventyyearold matron of honour and so many friends and relations that even shanni had felt overwhelmedshed meekly agreed they lay now in a sheltered cove their own idyllic place no more than six couples at a time came to paradise and there were beaches to spare shanni lay in pierces arms the sun was shining softly on her face she was sated with love and with happiness anchors ahoy look lively avast ye swabs the peace of their morning was shattered they looked up and saw a huge inflatable dinghy being paddled their way two men on paddles four kids within blake and nik and wendy and bryce and donald and abby pierce scrambled to his feet tugging a dazed shanni with him they were coated in sand theyd been tumbling in the shallows theyd been well some things were best left unexplained suffice to say shanni was blushing as pierce tugged her down to the waters edge to meet the incoming dinghy you havent rowed all the way from the mainland have you pierce demanded as the dinghy beached and the kids tumbled out whooping splashing surrounding them with laughter we hired a yacht nik said proudly ruby and olga and bessy are still on board rubys the captain wendy said and giggled but sams helping sam another brother youre not allowed here pierce said trying to sound stern and failing we know that wendy said we rowed into two beaches before we found you and the people told us but were just checking to make sure you arent missing us too much abby explained are you yes shanni said laughing so much she felt like crying she swept abby into her arms and hugged her you want to come home with us bryce asked no pierce said and his brothers grinned hey bro you really telling us your family that you dont want us nik sounded wounded for two weeks i dont want you pierce growled then ive got you for the rest of our lives you can have another honeymoon abby said when you really really need one are you sure youre not sick of this one wendy said it looks lonely to me its not so lonely as youd notice pierce said and then as her face fell he grinned and lifted her with the same ease shanni had lifted abby youre having fun on your holiday were having fun on ours weve got lunch abby said sandwiches do you want to have lunch with us yes shanni said and giggled you can start your honeymoon again after lunch nik said grinning at her dont grin at my wife pierce said he can grin all he likes at me shanni declared hes family uncle nik where are the sandwiches youll be arrested pierce said then well all be locked up together shanni retorted put wendy down and grabbed pierces hand which is as it should be this is perfect little bits of honeymoon interspersed with little bits of family lots of family pierce said you love it and you know it she said serenely little bits of honeymoon interspersed with lots and lots of family for the rest of our lives marion lennox
