circumstances you cant lose what you lacked at conception massmarket nostalgia gets you hopped up for a past that never existed hagiography sanctifies shuckandjive politicians and reinvents their

clinton minus pervasive media scrutiny and a few rolls of flab jack got whacked at the optimum moment to assure his sainthood lies continue to swirl around his eternal flame its time to dislodge his urn and cast light on a few men who attended his ascent and facilitated his fall they were rogue cops and shakedown artists they were wiretappers and soldiers of fortune and faggot lounge entertainers had one second of their lives deviated off course american history would not exist as we know it its time to demythologize an era and build a new myth from the gutter to the stars its time to embrace

his sink newspaper mockups topped by banner headlines car thief suffers heart attack in federal custodycar thief expires in federal building cell the text was typed out below this afternoon philadelphia police enacted a daring arrest in the shadow of picturesque rittenhouse square acting on information supplied by an unnamed informant sergeant gerald p griffen and four other officers captured robert henry aiken in the act of stealing an expensive jaguar automobile aiken meekly let the officers restrain him and someone coughed and said sir kemper looked up a clerk type unlocked the cell and held the door open for him you can go out the back way sir theres a car waiting for you kemper brushed off his clothes and combed his hair he walked out the freight exit and saw a government limo blocking the alley his limo kemper got in the back j edgar hoover said hello mr boyd good afternoon sir a partition slid up and closed the backseat off the driver pulled out hoover coughed your infiltration assignment was terminated rather precipitously the philadelphia police were somewhat rough but they have a reputation for that and anything less would have lacked verisimilitude ive learned to stay in character in situations like that im sure the arrest was believable did you affect an east coast accent for your role no a midwestern drawl i learned the accent and speech patterns when i worked the st louis office and i thought theyd complement my physical appearance more effectively youre correct of course and personally i would not want to secondguess you on anything pertaining to criminal roleplaying that sports jacket youre wearing for instance i would not appreciate it as standard bureau attire but its quite appropriate for a philadelphia car thief get to it you officious little in fact youve always dressed distinctly perhaps expensively is more apt to be blunt there have been times when i wondered how your salary could sustain your wardrobe sir you should see my apartment what my wardrobe possesses it lacks hoover chuckled be that as it may i doubt if ive seen you in the same suit twice im sure the women youre so fond of appreciate your sartorial flair sir i hope so you endure my amenities with considerable flair mr boyd most men squirm you express both your inimitable personal panache and a concurrent respect for me that is quite alluring do you know what this means no sir i dont it means that i like you and am prone to forgive indiscretions that i would crucify other agents for youre a dangerous and ruthless man but you possess a certain beguiling charm this balance of attributes outweighs your profligate tendencies and allows me to be fond of you dont say what indiscretionshell tell you and maim you sir i greatly appreciate your respect and i reciprocate it fully you didnt include fondness in your reciprocity but i wont press the point now business i have an opportunity for you to earn two regular paychecks which should delight you no end hoover leaned back coaxme style kemper said sir the limo accelerated hoover flexed his hands and straightened his necktie the kennedy brothers recent actions have distressed me bobby seems to be using the mcclellan committees labor racketeering mandate as a means to upstage the bureau and advance his brothers presidential aspirations this displeases me ive been running the bureau since before bobby was born jack kennedy is a desiccated liberal playboy with the moral convictions of a crotchsniffing hound dog hes playing crimefighter on the mcclellan committee and the very existence of the committee is an implicit slap in the bureaus face old joe kennedy is determined to buy his son the white house and i want to possess information to help mitigate the boys more degenerately egalitarian policies should he succeed kemper caught his cue sir i want you to infiltrate the kennedy organization the mcclellan committees laborracketeering mandate ends next spring but bobby kennedy is still hiring lawyerinvestigators as of now you are retired from the fbi although you will continue to draw full pay until july the date you reach twenty years of bureau service you are to prepare a convincing fbi retirement story and secure an attorneys job with the mcclellan committee i know that both you and jack kennedy have been intimate with a senate aide named sally lefferts miss lefferts is a talkative woman so im sure young jack has heard about you young jack is on the mcclellan committee and young jack loves sexual gossip and dangerous friends mr boyd i am sure that you will fit in with the kennedys im sure that this will be both a salutary opportunity for you to practice your skills of dissembling and duplicity and the chance to exercise your more promiscuous tastes kemper felt weightless the limo cruised on thin air hoover said your reaction delights me rest now well arrive in washington in an hour and ill drop you at your apartment o o o hoover supplied uptodate study notesin a leather binder stamped confidential kemper mixed a pitcher of extradry martinis and pulled up his favorite chair to read through them the notes boiled down to one thing bobby kennedy vs jimmy hoffa senator john mcclellan chaired the us senates select committee on improper activities in the labor and management field established in january its subsidiary members senators ives kennedy mcnamara mccarthy ervin mundt goldwater its chief counsel and investigative boss robert f kennedy current personnel thirtyfive investigators fortyfive accountants twentyfive stenographers and clerks its current housing the senate office building suite the committees stated goals to expose corrupt labor practices to expose labor unions collusively linked to organized crime the committees methods witness subpoenas document subpoenas and the charting of union funds diverted and misused in organized crime activities the committees de facto target the international brotherhood of teamsters the most powerful transportation union on earth arguably the most corrupt and powerful labor union ever its president james riddle hoffa age hoffa mob

hole rumored to be administered by sam giancanas chicago moba loanshark scheme wherein gangsters and crooked entrepreneurs borrow large sums at usurious interest rates with nonpayment penalties up to and including torture and death kemper caught the gist hoovers jealous he always said the mob didnt existbecause he knew he couldnt prosecute it successfully now bobby kennedy begs to differ a chronology followed early the committee targets teamster president dave beck beck testifies five times bobby kennedys relentless goading breaks the man a seattle grand jury indicts him for larceny and

occasionally dear heart since you gave me the gate is this about trading little black books and evil tales out of school or im thinking of applying for a job with the mcclellan committee sally whooped well i think you should i think i should put a note on robert kennedys desk recommending you and you should send me a dozen longstemmed southern beauty roses for the effort youre the southern beauty sally i was too much woman for de ridder louisiana and that is a fact kemper hung up with kisses sally would spread the word exfbi car thief now seeking work hed tell bobby how he crashed the corvette theft ring he wouldnt mention the vettes he stripped for parts o o o he moved the next day he walked right in to the senate office building and suite the receptionist heard him out and tapped her intercom mr kennedy theres a man here who wants to apply for an investigators position he has fbi retirement credentials the office spread out unpartitioned behind herall cabinet rows cubicles and conference rooms men worked elbowtoelbow tightthe place hummed the woman smiled mr kennedy will see you take this first little aisle straight back kemper walked into the hum the office had a scavenged look mismatched desks and filing bins and corkboards topheavy with paper mr boyd robert kennedy stepped out of his cubicle it was the standard size the standard desk and two chairs he offered the standard toohard handshaketotally predictable kemper sat down kennedy pointed to his holster bulge i didnt know that retired fbi men were allowed to carry guns ive incurred enemies through the years my retirement wont stop them from hating me senate investigators dont wear sidearms if you hire me ill put mine in a drawer kennedy smiled and leaned against his desk youre from the south nashville tennessee sally lefferts said you were with the fbi for what fifteen years seventeen why did you retire early i worked autotheft infiltration assignments for the past nine years and it had gotten to the point where i was too well known to car thieves to go undercover convincingly the bureau bylaws contain an earlyretirement clause for agents who have engaged in prolonged stints of hazardous duty and i utilized it utilized did those assignments debilitate you in some way i applied for a position with the top hoodlum program first mr hoover rejected my application personally although he knew full well that i had desired organized crime work for some time no i wasnt debilitated i was frustrated kennedy brushed hair from his forehead so you quit is that an accusation no its an observation and frankly im surprised the fbi is a tightknit organization that inspires great loyalty and agents do not tend to retire out of pique kemper raised his voicejust barely a great many agents realize that organized crime not domestic communism poses the greatest threat to america the apalachin revelations forced mr hoover to form the top hoodlum program which of course he did with some reluctance the program is accruing antimob intelligence but not seeking hard evidence to build toward federal prosecution but at least thats something and i wanted to be part of it kennedy smiled i understand your frustration and i agree with your critique of mr hoovers priorities but im still surpnsed that you quit kemper smiled before i quit i snuck a look at mr hoovers private file on the mcclellan committee im uptodate on the committees work up to and including sun valley and your missing witness anton gretzler i quit because mr hoover has the bureau neurotically focused on harmless leftists while the mcclellan committee is going after the real bad guys i quit because given my choice of monomaniacs id rather work for you kennedy grinned our mandate ends in five months youll be out of work i have an fbi pension and youll have forwarded so much evidence to municipal grand juries that theyll be begging your investigators to work for them ad hoc kennedy tapped a stack of papers we work hard here we plod we subpoena and trace money and litigate we dont risk our lives stealing sports cars or dawdle over lunch or take women to the willard hotel for quickies our idea of a good time is to talk about how much we hate jimmy hoffa and the mob kemper stood up i hate hoffa and the mob like mr hoover hates you and your brother bobby laughed ill let you know within a few days o o o kemper strolled by sally lefferts office it was sally might be up for a quickie at the willard her door was open sally was at her desk fretting tissueswith a man straddling a chair up close to her she said oh hello kemper her color was up rosy verging on flushed she had that toobright ivelostatloveagain glow on are you busy i can come back the man swiveled his chair around kemper said hello senator john kennedy smiled sally dabbed at her eyes jack this is my friend kemper boyd they shook hands kennedy did a little halfbow mr boyd a pleasure my pleasure entirely sir sally forced a smile her rouge was streakedshed been crying kemper how did your interview go it went well i think sally i have to go i just wanted to thank you for the referral little nods went around nobodys eyes met kennedy handed sally a fresh tissue kemper walked downstairs and outside a storm had fired uphe ducked under a statue ledge and let the rain graze him the kennedy coincidence felt strange he walked straight from an interview with bobby into a chance meeting with jack it felt like he was gently pushed in that direction kemper thought it through mr hoover mentioned sallyas his most specific link to jack kennedy mr hoover knew that he and jack shared a fondness for women mr hoover sensed that hed visit sally after his interview with bobby mr hoover sensed that hed call sally for an interview referral immediately mr hoover knew that bobby needed investigators and interviewed walkin prospects at whim kemper took the logical leap mr hoover has capitol hill hotwired he knew that you broke up with sally at her officeto forestall a big public scene he picked up a tip that jack kennedy was planning the same thing and took a stab at maneuvering you into a position to witness it it felt logically sound it felt quintessentially hoover mr hoover doesnt entirely trust you to forge a bond with bobby he took a shot at placing you in a symbiotic context with jack the rain felt good lightning crackled down and backlit the capitol dome it felt like he could stand here and let the whole world come to him kemper heard foot scrapes behind him he knew who it was instantly mr boyd he turned around john kennedy was cinching up his overcoat senator call me jack all right jack kennedy shivered why the hell are we standing here we can run for the mayflower bar when this lets up a bit we can and i think we should you know sallys told me about you she told me i should work on losing my accent the way you lost yours so i was surprised to hear you speak kemper dropped his drawl southerners make the best cops you lay on the cornpone and people tend to underestimate you and let their secrets slip i thought your brother might know that so i acted accordingly youre on the mcclellan committee so i figured i should go for uniformity kennedy laughed your secrets safe with me thanks and dont worry about sally she likes men the way we like women and she gets over the attendant heartaches pretty fast i knew you figured it out sally told me you cut her off in a similar fashion kemper smiled you can always go back occasionally sally appreciates an occasional afternoon at a good hotel ill remember that a man with my aspirations has to be conscious of his entanglements kemper stepped closer to jack he could almost see mr hoover grinning i know a fair number of women who know how to keep things unentangled kennedy smiled and steered him into the rain lets go get a drink and talk about it ive got an hour to kill before i meet my wife w a r d j l i t t e l l chicago black bag worka classic fbi

inspired subservience littell said i figured something out in the process right between the chocolate and the glazed what that mr hoover hates leftwingers because their philosophy is based on human frailty while his own is based on an excruciating rectitude that denies such things boyd held his glass up you never disappoint me kemper waiters swooped past candlelight bounced off gold flatware crкpe suzettes ignitedan old woman squealed kemper mr hoover had me infiltrate the mcclellan committee he hates bobby kennedy and his brother jack and hes afraid their father will buy jack the white house in im now a fake fbi retiree on an indefinite assignment to cozy up to both brothers i applied for a job as a temporary committee investigator and i got the word today that bobby hired me im flying to miami in a few hours to look for a missing witness littell said jesus fucking christ boyd said you never disappoint me i suppose youre drawing two salaries you know i love money yes but do you like the brothers yes i do bobbys a vindictive little bulldog and jacks charming and not as smart as he thinks he is bobbys the stronger man and he hates organized crime like you do littell shook his head you dont hate anything i cant afford to ive never understood your loyalties lets just say theyre ambiguous document insert official fbi telephone call transcript recorded at the directors request classified confidential a directors eyes only speaking director hoover special agent kemper boyd jeh mr boyd kb sir good morning jeh yes it is a good morning are you calling from a secure phone kb yes im at a coin phone if the oonnection seems weak its because im calling from miami jeh little brother has put you to work already kb little brother doesnt waste time jeh interpret your rapid hiring use names if you must kb little brother was initially suspicious of me and i think it will take time to win him over i ran into big brother at sally lefferts office and circumstances forced us into a private conversation we went out for a drink and developed a rapport like many charming men big brother is also easily charmed we hit it off quite well and im certain he told little brother to hire me jeh describe the circumstances you mentioned kb we discovered that we shared an interest in sophisticated and provocative women and we went to the mayflower bar to discuss related matters big brother confirmed that he is going to run in and that little brother will begin the campaign groundwork when the mcclellan committee mandate ends this coming april jeh continue kb big brother and i discussed politics i portrayed myself as incongruously liberal by bureau standards which big brother jeh you have no political convictions which adds to your efficacy in situations like this continue kb big brother found my feigned political convictions interesting and opened up he said that he considers little brothers hatred of mr h somewhat untoward although justified both big brother and their father have urged little brother to strategically retreat and offer mr h a deal if he cleans up his organization but little brother has refused my personal opinion is that mr h is legally inviolate at this time big brother shares that opinion as do a number of committee investigators sir i think little brother is ferociously dedicated and competent my feeling is that he will take mr h down but not in the foreseeable future i think it will take years and most likely many indictments and that it certainly wont happen within the committee mandate time frame jeh youre saying the committee will hand the ball to municipal grand juries once their mandate expires kb yes i think it will take years for the brothers to reap real political benefit from mr h and i think a backlash might set in and hurt big brother democratic candidates cant afford to be viewed as antiunion jeh your assessments seem quite astute kb thank you sir jeh did big brother bring my name up kb yes he knows about your extensive files on politicians and movie stars you deem subversive and hes afraid you have a file on him i told him your file on his family ran to a thousand pages jeh good you would have lost credibility had you been less candid what else did you and big brother discuss kb chiefly women big brother mentioned a trip to los angeles on december th i gave him the phone number of a promiscuous woman named darleen shoftel and urged him to call her jeh do you think he has called her kb no sir but i think he will jeh describe your duties for the committee thus far kb ive been looking for a subpoenaed witness named anton gretzler here in florida little brother wanted me to serve him a backup summons theres an aspect of this we should discuss since gretzlers disappearance may tie in to a friend of yours jeh continue kb gretzler was mr hs partner in the alleged sun valley land fraud he jeh you said was youre assuming gretzler is dead kb im certain hes dead jeh continue kb he disappeared on the afternoon of november th he told his secretary he was going to meet a sales prospect at sun valley and never returned the lake weir police found his car in a swamp marsh nearby but they havent been able to locate a body they canvassed for witnesses and turned up a man who was driving by sun valley on the interstate at the same time the sales prospect was to meet gretzler the man said he saw a man parked on the sun valley access road he said the man averted his face when he drove by so its doubtful he could identify him he did describe him however six foot four or five huge two hundred and forty pounds dark hair thirtyfive to forty im thinking it jeh your old friend peter bondurant hes singularly outsized and hes on that list of mr hs known associates that i gave you kb yes sir i checked airline and car rental records in los angeles and miami and turned up a hughes aircraft charge that im certain bondurant made i know he was in florida on november th and im circumstantially certain that mr h hired him to kill gretzler i know that you and howard hughes are friends so i thought id inform you of this before i told little brother jeh do not inform little brother under any circumstances the status of your investigation should remain thus gretzler is missing perhaps dead there are no leads and no suspects pete bondurant is invaluable to howard hughes who is a valuable friend of the bureau mr hughes recently purchased a scandal magazine to help disseminate political information favorable to the bureau and i do not want his feathers ruffled do you understand kb yes sir jeh i want you to fly to los angeles on a bureau charge and tweak pete bondurant with your suspicions get a favor from him and cloak your friendly overtures with the knowledge that you can hurt him and when your committee duties permit go back to florida and clean up potential loose ends on the gretzler front kb ill wrap up here and fly to la late tomorrow jeh good and while youre in los angeles i want you to bug and wire miss darleen shoftels home if big brother contacts her i want to know kb she wont voluntarily assent so ill have to rig her apartment sub rosa can i bring in ward littell hes a great wire man jeh yes bring him in this reminds me that littell has been coveting a top hoodlum squad spot for some time do you think hed like a transfer as a reward for this job kb hed love it jeh good but let me be the one to inform him goodbye mr boyd i commend you for work well done kb thank you sir goodbye beverly hills howard hughes cranked his bed up

you been doing when i left you were two sheets to the wind littell laughed ive been reading the thp file and so far im not too impressed with mr hoovers antimob mandate watch your mouth he might have bugged your room thats a cruel thought yes if not farfetched ward look its still snowing and youll never be able to fly out today why dont you meet me at the committee office bobby and i are grilling a witness hes a chicago man and you might learn something i could use some air youre at the old senate office building right suite ill be in interview room a its got an observation corridor so youll be able to watch and remember my cover im retired from the fbi youre a glib dissembler kemper its rather sad dont get lost in the snow o o o the setup was perfect a closed hallway with oneway glass access and wallmounted speakers partitioned off in cubicle a the kennedy brothers kemper and a blond man cubicles b c and d were vacant he had the watching gallery to himselfthe snowstorm must have scared people home littell hit the speaker switch voices crackled out with minimum static the men sat around a desk robert kennedy played host and worked the tape recorder take your time mr kirpaski youre a voluntary witness and were here at your disposal the blond man said call me roland nobody calls me mr kirpaski kemper grinned any man who rolls over on jimmy hoffa deserves that formality brilliant kemperreviving his tennessee drawl roland kirpaski said thats nice i guess but you know jimmy hoffas jimmy hoffa what i mean is its like they say about the elephant he dont forget robert kennedy laced his hands behind his head hoffa will have plenty of time in prison to remember everything that put him there kirpaski coughed id like to say something and id uh like to read it off when i testify in front of the committee kemper said go ahead kirpaski leaned his chair back im a union guy im a teamster now i told you all them stories about jimmy doing this and doing that you know telling his guys to lean on these other guys that wouldnt play ball and so forth i guess maybe all that stuff is illegal but you know what that dont bother me so much the only reason im socalled rolling over on jimmy is because i can add up two and two and get four and i heard enough at fucking chicago local to figure out that jimmy fucking hoffa is cutting side deals with management which means that he is a scab piece of shit pardon my french and i want to go on the record as saying that that is my motive for ratting him off john kennedy laughed littell flashed on the shoftel job and winced robert kennedy said duly noted roland youll be able to read any statement you like before you testify and remember were saving your testimony for a televised session millions of people will see you kemper said the more publicity you get the more unlikely it is that hoffa will attempt reprisals kirpaski said jimmy dont forget hes like an elephant that way you know those gangster pictures you showed me those guys i saw jimmy with robert kennedy held up some photos santo trafficante jr and carlos marcello kirpaski nodded right i also want to go on the record as saying that ive heard good things about those guys i heard they hire union men exclusively no mafia guy ever said roland youre a dumb southside polack to me like i said they visited jimmy at his suite at the drake and all they talked about was the weather the cubs and politics in cuba i want to go on the record as saying i got no gripe against the fucking mafia kemper winked at the oneway neither does j edgar hoover littell laughed kirpaski said what robert kennedy drummed the table mr boyd is performing for some unseen colleague of his now roland lets get back to miami and sun valley kirpaski said id like to jesus this snow kemper stood up and stretched his legs walk us through your observations again kirpaski sighed i was a chicago delegate to the convention last year we stayed at the deauville in miami i was still friendly with jimmy then because i hadnt figured out he was a scab cocksucker cutting side deals with robert kennedy cut in stick to the point please the point is i ran some errands for jimmy i went by the tiger kab stand which is spelled with a goddamn k and picked up some cash so jimmy could take some guys from the miami locals out on a boat to shoot sharks with tommy guns which is one of jimmys favorite florida things to do i must have picked up three grand easy the cabstand was like the planet mars all these crazy cuban guys wearing tigercolored shirts the boss cuban was this guy fulo he was selling these hot tvs out of the parking lot the tiger kab business is strictly cashoperated if you want my considered opinion its a tax evasion bounce looking to happen static rattled the speakerlittell tapped the squelch button and smoothed the volume out john kennedy looked bored and restless robert kennedy doodled on a notepad tell us about anton gretzler again kirpaski said we all went out shark shooting gretzler came along him and jimmy were talking by themselves over on one end of the boat away from the shark shooters i was down in the can being seasick i guess they thought they had privacy because they were talking up this nottoolegalsounding stuff which i want to go on the record as stating was no skin off my ass because it didnt involve collusion with management john kennedy tapped his watch kemper prompted kirpaski what exactly did they discuss sun valley gretzler said he had land surveys done and his surveyor said the land wouldnt fall into the swamp for five years or so which would let them off the hook legally speaking jimmy said he could tap the pension fund for three million dollars to purchase the land and prefab material and maybe they could pocket some cash up front robert kennedy jumped up his chair crashedthe oneway glass shimmied that is very strong testimony that is a virtual admission of conspiracy to commit land fraud and intent to defraud the pension fund kemper picked the chair up its only courtroom valid if gretzler corroborates it or perjures himself denying it without gretzler its rolands word versus hoffas it comes down to credibility and roland has two drunkdriving convictions while hoffas record is technically clean bobby fumed kemper said bob gretzler has to be dead his car was dumped in a swamp and the man himself cant be found ive put a lot of hours in trying to find him and i havent turned up one viable lead he could have faked his own death to avoid appearing before the committee i think thats unlikely bobby straddled his chair and gripped down on the slats you may be right but i may still send you down to florida to make sure kirpaski said im hungry jack rolled his eyes kemper winked at him kirpaski sighed i said im hungry kemper checked his watch wrap it up for the senator roland tell us how gretzler got drunk and shot his mouth off i get the picture sing for your supper bobby said goddamnit all right all right it was after the shark shoot gretzler was pissed because jimmy ridiculed him for holding his tommy gun like a sissy grander started talking up these rumors hed heard about the pension fund he said he heard the fund is a lot fucking richer than people knew and nobody could subpoena the books because the books werent real see gretzler said there were these real teamster fund books probably in code with fucking tens of millions of dollars accounted for in them this money gets loaned out at these exorbitant rates theres supposed to be some retired chicago gangstera real brainwhos the bookkeeper for the real books and the real money and if youre thinking about corroboration forget itim the only one gretzler was talking to bobby kennedy pushed his hair back his voice went high like an excited childs its our big wedge jack first we subpoena the front books again and determine their solvency we trace the loanedout money the teamsters admit to and try to determine the existence of hidden assets within the fund and the probability that those real books exist littell pressed up to the glass he felt magnetized touslehaired passionate bobby jack kennedy coughed its strong stuff if you can produce verifiable testimony on those books before the committees mandate ends kirpaski applauded hey he speaks hey senator glad you could join us jack kennedy cringed mockwounded bobby said my investigators will be forwarding our evidence along to other agencies whatever we dig up will be acted on jack said eventually littell translated too late to bolster my career the brothers locked eyes kemper leaned across the table between them hoffas got a block of houses set up at sun valley hes down there himself giving pr tours rolands going down to look around he runs a chicago local so it wont look suspicious hell be calling in to report what he sees kirpaski said yeah and im also gonna see this cocktail waitress i met when i went down for the convention but you know what im not gonna tell my wife shes on the menu jack motioned kemper in close littell caught staticlaced whispers im flying to la when this snow lets upcall darleen shoftelim sure shed love to meet you kirpaski said im hungry robert kennedy packed his briefcase come on roland you can join the family for supper at my house try not to say fuck around my children though theyll learn

killed anton gretzler ward did not know that mr hoover condoned the murder bondurant terrified warda sane response to big pete and the legend he inspired the bondurant matter should be kept from ward

his wallet his id holder popped out and landed on the bar badgeup he grabbed it and threw some change down the barman said dont we want our beer o o o littell drove to the office and typed up a tail report he chewed a roll of clorets to kill his liquor breath he omitted mention of his beverage intake and his blunder at hernandos hideaway he stressed the basic gist that lenny sands might have a secret homosexual life this might prove to be a recruitment wedge he was obviously hiding that life from his mob associates lenny never noticed him so far his tail stood uncompromised court meade

phone calls with dates and everything like that roland said he stole the phone bills of some of mr hoffas friends because mr hoffa was afraid to call long distance from his hotel because he thought his phone might be tapped mrs kirpaski she grabbed a binder off the breakfast table roland would be so mad if i didnt show it to the authorities littell opened the binder page listed names and phone numbers neatly arranged in columns mary kirpaski crowded up to him roland called up the phone companies in all the different cities and found out who the numbers belonged to i think he impersonated policemen or something like that littell flipped pages front to back roland kirpaski printed legibly and neatly several calls received names were familiar sam giancana carlos marcello anthony iannone santo trafficante jr one name was familiar and scary peter bondurant mapleton drive los angeles hoffa called big pete three times recently bondurant snapped manacles barehanded he allegedly killed people for ten thousand dollars and plane fare mary kirpaski was fondling rosary beads she smelled like vicks vaporub and cigarettes maam could i use the phone she pointed to a wall extension littell pulled the cord to the far end of the kitchen she left him alone littell heard a radio snap on one room over he dialed the longdistance operator she put him through to the security desk at la

he rechecked the phone call list his instinct held firm pete bondurant killed roland kirpaski kemper mentioned a dead witness named gretzler if he could connect the man to bondurant two murder charges might fly littell sipped rye and beer he kept checking the back wall mirror to gauge his appearance his work clothes looked wrong his glasses and thinning hair didnt jibe with them the rye burned the beer tickled two men walked up to his table and grabbed him they jerked him upright they clamped down on his elbows they steered him back to an enclosed phone bank it was swift and sureno civilian patrons caught it the men pinned his arms back chick leahy stepped out of a shadow and got right up in his face littell felt his knees go the men propped him up on his toes leahy said your message to kemper boyd was intercepted you could have violated his cover on the incursion mr hoover does not want to see robert kennedy aided and peter bondurant is a valued colleague of howard hughes who is a great friend of mr hoover and the bureau do you know what fully coded messages are mr littell littell blinked his glasses fell off everything went blurry leahy jabbed his chest hard youre off the thp and back on the red squad as of now and i strongly urge you not to protest one man grabbed his notebook the other man said you reek of liquor they elbowed him aside and walked out the whole thing took thirty seconds his arms hurt his glasses were scratched and dented he couldnt quite breathe or stay balanced on his feet he swerved back to his table he choked down rye and beer and leveled his shakes out his glasses fit crooked he checked out his new mirror image the worlds most ineffectual workingman an intercom boomed united flight from new orleans is now arriving littell finished his drinks and chased them with two clorets he walked over to the gate and bucked passengers up to the jetway helen saw him and dropped her bags her hug almost knocked him down people stepped around them littell said hey let me see you helen looked up her head grazed his chinshed grown tall you look wonderful its max factor numberfour blush it does wonders for my scars what scars very funny and what are you now a lumberjack i was for a few days at least susan says mr hoovers finally letting you chase gangsters a man kicked helens garment bag and glared at them littell said come on ill buy you dinner o o o they had steaks at the stockyard inn helen talked a blue streak and got tipsy on red wine shed gone from coltish to rangy her face had settled in strong shed quit smokingshe said she knew it was fake sophistication she always wore her hair in a bun to flaunt her scars she wore it down nowit rendered her disfigurement matteroffact a waiter pushed the dessert cart by helen ordered pecan pie littell ordered brandy ward youre letting me do all the talking i was waiting to summarize summarize what you at age twentyone helen groaned i was starting to feel mature littell smiled i was going to say that youve become poised but not at the expense of your exuberance you used to trip over your words when you wanted to make a point but now you think before you talk now people just trip over my luggage when im excited about meeting a man a man you mean a friend twentyfour years your senior who watched you grow up she touched his hands a man i had a professor at tulane who said that things change with old friends and students and teachers so whats a quarter of a century here and there youre saying he was twentyfive years older than you helen laughed twentysix he was trying to minimize things to make them seem less embarrassing youre saying you had an affair with him yes and im saying it wasnt lurid and pathetic but going out with undergrad boys who thought id be easy because i was scarred up was littell said jesus christ helen waved her fork at him now i know youre upset because some part of you is still a jesuit seminarian and you only invoke our saviors name when youre flustered littell sipped brandy i was going to say jesus christ have kemper and i ruined you for young men your own age are you going to spend your youth chasing middleaged men you should hear susan and claire and i talk you mean my daughter and her best friends swear like longshoremen no but weve been discussing men in general and you and kemper in specific for years in case youve felt your ears burning i can understand kemper hes handsome and dangerous yes and hes heroic but hes a tomcat and even claire knows it helen squeezed his hands he felt his pulse racing he got this jesus fucking christ crazy idea littell took off his glasses im not so sure kempers heroic i think heroes are truly passionate and generous that sounds like an epigram it is senator john f kennedy said it are you enamored of him isnt he some terrible liberal im enamored of his brother robert who is truly heroic helen pinched herself this is the strangest conversation to be having with an old family friend whos known me since before my father died that ideajesus christ littell said ill be heroic for you helen said we cant let this be pathetic o o o he drove her to her hotel and carried her bags upstairs helen kissed him goodbye on the lips his glasses snagged in her hair and fell to the floor littell drove back to midway and caught a am flight to los angeles a stewardess gawked at his ticket his return flight left an hour after they landed one last brandy let him sleep he woke up woozy just as the plane touched down he made it with fourteen minutes to spare flight from miami was landing at gate on time littell badgered a guard and got permission to walk out on the tarmac a wicked hangover headache started kicking in baggage men cruised by and checked him out he looked like a middleaged bum whod slept in his clothes the airplane landed a ground crew pushed passenger steps out bondurant exited up front jimmy hoffa flew his killers firstclass littell walked up to him his chest hammered and his legs went numb his voice fluttered and broke someday im going to punish you for kirpaski and everything else los angeles freddy left a note under the wiper blades im getting some lunch wait

webfoot cartoon what is this and why are you carrying a tape recorder pete dug through his pockets and tossed pill vials under the tree ho ho fucking ho its christmas ten days early codeine and dilaudid ho ho hughes scrunched himself up on his pillows well im delighted but arent you supposed to be auditioning stringers for hushhush pete yanked the tree cord and plugged in the tape rig do you

in hushhush if youve got the money to keep a certain operation going ive got the money to buy the north american continent and if you dont quit leading me on ill put you on a slow boat to the belgian congo pete pressed the play button senator jack and darleen shoftel boned and groaned howard hughes clutched his bedsheets dead ecstatic the fuck crescendoed and diminuendoed jack k said my goddamn back gave out darleen said it was goooood short and sweets the best pete pressed stop howard hughes twitched and trembled we can have hushhush print this up if were careful boss but weve got to watch the wording real close where did you get that the girls a prostitute the fbi had her place wired and freddy turentine hooked up on top of it so we cant print anything that would tip the feds off we cant print anything that only could have come from the bug hughes plucked at his sheets yes ill finance your operation have gail hendee write the story upsomething like priapic senator dallies with hollywood playgirl weve got an issue coming out the day after tomorrow so if gail writes it today and gets it to the office by this evening it can make that next issue have gail write it today the kennedy family will ignore it but the legitimate newspapers and wire services might come to us asking for details to enlarge the story which of course we will give them big howard beamed kidatchristmaslike pete plugged his tree back in o o o gail needed convincing pete sat her down on the watchdoghouse veranda and laid out a line of sweet talk kennedys a geek he had you meet him on his goddamned honeymoon he dropped you two weeks later and kissed you off with a goddamn mink coat gail smiled he was nice though he never said honey lets get a divorce racket going when your old mans worth a hundred million dollars you dont have to do things like that gail sighed you win like always and you know why i havent been wearing that mink lately no i gave it to mrs walter p kinnard you

cot pete booked the presidential suite and placed a standing roomservice order tbird and cheeseburgers for breakfast lunch and dinner jimmy hoffa called he said the hushhush thing sounds good but i want more pete neglected to share his basic opinion jack and darleen were just a twominute mattress ride he kept thinking about miami the cabstand colorful spics tropical sunshine miami felt like adventure miami felt like money o o o he woke up early publication morning gail was goneshed taken to avoiding him with aimless drives to the beach pete walked outside his firstpressrun copy was stuffed in the mailbox per instructions dig the cover lines tomcat senator likes catnip ask nippedat la kittens dig the illustration john kennedys face on a cartoon cats body the tail wrapped around a blonde in a bikini he flipped to the piece gail used the pen name peerless politicopundit us senate cloakroom wags say hes far from being the most dedicatedly demonic democrat dallier no senator lb lover boy johnson probably tops political polls in that department with floridas george f pass the smackeroos smathers coming in second no senator john f kennedy is rather a tenuously tumescent tomcat with a tantalizingly trenchant taste for those finelyfurred and felicitous felines who find him fantastically fetching themselves pete skimmed the rest gail played it halfassedthe smear wasnt vicious enough jack kennedy ogled women and bewitched bothered and bewildered them with baubles bangles beads and brilliant boston beatitudes no heavyduty skank no implied fucking no snide jabs at twominuteman jack perk perk perkhis allstar feelers started twitching pete drove downtown and cruised by the hushhush warehouse things looked absolutely firstglance sop men were wheeling bound stacks out on dollies men were loading pallets a line of newsstand trucks were backed up to the dock sop but two unmarked prowl cars were parked down the street that ice cream wagon idling by looked diceythe driver was talking into a hand mike pete circled the block the fuzz multiplied four unmarkeds at the curb and two black amp whites around the corner he circled again the shit hit the fan and sprayed out in all directions four units were jammed up to the loading dockrunning full lights and siren plainclothesmen piled out a bluesuit cordon hit the warehouse with cargo hooks an lapd van blocked the distribution trucks off swampers dropped their loads and threw their hands up it was fucking scandalrag chaos it was fucking skanksheet armageddon o o o pete drove to the beverly hills hotel a big ugly picture formed somebody ratted off the kennedy issue he parked and ran by the pooi he saw a big crowd outside the hughes bungalow they were peeping in big howards bedroom window they looked like fucking ghouls at an accident scene he ran up and pushed to the front billy eckstine nudged him hey check this out the window was open two men were jacking up mr hughesdoubleteaming him with big verbal grief robert kennedy and joseph p kennedy sr hughes was swaddled in bed quilts bobby was waving a hypo old joe was raging youre a pathetic lecher and a narcotics addict i am two seconds away from exposing you to the whole wide world and if you think im bluffing please note that i opened the window to let your hotel neighbors have a sneak preview of what the whole world will know if you ever allow your filthy scandal rag to write another word about my family hughes cringed his head banged the wall and sent a picture frame toppling some allstar voyeurs dug the show billy mickey cohen some faggot mouseketeer sporting a jumbo mouseear beanie howard hughes whimpered howard hughes said please dont hurt me o o o pete drove to the shoftel pad the big ugly picture expanded either gail snitched or the feds exposed the piggyback he pulled up behind freddys van freddy was down on his knees in the streetcuffed to the frontbumper housing pete ran over freddy yanked at his shackle chain and tried to stand up hed scraped his wrist bloody hed ripped his knees raw crawling on the pavement pete knelt down in front of him what happened quit grabbing at that and look at me freddy did some wrist contortions pete slapped him freddy snapped to and focused in halfalert he said the listeningpost guy sent his transcripts to some fed in chicago and told him he was hinked on my van pete this thing plays wrong to me theres just one fbi guy working singleo like he went off halfcocked or some pete ran across the lawn and bolted the porch darleen shoftel ducked out of his way snapped a high heel and fell on her ass the big and ugly final picture spacklecoated mikes on the floor two tapgutted phones bellyup on an end table and sa ward j littell standing there in an offtherack blue suit it was a stalemate you dont whack fbi men impromptu pete walked up to him he said this is a bullshit roust or you wouldnt be here alone littell just stood there his glasses slipped down his nose you keep flying out here to bother me next times the last time littell said ive put it together the words came out all quivery im listening kemper boyd told me he had an errand at the beverly hills hotel he talked to you there and you got suspicious and tailed him you saw us blackbag this place and got your friend to put in auxiliary wires senator kennedy told miss shoftel about roland kirpaski testifying and you heard it and talked jimmy hoffa into giving you the contract booze guts this skinny stringbean cop with am liquor breath youve got no proof and mr hoover doesnt care youre right i cant arrest you and turentine pete smiled ill bet mr hoover liked the tapes ill bet he wont be too pleased that you blew this operation littell slapped his face littell said thats for the blood on john kennedys hands the slap was weak most women slapped harder o o o he knew shed leave a note he found it on their bed next to her house keys i know you figured out i softsoaped the article when the editor didnt question it i realized it wasnt enough and called bob kennedy he said he would probably be able to pull strings and get the issue pulled jack is sort of callous in some ways but he doesnt deserve what you planned i dont want to be with you any more please dont try to find me she left the clothes he bought her pete dumped them out in the street and watched cars drive over them washington dc to say that i am furious belittles the concept of fury to say that i consider your actions outrageous demeans the notion of outrage mr hoover paused the pillow on his chair made him tower over two tall men kemper looked at littell they sat flush in front of hoovers desk littell said i understand your position sir hoover patted his lips with a handkerchief i do not believe you and i do not rate the value of objective awareness nearly as high as i rate the virtue of loyalty littell said i acted impetuously sir i apologize for that impetuous describes your attempt to contact mr boyd and foist your preposterous bondurant suspicions on him and robert kennedy duplicitous and treacherous describe your unauthorized flight to los angeles to uproot an official bureau operalion i considered bondurant a murder suspect sir i thought that he had implemented a piggyback on the surveillance equipment that mr boyd and i had installed and i was correct hoover said nothing kemper knew hed let the silence build the operation blew from two flanks bondurants girlfriend tipped bobby to a smear piece ward logicked out the kirpaski hit himself that logic held a certain validity pete was in miami concurrent with roland hoover fondled a paperweight is murder a federal offense mr littell no sir are robert kennedy and the mcclellan committee direct rivals of the bureau i dont consider them that sir then you are a confused and naive man which your recent actions more than confirm littell sat perfectly still kemper saw his pulse hammer his shirt front hoover folded his hands january marks the twentieth anniversary of your bureau appointment you are to retire on that day you are to work at the chicago office until then you are to remain on the cpusa surveillance squad until the day you retire littell said yes sir hoover stood up kemper stood a beat later per protocol littell stood up too fasthis chair teetered you owe your continued career and pension to mr boyd who was most persuasive in convincing me to be lenient i expect you to repay my generosity by promising to maintain absolute silence regarding mr boyds mcclellan committee and kennedy family incursion do you promise that mr littell yes sir i do hoover walked out kemper put his drawl on you can breathe now son o o o the mayflower bar featured wraparound banquettes kemper sat littell down and thawed him out with a double scotchontherocks they bucked sleet walking overthere was no chance to talk ward took the thrashing better than he expected kemper said any regrets not really i was going to retire at twenty years and the thp is a halfmeasure at best are you rationalizing i dont think so ive had a finish the thought dont let me explicate for you well ive had a taste of something very dangerous and good and you like it yes its almost as if ive touched a new world kemper stirred his martini do you know why mr hoover allowed you to remain with the bureau not exactly i convinced him that you were volatile irrational and addicted to taking heedless risks the element of truth in that convinced him that you were better off inside the barn pissing out than outside the barn pissing in he wanted me there to buttress the intimidation and if he had signaled me i would have laced into you myself littell smiled kemper youre leading me youre like an attorney drawing out a witness yes and youre a provocative witness now let me ask you a question what do you think pete bondurant has planned for you my death your postretirement death more likely he murdered his own brother ward and his parents killed themselves when they found out its a bondurant rumor that ive chosen to believe littell said jesus christ he was awed it was a perfectly lucid response kemper speared the olive in his glass are you going to continue the work you started without bureau sanction yes ive got a good informant prospect now and i dont want to know specifics just yet i just want you to convince me that you understand the risks from both within and outside the bureau and that you wont behave foolishly littell smiledand almost looked bold hoover would crucify me if the chicago mob knew i was investigating them without sanction theyd torture and kill me kemper ive got a wild notion about where youre leading me tell me youre thinking of working for robert kennedy for real hes gotten to you and you respect the work hes doing youre going to turn things over a notch and start feeding hoover a minimum of information and selected misinformation lyndon johnson waltzed a redhead by the back booths hed seen her beforejack said he could arrange an introduction youre right but its the senator i want to work for bobbys more your type hes as catholic as you are and the mob is just as much his raison dкtre and youll feed hoover as much information as you deem fit yes the inherent duplicities wont bother you dont judge me ward littell laughed you enjoy my judgments you enjoy it that someone besides mr hoover has your number so ill warn you be careful with the kennedys kemper raised his glass i will be and you should know that jack might damn well be elected president two years from now if he is bobby will have carte blanche to fight organized crime a kennedy administration might mean considerable opportunities for both of us littell raised his glass an opportunist like you would know salud can i tell bobby that youll share your intelligence with the committee anonymously yes and it just hit me that i retire four days before the next presidential inauguration should your profligate friend jack be the one taking office you might mention a worthy lawyercop who needs a job kemper pulled out an envelope you were always a quick study and you forget that claire has both our numbers youre smirking kemper read me what youve got there kemper unrolled a sheet of notebook paper quote and dad you wouldnt believe this one am phone call i got from helen are you sitting down she had a hot date with uncle ward date of birth march to helens october and necked with him in her room wait until susan finds out helens always sideswiped older men but this is like snow white attacking walt

pursuer so far helen agee is a college girl in the guise of a mack truck remember that if things get complicated littell laughed and walked off primping his posture was good but those dented glasses had to go idealists disdained appearances ward had no flair for nice things kemper ordered a second martini and watched the back booths echoes drifted his waycongressmen were talking up cuba john stanton called cuba a potential agency hotspot he said i might have work for you jack kennedy walked in lyndon johnsons redhead passed him a napkin note jack saw kemper and winked part ii c o l l u s

informant hed tailed lenny sands for ten consecutive nights sands did not habituate homosexual meeting spots his sexual bent might not prove exploitablesands might belittle the threat of exposure snow swirled up michigan avenue littell studied his one wallet photo it was a laminated snapshot of helen her hairdo made her burn scars stand out the first time he kissed her scars she wept kemper called her the mack truck girl he gave her a mack truck bulldog hood hanger for christmas claire boyd told susan they were lovers susan said when the shock wears off ill tell dad what i think she still hadnt

i dusted them for prints and got four latents that matched your dmv set it was a bluff all he got were smears youve got no choice in this lenny you know what sam would do to you lenny broke a sweat littell poured him a scotchthe smell made him salivate lenny sipped his drink twohanded his toughguy voice didnt quite work i know bubkes about the fund what i know is that connected guys and certain businessman types apply for these largeinterest loans and get pushed up some kind of loan ladder to sam giancana thats one theory then elaborate on it the theory is that giancana consults with jimmy hoffa on all the bigmoney loan applications then they get accepted or refused are there alternative pension fund books what im thinking of is coded books hiding secret assets i dont know kemper boyd always said cow your informants lenny hauled himself into a chair schizophrenic lenny knew that tough jewboys dont cringe on the floor littell poured himself a double scotch loungeact lenny said make

addresses the addresses of members of the chicago crime cartel oh those addresses why dont they match lenny said because theyre fuck pads theyre pads where guys go to cheat on their wives ive got keys to some of the pads because i drop off jukebox receipts to them in fact i was bagging receipts at that fucking queer bar when that fucking faggot iannone came on to me littell downed his drink i saw

kenilworth in oak park wolverton in evanston iannone lived in oak parkthat fact made the papers the evanston address was a strong fuckpad possibility the locksmith supplied easytofollow directions littell found the address in just a few minutes it was a garage apartment behind a northwestern u frat house the neighborhood was dark and dead quiet the key fit the door littell let himself in gun

kab jimmy hoffa had points in two havana casinos littell and boyd made him for two killings stanton and banister probably didnt know that stanton fed him that little teaser i may ask a favor of you one day things were dovetailing tight and cozy his feelers started perkperkperking pete buzzed the receptionist donna get me long distance persontoperson i want to talk to a man named kemper boyd at the mcclellan committee office in washington dc tell the operator to try the senate office building and if you get through say im the caller yes sir pete hung up and waited the call was a longshotboyd was probably out somewhere conniving his intercom light flashed pete picked up the phone boyd speaking and surprised well i owe you one so i thought id deliver keep going i was in miami last week i ran into two men named john stanton and guy banister and they seemed real interested in you mr stanton and i have already spoken but thanks its nice to know theyre still interested i gave you a good reference youre a sport is there anything i can do for you you can find me a new dirt digger for hushhush boyd hung up laughing miami the committee booked him into a howard johnsons kemper upgraded to a tworoom suite at the fontainebleau he made up the difference out of his own pocket he was closing in on three salariesit wasnt that big an extravagance bobby sent him back to miami he instigated the trip himself and promised to return with some key sun valley depositions he didnt tell bobby that the cia was thinking about recruiting him the trip was a little vacation if stanton was good theyd connect kemper carried a chair out to the balcony ward littell had mailed him a reporthe needed to edit it before sending it on to bobby the report was twelve typed pages ward included a longhand preface kb since were partners in this gentle subterfuge im giving you a verbatim account of my activities of course youll want to omit mention of my more flagrant illegalities given mr kennedys proviso as youll note i have made substantial progress and believe me given the extreme circumstances i have been very careful kemper read the report extreme circumstances didnt quite cover it littell witnessed a homosexual murder the victim was a chicago mob underboss the killer was a mob fringe dweller named lenny sands sands was now littells snitch sands had recently partnered up with a bookieloan shark named mad sal donofrio donofrio shepherded gambling junkets to las vegas and lake tahoe sands was to accompany the groups as their traveling lounge act sands had keys to mobster fuck pads littell coerced him into making duplicates and surreptitiously entered three fuck pads to look for evidence littell observed and left untouched weapons narcotics and in cashhidden in a golf bag at the fuck pad of one butch montrose littell located tony iannones fuck pad a garage apartment littered with homosexual paraphernalia littell was determined to protect his informant from potential reprisals littell disclosed the fuck pads location to chicago mob members and staked it out to see if they followed up on his anonymous tip they did sam giancana and two other men broke down the fuck pad door an hour later they undoubtedly saw iannones homosexual contraband amazing fully emblematic of the ward littell trinity luck instinct naive courage littell concluded my ultimate goal is to facilitate a loan seeker up the ladder to the teamsters central states pension fund this loan seeker will be ideally my own legally compromised informant lenny sands and potentially mad sal donofrio may prove to be valuable allies in recruiting such an informant my ideal loan seeker would be a crooked businessman with organized crime connections a man susceptible to physical intimidation and threats of federal prosecution such an informant could help us determine the existence of alternative pension fund books contaming hidden thus illegal assets this avenue of approach presents robert kennedy with unlimited opportunities at prosecution if such books do exist the administrators of the hidden assets will be indictable on numerous counts of grand larceny and federal tax fraud i agree with mr kennedy this may pmve to be the way to link jimmy hoffa and the teamsters to the chicago mob and break their collective power if monetary collusion on such a rich and pervasive scale can be proven heads will roll the plan was ambitious and stratospherically risky kemper snapped to a possible glitch straight off littell exposed icepick tonys sexual bent did he consider all the potential ramifications kemper called the miami airport and altered his dc flight for a chicago stopover the move felt sound if his hunch proved right hed need to give ward a good thrashing dusk came on room service brought his standing order up punctual to the minute he sipped beefeaters and picked at smoked salmon collins avenue glowed twinkling lights bracketed the beachfront kemper got a mild glow on he reprised his moments with the mink woman and thought of a dozen lines he could have used chimes rang kemper ran a comb through his hair and opened the door john stanton said hello mr boyd kemper ushered him in stanton walked around and admired the suite robert kennedy treats you well youre being disingenuous mr stanton ill be blunt then you grew up wealthy and lost your family now youve adopted the kennedys youre in the practice of reclaiming your wealth in small increments and this really is quite a handsome room kemper smiled would you like a martini martinis taste like lighter fluid ive always judged hotels by their wine list i can send down for whatever you like i wont be here long enough whats on your mind stanton pointed to the balcony cubas out there i know that we think castro will go communist hes set to come to america in april and offer his friendship but we think hell behave badly and force an official rejection hes going to deport some politically undesirable cubans soon and theyll be granted asylum here in florida we need men to train them and form them into an anticastro resistance the pay is two thousand dollars a month in cash plus the chance to purchase discountpriced stock in agencybacked front companies this is a firm offer and you have my personal assurance that we wont let your agency work interfere with your other affiliations affiliations plural stanton stepped out on the balcony kemper followed him up to the railing you retired from the fbi rather precipitously you were close to mr hoover who hates and fears the kennedy brothers post hoc propter ergo hoc you were an fbi agent on tuesday a prospective pimp for jack kennedy on wednesday and a mcclellan committee investigator on thursday i can follow logical whats the standard pay rate for cia contract recruits eightfifty a month but my affiliations make me a special case yes we know youre getting close to the kennedys and we think jack kennedy might be elected president next year if the castro problem extends well need someone to help influence his cuban policy as a lobbyist no as a very subtle agent provocateur kemper checked the view lights seemed to shimmer way past cuba ill consider your offer chicago littell ran into the morgue kemper called him from the airport and said meet me there now he called half an hour ago he didnt elaborate he said just those four words and slammed the phone down a row of autopsy rooms extended off the foyer sheetcovered gurneys blocked the hallway littell pushed through them kemper stood by the far wall next to a row of freezer slabs littell caught his breath what the fuck is kemper pulled a slab out the tray held a male caucasian dead body the boy was torture slashed and cigarette burned his penis was severed and stuffed in his mouth littell recognized him the kid in icepick tonys nude snapshot kemper grabbed his neck and forced him down close this is on you ward you should have destroyed every bit of evidence pointing to iannones known associates before you tipped off those mob guys guilty or not they had to kill someone so they decided to kill the boy in the picture you left for them to see littell jerked backward he smelled stomach bile and blood and forensic dental abrasive kemper shoved him down closer youre working for bobby kennedy and i set it up and mr hoover will destroy me if he finds out youre damn lucky i decided to check some missingpersons reports and you had damn well better convince me you wont fuck up like this again littell closed his eyes tears spilled out kemper shoved him in cheek to cheek with the dead boy meet me at lenny sands apartment at ten well shore things up o o o work didnt help he tailed commies and wrote out a surveillance log his hands shook his printing was nearillegible helen didnt help he called her just to hear her voice her law school chitchat brought him close to screaming court meade didnt help they met for coffee and exchanged reports court told him he looked lousy court said his report looked threadbarelike he wasnt spending much time at the listening post he couldnt say im slacking off because i found a snitch he couldnt say i fucked up and got a boy killed church helped a little he lit a candle for the dead boy he prayed for competence and courage he cleaned up in the bathroom and remembered something lenny said sal d was

sifted through the clutter and grabbed knickknacks littell saw poker chips french ticlders and playboy rabbit key chains lenny held up a novelty pen shaped like a penis which one of you bigdick gavones wants to be the first one to sign up a line formed littell felt his stomach turn over he walked to the curb and vomited the rye and beer burned his throat he hunched over and puked himself dry some junket men walked past him twirling key chains a few laughed at him littell braced himself against a lamppost he saw sal and lenny in the rec hall doorway sal backed lenny into the wall and jabbed at his chest lenny mimed a single word okay o o o the door stood ajar littell pushed it all the way open kemper was going through lennys address book hed turned on all the livingroom lights

restaurant on northeast i street jeh i see the committee offices are close by so i imagine youre hard at work for little brother kb i am sir at least cosmetically jeh update me please kb i convinced little brother to send me back to miami i told him that i could depose some sun valley land fraud witnesses and in fact i did bring back some inconclusive depositions jeh continue kb my real motive in traveling to florida was to accrue information for you on the gretzler and kirpaski matters youll be pleased to know that i checked in with both the miami and lake weir police departments and learned that both cases have been moved to open file status i consider that a tacit admission that both homicides win remain unsolved jeh excellent now update me on the brothers kb the committees labor racketeering mandate expires in ninety days the paperwork forwarding process is now in the compilation stage and ill be sending you carbons of every piece of salient memoranda sent to our target grand juries and again sir my opinion is that jimmy hoffa is legally inviolate at this time jeh continue kb big brother has been calling legitimate labor leaders allied with the democratic party to assure them that the trouble that little brother has stirred up with hoffa does not mean that he is antilabor overall my understanding is that he will announce his candidacy in early january of next year jeh and you remain certain that the brothers do not suspect the bureau of collusion in the darleen shoftel matter kb im certain sir pete bondurants girlfriend informed little brother of the hushhush piece and ward littell exposed both our primary bug and bondurants secondary bug independent of her jeh i heard the brothers father made howard hughes eat crow kb thats true sir jeh hushhush has been lackluster lately the advance peeks that mn hughes has been sending me have been quite tame kb ive been staying in touch with pete bondurant on general principles and i think ive found him a hollywoodconnected man he could use as a stringer jeh if my bedtime reading improves ill know youve succeeded kb yes sir jeh we have ward littell to thank for that entire big brother snafu kb i passed through chicago and saw littell two days ago sir jeh continue kb i had initially thought that his thp expulsion might push him toward taking antimob actions on his own so i decided to check up on him jeh and kb and my concerns were groundless littell seems to be suffering his red squad work in silence and the only change of habit that i could detect was that hes begun an affair with tom agees daughter helen jeh an affair of a sexual nature kb yes sir jeh is the girl of age kb shes twentyone sir jeh i want you to keep an eye on littell kb i will sir and while i have you could i bring up a tangential matter jeh certainly kb it involves the cuban political situation jeh continue kb in the course of my florida visits ive met several probatista and procastro cuban refugees now apparently castro is going communist ive learned that undesirables of varying political stripes will be expelled from cuba and granted asylum in the us with most of them settling in miami would you like information on them jeh do you have an information source kb yes sir jeh but youd rather not reveal it kb yes sir jeh i hope theyre paying you kb its an ambiguous situation sir jeh youre an ambiguous man and yes any and all cuban emigre intelligence would be appreciated have you anything to add im due at a meeting kb one last thing sir did you know that the brothers father had an illegitimate daughter with gloria swanson jeh no i did not know that youre certain kb reasonably should i follow up on it jeh yes but avoid any personal entanglements that might upset your incursion kb yes sir jeh forewarned is forearmed you have a tendency to adopt people such as the morallyimpaired ward littell dont extend that tendency toward the kennedys i suspect that their powers of seduction exceed even your own kb ill be careful sir jeh good day mr boyd kb good day sir los angeles dick steisel said if mr hughes is so tight with j edgar hoover have him call off the goddamn process servers pete scoped out his office the client photos were boffo hughes shared a wall with some south american dictators and bongo player preston epps he wont ask hoover for favors he figures he hasnt kissed his ass

steisels desk he doesnt see things that way and how do you see things the way he pays me to which means in this instance which means im going to call central casting bag a halfdozen actors and have

shit itll buy us some time steisel sifted through desk clutter twa aside you should know that most of the hushhush articles youve sent over for vetting are libelous heres an example from that spade cooley piece does ella mae cooley have everlast stamped across her chest she should because spades been bopping bluegrass ballads on her already dangerously dented decolletage it seems that ella mae told spade she wanted to join a free love cult spade responded with fiddlehoned fisticuffs and now ella mae has been sporting brutally blackandblue blistered bosomage you see pete theres a no loophole

your move and stantons the machine guns came with fully loaded drums and a maintenance manual thes fit his shoulder rig perfectly kemper strapped one on and drove to the airport he caught the pm new york shuttle with time to spare o o o fifth avenue was a highline tudor fortress kemper ducked past the doorman and pushed the l hughes lobby buzzer a womans voice came on the intercom take the second lift on the left please you can leave the groceries in the foyer he elevatored up twelve floors the doors opened straight into an apartment vestibule the vestibule was the size of his living room the mink woman was leaning against a fullsized greek column wearing a tartan robe and slippers her hair was tied back she was juuust starting to smile i remember you from the kennedys party jack said youre one of bobbys policemen my names kemper boyd miss hughes from lexington kentucky youre close nashville tennessee she folded her arms you heard me give the cab driver my address and you described me to the doorman downstairs he told you my name and you rang my bell youre close you saw me give that vulgar diamond broach away any man as elegantly dressed as you are would appreciate a gesture like that only a welltakencareof woman would make that kind of gesture she shook her head thats not a very sharp perception kemper stepped toward her then lets try this you did it because you knew you had an audience it was a kennedy kind of thing to do and im not criticizing you for it laura cinched her robe dont get presumptuous with the kennedys dont even talk presumptuously about them because when you least expect it theyll cut you off at the knees youve seen it happen yes i have did it happen to you no because you cant expel what you havent admitted laura pulled out a cigarette case i started smoking because most of the sisters did they had cases like this so mr kennedy gave me one mr kennedy or joe or uncle joe kemper smiled my father went broke and killed himself he willed me ninetyone dollars and the gun he did it with uncle joe will leave me a good deal more than that whats the current stipend a hundred thousand dollars a year and expenses did you decorate this apartment to resemble the kennedys suite at the carlyle yes its beautiful sometimes i think i could live in hotel suites forever she walked away from him she turned on her heels and disappeared down a museumwidth hallway kemper let five minutes pass the apartment was huge and quiethe couldnt get his bearings he worked his way left and got lost three corridors led him back to the same pantry the four entrances to the dining room had him spinning in circles he hit intersecting hallways a library wings traffic sounds straightened him out he heard foot scuffs on the terrace behind the grand piano he walked over the terrace would swallow up his kitchen at least twice laura was leaning against the railing a breeze ruffled her robe she said did jack tell you no i figured it out myself youre lying the kennedys and a friend of mine in chicago are the only ones who know did mr hoover tell you bobby says he doesnt know but ive never believed him kemper shook his head mr hoover doesnt know lenny sands told a chicago fbi man whos a friend of mine laura lit a cigarette kemper cupped his hands around the match i never thought lenny would tell a soul he didnt have much choice if its any consol no i dont want to know lenny knows bad people and bad people can make you say things you dont want to kemper touched her arm please dont tell lenny you met me why mr boyd because hes embarrassingly well connected no you dont understand im asking you what youre doing here i saw you at joe kennedys party im sure you can fill in the rest yourself thats not an answer i couldnt very well ask jack or bobby for your number why not because uncle joe wouldnt approve and bobby doesnt entirely trust me why because im embarrassingly well connected laura shivered kemper draped his suitcoat around her shoulders she pointed to his holster bobby told me the mcclellan people dont carry guns im off duty did you think id be so bored and indolent that you could just ring my bell and seduce me no i thought id buy you dinner first laura laughed and coughed smoke is kemper your mothers maiden name yes is she alive she died in a nursing home in what did you do with the gun your father left you i sold it to a classmate in law school does he carry it he died on iwo jima laura dropped her cigarette in a coffee cup i know so many orphans so do i youre sort of one your no thats not true youre just saying it to make points with me i dont think its much of a stretch she snuggled into his suitcoat the sleeves flopped in the wind repartee is one thing mr boyd and the truth is another the truth is my robberbaron father fucked my moviestar mother and got her pregnant my moviestar mother had already had three abortions and didnt want to risk a fourth my moviestar mom disowned me but my father enjoys flaunting me in front of his legitimate family once a year the boys like me because im provocative and they think im nifty because they cant fuck me because im their halfsister the girls hate me because im a coded message from their father that says men can fuck around but women cant do you get the picture mr boyd i have a family my father put me through boarding school and several colleges my father supports me my father informed his family of my existence when jack brought me home from a harvard alumni mixer as the unwitting pawn in a rather vicious ploy i had initiated to assert myself into the family imagine his surprise when father said jack you cant fuck her shes your halfsister little bobby twenty and calvinistic overheard the conversation and spread the word my father figured what the hell the words out and invited me to stay for dinner mrs kennedy had a rather traumatic reaction to all of this our embarrassingly well connected friend lenny sands was giving jack speech lessons for his first congressional campaign and was at the house for dinner he stopped rose from making a scene and weve been sharing secrets ever since i have a family mr boyd my father is evil and grasping and ruthless and willing to destroy anybody who so much as looks the wrong way at the children he publicly acknowledges and i hate everything about him except the money he gives me and the fact that he would probably destroy anybody who tried to hurt me as well car horns bleeped long and shrill laura pointed down at a line of taxis they perch there like vultures they always make the most noise when im playing rachmaninoff kemper unholstered his piece he honed in on a sign marked yellow cabs only he braced his arm on the railing and fired two shots sheared the sign off the signpost the silencer went thwackpete was a good ordnance supplier laura whooped cabbies gestured up spooked and bewildered kemper said i like your hair laura untied it the wind made it dance o o o they talked he told her how the boyd fortune evaporated she told him how she flunked out of juilliard and flopped as a socialite she called herself a musical dilettante he called himself an ambitious cop she recorded chopin on a vanity label he sent christmas cards to car thieves he arrested he said he loved jack but couldnt stand bobby she called bobby deep beethoven and jack mozart most glib she called lenny sands her one true friend and didnt mention his betrayal he said his daughter claire shared all his secrets devils advocate snapped on automatically he knew exactly what to say and what to omit he called mr hoover a vindictive old queen he portrayed himself as a liberal pragmatist hitched to the kennedy star she revived the orphanhood theme he described the threedaughter combine susan littell was judgmental and shrill helen agee was courageous and impetuous his claire was too close to know just yet he told her about his friendship with ward he said he wanted a younger brother for keepsand the bureau gave him one he said ward worshiped bobby she said bobby sensed that uncle joe was evil and chased gangsters to compensate for his patrimony he hinted at his own lost brother he said the loss made him push ward in odd ways they talked themselves exhausted laura called and had dinner sent up the chateaubriand and wine made her drowsy they left it unspoken not tonightnext time o o o laura fell asleep kemper walked through the apartment two circuits taught him the layout laura told him the maid needed a map the dining room could feed a small army he called the agencys miami ops number john stanton picked up immediately yes its kemper boyd im calling to accept your offer im very pleased to hear that ill be in touch mr boyd well have lots to discuss good

garbagestrewn tide pool o o o littell got home late helen was asleep on his side of the bed her side was cold sleep wouldnt comehe kept replaying the breakin for errors he drifted off around dawn he

thing bugeyed littell stared them down miami the boat was late us customs agents crowded the dock the us health service had a tent pitched in the parking lot behind it the refugees would be xrayed and bloodtested the contagious ones would be shipped to a state hospital outside pensacola stanton checked his passenger manifest one of our onisland contacts leaked us a list all the deportees are male waves hit the pilings guy banister flicked a cigarette butt at them which implies that theyre criminals castros getting rid of plain old undesirables under the politically undesirable blanket debriefing huts flanked the dock us border patrol marksmen crouched behind them they had firsthintoftroubleshoottokill orders kemper stood above the front pilings waves smashed up and sprayed his trouser legs his specific job was to interview teofilio paez the exsecurity boss for the united fruit company a cia briefing pouch defined uf americas largest most longestablished and profitable incuba corporation and the largest onisland employer of unskilled and semiskilled cuban national workers a longstanding bastion of cuban anticommunism cuban national security aides working for the company have long been effective in recruiting anticommunist youth eager to infiltrate leftwing workers groups and cuban educational institutions banister and stanton watched the skyline kemper stepped into a breeze and let it ruffle his hair he had ten days in as a contract agenttwo briefings at langley and this he had ten days in with laura hughesthe la guardia shuttle made trysting easy laura felt legitimate laura went crazy when he touched her laura said brilliant things and played chopin con brio laura was a kennedy laura spun kennedy tales with great verve he hid those stories from mr hoover it felt like nearloyalty it felt nearpoignantand hoovercompromised he needed mr hoover he continued to feed him phone reports but limited them to mcclellan committee intelligence he rented a suite at the st regis hotel not far from lauras apartment the monthly rate was brutal manhattan got in your blood his three paychecks totaled fiftynine thousand a yearnowhere near enough to sustain the life he wanted bobby kept him busy with boring committee paperwork jack had dropped hints that the family might have postcommittee work for him his most likely position would be campaign security boss jack enjoyed having him around bobby continued to vaguely distrust him bobby wasnt up for grabsand ward littell knew it he talked to ward twice a week ward was ballyhooing his new snitcha bookieloan shark named sal donofrio cautious ward said he had mad sal cowed angry ward said lenny sands was now working for pete bondurant angry ward knew that he set it up ward sent him intelligence reports he edited out the illegalities and forwarded them to bobby kennedy bobby knew littell solely as the phantom bobby prayed for him and marveled at his courage hopefully that courage was tinged with circumspection hopefully that boy on the morgue slab taught ward a few things ward was adaptable and willing to listen ward was another orphanraised in jesuit foster homes ward had good instincts ward believed that alternative pension fund books existed lenny sands thought the books were administered by a mob elder statesman hed heard that cash was paid for loan referrals that resulted in large profits littell might be stalking big money it was potential knowledge to hide from bobby he did hide it he cut every fund reference from the phantoms reports littell was malleable for a zealot the big question was this could his covert work be hidden from mr hoover a dark speck bobbed on the water banister held up binoculars they dont look wholesome theres a crap game going on at the back of the barge customs men hit the dock they packed revolvers billy clubs and shackle chains stanton showed kemper a photograph this is paez well grab him right off so customs cant requisition him paez looked like a skinny xavier cugat banister said i can see him now hes up front and hes cut and bruised stanton winced castro hates united fruit our propaganda section picked up a polemic he wrote on it nine months ago it was an early indication that he might go commie whitecaps pushed the barge in close the men were kicking and clawing to be first off kemper flicked the safety off his piece where are we detaining them banister pointed north the agency owns a motel in boynton beach they concocted a cover story about fumigation and evicted all the tenants well pack these beaners in six to a room and see who we can use the refugees yelled and waved little flags on sticks teo paez was crouched to sprint the customs boss yelled on ready the barge tapped the dock paez jumped off kemper and stanton grabbed him and bearhugged him they picked him up and ran with him banister ran interferencecia custody hes ours the riflemen fired warning shots the refugees ducked and covered customs men grappled the barge in and cinched it to the pilings kemper hustled paez through the crowd stanton ran ahead and unlocked a debriefing hut somebody yelled theres a body on the boat they got their man inside banister locked the door paez hit the floor and smothered it with kisses cigars fell out of his pockets banister picked one up and sniffed the wrapper stanton caught his breath welcome to america mr paez weve heard very good things about you and were very glad youre here kemper cracked a window the dead man passed by on a gurneybladepunctured from head to toe customs agents lined up the exilesmaybe fifty men total banister set up his tape recorder on a table stanton said you had a death on the boat paez slumped into a chair no it was a political execution we surmised that the man had been deported to serve as an antiamerican spy under interrogation he revealed that this was true we acted accordingly kemper sat down you speak excellent english teo i speak the slow and exaggeratedly formal english of the laboriously selftaught native speakers tell me that i sometimes lapse into hilarious malapropisms and mutilations of their language stanton pulled a chair up would you mind talking with us now weve got a nice apartment ready for you and mr boyd will drive you there in a little while paez bowed i am at your disposable excellent im john stanton by the way and these are my colleagues kemper boyd and guy banister paez shook hands all around banister pocketed the rest of the cigars and turned on the tape machine can we get you anything before we start no i would like my first american meal to be a sandwich at wolfies delicatessen in miami beach kemper smiled banister laughed outright stanton said teo is fidel castro a communist paez nodded yes indubitably so he is a communist in both thought and practice and my old network of student informants have told me that airplanes carrying russian diplomats have flown in to havana late at night on several occasions recently my friend wilfredo olmos delsol who was on the boat with me has the flight numbers memorized banister lit a cigarette che guevaras been red since way back yes and fidels brother raul is a communisto pig himself moreover he is a hypocriticize my friend tomбs obregуn says that raul is seffing confiscated heroin to rich drug addicts and hypocriticizingly spewing communist rhetoric at the same time kemper checked his custody list tomбs obregуn was on the boat with you yes how would he have information on the cuban heroin trade because mr boyd he was involved in the heroin trade himself you see my fellow boat passengers are mostly criminal scum fidel wanted to be rid of them and foisted them on america in hopes that they would practice their trades on your shores what he failed to realize was that communism is a bigger crime than dope peddling or robbery or murder and that even criminals might possess the patriotic desire to reclaim their homeland stanton rocked his chair back weve heard that castro has taken over the mafiaowned hotels and casinos it is true fidel calls it nationalization he has stolen the casinos and millions of dollars from the mafia tomбs obregуn told me that the illustrious american gangster santo trafficante jr is currently in custody at the nacional hotel banister sighed that cocksucker castro has a death wish he is fucking with both the united states of america and the mafia there is no mafia guy at least mr hoover has always said so kemper even god can make mistakes stanton said enough of that teo whats the status of the american citizens remaining inside cuba paez scratched and stretched fidel wants to appear humane he is coddling the influential americans still in cuba and allowing them to see only the alleged good his revolution has done he is going to release them slowly to return to america as duped tools to dispense communistic propaganda and in the meantime fidel has burned many of the cane fields of my beloved united fruit and has tortured and killed many of my student infonnants under the indictment that they are spies for the imperialisto y fascisto la united stanton checked his watch guy take teo over for his medical teo go with mr banister mr boyd will drive you into miami in a little while banister hustled paez out kemper watched them walk to the xray shack stanton shut the door dump the dead man somewhere kemper ill debrief all the personnel whove seen him and dont rattle guys cage he can be volatile ive heard rumor has it that he was assistant superintendent of the new orleans police for about ten minutes until he got drunk and shot off his gun in a crowded restaurant stanton smiled and rumor has it that youve fenced a few hot corvettes in your day touchй and parenthetically what did you think of pete bondurants gun donation i was impressed were thinking of making pete an offer and ill be bringing it up the next time i talk to the deputy director kemper said petes a good man hes good at keeping rowdies in line yes he is jimmy hoffa uses him to good effect at that tiger kab place keep going kemper i can tell that youve got your thinking cap on kemper turned off the tape recorder john youre going to find that a sizable percentage of those men out there are uncontrollably psychopathic your notion of indoctrinating them and training them as potential anticastro guerrillas may not work if you house them with stable cuban immigrant families and find them work per your existing plan youll find them reverting to their former criminal predilections as soon as the novelty of being in this country wears off youre saying we should screen them more thoroughly no im saying i should im saying we should extend the detention period at the agencys motel and i should be the one with final authority as to who we recruit stanton laughed may i ask what qualifies you for this kemper ticked off points on his fingers i worked undercover for nine years i know criminals and i like them i infiltrated car theft rings arrested the members and worked with the us attorneys office in building their cases for prosecution i understand the need certain criminals have to acquiesce to authority john i got so close to some of those car thieves that they insisted on deposing their confessions to me onlythe agent who betrayed them and arrested them stanton whistledoutofcharacter for him are you suggesting that you expand your duties and remain with the men you select as their field officer that seems unrealistic to me given your other entanglements kemper slapped the table no im strongly proposing pete bondurant for that job what im saying is this a hardcore criminal contingent properly indoctrinated and supervised could be very effective lets assume that the castro problem extends i think that even at this early date its safe to assume that the agency will have a large pool of future deportees and legally emigrated cubans to choose from lets make this first cadre an elite one its ours john lets make it the best stanton tapped his chin mr dulles was ready to request green cards for all the men hed be pleased to know that were being so selective early on he hates begging the ins for favors kemper put a hand up dont deport the men we reject banister knows some cubans in new orleans doesnt he yes theres a large batistaite community there then let guy have the men we reject let them find jobs or not find jobs and have them file for visas on their own in louisiana how many men do you think will meet your qualifications i have no idea stanton looked eager mr dulles has approved the purchase of some cheap south florida land for our initial training site i think i could convince him to keep our permanent cadre there small and contained if you think the men you select can also train future arrivals before we disperse them to the other camps that im certain will be springing up kemper nodded ill make training skills one of my criteria where is this land its on the coast outside a small town named blessington is it accessible to miami yes why i was thinking of the tiger kab stand as a recruiting hub stanton looked almost hot and bothered gangster connotations aside i think the tiger kab place could be utilized chuck rogers is working there already so weve already got an in kemper said johnvery slowly stanton looked dead ecstatic the answer to all your suggestions is yes pending the deputy directors approval and bravo kemper youre more than fulfilling my expectations kemper stood up and bowed thanks and i think well make castro rue the day he sent that boat off from your mouth to gods ears and by the way what do you think your friend jack would say about our little freedom barge kemper laughed jack would say wheres the women o o o paez talked a blue streak kemper rolled down his window for relief they hit miami at rush hour paez kept jabbering kemper drummed the dashboard and tried to replay his talk with stanton and mr thomas gordean was my patron at la united he loved pussy until his fondness for i w harper bonded bourbon inappropriated him most of the executives at la united got out after castro took over but mr gordean has remained behind now he is drinking even more heavily he has several thousand shares of united fruit stock with him and refuses to leave he has bought off militiamen to be his private bodyguards and is beginning to sprout the communist line himself my great fear is that mr gordean will go communisto like the fidel i loved long ago i fear that he will become a propaganda tool par eccentricity and stock shares thomas gordean a light bulb popped on and nearly blinded him kemper almost ran his car off the road document insert hushhush stringer report lenny sands to pete

miss hughes confidence in the course of establishing a casual friendship with her my relationship with the kennedys gives me credibifity and miss hughes was impressed with the fact that i determined the secret of her parentage without actually broaching the topic to kennedy family members or her other knowledgeable friends miss hughes loves to talk about the family but she only discusses john robert edward rose and the sisters in bland terms she reserves considerable wrath for joseph p kennedy sr cites his ties to boston mobster raymond l s patriarca and a retired chicago bootleggerfinancier named jules schiffrin and delights in telling stories of mr kennedys business rivalry with howard hughes miss hughes adopted the name hughes on her eighteenth birthday replacing the kennedyswanson proffered johnson in an effort to somehow fluster her father one of howard hughes most auspicious enemies miss hughes contends that joseph p kennedys gangster ties run considerably deeper than the he was a bootlegger tag foisted upon him by the press in reference to his highly successful scotch whisky import business preprohibition she cannot cite specific gangster intimates or recall incidents that she has witnessed or heard of secondhand nevertheless her sense of joseph p kennedy as deeply gangster connected remains inchoately strong i will continue my friendship with miss hughes and report all salient kennedy family intelligence to you respectfully kemper boyd document insert summary report sa ward j littell to kemper boyd for editing and forwarding to robert f kennedy

a beating apparently my theft of butch montroses was never connected to sals windfall i ordered sal to repay giancana in three increments and he followed that order my initial violence directed at sal proved to be farsighted i seem to have the man thoroughly cowed in the course of casual conversation i told him that i had been a jesuit seminarian donofrio a selfdescribed devout catholic was impressed by this and now considers me something of a fatherconfessor he has confessed to six torturemurders and of course i now have those gruesomely detailed confessions to hold over him aside from the occasional nightmares the confessions have induced sal and i seem to be proceeding on an even keel i told him i would appreciate it if he would refrain from killing and selfdestructive gambling while under my stewardship and so far he seems to be doing that sal has provided me with rather tame pieces of antimob intelligence not worth forwarding to you or mr kennedy but has not been of help in steering me toward a loan seeker to hoist up the teamster pension fund ladder this was the sole reason i suborned him as my informant and he has failed me in that capacity i suspect that proving the existence of alternative pension fund books will be a gruesomely attenuated process lenny sands continues to wear almost as many hats as you hes the hushhush stringer god what ugly work that must bet sals junket partner and a general chicago mob drone he says hes actively engaged in attempting to accrue information on the workings of the pension fund and says that he believes the rumor that sam giancana pays bonuses for fund loan referrals is true he also believes that alternative perhaps coded pension fund books detailing hidden assets do exist in conclusion ive yet to glean hard information from either sands or donofrio on another front mr hoover seems to be dodging a potential opportunity to impede chicago mob members court meade picked up an elliptically worded mention of a robbery on the tailor shop bug chicago mob soldiers rocco malvaso and dewey di pasquale apparently clouted from a nonchicago mob highstakes crap game in kenilworth thp agents airteled this information to mn hoover who told them not to forward it to the applicable agencies for followup investigation my god that mans twisted priorities ill close now by way of farewell you continue to amaze me kemper god you as a cia man and with the mcclellan committee disbanded what will you be doing for the kennedys godspeed wjl document insert personal note kemper boyd to j edgar hoover marked extremely confidential sir i thought i would drop you a line and update you on the ward littell front littell and i continue to speak regularly on the telephone and i remain convinced that he is not undertaking overt or covert antimob actions on his own authority you mentioned that littell was spotted near celanos tailor shop and the top hoodlum program listening post i subtly queried littell on this and am satisfied with his answer that he was meeting sa court meade for lunch littells personal life seems to revolve around his affair with helen agee this affair has put a strain on his relationship with his daughter susan who disapproves of the liaison normally helen is in close contact with my daughter claire but now that they attend different colleges the frequency of that contact has been curtailed the littellagee romance seems to be comprised of three or four nights a week of domestic gettogethers both retain separate residences and i think they will continue to do so ill continue to keep an eye on littell respectfully kemper boyd document insert personal note kemper boyd to ward j littell ward i strongly urge that you stay away from celanos tailor shop and the listening post area and avoid being seen with court meade i think ive eased some mild suspicions mr hoover might have had but you cannot be too careful i strongly advise you to stop your assignment trade with meade destroy this letter immediately kb document insert summary report kemper boyd to john stanton markedconfidentialhand pouch deliver john heres the update you requested in your last pouch i apologize for the delay but as youve pointed out im multiplyemployed yes the mcclellan committees labor racketeering mandate has terminated no the kennedys havent offered me a permanent job yet i think they will soon there are numerous possibilities since im both an attorney and a cop yes i have discussed cuba with jack he has no opinion on its viability as a campaign issue yet he is strongly anticommunist despite his reputation as a liberal im optimistic ive concluded my auditions at the boynton beach motel today marks the end of the day sequestering period prescribed by deputy director bissell and tomorrow the bulk of our men will be sent to louisiana guy banister has a network of legally emigrated cubans ready to receive them they will be providing housing employment and references aimed at procuring them visas guy will funnel the men into his own indoctrinationtraining program i have selected four men to form the nucleus of our blessington cadre i consider them to be the best of the fiftythree men on the banana boat since i am multiplyemployed i was not present for much of the sequestering but capable case officers followed the indoctrination and psychological testing guidelines i set down those guidelines were exceedingly rigorous i personally supervised polygraph tests to determine the presence of castroplanted informants all fiftythree men passed i think the man they killed on the boat was the ringer backup sodium pentothal tests were administered again all the men passed interrogations followed as i suspected all fiftythree men possessed extensive criminal records inside cuba their offenses included armed robbery burglary arson rape heroin smuggling murder and various political crimes one man was revealed to be a deviate who had molested and decapitated six small children in havana another man was a homosexual procurer despised by the other exiles i deemed both men to be dangerously unstable and terminated them under the indoctrination guidelines set down by the deputy director all the men were subjected to hard interrogation verging on torture most resisted with great courage all the men were physically drilled and verbally abused in the manner of marine corps boot camp most responded with the perfect mixture of anger and subservience the four men i selected are intelligent violent in a controlled manner physically skilled garrulous theyll be good miami recruiters acquiescent to authority and resoundingly proamerican anticommunist and anticastro the men are ateofilio paez himself dob former security chief for united fruit skilled in weaponry and interrogation techniques former cuban navy frogman adept at political recruitment btomas obregon dob former castro guerrilla former havana dope courier and bank robber skified in jujitsu and the manufacture of explosives cwilfredo olmos delsol dob obregons cousin former leftist firebrand turned rightist zealot when his bank accounts were nationalized former cuban army drill instructor small arms weaponry expert dramon gutierrez dob pilot skilled propaganda pamphieteer former torturer for batistas secret police expert in counterinsurgency techniques ive toured the area surrounding the land the agency purchased for the blessington campsite it is impoverished and inhabited by poor white trash a fair number of them ku klux klan members i think we need an impressive white man to run the campsite a man capable of instilling fear in any local rednecks who become perturbed at the notion of cuban emigres squatting in their bailiwick i recommend pete bondurant i checked his world war ii marine corps record and was impressed he survived fourteen handtohand combat charges on saipan won the navy cross and rose from buck private to captain via field commission i strongly urge you to hire bondurant on an agency contract basis thats all for now ill be at the st regis in new york if you need me yours kb ps you were right about castros us trip he refused to register in a hotel that didnt admit negroes then went up to harlem and began issuing antius statements his behavior at the un was deplorable i salute your prescience the man was forcing a rejection document insert memo john stanton to kemper boyd kemper the deputy director has approved the hiring of pete bondurant i have minor qualms and i want you to send him on a trial run of some sort before we approach him use

ransack my suitcase you ask me these questions you think because im a rich american businessman that im on your side you think i dont know how you cia fuckers rigged the elections in guatemala i was

release forms they were superbly forgeda counterfeiter friend did the job sign these please mr gordean theyre reimbursement vouchers for your airfare gordean signed in triplicate kemper signed the notary statement and sealstamped all three signatures his friend rigged the seal at no extra charge gordean laughed cia mannotary public what a combo kemper pulled his and shot him in the head gordean flew off his chair blood sprayed out one ear kemper stepped on his head to stanch the spritz something rustled outside kemper pushed the door open with his gun it was pete bondurant standing there with his hands in his pockets they both smiled pete drew in the air document insert summary report kemper boyd to john stanton marked confidentialhand pouch deliver john i delayed the writing of this communique for two reasons one i wanted to seea botched incident through to its conclusion before contacting you two this note details a mission that i quite frankly blew you had asked me to use my own discretion and send pete bondurant on a trial run to help determine his suitability for agency contract employment i did this and sent bondurant into cuba to pull out a united fruit executive named thomas gordean a man whom teoffflo paez described as volatile and espousing the communist line bondurant succeeded in the first part of his mission we installed mr gordean at the rusty soupper motel in key west for debriefing and made the mistake of leaving him alone to rest gordean committed suicide with a automatic he had secreted on his person i summoned the key west police and bondurant and i debriefed them a coroners jury ruled gordeans death a suicide bondurant testified as to gordeans apparent alcoholism and depressive behavior an autopsy confirmed that gordean showed signs of advanced liver damage his body was shipped to a distant cousin in seattle gordean had no immediate family should you require verification please contact captain hildreth of the key west police of course i apologize for this boondoggle and i assure you that nothing like this will happen again sincerely kemper boyd document insert personal note john stanton to kemper boyd dear kemper of course i am furious and of course you should have informed me of this snafu immediately thank god gordean had no immediate family capable of causing trouble for the agency that expressed ill state that most likely you were to some degree a victim ot mitigating circumstances after all as you once said you are an attorney and a cop not a spy youll be pleased to kaow that deputy director bissell is quite taken with your idea of creating an elite cadre to run the blessington campsite the campsite is currently under construction your four personally selected recruits paez obregon delsol gutierrez are undergoing further training at langley and doing quite well as previously stated the deputy director has approved the hiring of pete bondurant to run the campsite that of course was before the gordean snafu eight now i want to wait and reconsider bondurant in conclusion the gordean incident sits poorly with me but my enthusiasm for you as a contract agent remains strong until i tell you otherwise undertake no more missions on your own authority john stanton document insert personal note ward j littell to kemper boyd for editing and forwarding to robert f kennedy kemper my antimob intelligence gathering continues apace i now have several independently gleaned indications that alternative most likely coded teamster pension fund books do exist lenny sands believes they exist sal donofrio has heard rumors to that effect other sources have supplied rumors a retired chicago mob man administers the books sam giancana serves as the pension funds chief loan approval officer as pervasive as these rumors are i have nothing resembling corroboration and of oourse i wont until i can suborn a cosmetic borrower and gain some kind of literal access to the fund itself and on may th i coerced a third informant into my stable this man a dallasbased strip club operatorloan shark is searching for a borrower to refer to sal donofrio and thence to sam giancana i consider this man to be a major informant because he previously referred a loan seeker to giancana and thp pension fund he calls me at a pay phone near my apartment every thesday morning i have given him money on several occasions he fears me and respects me to just the right degree like sal donofrio he has perpetual money troubles i believe that sooner or later he will supply me with a potentially subornable borrower i also now have a fund of my own ie an informant fund in late may i secured an robbery stash one unreported to any police agency i have paid sal donofrio from this fund strengthening my hold over him strange but i had originally thought that lenny sands would be my most valued informant but both sal and the dallas man have proven themselves more competent or is it more desperate for money i blame you kemper setting lenny up with pete bondurant and hushhush was detrimental to my purposes lenny has seemed abstracted lately he travels with sals junket tours and moonlights for hushhush and seems to have forgotten what i hold over him does he talk to your friend miss hughes id be curious to know per your instructions im avoiding court meade and the listening post court and i have also formally ceased our assignment trade im being careful but i cant help dreaming utopian dreams my essential dream a john f kennedy presidential administration with robert kennedy fulfilling his brothers antimob mandate god kemper wouldnt that be heaven tell mr kennedy hes in my prayers yours wjl document insert personal note kemper boyd to robert f kennedy dear bob just a short note to update you on the work of your anonymous colleague the chicago phantom hes working hard and i hope you find it gratifying that theres at least one human being on earth who hates organized crime as much as you do but as hard as he is workingand always within the legal guidelines you set down to mehes getting scant results pursuing the possibility that alternative pension fund books exist the chicago mob is a closed circle and he hasnt been able to gain the inside information he hoped he would moving along arent you and jack going to offer me some postmcclellan committee employment yours kemper document insert personal letter robert f kennedy to kemper boyd dear kemper thanks for your note on the phantom it is good to know that an exseminarian fbi man shares my antimob fervor and what most impresses me about him is

stay with our organization and fill two positions the first traffic manager for the mcclellan committees legal paperwork weve disbanded but like the phantom im still afire lets keep our antimob and

in captivity seems to want to bite my tush these days which is unusual because ive been playing some pretty square rooms as you know ive been working my wop gig with sal donofrio weve been playing reno vegas tahoe gardena and some lake michigan cruise boats that feature gambling ive been running into fruits galore a regular layfayette escad butt drill of fruitness delores drivein on wilshire e

amp conductor leonard bernstein hey have you noticed im starting to write in the hushhush style more later cheers lenny document insert personal memorandum kemper boyd to john stanton marked confidentialhand pouch deliver john some further thoughts on pete bondurant the tiger kab stand and our elite cadre the more i think about it the more i see tiger kab as the potential hub for our miami activities i broached this thought to fulo machado a former castroite now bristlingly anticastro the cabstand codispatcher and a close friend of contract agent chuck rogers machado shared my enthusiasm he agreed to let rogers take over as permanent cabstand dispatcherboss fulo got approval from jimmy hoffa who frankly prefers white men in supervisory positions fulo is now recruiting for us on the cabstand payroll hoffa knows that cooperating with the agency is smart business he sees cuba as our common cause farsighted for such a brutal and singleminded man i would like to propose fulo machado as the fifth member of our cadre i would also like you to allow rogers to hire tomas obregon wilfredo olmos delsol teofilio paez and ramon gutierrez as fulltime drivers although construction of the blessington campsite is almost complete we do not have exile recruits to train there until more deportees arrive i think our men can be best utilized recruiting in miamis cuban community per bondurant yes he and i screwed up on the thomas gordean matter but bondurant is already employed as jimmy haifas ad hoc cabstand enforcer he also secured a note from santo trafficante personally requesting that no mafia reprisals be launched against castro for nationalizing the havana casinos bondurant forwarded this note to s giancana c marcello and j rosselli all three agree with trafficantes reasoning again brutal shortsighted men are cooperating with the agency out of a sense of common cause bondurant is also the defacto editor of a scandal magazine we can use as a counterintelligence organ and finally i think hes the best man alive to run the campsite they dont come any tougher as i think any local rednecks who toy with him will discover what do you think of my proposals kemper boyd document insert personal memo john stanton to kemper boyd kemper you batted yes machado can join the cadre yes rogers can hire delsol obregon paez and gutierrez as drivers yes have them recruit in miami yes hire pete bondurant to run blessington but have him retain his job with howard hughes as well hughes is a potentially valuable ally and we dont want him estranged from the agency good work kemper john document insert teletype report intelligence division los angeles police department to sa ward j littell chicago fbi sent private mail closure to ba littells home

arranged hors doeuvres on a sideboard near their chairs bobby pulled off his necktie my book will be published in hardback in february about a month after jack announces the paperback edition will come out in july right around the time of the convention im hoping it will put the whole hoffa crusade in perspective we dont want jacks association with the mcclellan conmiittee to hurt him with labor jack laughed that goddamn books eating up all your time you should get a ghost writer i did and i won the pulitzer prize joe smeared caviar on a cracker i heard kemper wanted his name deleted from the text thats too bad because then you could have titled it the ice cream jockey within kemper toyed with his tie pin theres a million car thievesout there who hate me mr kennedy id prefer that they not know what im doing jack said kempers the furtive type joe said yes and bobby could learn from him ive said it a thousand times before and ill say it a thousand times again this hardon for jimmy hoffa and the mafia is horseshit you may need those people to help you get out the vote one day and now youre adding insult to injury by writing a book on top of chasing them via the goddamn committee kemper plays his cards close to the vest bobby you could learn from him bobby chuckled enjoy the moment kemper dad sides against his kids with outsiders present once in a decade jack lit a cigar sinatras pals with those gangster guys if we need them we could use him as a gobetween bobby punched a chair cushion frank sinatra is a cowardly fingerpopping lowlife and i will never make deals with gangster scum jack rolled his eyes kemper took it as a cue to play middleman i think the book has possibilities i think we can distribute copies to union members during the primaries and notch

blew smoke rings bobbys the gangbuster not me kemper said you were on the committee bobby smiled ill portray you heroically jack i wont say that you and dad were soft on hoffa from the gate they all laughed bobby grabbed a handful of canapes joe cleared his throat kemper we invited you to this session chiefly to discuss edgar hoover we should discuss the situation now because im hosting a dinner

convinced himself that the woman was a nazi spy do you mean inga arvad thats right kemper snatched one of bobbys canapes mr hoover has that documented yes he bragged about it to me years ago may i make a suggestion and clear the air about something joe nodded jack and bobby pushed up to the edge of their chairs kemper leaned toward them im sure mr hoover knows that i went to work for the committee im sure hes disappointed that i havent been in touch with him let me reestablish contact and tell him that im working for you let me assure him that jack wont replace him as fbi director if

and ive been thinking that jack should establish some antifidel credentials joe fiddled with his tie pin everybodys starting to hate castro i dont see cuba as a partisan issue jack said dads right but ive been thinking that i might send some marines down if im elected joe said when youre elected right ill send some marines down to liberate the whorehouses kemper can lead the troops ill have him establish a spearhead in havana joe winked dont forget your spear kemper i wont and seriously ill keep you posted on the cuban front i know some exfbi men with good anticastro intelligence bobby

loved ballsy men and the arts she was a solitary womanwith no real friends except lenny sands she exemplifled the pervasive kennedy orbit a mobbedup lounge lizard gave jack speech lessons and forged a bond with his halfsister that bond was borderline scary lenny might tell laura things lenny might tell her grisly stories laura never mentioned lennydespite the fact that he facilitated their meeting she probably talked to lenny longdistance lenny was volatile an angry or frightened lenny might say mr boyd made mr littell hit me mr boyd and mr littell are nasty extortionists mr boyd got me my hushhush jobwhich is very nasty employment his lenny fears peaked in late april the boynton beach auditions revealed two security risks a child molester and a homosexual pimp cia guidelines mandated termination he took them out to the everglades and shot them the pimp saw it coming and begged he shot him in the mouth to cut his squeals off he told claire he killed two men in cold blood she

saw a stack of plasticwrapped bricks by the tv set white powder was leaking out he knew it was heroin miami kemper read by the eden roc pool a waiter freshened his coffee every few minutes the herald ran it in banner print four dead in cuban dope war the paper reported no witnesses and no leads the assumed perpetrators were rival cuban gangs kemper linked events john stanton sends him a report three days ago it states that president eisenhowers cubanops budget has come in way below the requested amount it states that raul castro is funding a miami propaganda drive through heroin sales it states that a distribution shacksafe house has already been established it states that the heroin gang includes two extiger kab men cйsar salcido and rolando cruz he tells pete to clear an agencycabstand lease deal he assumes that jimmy hoffa will stipulate vengeance on the men who shot up the stand he knows that pete will wreak that vengeance with considerable flair he has dinner with john stanton they discuss his report at length john says heroinpushing commies are tough competition ike will kick loose more money later on but now is now more banana boats are due anticastro zealots will swarm florida hothead ideologues will join the cause and demand action rampant factionalism might reign the blessington campsite is still short of operational and their elite cadre is still untested the dope clique might usurp their strategic edge and financial hegemony kemper said heroinpushing commies are tough you cant compete with men wholl go that far he made stanton say it himself he made stanton say unless we exceed their limits talk went ambiguous abstractions passed as facts a euphemistic language asserted itself selfbudgeted autonomous and compartmentalized needtoknow basis and ad hoc utilization of agency resources coopting of agencyaligned pharmacological sources on a cashandcarry basis without divulging the destination of the merchandise they sealed the deal with elliptical rhetoric he let stanton think he devised most of the plan kemper skimmed his newspaper he noticed a pagefour banner grisly causeway discovery an arsoned chevy collapses a rickety wooden dock rolando cruz and cйsar salcido are along for the dip authorities believe the killings of cruz and salcido may be connected to the slayings of four other cubans in coral gables late last night kemper flipped back to page one a single paragraph stood out although the dead men were rumored to be heroin traffickers no narcotics were found on the premises be prompt pete and be as smart and farsighted as i think you are o o o pete showed up early carrying a large paper bag he didnt check out the women by the pool or walk up with his usual swagger kemper slid a chair out pete saw the herald on the table folded to the pageone headline kemper said you pete put the bag on the table fulo and me both jobs thats right whats in the bag fourteen point six pounds of uncut heroin and a diamond ring kemper fished the ring out the stones and gold setting were beautiful pete poured a cup of coffee keep it to consecrate my marriage to the agency thanks i may be popping a question with it soon i hope she says yes did hoffa yeah he did he put a condition on the deal which i fucking fulfilled as im sure you already know kemper nudged the bag you could have unloaded it yourself i wouldnt have said anything im along for the ride and for now im enjoying it too much to fuck with your agenda which is compartmentalization kemper smiled thats the biggest word ive ever heard you use i read books to teach myself english i must have read the websters unabridged dictionary at least ten times youre an immigrant success story go fuck yourself but before you do it tell me my official cia duties kemper twirled the ring sunlight made the diamonds twinkle youll be nominally running the blessington campsite theres some additional buildings and a landing strip going up and youll be supervising the construction your assignment is to train cuban refugees for amphibious sabotage runs into cuba and to funnel them to other training sites the cabstand and miami for general gainful employment pete said it sounds too legal pool water splashed at their feet his suite upstairs was almost kennedysized boyd eisenhower has given the agency a tacit mandate to covertly undermine castro the outfit wants their casinos back nobody wants a communist dictatorship ninety miles off the florida coast tell me something i dont know ikes budget allocation came in a little low tell me something interesting kemper poked the bag a tiny trace of white powder puffed out i have a plan to refmance our part of the cuban cause its implicitly agencyvetted and i think it will work im getting the picture but i want to hear you say it kemper lowered his voice we link up with santo trafficante we utilize his narcotics connections and my cadre as pushers and sell this dope santos dope and all the other dope we can get our hands on in miami the agency has access to a poppy farm in mexico and we can buy some freshprocessed stuff there and have chuck rogers fly it in we finance the cause with the bulk of the money give trafficante a percentage as operating tribute and send a small percentage of the dope into cuba with our blessington men theyll distribute it to our onisland contacts who will sell it and use the money to purchase weapons your specific job is to supervise my cadre and make sure they sell only to negroes you make sure my men dont use the dope themselves and keep their profit skim at a minimum pete said whats our percentage petes response was utterly predictable we dont take one if trafficante approves my plan well get something much sweeter which youre not going to talk about now im meeting trafficante in tampa this afternoon ill let you know what he says and in the meantime if trafficante says yes well get going in a week or so in the meantime you drive down to blessington and check things out meet the cadre and tell mr hughes that youll be taking some prolonged florida vacations pete smiled hell be pissed you know how to get around that if im working up in miami whos going to run the campsite kemper got out his address book go see guy banister in new orleans tell him we need a tough white man to run the camp a shitkicker type who can handle the crackers around blessington guy knows every rightwing hardcase on the gulf coast tell him we need a man whos not too insane and willing to move to south florida pete wrote banisters number on a napkin youre convinced all this is going to work im certain just pray that castro doesnt go prous thats a nice sentiment from a kennedy man jack would appreciate the irony pete cracked his knuckles jimmy thinks you should tell jack to put a leash on bobby never and i want to see jack elected president and i will not intercede with the kennedys to help hoffa i keep things compartmentalized i know kemper held the ring up stanton wants me to help influence jacks cuban policy we want the cuban problem to extend pete hopefully into a kennedy administration pete cracked his thumbs jacks got a nice head of hair but i dont see him as president of the united states qualifications dont count all ike did was invade europe and look like your uncle pete stretched his shirttail slid up over two revolvers whatever happens im in this is too fucking big to pass up o o o his rentacar came with a discreet dashboard jesus kemper slipped the ring over its head the air conditioner died outside miami a radio concert kept his mind off the heat a virtuoso played chopin kemper replayed the scene at pavillon jack played peacemaker and smoothed things out old joes freeze thawed out nicely they stayed for one awkward drink bobby sulked ava gardner was plain flummoxed she had no idea what the scene meant joe sent him a note the next day it closed with laura deserves a man with balls laura said i love you that night he made up his mind to propose to her at christmas he could afford laura now he had three paychecks and two fulltime hotel suites he had a low sixfigure bankaccount balance and if trafficante says yes o o o trafficante understood abstract concepts selfbudgeted autonomous and compartmentalized amused him agencyaligned pharmacological sources made him laugh outright he wore a nubbyweave silk suit his office was turned out in blondwood danish modern he loved kempers plan he grasped its political thrust immediately the meeting extended a yesman served anisette and pastry their conversation veered in odd directions trafficante critiqued the big pete bondurant myth the paper bag by kempers feet went unmentioned the yesman served espresso and courvoisier vsop kemper marked the moment with a bow raul castro sent this in mr trafficante pete and i want you to have it as a symbol of our good faith trafficante picked up the bag he smiled at the weight and gave it a few little squeezes kemper swirled his brandy if castro is eliminated as a direct or indirect result of our efforts pete and i will insure that your contribution is recognized more importantly well try to convince the new cuban ruler to allow you mr giancana mr marcello and mr rosselli to regain control of your casinos and build new ones and if he refuses well kill him and what do you and pete want for all your hard work if cuba is liberated we want to split of the profits from the capri and nacional hotel casinos in perpetuity suppose cuba stays communist then we get nothing trafficante bowed ill talk to the other boys and

i got rammed for fourteen gs out of my fucking golf bag giancana and in april some friends of ours got clouted for eighty grand they had stashed in a locker you see right after these hits sal started spending new money butch and me just put it together sort of circumstantially littell went lightheaded his pulse went haywire kabikoff no sal wouldnt do something like that no he wouldnt montrose the loops the loop and the funds the fund but the two aint necessarily the same thing jules schiffrins with the fund but that dont mean hed roll over for a loan for you just because you shared spit way

got his car and punched it straight through a red light littell hit the ignition the car wouldnt starthis bug feed ran down the battery o o o he knew what hed find at sals house four ryeandbeers prepared him to break in and see it they tortured sal in his basement they stripped him and tied him to a ceiling pipe they hosed him and scorched him with jumper cables sal didnt talk giancana didnt know the name littell fat sid didnt know his name or what he looked like they might let sid go back to texas they might or might not kill him somewhere down the line they left a cable clamped to sals tongue voltage burned his face shiny black littell called fat sids hotel the desk clerk said mr kabikoff was inhe had two visitors just an hour ago littell said dont ring his room he stopped for two more ryeandbeers and drove over to see for himself they left the door unlocked they left sid in an overflowing bathtub they tossed a pluggedin tv set on top of him the water was still bubbling

telescope you looked lonesome all by yourself with no sheet pete stretched his head grazed the ceiling its sweet guy i thought you might like it whos paying for it everybody which means which means i own the land and the agency put up the buildings carlos marcello donated three hundred thousand for guns and sam giancana put up some money to buy off the state police the klan folks pay to enter and

keep telling me that thats because youre dealing with a higher type of person now that youre agency like evans point taken but offhand id say that that man has stronger anticommunist credentials than you do communisms bad for business dont pretend its anything more than that banister hooked his thumbs in his belt if you think that makes you sound worldly youre sadly mistaken yeah banister smiled too smug to live accepting communism is synonymous with promoting communism your old nemesis ward littell accepts communism and a friend of mine in chicago told me that mr hoover is building a procommunist profile on him based on his inactions more than his actions you see where being worldly and accepting gets you when the chips are down pete cracked some knuckles go get lockhart you know what boyd wants so explain it to him and from here on in shitcan the lectures banister flinched banister started to open his mouth pete went boo banister scurried out the hatch doubletime quick the

personal note j edgar hoover to howard hughes dear howard i greatly enjoyed peerless politicopundits piece in the october th issue of hushhush it was of course farfetched but subtract the purple prose and what remains is politically substantive lenny sands has certainly adapted to the hushhush style and as a fledgling propagandist he shows promise i found the subliminallyplanted plugs for the tiger kab kompany to be a nice little aside to the cognoscenti and especially enjoyed the lofty sentiments expressed by our pragmatist friend pierre bondurant all in all a most salutary issue warmest regards edgar document insert summary report john stanton to kemper boyd marked confidentialhand pouch deliver dear kemper a short note to keep you advised of some recent policy decisions you remain hard to reach so im sending this to you via courier first off our superiors are now more than ever convinced that the castro problem will extend although the presidents latest allocation came in low we have every hope that castros powers of persistence will loosen up the white house pursestrings to paraphrase our friend peerless poiticopundit nobody wants a communist dictatorship ninety miles from our shores i wish i could write reports like he writes yellow journalism mr dulles deputy director bissell and selected cubanexpert case officers are beginning to plan for an exile invasion in late or early it is assumed that by that date the agency will have a pool of at least ten thousand welltrained usbased exile troops to draw from and that public opinion will be strongly on our side the general idea is to launch an amphibious assault force backed by air cover from gulf coast campsitelaunch sites ill keep you abreast as plans develop further and you keep at our friend jack if this plan stays on hold until after january theres a chance hell be the man to approve it or scrap it since we last spoke eleven more banana barges have landed in florida and louisiana regional case officers have been assigned immigrant caseloads and are dispersing the men to various campsites many who decline regular agency assistance will be heading to miami ill be curious to see if our cadre latches on to any of them as im sure you know the blessington site is now ready to house troops formally i have approved the hiring of douglas frank lockhart to run the camp and i think it is time to rotate our cadre on a miamibusiness blessingtontraining axis put pete bondurant and chuck rogers on this immediately and have bondurant pouch deliver a report to me inside six weeks per our cadres miami business and in keeping with our elliptical way of discussing it ill state that im glad profits seem to be growing and that the agreement you reached with our agencyfriendly source in mexico seems to be flourishing i envision a time when our superiors will vet this business as good common sense but until anticastro rancor or whatever reaches that point i must stress absolute compartmentalization and secrecy mr trafficantes participation must remain secret and i would not want it generally known that mr s giancana and mr c marcello have also contributed to the cause keep me posted and burn this communique all best john document insert summary report kemper boyd to robert f kennedy dear bob i had a talk with james dowd the head of the organized crime section at the department of justice i knew him when he was with the us attorneys office as a courtesy i had sent mr dowd carbons of the paperwork i forwarded to various grand juries seeking hoffa evidence and now that courtesy seems to be bringing results as you know the landrumgriffin labor reform bill passed congress so now the republicandominated justice department has a clear get hoffa mandate dowd has deployed investigators and assistantcounsels to grand jury investigatory bodies in ohio louisiana and florida the mcclellan committee spawned landrumgriffin everyone knows it dowd has seen the political light and has decided to concentrate his energy on our sun valley evidence he thinks the two missing witnessesgretzler and kirpaski give it a moral weight as of he had assigned six men to serve with three south florida grand juries they are actively seeking disgruntled teamsters who had purchased sun valley property dowd thinks the get hoffa process will be grindingly attenuated which suits our political purposes to a degree my strongest sense is that we do not want get hoffa rancor to go too bipartisan and we do want jack to stand out as the antilabor corruption candidate dowd told me that he expects hoffa to barnstorm primary election states and deluge voters with antikennedy sentiment and i think this may play into our hands as hard as he sometimes tries to hide it under duress hoffa always comes off as a psychopathic thug we want the teamsters to endorse the republican candidate we want richard nixon to take hoffas money and sidestep labor corruption as an issue in the general election that said i think it is imperative that jack redouble his efforts to woo legitimate labor leaders and convince them that he differentiates them from hoffaites im shifting my emphasis now to the primaries the kennedy crime fighter image has impressed many of my normallyrepublican law enforcement acquaintances and im working my way through wisconsin new hampshire and west virginia county by county your local organizations seem sound and ive told each and every volunteer ive met to keep their ears down for hoffa barnstorming scuttlebutt more later write your book i think it could be a valuable campaign tool yours kemper document insert memorandum robert f kennedy to kemper boyd kemper thanks for the note youre starting to think politically and i think your hoffarepublican observations were quite astute im glad the justice department has focused on sun valley which i have always considered our strongest hoffa case ive always believed that illegallyprocured pension fund money the spooky million financed hoffas sun valley investment and that hoffa skimmed a large amount off the top some pension fund leads andor intelligence on the possibility of real pension fund books would do us a lot of good now whats the chicago phantom been doing youve always portrayed this anonymous jesuit crusader as quite a worker but you havent forwarded a phantom report to me in months bob document insert note kemper boyd to robert f kennedy dear bob i agree we certainly could use some pension fund leads now the phantom is working hard but hes run up against one brick wall after another and keep in mind hes an fbi agent with a full load of regular duties hes persisting but as ive said before its very slow going kemper document insert l fbi field surveillance report chicago special agentincharge charles leahy to j edgar hoover marked extremely confidentialdirectors eyes only sir per your request agents coopted from the sioux city office have kept sa ward j littell under spot surveillance since he has not been observed in the vicinity of celanos tailor shop and he has apparently refrained from covert antiorganized crime activity he has not been seen with sa kemper boyd and the initiated tap on his home telephone indicates that he speaks only to helen agee with occasional calls to his exwife margaret he does not call or receive calls from his daughter susan and since the tap initiation date sa boyd has not called him littells work performance has steadily deteriorated this decline was in effect before the spot tails were initiated assigned to surveil cpusa members in hyde park and rogers park littell frequently abandons his surveillance positions to drink in taverns or visit various catholic churches littells red squad reports have been slipshod he regularly misrepresents the hours he spends on his assignments and his comments on cpusa members can only be considered overly charitable on sa wr hinckle observed cpusa cell leader malcolm chamales accost littell outside his apartment building chamales accused littell of fbi black bag chicanery and challenged him to respond littell invited chamales to a tavern sa hinckie observed them engaged in a political discussion they met again on and sa hinckle observed both meetings and believes the two men are becoming friends or at least drinking companions bureaufriendly university of chicago sources have reported that sa littell and helen agee have been seen on campus arguing heatedly their affair appears to be strained and miss agee was overheard urging littell to seek help for his drinking problem on ba js burtler observed littell and miss agee engage in a political discussion miss agee expressed admiration for vicepresident richard nixon littell referred to mr nixon as tricky dick and called him a redbaiting slushfund financed cryptofascist in conclusion a procommunist profile of littell is now being compiled i believe that his subversive statements treasonous red squad omissions and friendship with malcolm chamales will continue and comprise a damaging security risk portrait respectfully charles leahy sac chicago office document insert field report pete bondurant to kemper boyd for forwarding to john stanton marked kbbe careful how you transmit this kb sorry this report stanton wanted is late i dont like writing things down so cross out what you want and get it to him make sure stanton destroys it i know he thinks the agency will go along with what were doing somewhere down the line but that might be a long time my klan workers finished up the dock and the speedboat launchsite blessingtons now operational dougie frank lockhart is solid hes got the usual crazy ideas that guys in his line of work have but thats just the way things are amp i dont think its too bad if it doesnt interfere with his job his fbi contact was pissed that he wont be snitching those rival kkxs in louisiana but he changed his tune when lockhart told him you were heading up the operation my guess is that he checked with hoover who told him you have carte blanche lockhart has done a good job so far i got some from trafficante for him amp hes used it to start up his own klan outside blessington he handed out signing bonuses and all the local klan guys quit their old klans to sign on with dougie frank ive told him you want no lynchings church bombings or beatings hes disappointed but going along lockhart gets along with cubans amp has told his klan guys not to stir up any racial trouble with the cadre or our trainees so far the guys have gone along with his orders our miami business is good and getting better last months gross at the booker t washington housing project was higher than the trafficante organizations best month ever the october gross at the george washington carver project was higher than sts best chuck rogers says the men at the mexican ranch are solid they set up a deal where he can fly in amp out without filing flight logs with the mex state police weve got a landing strip at blessington now so chuck can make the pickup runs that much safer ive been driving the split money to st in tampa every week hes pleased with his profits and has been dishing out bonus to the cadre regularly hes been kicking back directly to me to funnel into the cause and to a gun fund that guy banister has set up in new orleans so far fulo chuck paez obregon delsol amp gutierrez have been completely honest there have been no shortages of merchandise or stanton wanted fitness reports on the men my feeling is that until somebody steals merchandise or or punks out on a job they all deserve a ratings obregons a little gunshy about speedboat runs into cuba amp his cousin delsol is a little shifty but so far this is just minor stuff what matters is that these are prous anticastro diehards who dont steal from trafficante i say let them bootjack fares at the cabstand and blow off steam with booze and whores i say you cant snap theirleashes too hard or theyll get antsy as recruiters theyre not bad weve got bunks at blessington amp theyve been keeping them filled up chuck fulo lockhart amp me have been training the men in day cycles we teach small arms riflery handtohand combat amp speedboat sabotage techniques then funnel the men to miami with job leads the men recruit there amp send their own prospects to a case officer codenamed bkcougar who sends them to one of the agcybacked resident training camps according to bunkavailability if this invasion you told me about ever comes off we should have a surplus of welltrained soldiers to pick from paez obregon delsol gutierrez fulo amp me have all made night speedboat runs into cuba weve dropped off merchandise with our onisland contacts amp gunned down some militia patrol boats fulo amp gutierrez made a run amp saw some militiamen sleeping on the beach they killed all with tommy guns fulo scalped the ranking officer amp now flies the scalp on the radio antenna of our lead boat like you wanted im spreading myself between blessington our miami business amp the cabstand jimmy hoffa is sort of pissed that youre pals with the kennedys but hes pleased with the lease deal amp the more cuban immigrants that hit miami the more tiger kab makes and thanks for the merchandise you gave me for hh since im in florida all the time i guess that that stuff is whats keeping me on his payroll id quit but i know you want to cultivate some kind of agcy connection with him i call him once a week to keep my hand in hh says hes got mormons looking after him now theyre helping him dodge the twa process servers amp doing the work i used to except for procuring merchandise i think that as long as i can supply that ill draw an la paycheck lenny sands is editing hushhush singlehandedly i thought that quban piece he wrote was pretty good amp got some good plugs in for the cause thats it i dont like writing things down so tell stanton to destroy this viva la causa pb blessington lockhart put his feet up on the dashboard his fiberfill santa claus suit had him sweating you wont let me bomb churches or kill niggers now what about enforcing the klan moral kode pete played indougie frank was good for yuks whats that well you get word joe rednecks sister sally has eyes for leroy with the rumored inch hog leg and you catch them at it you heat up your kkk branding iron and mark sally as a race mixer what about leroy you ask him where he got his and do they make them that size in white

no he doesnt know littells name and ive got him cowed pretty good a tiki torch lit their table boyd flickered in and out of this weird little glow i dont see how this concerns you pete it concerns jimmy hoffa hes tied to us on the cuban thing and jimmy is the fucking pension fund boyd drummed the table littell is fixated on the chicago mob and the fund it doesnt touch on our cuban work and i dont think we owe jimmy a warning and i dont want you to talk to lenny sands about this hes not conversant on the topic and you dont need to trouble him with it it was vintage boyd needtoknow basis straight down the line we dont have to warn jimmy but ill say this loud and clear jimmy hired me to clip anton gretzler and i dont want littell to burn me for it hes already made me for the job and hes just crazy enough to go public with it mr hoover or no mr hoover boyd twirled his martini stick you clipped roland kirpaski too no jimmy clipped him himself boyd whistledtrиs trиs casual pete got up in his face you cut littell too much slack you make fucking allowances for him that you shouldnt we both lost brothers pete let it go at that the line didnt compute boyd talked on these weird levels sometimes pete leaned back are you watchdogging littell how tight a leash are you keeping on him i havent been in touch with him in months ive been distancing myself from him and mr hoover why just an instinct like an instinct for survival more of a homing instinct you move away from some people and you move toward the people of the moment like the kennedys yes pete laughed ive hardly seen you since jack hit the trail you wont be seeing me at all until after the election stanton knows i cant be dividing my time he should know he hired you to get next to the kennedys he wont regret it i dont it means i get to run the cadre solo can you handle it can niggers dance they surely can pete sipped his beer it was flathe forgot he ordered it you said election like you think the jobs going through to november im reasonably certain it will jacks ahead in new hampshire and wisconsin and if we get past west virginia i think hell go all the way then i hope hes anticastro he is hes not as voluble as richard nixon but then dicks a redbaiter from way back president jack jesus christ boyd signaled a waiter a fresh martini hit the table quick its seduction pete hell back the country into a corner with his charm like its a woman when america sees that its a choice between jack and twitchy old dick nixon who do you think theyll get between the sheets with pete raised his beer viva la causa viva badback jack they clinked glasses boyd said hell get behind the cause and if the invasion goes we want it to be in his administration pete lit a cigarette im not worried about that put littell aside and theres only one thing to be worried about youre concerned that the agency at large will find out about our cadre business thats right boyd said i want them to find out in fact im going to inform them some time before november its inevitable that they will find out and by the time they do my kennedy connection will make me too valuable to dismiss the cadre will have recruited too many good men and have made too much money and as far as morality goes how does selling heroin to negroes rate when compared to illegally invading an island more vintage boyd selfbudgeted autonomous and dont worry about littell hes trying to accrue evidence to send to bobby kennedy but i monitor all the information that bobby sees and i will not let littell hurt you at all or hurt jimmy for the kirpaski killing or anything else related to you or the cause but sooner or later bobby will take hoffa down and i do not want you to meddle in it pete felt his head swim i cant argue with any of that but ive got a pipeline to littell now and if i think your boy needs a scare im going to scare him and i cant argue with that you can do whatever you have to do as long as you dont

are so you kennedy was addressing civil rights littell hit the off switch in middiscourse lenny waved goodbye ta jack my brotherinlaw in the best of all possible worlds if i liked girls and you had the profile in courage to acknowledge my dear friend laura that that gorgeously cruel mr boyd drove out of my life littell moved toward him lenny dont you fucking come any closer or try to touch me or try to assuage your pathetic guilt or in any way mess with my gorgeous percodan high or i wont spill my lead on the teamster pension fund books that ive had all along you sad excuse for a policeman littell stiffarmed a chair his fingers ripped through the fabric he started weaving on his feet just like lenny the bookcase shimmied lenny was weaving on his heels doped up and punchdrunk jules schiffrin keeps the books someplace in lake geneva hes got an estate there and hes got the books in safes or in safedeposit boxes at some banks around there i know because i played a gig there and i heard jules and johnny rosselli talking dont ask for details because i dont have any and concentrating makes my head hurt his arm slid the chair slid behind it littell stumbled up against the tv console why are you telling me this because youre a tiny smidgen better than mr beast and mr boyd and in my opinion mr boyd only wants the information for its profit potential and besides i took a beating for doing some work for mr sam lenny and mr sam said hed make a powerful man crawl for it but i said please dont do that lenny and jules schiffrin was with him and they were talking about somebody called irish joe back in the s and how they made these movie extra girls crawl lenny come on and it all felt so ugly that i popped a few more percs and here i am and if im lucky i wont remember all this in the morning littell stepped closer lenny slapped and scratched and flailed and kicked him away the bookcase fell lenny tripped and weaved out the door law texts hit the floor a framed photograph of helen agee shattered o o o littell drove to lake geneva he arrived at midnight and checked in at a motel off the interstate he paid cash in advance and registered under a fake name the phone book in his room listed jules schiffrin his address was marked rural free delivery littell checked a local map and pegged it a woodland estate near the lake he drove out and parked off the road binoculars got him in close he saw a stonework mansion on a minimum of ten acres trees enclosed the property there were no walls or fences no floodlamps two hundred yards from the door to the roadway alarm tape bracketing the front windows no guard hut and no gate the wisconsin state police probably kept watch on an informal basis lenny said safes or safedeposit boxes lenny said mr boydinformationprofit potential lenny was drugged up but lucid his mr boyd line was easy to decode kemper was chasing fund leads independently littell drove back to his motel he checked the yellow pages and found listings for nine local banks discreet behavior would cloak his lack of sanction kemper boyd always stressed boldness and discretion kemper shook down lenny on his own the revelation didnt shock him at all o o o he slept until he checked a map and saw that the banks were all within walking distance the first four managers cooperated their replies were direct mr schiffrin does not rent with us the next two managers shook their heads their replies were direct our facilities do not include safedeposit boxes manager number seven asked to see a bank writ it was no great loss the name schiffrin sailed past him unrecognized banks number eight and nine no safedeposit boxes on the premises there were several major cities nearby there were two dozen small towns spread out in a hundredmile radius safedeposit box access was a pipe dream safes meant onsite placement safealarm companies retained placement diagramsand did not release them without suit for legal cause lenny played an onsite engagement he might have seen the safe or safes firsthand lenny was too combustible to approach now but jack ruby was a probable schiffrin acquaintance jack ruby was bribable and acquiescent littell found a pay phone a longdistance operator patched him through to dallas ruby picked up on the third ring this is the carousel club where your entertainment dollar goes its me jack your friend from chicago fuck this is grief i dont he sounded flummoxed flabbergasted and dyspeptically peeved how well do you know jules schiffrin jack casual i know jules casual at best why why why

famous guy like you rosselli said if jack is elected bobby will fade into the woodwork my bet is hell run for governor of massachusetts and raymond patriarca and the boston boys will have to worry about him santo junior said that will never happen old joe and raymond go too far back and when push comes to shove its joe who hands down the lawnot jack or bobby hoffa said its the handing down of grand jury indictments that bothers me my lawyer said the sun valley thing is unlikely to go my way which means indictments by the end of the year so dont make joe kennedy sound like jesus handing god

road bisected two fencedoff pastures clouds covered the moonvisibility was close to nil littell pulled over and stuffed his money in a grocery bag it was ruby was late littell turned off his headlights clouds skittered by the moon lit up a huge shape walking toward the car the windshield exploded the dashboard fell on his lap a steel bar cracked the steering wheel and ripped the gearshift out hands jerked him across the hood glass ripped through his cheeks and lodged in his mouth hands dumped him in a ditch hands picked him up and pinioned him against a barbedwire fence he was dangling steel barbs pierced his clothes and held him upright the monster ripped his holster off the monster hit him and hit him and hit him the fence shook twisty metal gouged his backside down to the bone he coughed up blood and chunks of glass and a big piece of a chevy hood ornament he smelled gasoline his car exploded a heat blast singed his hair the fence collapsed he looked up and saw clouds ignite document insert fbi memorandum milwaukee special agentincharge john campion to director j edgar hoover sir our investigation into the nearfatal assault on sa ward littell is proceeding but making scant headway primarily due to sa littells poor attitude and lack of cooperation agents from both the milwaukee and chicago offices canvassed lake geneva for eyewitnesses to the assault and for witnesses to littells general presence in the area and were unable to locate any chicago sac leahy informed me that littell was under loose survefflance for matters pertaining to internal bureau security and that on two recent occasions may th and may th the agents mobiletailing littell lost him on roadways leading north to the wisconsin border the nature of littells business in the lake geneva area is thus far unknown per investigatory specifics the assault occurred on a rural access road four miles southeast of lake geneva brush marks in the dirt near the remains of littells car indicate that the assailant obliterated all traces of his tire tracks rendering forensic casting impossible littells car was burned with a highlyflammable nitrous gas compound of the type used in the manufacture of military explosives such compounds burn themselves out very quickly and are used because they minimize the risk of decimating the area surrounding the target the assailant obviously has military experience andor access to military ordnance forensic analysis revealed the presence of charred us currency laced with paper bag fragments the aggregate weight of the fragments indicates that littell was carrying a large amount of money in a grocery sack farmers rescued littell who was pinned to a downed section of barbedwire fence he was taken to overlander hospital near lake geneva and treated for a massive series of posterior cuts and lacerations broken ribs contusions a broken nose broken collarbone internal hemorrhaging and facial gouges caused by contact with windshield glass littell checked out against medical advice fourteen hours later and engaged a taxi cab to drive him to chicago chicago office agents assigned to loosetail litteil saw him entering his apartment building he collapsed in the entry hail and the agents interceded on their own authority and drove him to saint catherines hospital littell remains at the hospital he is listed in good condition and will most likely be released within a week a supervising physician told agents that the scarring on his face and backside will be permanent and that he should slowly recover from his other injuries agents have repeatedly queried littell on three topics his presence in lake geneva the presence of the burned money and enemies who might want to hurt him litteil stated that he was in lake geneva scouting retirement property and denied the presence of the money he said that he had no enemies and considered the assault a case of mistaken identity when asked about cpusa members who might be seeking vengeance on him for his bureau red squad work litteil replied are you kidding those commies are all nice guys agents have surmised that litteil has made at least two trips to lake geneva his name has not appeared on any hotel or motel ledgers so we are assuming he either registered under assumed names or stayed with friends or acquaintances littells responsethat he took catnaps in his oarwas not convincing the investigation continues i respectfully await orders john campion special agentincharge milwaukee office document insert fbi memorandum chicago sac charles leahy to director j edgar hoover sir per sa ward j littell please be informed sa littell is now back on light duty and has been assigned to review federal deportation briefs in conjunction with the us attorneys office work which utilizes the writanalysis expertise he developed in law school he refuses to discuss the assault with other agents and as sac campion may have told you we have yet to find witnesses to his lake geneva visits helen agee told agents that littell has not discussed the assault with her i personally questioned ba court meade littells only friend in the chicago office and have the following to report ameade states that in late and early following his expulsion from the top hoodlum program littell loitered near the tep listening post and expressed interest in the squads work that interest dissipated meade stated and he further surmised that it is extremely unlikely that littell engaged in antimob actions on his own meade scoffed at the notion that the chicago mob was responsible for the assault or that leftwingers surveffied by littell were seeking vengeance for his red squad efforts meade thinks that littells marked bent for young women as evinced by his continuing affair with helen agee was the motive for the assault meade colorfully stated go back up to wisconsin and look for some idealisticallyinclined girl with nasty brothers who didnt take kindly to sis consorting with a fortysevenyearold boozehound gman or no gman i find this theory plausible blittells bureau arrest record going back to was checked with an eye toward uncovering recently paroled felons perhaps inclined toward vengeance a list of twelve men was compiled and all twelve were alibicleared i recalled litteils arrest of one pierre pete bondurant and how the man taunted littell during detainment procedures agents checked bondurants whereabouts during the assault time frame and confirmed that he was in florida the procommunist profile of littell continues to develop litteli remains a confirmed friend of longterm subversive mal chamales and phone tap logs now pinpoint a total of nine littellchamales telephone conversations all of which contain lengthy expressions of littells sympathy for leftwing causes and expressions of his disdain for fbi witch hunting on may th i called littell and ordered him to implement immediate lockstep surveillance on mal chamales five minutes later litteil called chamales and warned him chamales addressed a socialist labor party meeting that afternoon littell and a trusted bureau informant attended unknown to each other the informant presented me with a verbatim transcript of chamales seditious virulently antibureau antihoover remarks littells may th report on the meeting called these remarks noninflammatory the report was filled with numerous other outright lies and distortions of a treasonous nature sir i believe it is now time to confront littell on both his lack of cooperation in the assault matter and more pertinently on his recent seditious actions will you please respond i think this demands immediate action respectfully charles leahy document insert fbi memorandum director j edgar hoover to chicago sac charles leahy mr leahy per ward

been avoiding me for some time kb i wouldnt put it that way sir jeh of course you wouldnt youd put it in a way calculated to minimize my rancor the question is would you have contacted me if i hadnt contacted you kb yes sir i would have jeh before or after the coronation of king jack the first kb i wouldnt call the coronation a sure thing sir jeh does he have a delegate majority kb almost i think hell be nominated on the first ballot jeh and you think hell win kb yes im reasonably certain jeh i cant dispute that big brother and america have all the earmarks of a fatuous love affair kb he is

of eight years while i shall remain in office until the millennium kb ill keep that in mind sir jeh i would advise you to you should also be advised that my interest in big brother extends beyond the confines of wishing to keep my job unlike you i have altruistic concerns such as the internal security of our nation unlike you my primary concern is not selfpreservation and monetary advancement unlike you i do not credit the ability to dissemble as my single greatest skill kb yes sir jeh allow me to interpret your reluctance to contact me were you afraid i would ask you to introduce big brother to bureaufriendly women kb yes and no sir jeh meaning kb meaning little brother doesnt entirely trust me meaning the primary campaign schedule was hectic and only left me time to procure local call girls meaning i might have been able to house big brother in hotel rooms with standing bureau bugs but little brother has been around law enforcement for years and he just might know that coopt bugs like that exist jeh i always reach a certain point with you kb meaning jeh meaning i dont know whether or not youre lying and to one degree or another i dont care kb thank you sir jeh youre

ninetyfive pounds apiece you had their exact location memorized final checks your new motel room outside beloit safely rented the newspaper piece on schiffrins art collection clipped out to leave at the crime scene littell took a deep breath and downed three quick shots his nerves fluttered and almost leveled out he checked his face in the bathroom mirror one last look for courage o o o low clouds covered the moon littell drove to the halfmileout point it was he had two hours and thirteen minutes to get clear a state police cruiser passed him eastbound on time the standard perimeter check littell swung off the pavement hardpacked dirt grabbed his tires he hit his brights and slalomed downhill the slope evened out he brodied his back wheels to obliterate tread marks trees dotted the clearinghis car couldnt be seen from the road he killed the lights and grabbed his duffel bag he saw house lights due west uphilla faint directional glow to work off of he walked toward it leaf clumps obscured his footprints the glow expanded every few seconds he hit the driveway adjoining the carport schiffrins eldorado brougham was gone he ran to the library window and crouched low an inside lamp provided hazy light to work by he got out his tools and snipped two wires taped to a storm drain an exterior arc light sputtered he saw alarm tape bracketing the window glassmounted between two thick panes he gauged the circumference he cut magnettape strips to cover it he stuck them to the outside glass in a nearperfect outline his legs ached cold sweat stung some shaving cuts he ran a magnet over the tape he traced a circle inside the outline with his glass cutter the glass was thickit took two hands and all his weight to notch a groove no alarms went off no lights flashed he gouged circles in the glass no sirens whirred no general pursuit noise went down his arms burned his blade went sharp to dull his sweat froze and made him shiver the outside pane broke he tucked his sleeves inside his gloves and bore down harder twentynine minutes elapsed elbow pressure snapped the inside pane littell kicked the frame glass out to make a crawl space he vaulted inside the fit was tightglass shards cut him down to the skin the library was oakpaneled and furnished with green leather chairs the side walls featured artwork one matisse one cezanne one van gogh floor lamps gave him lightjust enough to do the job by he arranged his tools he found the safes wallpanelrecessed two feet apart he covered every inch of wall space with triplethick acoustical baffling he hammered it down tightfivepenny nails into highvarnished oak he xmarked the sections covering the safes he put on his goggles and stuffed in his earplugs he loaded his shotgun and let fly one round two roundshuge contained explosions three rounds four roundspadding chunks and hardwood decomposing littell reloaded and fired reloaded and fired reloaded and fired wood chips sliced his face muzzle smoke had him retching visibility was zero mulch slammed up against his goggles littell reloaded and fired reloaded and fired reloaded and fired fortyodd rounds took the wall and rear ceiling beams down wood and plaster crashed secondstory furniture dropped down and shattered two safes fell out of the rubble littell kicked through itplease god let me breathe he vomited splinters and scotch he coughed up gunsmoke and black phlegm he dug through wood heaps and lugged the safes over to his duffel bag seventytwo minutes elapsed the library was blasted through to the dining room fortyodd explosions toppled the artwork the cezanne was intact the matisse bore slight frame damage the van gogh was pelletshredded nothingness littell dropped the newspaper clip littell lashed the duffel to his back with curtain strips littell grabbed the paintings and ran out the front door pure air made him go lightheaded he gulped it in and ran he slid on leaves and bounced off trees his bladder went nothing ever felt so good he stumbled hunched over double two hundred pounds of steel kept him plummeting downhill he fell his body went rubberhe couldnt stand up or lift the duffel bag he crawled and dragged it the rest of the way he loaded his car and fishtailed up to the access road heaving for breath the whole time he caught his face in the rearview mirror the word heroic came up short o o o he took switchbacks northnorthwest he found his preselected detonation spot a forest clearing outside prairie du chien he lit the clearing with three big coleman lanterns he burned the paintings and scattered the ashes he crimped the butt ends of six sticks of dynamite and slid them up against the safe dialhousings he strung fuses a hundred yards out and lit a match the safes blew the doors shot all the way up to the tree line a breeze scattered scorched piles of currency littell sifted through them the blast destroyed at least a hundred thousand dollars undamaged three large ledger books wrapped in plastic littell buried the scraps of money and dumped the safe sections in a sewage stream adjoining the clearing he drove to his new motel and obeyed all speed limits en route o o o three ledgers two hundred pages per unit crosscolumn notations on each page squared off in a standard bookkeeping style huge figures listed left to right littell laid the books out on the bed his first instinct the amounts exceeded all possible compilations of monthly or yearly pension fund dues the two brown leather ledgers were coded the numberletter listings in the far lefthand column roughly corresponded in digit length to names thus ahwzyx one fiveletter first name and one sevenletter last name maybe the black leather ledger was uncoded it contained similarly large financial talliesand two and threeletter listings in the far lefthand column the listings might be lender or lendee initials the black book was subdivided into vertical columns they were realword designated loan and transfer littell put the black book aside his second instinct code breaking would not be easy he went back to the brown books he followed symbol names and figures and watched money accrue horizontally neatly doubled sums told him the pension fund repayment rate a usurious he spotted letter repetitionsin fourtosixletter increments most likely a simple date code a for b for something told him it was just that simple he matched letters to numbers and extrapolated fund loan profiteering went back thirty years the letters and numbers ascended left to rightstraight up to early the average amount lent was million with repayment fees million the smallest loan was the largest was million numbers growing left to right multiplications and divisions in the far righthand columnsodd percentage calculations he extrapolated the odd numbers were loan investment profits tallied in over and above payback interest eyestrain made him stop three quick shots of scotch refueled him he got a brainstorm look for hoffas sun valley skim money he scanned columns with a pencil he linked the dots mid to mid and ten symbols to spell jimmy hoffa he found and hypothetically bobby kennedys spooky three million he found five symbols six and five in a perfectly intersecting column james riddle hoffa hoffa laughed off the sun valley charges with valid assurance his chicanery was very well cloaked littell skimmed the books and picked out odd totals tiny zeros extendedthe fund was billionaire rich double vision set in he corrected it with a magnifying glass he quickscanned the books again identical numbers kept recurringin fourfigure brackets over and over littell went through the brown books page by page he found twentyone sincluding two next to the spooky three million quick addition gave him a total fortynine million dollars lent out or borrowed mr was wellheeled either way he checked the black book initial column it was alphabetically arranged and entered in jules schiffrins neat block printing it was am he had five hours of study in the loan subhead tweaked him he saw be straight down the graphthe numberletter code decoded to he extrapolated the initials tagged pension fund lendersrepaid at a fat but not brutal rate he checked the transfer column the listings were strictly uniform initials and six digits no more he extrapolated the initials were bank account numbersrepaid mobster money laundered clean said initials all ended in bmost likely short for the word branch littell copied over letters on a scratch pad boabhb bank of america beverly hills branch hsalmbb home savings amp loan miami beach branch it worked he was able to form known bank names out of every set of letters he jumped columns tracing right there on the money jpk srjsfnbb sfn meant securityfirst national bb could mean buffalo branch boston branch or other bcity branches the sr probably denoted a senior why the added designation just above jpk sr jpk boadb the man was a piker compared to he lent the fund a paltry million the added sr was simply to distinguish the lender from someone with the same initials jpk sr sfnbb one filthyrich moneylending stop stop right there jpk sr joseph p kennedy senior bb for boston branch august sid kabikoff talking to mad sal i knew jules way back whenwhen he was selling dope and using the profits to finance movies with rko back when joe kennedy owned it stop make the call impersonate a bureau hardon and confirm it or refute it littell dialed he dripped sweat all over the telephone an operator came on what number please i want the securityfirst national bank in boston massachusetts one moment sir ill look the number up and connect you littell held the line adrenaline hit he went dizzy and parched a man answered securityfirst national this is special agent johnson fbi let me speak to the manager please please hold ill transfer you littell heard connection clicks a man said this is mr carmody may i help you ththis is special agent johnson fbi i have an account number at your bank here and i need to know who it belongs to is this an official request its a sunday and im here overseeing our monthly inventory this is an official request i can get a bank writ but id rather not put you to the trouble of an inperson visit i see well i guess littell came on firm the number is the man sighed well uh the listings denote safedepositbox storage accounts so if youre interested in balance figures im afraid how many storage boxes are rented out to that account number well that account is quite familiar to me because of its size you see how many boxes an entire vault now of ninety can valuables be transferred directly into that vault from outside sources certainly they could be placed in the boxes sight unseen by second parties with access to the account holders password ninety stash boxes millions in moblaundered cash who does that account number belong to well shall i get a writ well i littell almost shouted it is the account holder joseph p kennedy sr well uh yes the senators father yes the senators the phone slipped out of his hand littell kicked it across the room the black book mr millionaire loan shark he went back over the numbers and confirmed it he triplechecked every digit until his vision blurred yes joe kennedy lent the fund sun valley seed money yes the fund lent the money out to james riddle hoffa sun valley constituted felony land fraud sun valley spawned two pete bondurant killings anton gretzler and roland kirpaski littell tracked s across paper he saw continuous commasand no cashout bottomline onetime profit joe

the deans of every university law school in the continental us should you go public with information pertaining to kemper boyds clandestine activities i will guarantee you that your daughter susan and helen agee will never practice law and guarantee that the interesting coincidence of your threeweek absence and the destruction of jules schiffrins lake geneva estate will be mentioned to key

attorney general designate robert f kennedy dear bob congratulations first of all youll make a splendid attorney general and i can envision jimmy hoffa and certain others swinging from yardarms already hoffa makes for a good segue point the purpose of this letter is to recommend former special agent ward j littell for a justice department counselship littell the chicago phantom who has worked for us subrosa since early is a bumma cum laude notre dame law grad federalbar licensed he is considered brilliant in the field of federal deportation statutes and will be bringing with him a good deal of recently accrued antimob antiteamster evidence i realize that littell in his anonymous capacity has been out of touch with you for some time and hope that that fact will not dampen your enthusiasm for him he is a splendid attorney and a dedicated crimefighter yours kemper document insert personal note robert f kennedy to kemper boyd dear kemper per ward littell my answer is emphatically no i have received a report from mr hoover that though perhaps biased persuasively paints a portrait of littell as an alcoholic with ultra leftwing tendencies mr hoover also included evidence that indicates that litteli was receiving bribes from chicago mob members this to me negates the viability of his alleged antimob antiteamster evidence i realize that littell is your friend and that he did work hard for us at one time franky though we cannot afford even the slightest taint on our new appointees lets consider the littell matter closed the question of your kennedy administration employment remains and i think youll be pleased with what the presidentelect and i have come up with best bob document insert personal letter j edgar hoover to kemper boyd dear kemper threefold congratulations one your recent evasion tactics were superbly efficacious two your marilyn monroe aside had me going for quite some time what a myth you have created with luck it will enter what hushhush would call the peephole pantheon thirdly bravo for your appointment as roving justice department counsel my contacts tell me youll be concentrating on voting rights abuse in the south how fitting now youll be able to champion leftinclined negroes with the same tenacity that you embrace rightwing cubans i think youve found your metier i would be hardpressed to conceive of work more suitable for a man with such a lenient code of loyalty i hope well get the chance to be colleagues again as always jeh new york city shed been crying tear streaks had ruined her makeup kemper stepped

februarynovember document insert memorandum kemper boyd to john stanton marked confidential hand pouch deliver john ive been subtly pressing little brother and a few white house aides for information and i am sad to report that as of this date the president is ambivalent about our invasion plans the imminent nature of the plans apparently has him waxing indecisive its obvious that he doesnt want to deal with something so pressing this early in his administration the president and attorney general kennedy have been briefed by director dufles and deputy director bissell little brother attends many highlevel presidential briefings it is obvious that he is becoming the presidents chief advisor on all urgent matters little brother to the consternation of some friends of ours remains fixated on organized crime and seems to be uninterested in the cuban issue my contacts tell me that the president hasnt updated him on the atready status of our invasion plans the blessington campsite stands preinvasion ready recruit training cycles have been suspended as of the fortyfour bunks have been filled with graduate troops culled from other induction camps men specifically trained in amphibious warfare tactics these men now stand as the blessington invasion force pete bondurant and douglas prank lockhart are putting them through rigorous daily maneuvers and report that their morale is very high i visited blessington last week to assess its atready status prior to mr bissells inspection im happy to report that pete and lockhart have whipped things into topflight shape landing crafts are now docked at camouflaged inlets built by laborers recruited from lockharts klan klavern chuck rogers gave ramon gutierrez a refresher flying course as part of a bondurantdevised plan to have gutierrez portray a castro defector and fly into blessington on invasion day with doctored anticastro atrocity photographs to be leaked to the press as genuine weapons and ammunition stand inventoried and atready an inlet a half mile from the campsite is being prepared to house the troopship that will carry the blessington invasion force it should be atready by i am now free to spend occasional time in florida chiefly because the brothers believe the falsehood that i established over a year ago that mr hoover has coerced me into spying on anticastro groups in the miami area my current justice department assignment investigating the accusations of negroes denied voting rights should have me sequestered in the south for some time i specifically requested this assignment because of its proximity to miami and blessington my southern background convinced little brother to give me the job and he has allowed me to choose my initial target districts i picked the area surrounding anniston alabama there are eight daily commercial flights to miami which should make job hopping just a matter of a ninetyminute plane ride should you need me call my service in dc or contact me directly at the wigwam motel outside anniston dont say what youre thinking i know its beneath me again let me stress the importance of obfuscating all agencyoutfit links to little brother i was as amazed and dismayed as our sicilian colleagues when big brother tapped him for ag his antioutfit fervor has if anythlng increased and we do not want him to learn that messrs cm sg and jr have donated money to the cause or that our cadre business even exists ill close now see you in blessington kb document insert memorandum john stanton to kemper boyd marked confidentialhand pouch deliver kemper i received your memo things sound excellent although i wish big brother wasnt waffling ive developed some new additions to our basic blessington invasion plan will you tell me what you think when we meet at the inspection ive assigned pete bondurant and chuck rogers to coordinate onsite blessington security and communications between blessington and other launch sites in nicaragua and guatemala rogers can fly between sites and i think pete will be especially effective as a roverpeacekeeper teo paez has brought in a new recruit nйstor javier chasco dob teo knew the man in havana when he was running a string of informants for united fruit chasco infiltrated numerous leftwing groups and once foiled an assassination attempt on a up executive when castro took over chasco infiltrated raul castros onisland heroin operation and siphoned dope to anticastro rebels who of course sold it and used the money to purchase weapons chasco is an experienced dope trafficker an expert interrogator and a cuban armytrained sharpshooter lent out by president batista to various south american government leaders teo says that chasco assassinated no less than fourteen leftist insurgents between the years and chasco who had been supporting himself by selling marijuana escaped cuba by speedboat last month he contacted paez in miami and begged him to find him procause work teo introduced him to pete bondurant and later described the meeting to me as love at first sight you were unreachable so pete contacted me and recommended nйstor chasco for immediate blessington and cadre employment i met chasco and was very impressed i hired the man immediately and had pete introduce him to the other cadre members paez told me that the meetings were amicable chasco is learning the cadre business ropes and doubling as a blessington drill instructor hell be shuffling between blessington miami and our formal facilities in guatemala and nicaraguaa case officer passing through blessington noted his training skills and put in an expedite personnel request directly to mr bissell youll meet chasco at the inspection i think youll be impressed too during the actual invasion time frame i want you and chasco to patrol the cadres miami business sites our onisland sources expect some invasion plan intelligence to leak to cuba and i want to make sure that local procastro groups dont try to hit us when they think were focusing solely on invasion logistics it should be easy for you to get away miami is annistonaccessible and you can tell little brother that mr h sent you in to monitor procastro activity ill close with an embarrassing request carlos m gave guy banister an additional gun money the man is a great friend to the cause and he has some very great and i think justified fears

offense did i say something funny mr bondurant no sir you didnt i didnt think so i was saying that president kennedy has been briefed several times but he still wont commit to an invasion date which i dont find amusing at all pete poured himself a beer stanton said mr dulles describes the president as enthusiastic but cautious bissell smiled our secret weapon is mr boyd here hes our kennedy confidante and i imagine that if push came to shove he could reveal his covert agency standing and then overtly advocate our invasion plan pete froze the moment boyd about to lose it six ways from sunday stanton stepped in mr bissells joking kemper i know that and i know that he understands how complex our alliances have become bissell fingered his napkin i do mr boyd and i know how generous mr hoffa mr marcello and a few other italian gentlemen have been to the cause and i know that you possess a certain amount of influence in the kennedy camp and as the presidents chief cubanissue liaison i also know that fidel castro and communism are a good deal worse than the mafia although i wouldnt dream of asking you to intercede on our friends behalf because it might cost you credibility with your sacred kennedys stanton dropped his soup spoon pete let a big breath out eeeasy boyd put out a big shiteating grin im glad you feel that way mr bissell because if you did ask me id have to tell

money prayer taught you to hate falsehood prayer gave you insight prayer was like a choke hold on mendacity you see the presidents face and see through it you see jimmy hoffa skate on sun valley chargesa newsman cites insufficient evidence you hold numbers to reverse that injustice you hold numbers to indict the kennedy seduction you can break the remaining fund code you can expose the robber baron and his son the priapic boy fьhrer littell got out his cryptography books three shots a night taught him this youre down but youre capable of anything washington dc bobby held the floor fourteen lawyers pulled chairs up and balanced notebooks and ashtrays on their knees the briefing room was drafty kemper leaned against the back wall with his topcoat slung over his shoulders the ag brayedthere was no need to get close he had free timea storm delayed his flight to alabama bobby said you know why i called you in and you know what your basic job is ive been tied up in red tape since the inauguration so i havent been able to get to the applicable case files and ive decided to let you do that on your own youre the organized crime unit and you know what your mandate is and ill be damned if im going to dawdle any longer the men got out pens and pencils bobby straddled a chair in front of them weve got lawyers and investigators of our own and any attorney worth his salt is also a catchascatchcan investigator weve got fbi agents we can utilize as needed if i can convince mr hoover to shift his priorities a bit hes still convinced that domestic communists are more dangerous than organized crime and i think that making the fbi more cooperative is going to be a major obstacle to overcome the men laughed an exmcclellan cop said we shall overcome bobby loosened his tie we shall and roving counsel kemper boyd whos spying from the peanut gallery will overcome racial exclusion practices in the south i wont ask mr boyd to join us because skulking at the back of the room is very much his modus operandi kemper waved im a spy bobby waved back the president has always contended that kemper laughed bobby halfass liked him nowbreaking off with laura clinched it claire

johnny rosselli and carlos marcello i want the irs files on these men pulled and i want the intelligence files of the chicago new york los angeles miami cleveland and tampa pds combed for mention of them i also want probablecause briefs written so that we can subpoena their financial books and personal records a man said what about hoffa specifically he got hungjuried on sun valley but theres got to be other approaches we can use bobby rolled up his sleeves a hung jury first time out means an acquittal next time ive given up hope of tracing the spooky three million and im starting to think that the socalled real pension fund books are nothing but a pipe dream i think we need to impanel grand juries and deluge them with hoffa evidence and while were at it i want to pass a federal law requiring all municipal pds to obtain justice department writs to implement their wiretaps so that we can have access to every bit of wiretap intelligence seized nationwide the men cheered an old mcclellanite threw some mock punches bobby stood up i found an old deportation order on carlos marcello he was born in tunis north africa of italian parents but hes got a phony guatemalan birth

literacy tests that the local registrars want them to fail littell smiled and im sure the kennedys will rig binding legal clauses to insure that every negro in alabama registers as a democrat you have to consider things like that in the early stages of building a dynasty kemper laughed the presidents civil rights policy isnt that cynically conceived is your application of it hardly ive always considered suppression illadvised and futile and you like the people yes i do your southern accents back in force it disarms the people i deal with they appreciate it that a southern white mans on their side youre grinning ward what is it littell sipped coffee it occurred to me that alabama is rather close to florida you were always quick does the attorney general know that youre moonlighting

eyes only speaking director j edgar hoover attorney general robert f kennedy rfk its bob kennedy mr hoover i was hoping i could have a few minutes of your time jeh certainly rfk there were a few matters of protocol i wanted to discuss jeh yes rfk communications to begin with i sent you a directive requesting carbons of all summary reports submitted by your top hoodlum program squads that directive was dated february th its now the nd of april and ive yet to see a single report jeh these directives take time to implement rfk six weeks seems like ample time to me jeh you perceive an undue delay i do not rfk will you expedite the implementation of that directive jeh certainly will you refresh my memory as to why you issued it rfk i want to assess every scrap of antimob intelligence the bureau acquires and share it where needed with the various regional grand juries that i hope to impanel jeh you may be acting injudiciously leaking information that could only have originated from thp sources might jeopardize thp informants and electronic survefflance placements rfk all such information will be evaluated from a security standpoint jeh that function should not be trusted to nonfbi personnel rfk i adamantly disagree youre going to have to share your information mr hoover the simple cultivation of intelligence will not bring organized crime to its knees jeh the top hoodlum program mandate does not provide for informationsharing to expedite grand jury indictments rfk then were going to have to revise it jeh i would consider that a rash and heedless act rfk consider it what you like and consider it done consider the top hoodlum program mandate superseded by my direct order jeh may i remind you of this simple fact you cannot prosecute the mafia and win rfk may i remind you that for many years you denied that the mafia existed may i remind you that the fbi is but one cog in the overall wheel of the justice department may i remind you that the fbi does not dictate justice department policy may i remind you that the president and i consider of the leftwing groups that the fbi routinely monitors to be harmless if not outright moribund and laughably inoffensive when compared to organized crime jeh may i state that i consider that burst of invective to be illconcelved and fatuous in its historical perspective rfk you may jeh was there anything of a similar or less offensive nature that you wish to add rfk yes you should know that i intend to initiate wiretap accountability legislation i want the justice department to be informed of every single instance of wiretapping undertaken by municipal police departments nationwide jeh many would consider that undue federal meddling and a flagrant abuse of states rights rfk the concept of states bights has been a smokescreen to obscure everything from de facto segregation to outmoded abortion statutes jeh i disagree rfk duly noted and i would like you to duly note that from this day on you are to inform me of every electronic surveillance operation that the fbi engages in jeh yes rfk duly noted jeh yes rfk i want you to personally call the new orleans sac and have him assign four

agent named court meade and he gave the books to meade when he realized that the paintings were too wellknown and recognizable to sell meade died of a heart attack in january and he willed the books

witness statements four corkboadmounted walls dripping with papersystematic suppression in typescript blackonwhite his room was small and drab the wigwam motel was not quite the st regis kemper worked up a voting rights obstruction brief one literacy test and one witness deposition formed his evidentiary basis debmar herbert bowen was a male negro born in anniston alabama he was literate and a selfdescribed big reader on mr bowen tried to register to vote the registrar said boy can you read and write mr bowen proved that he could the registrar asked exclusionary questions pertaining to advanced calculus mr bowen failed to answer them mr bowen was denied the right to vote he subpoenaed mr bowens literacy test he determined that the anniston registrar fabricated the resubts the man said that mr bowen could not spell dog and cat mr bowen did not know that coitus precipitates childbirth kemper clipped pages the work bored him the kennedy civil rights mandate was not bold enough for his taste his mandate was gunboat diplomacy he grabbed a sandwich at a bunch counter yesterday in the colored sectionfor the pure hell of it a cracker called him a nigger lover he judochopped him into a bowl of grits shots zinged his door last night a colored man told him the klan torched a cross down the block kemper finished the bowen brief he did it catchup fasthe had to meet john stanton

marcello pete bondurant observed the transaction marcello seemed to buy wards convoluted cover story ward said i made copies kemper and the depositions on your incursion and joe kennedys malfeasance remain failsafed and id appreciate it if you advised le grand pierre not to kill me he called pete immediately he said dont kill littell or tell carlos his story is bullshit pete said credit me with some brains ive been playing this game as long as you littell finessed them it was no severe bossthe books were always a moneymaking longshot kemper oiled his bobby knew he carried itand baughed it off as pretentious he wore it to the inaugural he found bobby on the parade route and told him he cut laura off clean he found jack at a white house reception he called him mr president for the first time jacks first presidential decree find me some girls for later tonight kemper rustled up two georgetown coeds president jack told him to stash the girls away for late quickies kemper stashed them in white house guest rooms jack caught him yawning and splashing water on his face it was am with inaugural galas set to run past dawn jack suggested a pickmeup they walked into the oval office and saw a doctor preparing vials and hypodermics the president rolled up one sleeve the doctor injected him john f kennedy booked positively orgasmic kemper robbed up one sleeve the doctor injected him a rocket payload hit his system the ride lasted twentyfour hours the time and place cohered around it jacks ascent became his that simple truth felt spelbbindingby articulate the time and place were beholden to one kemper cathcart boyd in that sense he and jack were indistinguishable he picked up one of jacks obd flames and made love to her at the willard he described the moment to senators and cab drivers judy garland showed him how to dance the twist the ride sputtered out and left him wanting more he knew that more would only vulgarize the moment the phone rang kemper cinched his overnight bag and picked up this is boyd its bob kemper ive got the president here with me does he want me to repeat that update i gave you no we need you to help us sort out a communications glitch pertaining to cuba i realize that youre only informally acquainted with some recent developments but i still think youre the best man for this for what what are we talking about bobby came off exasperated the projected exile invasion which you may or may not have heard about richard bissell just dropped by my office and said the cias chomping at the bit and their cubans are just a bit beyond restless theyve got the key landing site picked out its some place called playa giron or the bay of pigs it was new news stanton never told him that langley picked a site kemper faked bewilderment i dont see how i can help you you know i dont know anybody in the cia jack came on the line bobby didnt know the thing was this far advanced kemper allen dulles briefed us on it before i took office but we havent discussed it since then my advisors are split down the middle on the damn thing kemper slipped on his holster bobby said what we need is an independent assessment of the exiles readiness kemper laughed because if the invasion fails and it becomes known that you backed the socalled rebels youll be fucked in the court of world opinion bobby said vividly put jack said and to the point and i should have taken bobby into my confidence on this a few weeks ago but hes been so goddamned busy chasing gangsters kemper yes mr president ive been waffling on a date and bissells been pressing me i know youve been doing that anticastro work for mr hoover so i know youre at beast somewhat i am somewhat conversant on cuba at least from a procastrogroup standpoint bobby cracked the whip cubas always been a bit of a fixation for you so go to florida and make something positive out of it visit the cia training camps and take a swing through miami call back and tell us if you think the operation has a chance to succeed and do it damn fast kemper said ill leave now ill report back inside fortyeight hours o o o john almost died laughing kemper almost called a cardiologist they sat on stantons private terrace langley let him upgrade to the fontainebleauhotelsuite living was contagious a breeze blew up collins avenue kempers throat hurthe repeated the phone talk replete with jacks boston bray john stanton caught his breath im sorry but i never thought presidential indecisiveness could be so goddamn funny what do you think i should tell him how about the invasion will guarantee your reelection kemper laughed ive got some time to kill in miami any suggestions yes two tell me then and tell me why you wanted to see me when you knew i was swamped in alabama stanton poured a short scotchandwater that civil rights work must be vexing not really i think the negro vote is a mixed blessing arent they easily led id call them slightly less malleable than our cubans and considerably less criminally inclined stanton smiled stop it dont make me start laughing again kemper put his feet up on the railing i think you could use a few laughs langleys running you ragged and youre drinking at pm stanton nodded this is true everybody from mr dulles on down would like the invasion to go off some time in the next five minutes and im no exception and to answer your initial question i want you to spend the next fortyeight hours devising realisticsounding intelligence on troop readiness to submit to the president and i want you to prepatrol our cadre territory with fulo and nйstor chasco miamis our best source of streetlevel intelligence and i want you to assess just how far and how accurately rumors pertaining to the invasion have spread within the cuban community kemper mixed a gin and tonic ill get on it right away was there anything else yes the agency wants to set up a cuban government in exile to be housed at blessington during the actual invasion its mostly cosmetic but weve got to have at least a facsimile of a consensuschosen leadership ready to install if we get castro out within say three or four days of our go date and you want my opinion as to who gets the nod right i know youre not too well versed on exile politics but i thought you might have picked up some opinions from the cadre kemper faked deep thought steady now make him wait stanton threw his hands up come on i didnt tell you to go into a goddamn trance about kemper snapped out of itbrighteyed and forceful we want farrightwingers susceptible to working with santo and our other friends in the ouffit we want a figurehead leader who can maintain order and the best way to restabilize the cuban economy is to get the casinos operating on a full profit margin if cuba stays volatile or the reds take over again weve got to be able to draw on the outfit for financial assistance stanton laced his hands around one knee i was expecting something a bit more enlightened from kemper boyd the civil rights reformer and im sure you know that the donations of our italian friends only account for a tiny percentage of our legitimately funded government budget kemper shrugged cubas solvency depends on american tourism the outfit can help insure that united fruit is out of cuba now and only a bribable farrightwinger will be willing to denationalize their holdings stanton said keep going youre close to persuading me kemper stood up carlos is down at the guatemala camp with my lawyer friend chucks going to fly him to louisiana in a few days and hide him out and ive heard that hes getting more proexile by the day im betting that the invasion will succeed but that chaos will reign inside cuba for some time whoever we install will fall under intense public scrutiny which means public accountability and we both know that the agency will be subjected to intense scrutiny that will limit our deniabibity in all matters pertaining to covert action well need the cadre then and well probably need a halfdozen more groups as ruthless and autonomous as the cadre and well need them to be privately funded our new leader will need a secret police and the outfit will provide him with one and if he falters in his prous stance the outfit will assassinate him stanton stood up he looked brighteyed verging on feverish i dont have the final say but you sold me your pitch wasnt as flowery as your boys inaugural address but it was a good deal more politically astute and profitmotivated kemper said thanks its an honor to be compared to john f kennedy o o o fulo drove nйstor talked kemper watched they cruised cadre turf in random figureeights slum shacks and housing projects zipped by nйstor said send me back to cuba i will shoot fidel from a rooftop i will become the simon bolivar of my country fulos chevy was packed with dope powder puffed out of plastic bags and dusted the seats nйstor said send me back to cuba as a boxer i will beat fidel to death with bolo punches like kid gavilan rheumy eyes popped their waylocal junkies knew the car winos pressed up for handoutsfulo was a wellknown soft touch fulo called it the new marshall plan fulo said his handouts inspired subservience kemper watched nйstor stopped at drop sites and sold prepackaged bindles fulo backstopped all transactions with a shotgun kemper watched fulo spotted a noncadre transaction outside lucky time liquors nйstor sprayed the transactors with gaugepropelled rock salt the transactors dispersed every which way rock salt tore through your clothes and made your skin sting like a mother humper kemper watched nйstor said send me back to cuba as a skin diver i will shoot fidel with an underwater spear gun streetcorner rummies sucked down tbird glue fiends sniffed

down flagler theyd all head invasion rumors they all shared them with gusto kemper shut his eyes and listened nouns jumped out of runon spanish havana playa girуn baracoa oriente playa giron guantбnamo guantбnamo kemper caught the upshot people were talking onleave trainees were talking agencyfrontgroup men were talking the talk was innuendo bullshit wish fulfillment and truth by defaultspeculate on enough invasion sites and youll hit the right one out of sheer luck the talk constituted a minor security leak fulo didnt seem worried nйstor shrugged the talk off kemper categorized it as containable they cruised the side streets off flagler fulo monitored cab calls nйstor talked up ways to torture fidel castro kemper looked out his window and savored the view cuban girls blew them kisses car radios churned out mambo music street loafers gobbled melons soaked in beer fulo clicked off a call that was wilfredo he said don juan knows something about a dope drop and maybe we should go see him o o o don juan pimentel had a tb cough his front room was littered with customized barbie and ken dolls they stood just inside the door don juan smelled like mentholated chest rub fulo said you can talk in front of mr boyd he is a wonderful friend of our cause nйstor picked up a nude barbie the doll wore a jackie kennedy wig and brillopad crotch hair don juan coughed it is twentyfive dollars for the story and fifty dollars for the story and the address nйstor dropped the doll and crossed himself fulo handed don juan two twenties and a ten he tucked the cash in his shirt pocket the address is balustrol four men from the cuban intelligence directorate live there they are terribly afraid that your invasion will succeed and that their supply from the island will be how you say removed they have at the house a very large supply of single shots packaged to sell in order to make quick money to how you say bankroll their resistance to your resistance they have over a pound of heroin ready to be sold in these small amounts where there is to be the how you say most profit kemper smiled is the house guarded i do not know who would they sell the stuff to certainly not to cubans i would say to the negritos and the poor whites kemper nudged fulo is mr pimentel a reliable informant yes i think so is he strongly anticastro yes i think so would you trust him not to betray us under any circumstances well that is hard to don juan spat on the floor you are a coward not to ask such questions to my face kemper judochopped him don juan clipped a doll rack and went down gagging for breath nйstor dropped a pillow on his face kemper pulled his and fired through it pointblank his silencer ate up the noise bloodsoaked feathers billowed nйstor and fulo looked shocked kemper said ill explain later rebels rescue cuba commies pander poison dope in rapacious revenge heroin holocaust pusher castro gloats desperate dictator in exile dope death toll mounts kemper printed the headlines on a dispatch sheet tiger kab swirled all around himthe midnight shift was just coming on he wrote a cover note pb have lenny sands write up hushhush articles to accompany the enclosed headlines tell him to expedite it and to check the miami papers over the next week or so for background details and call me if necessary this of course pertains to the invasion and my feeling is that were very close to a godate i cant go into my plan in detail yet but i think its something youd appreciate if lenny finds my orders confusing tell him to extrapolate off the headlines in the inimitable hushhush style i know youre somewhere in nicaragua or guatemala and im hoping this pouch gets to you and try to think of wjl as a colleague peaceful coexistence doesnt always mean appeasement kb kemper stamped the envelope c rogersnext flight urgent fulo and nйstor walked by looking befuddledhe never explained why he killed don juan santo junior had a pet shark named batista

certain amount of criminal negligence andor criminal intent did mr l sands perhaps possess some spurious foreknowledge of unforetellable events his piece mentioned a number of negro heroin overdoses in the miami area and my miami police contacts tell me that no such overdoses occurred nine cuban teenagers however did die from injections of poisonous heroin my contact told me that on april two cuban youths stole an attachй case containing a large quantity of toxic heroin from a car involved in an unsolved shootout that left two cuban men dead my contact mentioned the curiously prophetic if historically inaccurate hushhush piece i told him that it was merely one of lifes odd coincidences an explanation that seemed to satisfy him i would advise you to tell mr sands to get his facts

told an informal gathering of reporters that he has organized a study group to delve into precisely why the bay of pigs invasion failed and to also assess uscuban policy in the wake of what he called a catastrophically embarrassing episode the group will interview evacuated bay of pigs survivors central intelligence agency personnel involved in highlevel invasion planning and cuban exile spokesmen

miamibased cia contingent and their cuban charges i think youll be good at the job even though your preinvasion appraisal of exile readiness turned out to be quite inaccurate you should know that the president and i do not blame you in any way for the ultimate failure of the invasion at this stage of assessment i think the blame should be leveled at overzealous cia men sloppy preinvasion security and an egregious miscalculation of incuba discontent enjoy another weeks rest in miami the president sends his best and we both think its ironic that a fortyfiveyearold man who has courted danger all

orlando sentinel crimewatch feature the odd odyssey of carlos marcello nobody seems to know where the man was born it is generally conceded that alleged mafia chief carlos marcello was born in either tunis north africa or somewhere in guatemala marcellos earliest recollections are not of either location they are of his adopted homeland the united states of america the country that attorney general robert f kennedy deported him from on april th of this year carlos marcello man without a country as marcello tells it the us border patrol shanghaied him out of new orleans and deposited him near guatemala city guatemala he said that he daringly escaped from the airport and hid out in various guatemalan hellholes with a lawyer companion frantically seeking to legally return him to home hearth and his alleged three hundred million dollar a year rackets empire meanwhile robert f kennedy was following up on anonymous tips that placed the alleged mob boss in numerous louisiana locales the tips did not pan out kennedy realized that marcello had been hiding out in guatemala with guatemalan government protection since the very moment of his daring escape kennedy exerted diplomatic pressure the guatemalan prime minister bowed to it and ordered the state police to begin a search for marcello the alleged mafia sultan and his lawyer companion were discovered living in a rented apartment near guatemala city both men were immediately deported to el salvador they walked from village to village ate in greasy spoon cantinas and slept in mud huts the lawyer attempted to contact a marcello underling a pilot who might fly them to more amenable hideouts the man could not be reached and marcello and his lawyer companion ever fearful of another deportation action kept walking robert f kennedy and his justice department lawyers readied legal briefs marcellos lawyer companion wrote briefs and phoned them in to the alleged mafia pashas formal legal team in new york city marcellos pilot friend appeared out of nowhere and according to this reporters confidential source flew his contraband confreres all the way from el salvador to matamoros mexico at treetop level to avoid radar detection marcello and his lawyer companion then walked across the border the alleged mob maharajah turned himself in at the us border patrol detention center in mcallen texas confident that a threejudge immigration appeals panel would allow him to be released on bond and remain in america his confidence was justified marcello walked out of court last week a free manalbeit a man haunted by the awful specter of statelessness a justice department official told this reporter that the marcello deportation matter could drag on legally for years when asked if a suitable compromise might be reached attorney general kennedy said its possible if marcello is willing to give up his us assets and relocate to russia or lower mozambique carlos marcellos odd odyssey continues document insert personal note kemper boyd to john stanton john thanks for the gin and smoked salmon it beat the hospital fare hands down and was greatly appreciated ive been back in anniston since the th little brother does not respect the concept of convalescence so ive been birddogging freedom riders and collecting statements for his cuban study group we can thank n chasco for getting me into the hospital sans police notification nйstor is excellent at bribing bilingual doctors the study group assignment troubles me ive been around the cause since its inception and one loose word to little brother will destroy me with both brothers get me disbarred as a lawyer and prevent me from ever obtaining any kind of policeintelligence agency work ever again that said you should know that i have deliberately sought out exile interviewees that i have not met before and that do not know that i am covertly agencyemployed i am editing their statements to show the agencys preinvasion planning in as positive a light as possible as you know big brother has become virulently antiagency little brother shares his fervor but is also evincing a true enthusiasm for the cause this heartens me but i must once again stress the absolute necessity of obfuscating all outfitexileagency links to little brother which now becomes more problematic given his new proximity to the cause im going to absent myself from my agency contract work and concentrate solely on my two justice department assignments i feel that i can best serve the agency by working as a direct conduit between them and little brother with the cuban issue undergoing profound policy reassessment the closer i remain to the policy shapers the better i can serve the agency and the cause our cadre business remains solidly lucrative i trust the ability of fulo and nйstor to keep it that way santo tells me that our italian colleagues will continue to make sizable donations playa giron gave everyone a taste of what could be nobody wants to

thousand pieces jack hates the cia bobby doesnt bobby now hates fidel castro like he hates hoffa and the mob the bay of pigs postmortem was painfully protracted he doubleagented as kemper boyd chaperone he showed bobby scores of sanitized exilesthe noncriniinal types that langley wanted him to see the study group called the invasion quixotic undermanned and based on specious intelligence he agreed langley disagreed langley thought he was a kennedy apologist they considered him politically unsound john stanton told him this he silently agreed with the appraisal he vocally agreed yes jmwave will prove efficacious he silently disagreed he urged bobby to assassinate fidel castro bobby disagreed he said it was too gangsterlike and inimical to kennedy policy bobby was a bully with strong moral convictions his guidelines were often hard to gauge bully bobby set up racket squads in ten major cities their one goal was to recruit organizedcrime informants the move enraged mr hoover independent mobbusters might upstage the top hoodlum program bully bobby hates bully j edgar bully j edgar reciprocates it was unprecedented hatredthe justice department seethed with it hoover staged protocol slowdowns bobby trashed fbi autonomy guy banister said hoover placed illegal bugtaps in mob venues coast to coast bobby had no inkling mr hoover knew how to keep secrets so did ward littell wards best secret was joe kennedys teamster fund malfeasance joe had a nearfatal stroke late last year claire said it devastated laura she tried to contact her father bobby prevented it that threemilliondollar buyoff was binding and permanent claire graduated from tulane magna cum laude the nyu law school accepted her she moved to new york city and took an apartment near laura laura

augustines the second the doctor called her claire said laura had a new boyfriend claire said he was nice claire said she met lauras nice friend lenny sands lenny violated his order and resumed contact with laura lenny always played things indirectlythat hushhush bay of pigs piece was filled with doubleedged innuendo he didnt care lenny was extortable and long gone from his life lenny dug up dirt for howard hughes lenny tattled certain secrets and quashed others lenny possessed circumstantial evidence on how badly kemper boyd fucked up in april kemper sniffed another speedball his heart revved his collarbone went numb he remembered how last may compensated for last april bobby ordered him to follow some freedom riders he said just observe and call for help if klansmen or whoever get rowdy remember youre still convalescing he observed he got up closer than reporters and camera crews he saw civil rights workers board buses he tailed them hymns roared out of wideopen windows shitkickers tailed the buses car radios blared dixie he badged a few rock throwers off with his gun arm still in a sling he stopped in anniston some rednecks slashed his tires a white mob stormed the depot and pelted a freedom bus out of town he rented an old chevy and played catchup he zoomed out highway and caught a mob scene the bus had been torched cops freedom riders and crackers were tangled up off the roadside he saw a colored girl batting flames off her pigtails he saw the torch artist peel rubber he ran him off the road and pistolwhipped him halfdead i take a few tastes now and then its just to help me keep things straight o o o and the best thing about what im proposing is that you wont have to testify in open court federal judges will read your depositions and my accompanying affidavits and go from there if any of you are called to testify it will be in closed session with no reporters opposing counsel or local police officials present the pretty little church was sro the preacher rounded up sixtyodd people kemper said questions a man yelled where you from a woman yelled what about protection kemper leaned over the pulpit im from nashville tennessee you might recall that we had some boycotts and sitins there in and you might recall that weve made great strides toward integration with minimum bloodshed i realize that mississippi is a whole lot less civilized than my home state and as far as protection goes i can only say that when you go to register to vote youll have numbers on your side the more people who offer depositions the better the more people who register and vote the better im not saying that certain elements will take kindly to your voting but the more of you who vote the better your chance of electing local officials wholl keep those elements in line a man said we got a nice cemetery outside its just that none of us want to move in real soon a woman said you cant expect the law around here to jump on our side all of a sudden kemper smiled two tastes and a twomartini lunch made the church glow as cemeteries go that one youve got is just about the prettiest ive ever seen but none of us want to visit it until some time around the year and as far as protection goes i can only say that president kennedy did a pretty good job of protecting those freedom riders last year and if those aforementioned whitetrash peckerwood redneckcracker elements turn out in force to suppress your godgiven civil rights then the federal government will meet that challenge with greater force because your will to freedom will not be defeated because it is good and just and true and you have the strength of kindness decency and unflinching rectitude on your side the congregation rose and applauded o o o so its what you call a sweetheart deal i got my royal knights klavern which is basically an fbi franchise and all i gotta do is keep my ear down and rat off the exalted knights and imperial knights for mail fraud which is the only klan stuff mr hoover really cares about i got my own informants subcontracted into both them groups and i pay them out of my bureau stipend which helps to consolidate the power of my own group the shack reeked of stale socks and stale reefer smoke dougie frank wore a klan sheet and levis kemper smashed a fly perching on his chair what about those shooters you mentioned theyre here theyve been bunking with me cause the motels around here dont differentiate between cubans and niggers course youre trying to change all that where are they now i got a shooting range down the road

bartender at the skyline lounge on my side must be a jew or a homo kemper laid on some drawl son you are trying my patience lockhart flinched well shit then you should know that i heard pete found his four boys guy banister said youre still two short which dont surprise me given all the integration work youve been doing tell me about the shooters limit your extraneous comments and get to the point lockhart wiggled his chair back kemper slid his chair closer to him well uh banister he sent them over to me they stole a speedboat in cuba and ran it aground off the alabama coast they robbed some gas stations and liquor stores and renewed an old acquaintance with that frenchy guy laurent guйry who told them to call guy for some antifidel work and and guy considered them too goddamn crazy for his taste which is too crazy for just about anybodys he sent them to me but i got about as much use for them as a dog does for fleas kemper moved closer lockhart backed his chair into the wall man you

daniels they hit one can out of four at thirty yards flash and juan notched all hits from twice that distance they shot old ms in lateafternoon light better rifles and telescopic sights would make

hoffa smiled you used to like bobby i heard you used to really admire him lines come and go jimmy you said so yourself hoffa dropped the paperweight this is true it is also fucking true that i need an edge on bobby and you fucking pulled the plug on that kennedy wire job that pete bondurant was working for me back in littell forced a wince into a smile i didnt know you knew that that is obvious it should also be fucking obvious that i forgive you and obvious that you want to try it again this is true call pete jimmy i dont have much use for him but hes the best shakedown man alive hoffa leaned

hard on jimmy we want to work up a derogatory tape profile on jack and use it as a wedge to get him to call off bobby if i hadnt interfered the shoftel operation might have worked i think we should do it again and i think we should recruit a woman that jack would find interesting enough to sustain an affair with pete rolled his eyes you want to shake down the president of the united states yes you me and jimmy you me fred turentine and the woman we bring in and youre going at this like you think we can trust each other littell smiled we both hate jack kennedy and i think weve got enough dirt on

hoffa belched im watching you two humps stare at each other and im starting to feel like im out of the fucking loop even though im financing the fucking loop littell said lenny sands hoffa sprayed eclair crumbs what the fuck does jewboy lenny have to do with fucking anything pete looked at littell littell looked at pete their brainwaves meshed somewhere over the pastry tray hoffa looked dead flummoxed his eyes went out of focus somewhere near the planet mars pete steered littell to the kitchen and shut the door youre thinking lennys this big hollywood insider youre thinking he might know some women we could use as bait right and if he doesnt come through at least were here in los angeles which is the best place on earth to find shakedowntype women littell sipped coffee right and lenny was my informant once ive got a hold on him and if he doesnt cooperate ill squeeze him with it pete cracked some knuckles hes a homo he shanked this made guy in an alley behind some fruit bar lenny

the end and theyll be pleased with the results we get bobbys been riding them too and i think we can safely say that giancana will find whatever we had to do to lenny justified pete said i like lenny littell said so do i but business is business pete traced dollar signs on the stove what kind of money are we talking about littell said twentyfive thousand a month with your expenses and freddy turentines fee worked in i know youll need to travel for your cia job and thats fine with both jimmy and me ive done wire jobs for the bureau myself and i think that between you me and turentine well

you know now the only people he talks to besides the mormons are mr j edgar hoover himself and lenny the hushhush guy you know why im talking so much because i work the gate all day and pick up scuttlebutt and the only nonmormon people i see are the filipino janitor and this jap switchboard girl mr hughes can still wheel and deal though i got to say that i heard hes pushed the twa divestment price way up so when he gets the gelt he can funnel it straight into some account hes holding like some kind of zilliondollar buy up vegas fund larry ran out of breath pete whipped out a hundreddollar

to the porch all four doors showed slack at the doordoorjamb juncture the street was dead the porch was dead quiet the mail slot for the left downstairs unit read l sands pete snapped the lock with his pocketknife an inside light hit him straight off lenny planned to stay out after dark he could prowl the pad for four solid hours pete locked himself in the crib spread out off a hallway maybe five rooms total he checked the kitchen the dinette and the bedroom the pad was nice and quietlenny eschewed pets and stayathome bun boys an office connected to the bedroom it was cubbyhole sizea desk

attached to the page lenny i dont see this one as a feature or anything else if it went to arrest amp trial great but it didnt the whole thing seems skewed to me plus the girls a nobody pete read the report skewedno shit lenny skank man sands verbatim i learned that gorgeous redhead singerdancer barb jahelka the lead attraction in her exhusband joey jahelkas swingin dance revue was arrested on august th as part of an extortion scheme levied against rock hudson it was a photo job hudson and barb were in bed at rocks house in beverly hills when a man snuck in and managed to snap several pictures with infrared film a few days later barb demanded that hudson pay her thousand dollars or the pictures would be circulated everywhere rock called private detective fred otash otash called the beverly hills pd and they arrested barb jahelka hudson then went soft hearted and refused to press charges i like this for the issue rocks a hot ticket these days and barbs a real dish ive got bikini pictures of her we can use let me know so i can formally write the piece up skewedno shit sherlock rock hudson was a fruiffly with no yen for cooze fred otash was an excop hollywood lapdog dig the skewed postscript freddys phone number doodled right there on the report pete grabbed the phone and dialed it a man answered otash its pete bondurant freddy otash whistled this has to be interesting the last time you made a sociable phone call was never im not starting now this sounds like were talking about money if its your money for my time im listening pete checked the report in august of you allegedly helped rock hudson out of a jam i think the whole thing was a setup ill give you a thousand dollars to tell me the story otash said go to two thousand and throw in a disclaimer pete said two thousand and if push comes to shove ill say i got the information elsewhere funny noise hit the line pete idd it freddy tapping his teeth with a pencil okay frenchman okay and okay and youre right the setup was rock was afraid of being exposed as a queer so he cooked up a deal with lenny sands lenny brought in this number barb jahelka and her exhusband joey and barb and rock got between the sheets joey faked a breakin and took some pictures barb made a fake extortion demand and rock fake called me in and you fake called the beverly hills pd right they popped barb for extortion one then rock got fake sentimental and dropped the charges lenny wrote the thing up for hushhush but for some reason it never got published lenny tried to leak the story to the legjt press but nobody would touch it because half the goddathn country knows rocks a homo pete sighed the whole caper went nowhere otash sighed thats correct rock paid barb and joey two gs apiece and now youre paying me an extra two just to tell you the whole sorry tale pete laughed tell me about barb jahelka while youre at it all right my take on barb is that shes slumming but she doesnt know it shes smart shes funny she looks good and she knows shes not the next patti page i think shes from the wisconsin boonies and i think she did six months honor farm for maryjane possession about four or five years ago she used to have a thing going with peter lawford jacks brotherinlaw and she treats her exhusband joey whos a piece of shit exactly the way he ought to be treated id have to say she likes kicks and ill bet shed tell you she likes danger but my take is shes never been tested if youre interested in her whereabouts try the reef club in ventura the last i heard joey jahelka was fronting some kind of cutrate twist show up there pete said you like her freddy youre an open book so are you and while were being candid let me heartily recommend that girl for whatever kind of shakedown youve got in mind o o o the reef club was all driftwood and fake barnacles the clientele was mostly college kids and lowrent hipsters pete snagged a table just off the dance floor joeys swingin twist revue went on in ten minutes wall

your logic littell said we want to convince the man to make his brother tone down his assault on my clients and their friends and if they think you have copies of the tapes it will go a long way

rig a federal release writ littell could hip kemper to the campsite raids the guard yelled bondurant pete walked up the guard steered him down the tier to a phone bank guy banister was waiting there he was holding a pen and a falsearrest waiver the guard walked back to the tank pete signed his name in triplicate im free to go banister looked gleeful thats right the sac didnt know you were agency so i informed him who told you where i was i was out at sun valley kemper gave me a note for you so i went by the stand to deliver it some kids were stealing hubcaps they told me the big gringo got arrested pete rubbed his eyes a fouraspirin headache started pounding banister pulled out an envelope i didnt open it and kemper sure seemed anxious for me to make the transmittal pete grabbed it im glad youre exbureau guy i mightve had to stay here awhile dont fret big fella i have a hunch all this kennedy bullshit is just about to end o o o pete caught a cab back to the stand vandals had stripped the tiger cars down to spare parts he read the note boyd cut straight to the point nйstors here i got a tip that he was seen begging gun money in coral gables my source says hes holed up at th and collins the pink garage apartment on the southwest corner the note meant kill him dont let santo get to him first o o o he took bourbon and aspirin for his headache he took his magnum and his silencer for the job he took some procastro leaflets to plant near the body he drove to th and collins he took this weird revelation with him you might let nйstor talk you out of it the pink garage apartment was right there as stated the chevy at the curb looked like a nйstorstyle ride pete parked pete got butterflies go ahead do ityouve killed at least three hundred men he walked up and knocked on the door nobody answered he knocked again he listened for footsteps and whispers he couldnt hear a thing he picked the lock with his penknife and walked in shotgun slides went kachook some unseen party hit a light switch theres nйstor lashed to a chair theres two fat henchmen types holding ithaca pumps theres santo trafficante with an icepick new orleans littell opened his briefcase stacks of money fell out marcello said how much littell said a quarter of a million dollars whered you get it from a client carlos cleared some desk space his office was topheavy with italianate knickknacks youre saying this is for me im saying its for you to match what else are you saying littell dumped the money on the desk im saying that as an attorney i can only do so much with john kennedy in power bobby will get you all sooner or later im also saying that eliminating bobby would be futile because jack would instinctively know who did it and take his vengeance accordingly the money smelled hughes dredged up old bills but lyndon johnson dont like bobby hed put the skids to him just to teach the fucking kid a lesson thats right johnson hates bobby as much as mr hoover does and like mr hoover he bears you and our other friends no ill will marcello laughed lbj borrowed some money from the teamsters once he is well known as a reasonable guy so is mr hoover and mr hoover is also very upset about bobbys plans to put joe valachi on tv hes very much afraid that valachis revelations will severely damage his prestige and virtually destroy everything that you and our other friends have built carlos built a little cash skyscraper bank stacks rose off his desk blotter littell knocked them over i think mr hoover wants it to happen i think he feels it coming weve all been thinking about it you cant get a roomful of the boys together without somebody bringing it up it can be made to happen and it can be made to look like we werent involved so youre saying im saying its so big and audacious that well most likely never be suspected im saying that even if we are the powers that be will realize that it can never be conclusively proven im saying that a consensus of denial will build off of it im saying that people will want to remember the man as something he wasnt im saying that well present them with an explanation and the powers that be will prefer it to the truth even though they know better marcello said do it make it happen sun valley the squad shared turf with gators and sand fleas kemper called the place hoffas paradise lost flash set up targets laurent benchpressed cinderblock siding juan canestel was awolwith am rifle practice pending nobody heard him drive off juan was prone to odd wanderings lately kemper watched laurent guйry work out the man could bench three hundred pounds without breaking a sweat dust swirled up the main road teamster boulevard was now a pistol range flash played his transistor radio bad news crackled out there were no arrests in the birmingham church bombing case the revamped mcclellan committee was set to go to televised sessions a woman was found sashcord strangled outside lake weir the police reported no leads and appealed to the public for assistance juan was one hour awol pete was missing for three days he got the phone tip on nйstor four days ago the tipster was a freelance exile gunman he gave guy banister a note to relay to pete guy called and said he delivered it he said he found pete at the federal detention jail he dropped hints that more fbi raids were coming a storm browned out their phone setup two days ago pete couldnt call sun valley kemper drove to a pay phone off the interstate last night he called petes apartment six times and got no answer nйstor chascos death never made the news pete would have dumped the body in a newsworthy locale pete would put a procastro spin on the murder pete would make sure trafficante got the word his morning dexedrine surge hit it took ten pills to kickstart the dayhed built up a large tolerance juan and pete were missing juan was hanging out with guy banister latelylittle lake weir drinking excursions every other day or so the pete thing felt wrong the juan thing felt mildly hinky his amphetamine surge said do something o o o juan drove a candyapplered tbird flash called it the rapemobile kemper cruised lake weir the town was small and laid out in a grid patternthe rapemobile would be easy to spot he checked side streets and the bars near the highway he checked karls kustom kar shop and every parking lot on the main drag he didnt spot juan he didnt spot juans customized tbird juan could wait the pete thing was more pressing kemper drove to miami the pills started to hit counterproductivehe kept yawning and fading out at the wheel he stopped at th and coffins that pink garage apartment was right where the tipster said it would be a traffic cop walked over kemper noticed a no parking sign on the corner he rolled down his window the cop jammed a smelly rag in his face o o o it felt like chemical warfare inside him the smell fought his wakeup pills the smell might be chloroform or embalming fluid the smell meant he might be dead his pulse said noyoure alive his lips burned his nose burned he tasted chloroformed blood he tried to spit his lips wouldnt part he gagged the blood out through his nose he stretched his mouth something tugged at his cheeks it felt like tape coming loose he sucked in air he tried to move his arms and legs he tried to stand up heavy ballast held him down he wiggled chair legs scraped wood flooring he thrashed his arms and got rope burns kemper opened his eyes a man laughed a hand held up polaroid snapshots glued to cardboard he saw teo paez gutted and quartered he saw fulo machado shivved through the eyes he saw ramdn gutierrez powderscorched from bigbore shots to the head the photos disappeared the hand swiveled his neck kemper caught a slow view he saw a shabby room and two fat men in a doorway he saw nйstor chasconailed to the far wall with icepicks through his palms and ankles kemper shut his eyes a hand slapped him a big heavy ring cut his lips kemper opened his eyes hands slid his chair around they had pete chained down they had him doublecuffed and shackled to a chair they had the chair bolted directly into the floor a rag hit his face kemper sucked the fumes in voluntarily o o o he heard stories filtered through a long echo chamber he picked out three storytelling voices nйstor got close to castro twice you got to hand it to him a kid that toughwhat a shame to put his lights out nйstor said he bought off some castro aide the aide said castro was considering a kennedy hit the aide said whats with this kennedy first he invades us then he pulls backhes like a cunt who cant make up her mind fidels the cunt the aide told chasco hed never work with the outfit again he thinks santo screwed him on the heroin deal he didnt know it was nйstor and our boys here bondurant pissed his pants look you can see the stain santo and mo were not gentle and i got to say nйstor went out brave im bored with this i got to say this waiting around is stretching me thin i got to say theyll be back soon i got to say theyll want to put some hurt on these two kemper felt his bladder go he took a deep breath and forced himself unconscious o o o he dreamed he was moving he dreamed somebody cleaned him up and changed his clothes he dreamed he heard fierce pete bondurant sobbing he dreamed he could breathe he dreamed he could talk he kept cursing jack and claire for disowning him he woke up on a bed he recognized his old fontainebleau suite or an exact replica of it he was wearing clean clothes somebody pulled off his soiled boxer shorts he felt rope burns on his wrists he felt tape fragments stuck to his face he heard voices one room overpete and ward littell he tried to stand up his legs wouldnt function he sat on the bed and coughed his lungs out littell walked in he looked commandingthat gabardine suit gave him some bulk kemper said theres a price littell nodded thats right its something i worked out with carlos and sam ward santo agreed too and you and pete get to keep what you stole kemper stood up ward held him steady what do we have to do littell said kill john kennedy miami to thirty years and parallel situations miami giuseppe zangara tries to shoot presidentelect franklin d roosevelt he missesand kills chicago mayor anton cermak miami a kennedy motorcade is scheduled for november littell slowcruised biscayne boulevard every inch of ground told him something carlos told him the zangara story last week giuseppe was a fucking nut some chicago boys paid him to pop cermak and take the bounce he had a fucking death wish and he got his fucking wish fulfilled frank nitti took care of his family after he got executed he met with carlos sam and santo he bartered for pete and kemper they discussed the fallguy issue at length carlos wanted a leftist he thought a leftwing assassin would galvanize anticastro feeling trafficante and giancana overruled him they matched howard hughes contribution they added one stipulation we want a rightwing patsy they still wanted to suck up to fidel they wanted to replenish raul castros dope stash and effect a latebreaking rapprochement they wanted to say we financed the hitnow will you please give us back our casinos their take was too convoluted their take was politically naive his take was minimalistically downscaled the hit can be accomplished the planners and shooters can walk bobbys mob crusade can be nullified any results beyond that are unforeseeable and will most likely resolve themselves in a powerfully ambiguous fashion littell drove through downtown miami he noted potential motorcade routeswide streets with high visibility he saw tall buildings and rear parking lots he saw office for rent signs he saw blighted residential blocks he saw house for rent signs and a gun shop he could see the motorcade pass he could see the mans head explode o o o they met at the fontainebleau pete ran a walltowall bug sweep before they said one word kemper mixed drinks they sat around a table by the wet bar littell laid the plan out we bring the fall guy to miami some time between now and the first of october we get him to rent a cheap house on the outskirts of downtown close to the announced or assumedtobeannounced motorcade routeand an office directly on the routeonce that route is determined i cruised every major airporttodowntown artery this morning my educated guess is that well have plenty of houses and offices to choose from pete and kemper stayed quiet they still looked close to shellshocked one of us sticks close to the fall guy between the time we bring him here and the morning of the motorcade theres a gun shop near his office and his house and one of you burglarizes it and steals several rifles and pistols hate literature and other bits of incriminating paraphernalia are planted at the house and our man handles them to insure latent fingerprints pete said get to the hit littell framed the moment three men at a table and hearapindrop silence he said its the day of the motorcade were holding our man hostage at the office on the parade route theres a rifle from the gunshop burglary with him and his fingerprints are all over the stock and barrel housing kennedys car passes our two legitimate shooters fire from separate roof perches in the rear and kill him the man holding our patsy hostage fires at kennedys car and misses drops the rifle and shoots the patsy with a stolen revolver he flees and drops the revolver down a sewer grate the police find the guns and compare them to the manifest from the burglary theyll chalk up the evidence and figure theyve got a conspiracy that tenuously succeeded and unraveled at the last second theyll investigate the dead man and try to build a conspiracy case against his known associates pete lit a cigarette and coughed you said flee like you think getting outs a cinch littell spoke slowly there are perpendicular side streets off every major thoroughfare that ive designated motorcadelikely theyre all freewayaccessible inside two minutes our legitimate shooters will be firing from behind theyll fire two shots total which will sound at first like car backfires or firecrackers the secret service contingent wont know exactly where the shots came from theyll still be reacting when multiple shotsfrom our fake shooter and the man guarding himring out theyll storm that building and find a dead man theyll be distracted and theyll blow a minute or so all our men will have time to get to their cars and drive off kemper said its beautiful pete rubbed his eyes i dont like the rightwingnut part its like we came this far and didnt play an angle that could help out the cause littell slapped the table no trafficante and giancana want a rightwinger they think they can build a truce with castro and if thats what they want well have to go along with it and remember they did spare your lives kemper freshened his drink his eyes were still bloodshot from chloroform exposure i want my men to shoot theyve got the hate and theyre expert marksmen pete said agreed littell nodded well pay them each use the rest of the money for expenses and split the difference three ways kemper smiled my men are pretty far to the right we should downplay the fact that were setting up a fellow rightwinger pete mixed a cocktail two aspirin and wild turkey we need to get a handle on the parade route littell said thats your job youve got the best miami pd contacts ill get on it and if i find out anything solid ill start mapping out the hard logistics kemper coughed the key thing is the patsy once we get beyond that were home free littell shook his head no the key thing is to thwart a fullscale fbi investigation pete and kemper looked puzzled they werent thinking up to his level littell spoke very slowly i think mr hoover knows its coming hes got private bugs installed in godknowshowmany mob meeting places and he told me hes been picking up a huge amount of kennedy hatred he hasnt informed the secret service or they wouldnt be planning motorcades through to the end of the fall kemper nodded hoover wants it to happen it happens hes glad it happened and he still gets assigned to investigate it what we need is an in to get him to obfuscate or shortshrift the investigation pete nodded we need an fbilinked fall guy kemper said dougie frank lockhart miami he liked to spend time alone with it boyd said he was doing the same thing pete laid out bourbon and aspirin he turned on the window unit and cooled off the living room just right he leveled off his headache and ran some fresh odds the odds they could kill jack the haircut the odds that santo would kill him and kemper deal or no deal all the odds hit inconclusive his living room took on a rather shitty medicinal glow littell loved dougie franks pedigree the fuck was ultraright and fbifilthy littell said hes perfect if mr hoover is forced to investigate hell put a blanket on lockhart and his known associates immediately if he doesnt hell risk exposure of all the bureaus racist policies lockhart was holed up in puckett mississippi littell said go there and recruit him he strolled through the main mpd squadroom last night he saw three prospective motorcade maps they were tacked to a corkboard in plain fucking view he memorized them all three routes ran by their gun shop and for rent signs boyd said he felt awe more than fear pete said i know what you mean he didnt say i love this woman if i die i came this far and lost her for nothing miami somebody placed a tape recorder on his coffee table somebody placed a sealed envelope beside it littell shut the door and thought it through pete and kemper know youre here jimmy and carlos know you always stay at the fontainebleau you went down to the coffee shop for breakfast and were gone less than half an hour littell opened the envelope and pulled out a sheet of paper mr hoovers block printing explained the surreptitious entry jules schiffrin died concurrent with your fall absence from duty his estate house was ransacked and certain ledger books were stolen joseph valachi did extensive pension fund forwarding work he is currently being questioned by a trusted colleague of mine robert kennedy does not know that this interrogation is progressing the accompanying tape contains information that mr valachi will refuse to reveal to mr kennedy the mcclellan committee and indeed to anyone else i trust mr valachi to maintain his silence he has been made aware that the quality and duration of his federal relocation is predicated on it please destroy this note please listen to the tape and keep it in a safe place i realize that the tape has limitless strategic potential it should be revealed to robert kennedy only as an adjunct to measures of great boldness littell plugged in the machine and prepped the enclosed tape his hands were butterthe spool kept slipping off the spindle he tapped the play button the tape splice sputtered and hissed go over it again joe like i told you before slow and easy okay slow and easy then slow and easy for the sixteenth goddamn joe come on okay slow and easy for the stupes in the peanut gallery joseph p kennedy sr was the charter bankroller of the teamsters central states pension fund which loans out money to all kinds of bad people and a few good people at very high interest rates i did a lot of the forwarding work somethnes i delivered cash to peoples safedeposit boxes you mean they gave you clearance to enter their boxes right and i used to visit joe kennedys bank regularly its the main securityfirst national in boston its account its like ninety or a hundred safedeposit boxes filled with cash raymond patriarca thinks theres close to a hundred million dollars in there and raymond should know cause him and irish joe go back a ways i got to say the notion of bob kennedy as a racket buster makes me laugh i guess the apple does fall pretty far from the tree cause joe kennedy money has financed one whole hell of a lot of ouffit deals i got to say also that old joes the only kennedy that knows about that money you dont tell people i got a hundred million in cash put away that my sons the president and attorney general dont know about and now joes had this stroke so maybe hes not thinking too clear you would sort of like to see that money put to use and not just sit there which it might if old joe kicks off or goes senile and forgets about it i should also mention that every big guy in the outfit knows how dirty joe is but they cant shake bobby down with the knowledge without putting their own fits in the wringer the tape ran out littell tapped the stop button and sat perfectly still he thought it through he assumed hoovers perspective and spoke his thoughts out loud in the first person im close to howard hughes i set ward littell up with him littell asked hughes for money to help assure my fbi directorship jack kennedy plans to fire me ive got private taps installed in mob venues ive picked up a great deal of kennedy hatred littell switched back to his own perspective hoover possessed insufficient data said data would not lead him to extrapolate a specific hit i told pete and kemper mr hoover knows its coming i meant it in the metaphorical sense the tape and note implied specificity hoover called the tape an adjunct to measures of great boldness he was saying i know the tape was a device to humble bobby the tape was a device to insure bobbys silence the tape should be revealed to bobby before jacks death jacks death would explicate the purpose of the humbling bobby would thus not seek to establish proof of an assassination conspiracy bobby would know that to do so would forever besmirch the kennedy name bobby would assume that the man who delivered the humbling had foreknowledge of his brothers death bobby would be powerless to act upon his assumption littell reassumed hoovers perspective bobby kennedy broke littells heart kennedy hatred binds us littell will not resist the urge to maim bobby littell will want bobby to know that he helped plan his brothers murder it was complex and vindictive and psychologically dense hoover thinking a single logical thread was missing you havent broken cover your financiers presumably havent kemper and pete havent kemper hasnt broached the plan to his shooters yet hoover senses that youre pushing toward a hit the tapes your adjunctif you get there first theres a second plot in the works mr hoover has specific knowledge of it littell sat perfectly still little hotel sounds escalated he couldnt lock the conclusion in he couldnt rate it as much more than a hunch mr hoover knew himas no one else ever had or ever would he felt an ugly wave of love for the man puckett the geek wore a monogrammed klan sheet pete fed him bonded bourbon and lies this gig is you dougie its got you written all over it lockhart burped i knew you didnt drive out here at am just to share that bottle with me the shack smelled like a cat box dougie reeked of wildroot cream oil pete stood in the doorwaythe better to dodge the stink its three hundred a week its an official agency job so you wont have to worry about those fed raids lockhart rocked back in his lazboy recliner those raids have been pretty indiscriminate i heard quite a few agency boys got themselves tangled up in them pete cracked his thumbs we need you to ride herd on some klansmen the agency wants to build a string of launch sites in south florida and we need a white man to get things going lockhart picked his nose sounds like blessington all over again sounds also like it might be another big fuckin buildup to another big fuckin letdown like a certain invasion we both remember pete took a hit off the bottle you cant make history all the time dougie sometimes the best you can do is make money dougie tapped his chest i made history recently is that right thats right it was me that bombed the th street baptist church in birmingham alabama that communistinspired hueandcry thats going up right now well i

plates two were assigned to the shooters the third car was for the man assigned to kill dougie pete brought a fourth man in chuck rogers signed on as their fallguy impersonator rogers and lockhart had similar builds and similar features dougies most distinguishing attribute was bright red hair chuck dyed his hair red chuck spewed kennedy hatred all over miami he shot his mouth off at taverns and pool halls he raged at a skating rink a gun range and numerous liquor stores he was paid to rage nonstop until november littell drove by dougies office every circuit gave him a brilliant new embellishment he should find some rambunctious kids on the motorcade route he should give them firecrackers and tell them to let fly it would wear the secret service escort down it would inure them to gunshotlike noises kemper was working up some dougie frank keepsakes lockharts psychopathology would be summarized in minutiae kemper defaced jfk photographs and carved swastikas on jack and jackie dolls kemper smeared focal matter over a dozen kennedy magazine spreads the investigators would find it all in dougies bedroom closet currently in progress dougie frank lockharts political diary it

sun valley was risky the men bunked at the breakers motel they testfireds all day every day their rifles were identical to the rifles kemper stole the shooters didnt know about the hit kemper would inform them six days beforein time to stage a fulldress miami rehearsal littell cruised by dougies house pete said he always came in through the alley and never let the neighbors see him they should plant some narcotics at the house they should expand dougies pedigree to assassinchurch bomberdope fiend kemper had a drink with the miami sac yesterday they were old bureau palsthe meeting wouldnt stand out as anomalous the man called the motorcade a pain in the ass he called kennedy tough to guard he said the secret service let crowds get too close to him kemper said any threats any loonies coming out of the woodwork the man said no their one risky bluff was holding no one had reported the loudmouthed pseudo dougie littell drove back to the fontainebleau he wondered how long pete and kemper would outlive jfk blessington training officers formed a cordon just inside the front gate they wore face shields and packed shotguns filled with rock salt refuge seekers slammed the fence the entry road was jammed with junk cars and dispossessed cubans kemper watched the scene escalate john stanton called and warned him that the raids went from bad to godawful the fbi hit fourteen exile camps yesterday half the cubans on the gulf coast were out seeking cia asylum the fence teetered the training men raised their weapons there were twenty men inside and sixty men outside only weak chainlinks and some barbed wire stood between them a cuban climbed the fence and snagged himself on the barbs at the top a training man blew him downone salt round desnagged him and lacerated his chest the cubans picked up rocks and waved lumber planks the contract men assumed protective postures a big bilingual roar went up littell was late pete was late toothe migration probably stalled traffic kemper walked down to the boat dock his men were shooting buoys floating thirty yards offshore they wore earplugs to blot out the gate noise they looked like highline spitandpolish mercenaries he moved them in just under the wire they had free run of the campsitejohn stanton pulled strings for old times sake ejected shells hit the dock laurent and flash notched bullseyes juan fired wide into some waves he told them about the hit last night the pure audacity thrilled them he couldnt resist it he wanted to see their faces ignite laurent and flash lit up happy juan lit up disturbed juans been acting furtive juans been awol three nights running the radio reported another dead woman she was beaten senseless and strangled with a sash cord the local cops were baffled victim was found near sun valley victim was found near blessington the gate noise doubled and tripled rocksalt rounds exploded kemper popped in earplugs and watched his men shoot juan canestel watched him flash made a buoy jump laurent nailed it on the rebound juan slammed three straight misses something was wrong o o o the state police cleared the cubans out black amp whites escorted them to the highway kemper drove behind the convoy the line was fifty cars long the rocksalt barrage blew out windshields and stripped convertible tops it was a shortsighted solution john stanton prophesied exile chaosand hinted at much worse pete and ward called to say theyd be late he said goodi have to run an errand they rescheduled their meet for at the breakers hed tell them stantons news hed stress that it was strictly speculative the car herd crawledboth outbound lanes were jammed up bumpertobumper two black amp whites drove point to keep the cubans boxed in kemper turned onto a switchback it was the only shortcut to blessington properdirt roads straight in dust kicked up a light drizzle turned it to mud spray the rapemobile passed him fullthrottle on a blind curve kemper hit his wipers the spray thinned out translucent he saw exhaust fumes up aheadand no rapemobile juans distracted he didnt recognize my car kemper hit downtown blessington he cruised by the breakers als dixie diner and every exile hangout on both sides of the highway no rapemobile he gridsearched side streets he made systematic circuits three blocks left three blocks right sevencomeelevenwheres that candyapplered tbird there the rapemobile was parked outside the larkhaven motel kemper recognized the two cars parked beside it guy banisters buick carlos marcellos lincoln o o o the breakers motel faced the highway kempers window faced a justrigged state police checkpoint he saw cops divert cars down an offramp he saw cops force male latins out at gunpoint the cops ran id checks and ins checks the cops impounded vehicles and arrested male latins wholesale kemper watched for one straight hour the staties busted thirtynine male latins they herded the men into jail trucks they dumped confiscated weapons into one big pile he searched juans room an hour ago he found no sash cords he found no perverted keepsakes he saw absolutely nothing incriminating somebody leaned on the doorbell kemper opened up quick to stop the noise pete walked in have you seen whats going on out there kemper nodded they were trying to break in to the camp a few hours ago the head training officer called the staties pete checked the window those are some pissedoff cubans kemper pulled the drapes wheres ward hes coming and i hope you didnt call us all the way down here to show us some fucking roadblocks kemper walked to the bar and poured pete a short bourbon john stanton called me he said jack kennedy told hoover to turn up the heat the fbi has raided twentynine nonagency campsites within the past fortyeight hours every nonagency exile in captivity is out looking for agency asylum pete downed his shot kemper poured him a refill stanton said carlos put up a bail fund guy banister tried to bail out some of his pet exiles but the ins has put a deportation hold on every cuban national in custody pete threw his glass at the wall kemper plugged the bottle stanton said the entire exile community is going crazy he said theres lots of talk about a kennedy hit he said theres a good deal of specific talk about a motorcade hit in miami pete punched the wall his fist smashed through to the baseboard kemper stood back and talked slow and easy nobody on our team has broken cover so the rumors couldnt have originated from there and stanton said he didnt inform the secret service which implies that he wouldnt mind seeing jack dead pete gouged his knuckles bonedeep he threw a left hook at the wallplaster chunks flew kemper stood way back ward said hoover sensed it was coming he was right because hoover would have stalled the raids and sent out warnings to the oldboy network just to screw bobbyunless he wanted to fuel the hatred against jack pete grabbed the bottle pete doused his hands and wiped them on the drapes the fabric seeped beige to red the wall was halfdemolished pete listen theres ways we can pete shoved him against the window no this is the one we cant get out of we either kill him or we dont and theyll probably kill us even if we get him kemper slid free pete slid the drapes back exiles were jumping off the highway abutment cops were going at them with electric cattle prods look at that kemper look at that and tell me we can contain this fucking thing littell walked past the window pete opened the door and pulled him in bodily he didnt react he looked glazed and hurt kemper shut the door ward what is it littell hugged his briefcase he didnt even blink at the room damage i talked to sam he said the miami hit is out because his liaison to castro told him that castro would never speak to any outfit man ever again under any circumstances theyve given up the idea of a rapprochement ive always considered it farfetched and now apparently sam and santo agree pete said this is all crazy kemper read littells face dont take this away from me are we still on littell said i think so and i spoke to guy banister and figured something out pete looked ready to blow so tell us ward we know youre the smartest and the strongest now so just tell us what you think littell squared his necktie banister saw a copy of a presidential memo it passed from jack to bobby to mr hoover then through to the new orleans sac who leaked it to guy the memo said that the president is sending a personal emissary to talk to castro in november and that further jmwave cutbacks will be forthcoming pete flicked blood off his hands i dont get the banister connection littell tossed his briefcase on the bed it was coincidental guy and carlos are close and guys a frustrated lawyer himself we talk from time to time and he just happened to mention the memo what it all ties in to is my feeling that mr hoover senses theres a hit plan in the works since none of us have broken cover im thinking thatmaybetheres a second hit in the planning stages im thinking also that banister might have knowledge of itand thats why hoover leaked the memo in his direction kemper pointed to the window did you see that checkpoint littell said yes of course kemper said thats hoover again thats him letting the raids happen to keep the hate against jack peaking john stanton called me ward theres supposed to be a halfdozen or six dozen or two dozen more fucking plots in the works like the fucking assassination metaphysic is just out there too undeniably pete slapped him kemper pulled his piece pete pulled his littell said no very softly pete dropped his gun on the bed kemper dropped his littell said enough very softly the room crackled and buzzed littell unloaded the guns and locked them in his briefcase pete spoke just shy of a whisper banister bailed me out of jail last month he said this kennedy bullshit is about to end like he had some kind of fucking foreknowledge kemper spoke the same way juan canestels been acting strange lately i tailed him a few hours ago and spotted his car parked next to banisters and carlos marcellos it was right down the road here outside another motel littell said the larkhaven thats right pete sucked blood off his knuckles howd you know that ward and if carlos is in on a second hit are santo and mo calling ours off littell shook his head i think were still on what about this banister stuff its new to me but it fits all i know for certain now is that im meeting carlos at the larkhaven motel at five he told me that santo and mo have handed the whole thing to him with two new stipulations kemper rubbed his chin the slap left his face bright red which are that we reschedule out of miami and work up a leftwing patsy theres no chance at a truce with castro so they want to build the killer up as profidel pete kicked the wall a landscape print hit the floor kemper swallowed a loose tooth pete pointed to the highway the cops were putting on full riot gear the cops were running strip searches in broad daylight kemper said look at that thats all mr hoovers chess game pete said youre crazy hes not that fucking good littell laughed in his face blessington carlos arranged a liquor tray the setting was incongruous hennessy xo and paperwrapped motel glasses littell took the hard chair carlos took the soft one the tray sat on a coffee table between them your crew is out ward were using somebody else hes been planning his thing all summer which makes it a better allaround deal littell said guy banister howd you know did a little birdie tell you his cars outside and theres some things that you just tend to know youre taking it good i dont have a choice carlos toyed with a humidor i just learned about it the things been in the works for a while which to my way of thinking increases the chance of success where dallas next month guys got some rich rightwingers backing it hes got a longterm fall guy one pro shooter and one cuban juan canestel carlos laughed youre a very smart tend to know guy littell crossed his legs kemper figured it out and in my opinion you shouldnt trust psychopaths who drive bright red sports cars carlos bit the tip off his cigar guys a capable guy hes got a commietype patsy with a job on one of the motorcade routes two real shooters and some cops to kill the patsy ward you cant fault a guy who came up with the same plan as you fucking independent of you he felt calm carlos couldnt break him he still had the chance to maim bobby i wish it could have been you ward i know you got a personal stake in seeing that man dead he felt secure he felt inimical to pete and kemper i wasnt pleased that mo and santo cozied up to castro ward you should have seen me when i found out littell took out his lighter it was solid golda gift from jimmy hoffa youre building up to something carlos youre about to say ward youre too valuable to risk and offer me a drink even though i havent touched liquor in over two years marcello leaned in littell lit his cigar youre not too valuable to risk but youre way too valuable to punish everybody agrees with me on that and everybody also agrees that boyd and bondurant constitute another fucking matter i still dont want that drink why should you you didnt steal two hundred pounds of heroin and shit all over your partners you took part in a shakedown that you should have told us about but thats no more than some fucking misdemeanor littell said i still dont want that drink and id appreciate it if you told me exactly what you want me to do between now and dallas carlos brushed ash off his vest i want you pete and kemper not to interfere with guys plan or try to horn in on it i want you to cut that lockhart guy loose and send him back to mississippi i want pete and kemper to return what they stole littell squeezed his gold lighter what happens to them i dont know thats not for me to fucking say the cigar smelled foul an air conditioner blew smoke in his face it would have worked carlos we would have made it happen marcello winked you always take business on its own terms you dont do some regret number when things dont go your way i dont get to kill him thats a regret youll live with it and your plan helped guy set up a diversion what diversion carlos perched an ashtray on his stomach banister told some nut named milteer about the miami job without naming no personnel guy knows milteers a loudmouth whos got a miami pd snitch birddogging him hes hoping milteer will blab to the snitch wholl blab to his handler and somehow the miami motorcade will get canceled and divert everybodys attention away from dallas littell smiled its farfetched its something out of terry and the pirates carlos smiled sos your story about the teamster books sos the whole idea of you thinking i didnt know what really happened from the gate a man stepped out of the bathroom he was holding a cocked revolver littell shut his eyes carlos said everybody but jimmy knows we had detectives tailing you from the fucking instant you walked me over the border they know all about your code books and the research you did at the library of congress i know you got plans for the books and sonny boy now you got partners littell opened his eyes the man wrapped a pillow around his gun carlos poured two drinks youre going to set us up with howard hughes were going to sell him las vegas and keester him for most of his profits youre going to help us turn the fund books into more legitimate money than jules schiffrin ever dreamed of he felt weightless he tried to dredge up a hail mary and couldnt remember the words carlos raised his glass to las vegas and new understandings littell forced the drink down the exquisite burn made him sob meridian heroin bricks weighed down the trunk and made the rear wheels drift a simple traffic shake would net him thirty yeas in parchman prison he withdrew his bankvault stash some powder leaked on the floorenough to sedate rural mississippi for weeks santo wanted his dope back santo reneged on their deal santo let certain implications linger santo might have you killed santo might let you live santo might tease you with some stay of execution kemper pulled up to a stoplight a colored man waved to him kemper waved back the man was a pentecostal deaconand very skeptical of john e kennedy the man always said i dont trust that boy the light changed kemper punched the gas be patient mr deacon that boys got eighteen days left to live his team was out banisters was in juan canestel and chuck rogers crossed over to guys crew the hit was rescheduled for dallas on november juan and a corsican pro would shoot from separate locations chuck and two dallas cops were set to kill the fall guy it was littells basic plan embellished it illustrated the ubiquitous lets kill jack metaphysic littell disbanded the team lockhart returned to his klan gig pete flew straight to texas to be with his woman the swingin twist revue was scheduled to play dallas on hit day littell cut him loose some homing instinct drew him back to meridian quite a few locals remembered him some colored folks

countryside dusk hit kemper crossed the puckett town line he saw a ridiculous sign framed by floodlights martin luther king at a communist training school the photo insert looked doctored someone drew

squeals down a hallway a wall clock read dallas time the squeals turned into a dog food commercial littell pressed up to the wall and looked through the doorway an iv bag was feeding the man blood he was feeding himself with a hypodermic needle he was lying buck cadaverous naked on a crankup hospital bed he missed a hip vein he jabbed his penis and hit the plunger his hair touched his back his fmgernails curled over halfway to his palms the room smelled like urine bugs were floating in a bucket filled with piss hughes pulled the needle out his bed sagged under the weight of a dozen
