anne perry acceptable loss chapter hester was halfasleep when she heard the slight sound as if someone were taking in a sharp breath and then letting out a soft desperate gasp monk was motionless beside her his hand loose on the pillow his hair falling over his face it was not the first time in the last two weeks that hester had heard scuff crying in the night it was a delicate relationship she had with the boy she and monk had befriended he had lived on the streets by the river and had largely provided for himself which had made him wise beyond his age and fiercely independent he considered he was looking after monk who in scuffs opinion lacked the knowledge and the fierce survival instincts required for his job as head of the thames river police at wapping in the heart of the london docks until last month scuff had come and gone as hed pleased spending only the occasional night at monks house in paradise place however since his kidnapping and the atrocity on the boat at execution dock he had come to live with them going out only for short periods during the day and tossing and turning at night plagued by nightmares he would not talk about them and his pride would not let him admit to hester that he was frightened of the dark of closed doors and above all of sleep of course she knew why once the tight control he kept over himself in his waking hours slipped from him he was back on the boat again curled up on his side beneath the trapdoor to the bilges nailed in with the halfrotted corpse of the missing boy fighting the swirling water and the rats the stench of it making him gag in his nightmares it did not seem to matter that he was now free or that jericho phillips was dead scuff had seen the mans body himself imprisoned in the iron cage in the river his mouth gaping open as the rising tide trapped him choking off his voice forever hester heard the gasping sound again and slipped out of bed she pulled on a wrap not so much for warmth in the late september night but for modesty so as not to embarrass scuff if he was awake she crept across the room and along the passage his bedroom door was open just wide enough for him to pass through the gas lamp was on low maintaining the fiction that she had forgotten and left it on as she did every night neither of them ever mentioned this scuff was lying tangled in the sheets the blankets slipped halfway to the floor he was curled up in just the same position as they had found him in when she and the ratcatcher sutton had pried open the trapdoor without debating with herself anymore hester went into the room and picked up the blankets placing them over him and tucking them in lightly then she stood watching him he whimpered again and pulled at the sheet as if he were cold she could see in the faint glow of the gaslight that he was still dreaming his face was tight eyes closed hard jaw so clenched he must have been grinding his teeth every now and again his body moved his hands coming up as if to reach for something how could she wake him without robbing him of his pride he would never forgive her for treating him like a child and yet his cheeks were smooth his neck so slender and his shoulders so narrow that there was nothing of the man in him yet he said he was eleven but he looked about nine what lie would he not see through she could not waken him without tacitly admitting that she had heard him crying in his dream she turned and walked back to the door and went a little way along the passage then a better idea came to her she tiptoed downstairs to the kitchen and poured a glass of milk then she took four cookies and put them on a plate she went back upstairs careful not to trip over her nightgown just before she reached his room she deliberately banged the door of the linen cupboard she knew it might waken monk as well but that could not be helped when she reached scuffs room he was lying in bed with the blankets up to his chin fingers gripping them eyes wide open you awake too she said as if mildly surprised so am i ive got some milk and cookies would you like half she held up the plate he nodded he could see there was only one glass but the milk did not matter it was the chance to be awake and not alone that he wanted she came in leaving the door ajar and sat on the edge of the bed she put the glass on the table beside him and the plate on the blankets he picked up a biscuit and nibbled it watching her his eyes were wide and dark in the low lamplight waiting for her to say something i dont like being awake at this time of the night she said biting her lip a little im not really hungry it just feels nice to eat something have the milk if you want it ill take alf he said food was precious he was always fair about it she smiled good enough she agreed picking up a biscuit herself so he would feel comfortable eating he reached for the glass holding it with both hands he drank some then looked at it to measure his share drank a little more then handed it to her he sat very upright in the bed his hair tousled and a rim of white on his upper lip she wanted to hold him but she knew better he might have wanted it too but he would never have allowed such an admission it would mean he was dependent and he could not afford that he had lived in the docks scavenging for pieces of coal off the barges brass screws and other small valuable objects that had fallen off boats into the thames mud the low tide allowed boys like himmudlarksto survive he had a mother somewhere but perhaps she had too many younger children and neither the time nor room to care for him or maybe she had a new husband who did not want another mans son in the house boys like himself had been his friends sharing food warmth and one anothers pain comrades in survival have another biscuit hester offered ive ad two he pointed out that was alf yes i know i took more than i wanted she replied i thought i was hungry but now im just awake he looked at her carefully deciding if she meant it then took the last biscuit and ate it in three mouthfuls she smiled at him and after a moment he smiled back are you sleepy she asked no nor am i she hitched herself up a little so she could sit on the bed with her head against the headboard beside him but still keeping a distance away sometimes when im awake i read but i havent got a good book at the moment the newspapers full of all sorts of things i dont really want to know like wot he asked twisting round so he was facing her a little more settling in for a conversation she listed off a few social events she remembered adding where they had been held and who had attended neither of them cared but it was something to say presently she wandered off the subject and remembered past events describing clothes and food then behavior wit flirting disasters anything to keep him entertained she even recalled the chaotic remembrance service where her friend rose had been hopelessly and unintentionally drunk she had climbed onto the stage and seized the violin from the very earnest young lady who had been playing it and had then given her own rendition of several current music hall songs growing bawdier with each scuff giggled trying to picture it in his mind were it terrible he asked ghastly hester affirmed with relish she told them all the truth of what a fearful person the dead man had been and why they had really come it was awful then but i laugh every time i think of it now she were yer friend he said the word slowly tasting its value yes she agreed dyer elp er as much as i could fig were my friend he said very quietly i dint elp im nor the other neither i know she felt the lump hard and painful in her throat fig was one of the boys jericho phillips had murdered im sorry she whispered yer cant elp it he said reasonably yer did yer best no one can stop it he moved an inch or two closer to her tell me some more about rose and the others she had seen survivors guilt before in her nursing in the crimea she had heard soldiers cry out from the same nightmares and had seen them waken with the same shocked and helpless eyes staring at the comfort around them and feeling the horror inside she tried to think of something else to say to scuff happy things anything to take away his memory of his own lost friends adding a little more until she looked at him and saw his eyes closing she lowered her voice and then lowered it even more he was so close to her now that he was touching her she could feel the warmth of him through the sheet that separated them a few minutes later he was asleep without being aware of it he had put his head against her shoulder she stopped talking and lay still it was a little cramped but she did not move until morning when she pretended to have been asleep also after a breakfast of hot porridge toast and marmalade monk sent scuff out on an errand and turned to hester nightmares again he asked sorry she apologized i knew id probably waken you but i couldnt leave him alone i banged the door so you dont need to explain he cut across her the ghost of a smile softened the angular planes of his face for a moment and then it was gone again he looked grim full of a pain he did not know how to deal with she knew he was remembering the terrible night on the river when jericho phillips had kidnapped scuff to prevent monk from completing the case against him for which he would have assuredly hanged phillips had so very nearly succeeded had it not been for suttons little dog snoot they would never have found the boy hes still afraid she said quietly he knows phillips is deadhe saw the drowned body in the cagebut there are other people doing the same thing other boats on the river that use boys for pornography and prostitutionboys just like him his friends people we cant help i dont know what to say to him because hes far too clever to believe comforting lies and i dont want to lie to him anyway then hed never trust me in anything i wish he didnt care about them so much and yet id hate it if he could feel safe only by never looking back he thinks we cant help she blinked hard william parents ought to be able to help thats part of what they are for he sees us not even trying just accepting defeat he doesnt even understand why he feels so guilty and thinks hes betraying them by being all right he wont believe that we dont secretly think the same of him whatever we say i know he took a deep breath and let it out slowly and that isnt the only problem she waited her heart pounding they had avoided saying it all their time and emotion was concentrated on scuff but she had known it would have to come now she looked at the lines of strain in monks face the shadows around his eyes the lean high cheekbones there was a vulnerability there that only she understood she thought of oliver rathbone who had been both monks friend and hers for so long and beside whom they had fought desperate battles for justice often at the risk of their reputations even their lives they had sat up for endless nights searching for answers had faced victory and disaster together horrors of grief pity and disillusion rathbone had once loved hester but she had chosen monk then he had married margaret ballinger and found a happiness far better suited to his nature margaret could give him children but more obvious than that she was socially his equal she was of a calmer more judicious nature than hester she knew how to behave as lady rathbone wife of the most gifted barrister in london should was it really conceivable that margarets father had been the power and the money behind jericho phillipss abominations that is what lord justice sullivan had claimed right before his terrible suicide at execution dock hester longed for monk to tell her that it was not true you heard what rathbone said about arthur ballinger and phillips monk said yes has he said anything more no i suppose theres nothing legal or he would have hed have no choice you mean theres no proof just sullivans wordand hes dead anyway yes but you believe it that also was not really a question of course i do he said very softly rathbone believes it and do you think he would if there were any way in heaven or hell that he could avoid it monk lifted up his hand and touched hesters cheek so softly she felt the warmth of him more than the brush of his skin against hers i have to know if ballinger was involved for scuff so at least he knows im trying he continued and rathbone has to know too however much he would prefer not to are you going to speak to him ive been avoiding it and so has he hes been in court on another case for the last two weeks but its finished now and i cant put it off any longer are you sure he needs to know she pressed the pain of it would be intolerable and he would have no choice but to do something about it thats not like you he said ruefully to want to avoid someone elses pain she was momentarily indignant to be evasive he corrected her you are too good a nurse to want to put a bandage on something that you know needs surgery if its gangrene you must take off the arm or the patient will die you taught me that am i being a coward she winced as she said the word she knew that to a soldier coward was the worst word in any language worse even than cheat or thief monk leaned forward and kissed her lingering only a moment you dont need courage if you arent afraid he answered it takes a little while to be certain you have no alternative scuff needs to know that we care enough for the truth itself not just to rescue him and then turn away i think rathbone would want that too whatever the cost whatever she questioned he hesitated maybe not at any cost but that doesnt change the reality of it hester went to the clinic that she had set up to treat and care for prostitutes and other street women who were sick or injured it survived on charitable donations and margaret rathbone was by far the most dedicated and the most able among those who sought and obtained such money margaret also spent a certain amount of time actually working there cooking cleaning and practicing the little light nursing that she had learned from hester of course she had done rather less of such work since her marriage and no longer did nights still hester did not look forward to seeing her today and hoped it would be one of those times when margaret was otherwise engaged she walked from paradise place down the hill to the ferry the autumn wind was blustery saltsmelling from wapping she took an omnibus westward toward holborn it was a long journey but it was necessary that they live near monks work his was a reasonably new position back in the police again after years of being a private agent of inquiry when hed lurched from one case to another with no certainty of payment for less than a year he had been head of the river police in this area which was a profoundly responsible position there was no one in england with better skills in detection or more courage and dedicationand some might say ruthlessness but his art in managing men and placating his superiors in the political hierarchy was altogether another matter if the circumstances caused hester a little more traveling it was a small enough contribution to his success added to which she really did like the house in paradise place with its view over the infinitely changing water not to mention the freedom from financial anxiety that a regular income gave them she walked briskly along portpool lane under the shadow of the reid brewery and in at the door of the house that had once been part of a huge brothel it was oliver rathbone who had helped her obtain the building quite legally but with considerable coercion of its previous owner squeaky robinson squeaky had remained here a partially reformed character to begin with he had stayed because he had had nowhere else to go but now he took a certain pride in the place oozing selfrighteousness at his newfound respectability squeaky was in the entrance as she came in his face gaunt his stringy graywhite hair down to his collar as usual he was wearing an ancient frock coat and today had on a faded silk cravat we need more money he said as soon as hester was through the door i dunno how you expect me to do all these things on sixpence hapenny you had fifty pounds just a week ago she replied she was so used to squeakys complaints that she would have worried if he had said that all was well mrs margaret says were going to need new pans in the kitchen soon he retaliated lots of em big ones sometimes i think were feeding half london lady rathbone hester corrected him automatically and pans do wear out squeaky they get to the point where they cant be mended anymore then you tell her ladyship to come up with some money for em he said waspishly what happened to the fifty pounds sheets and medicines he replied instantly you can tell her now shes through there he jerked his head sideways indicating the door to his left there was no point in putting it off not only would it look like cowardice it would feel like it as if obedient to his instruction she went through into the next room margaret rathbone was standing near the central table with a pale blue notepad in her hand and a pencil poised she looked up as hester came in there was a moments total silence between them as if neither had expected to see the other and yet both of them must have been preparing for this inevitable meeting it was the first since lord justice sullivans suicide and the accusations he had then made against margarets fatherthat he was the force behind the pornographyand the blackmail that had finally ruined the judge there was no proof just unforgettable words and drowned bodies margaret would never admit the possibility but hester could not deny it it left them no bridge to each other margaret was not a beautiful woman but her features were regular and her bearing unusually graceful she had a dignity without arrogancean unusual gift now she put the notepad down and looked unblinkingly at hester her expression was guarded as yet without warmth i have the new sheets she remarked two dozen of them they will more than make up for those we have to get rid of the old ones will be good to tear up for bandages hester replied walking farther into the room thank you margaret looked a little surprised as if thanking her were inappropriate it was not my money she observed we would not have it if you had not persuaded someone to donate it hester pointed out she made herself smile but as always squeaky is now complaining that the old pans cannot be mended anymore and we need new ones do we hester relaxed a little we will do all i said was that we should start saving for them i swear he wouldnt be happy if he didnt have something to be miserable about there was a polite tap on the door hester answered it and claudine burroughs came in she was a broadhipped middleaged woman with a face that had once been handsome but time and unhappiness had taken away her bloom she had discovered both her independence of spirit and a considerable purpose in life when she had volunteered to help in the clinic mostly to irritate her unimaginative husband she had defied his orders to cease her association with such a place with more courage than she had known she possessed good morning mrs monk she said cheerfully morning lady rathbone without waiting for a reply she launched into an account of the new patients who had been admitted since yesterday evening and the progress of the more serious cases that had been there for some time there were the usual fevers stab wounds a dislocated shoulder sores and infestations the only thing less ordinary was an abscess which claudine reported triumphantly she had lanced and which was now clean and should heal margaret winced at the thought of the pain not to mention the mess hester applauded claudines medical confidence they moved on to other housekeeping matters then they went to see the more serious cases speaking only of business and the morning passed quickly when hester came downstairs to the entrance hall again she found oliver rathbone waiting she was startled to see him off guard because she had been trying not to imagine what monk would have said to him about ballinger now a glance at rathbones facesensitive intelligent faintly quizzicaland she knew that monk had not spoken to him yet she felt guilty as if in knowing what was to come and not saying it she were somehow deceiving him good morning oliver she said with a slight smile if you are looking for margaret she is in the medicine room he raised his eyebrows are you in a hurry she could have kicked herself for dismissing him so quickly she had not only been discourteous she had made her unease obvious would apologizing make it worse are you all right hester he asked taking a step toward her what about scuff how is he rathbone had been with them when they had searched so frantically for scuff he knew exactly how shed felt the horror of that day had touched him as nothing else had ever done in his life of prosecuting or defending some of the worst crimes in london she saw the memory of it in his eyes now and the gentleness stupidly the tears prickled in her own and her throat was tight with the fear of what might come for him if sullivan had been telling the truth she turned away so he could not read her face he still has awful nightmares she replied a little huskily im afraid its going to take she hesitated time what will it take for him ever to be over it he asked i dont know thinking its over for his friends other boys like him not lies he smiled very slightly hed never believe you anyway hester youre a terrible liar totally transparent she met his eyes with a flash of wit or else im so good that youve never caught me for an instant his face was blank with surprise and then he laughed at that moment margaret came in hester turned toward her and was struck with a sudden quite unnecessary stab of guilt she was relieved when rathbone stepped around her his face lighting with pleasure margaret my big case is over have you time to join me for luncheon id be delighted she replied without looking at hester especially if you can help me think of anyone further whom i can ask for money we have new sheets but soon we shall need pots and pans she did not add that she was the only one raising funds but it hung unspoken in the air hester felt ashamed for her own failure to raise money but margarets marriage to rathbone gave her a position in society that hester would never have that fact was too obvious for either of them to need to say it it was also unnecessary to add that margarets courtesy and natural good manners yielded far more reward than hesters outspoken candor people liked to feel that they were doing their christian duty toward the less fortunate but definitely not that they owed it in any way and they certainly did not wish to hear the details of poverty or disease thank you hester said mildly although it cost her an effort it would certainly be a great help margaret smiled and took rathbones arm by the middle of the afternoon hester had had little more for luncheon than a cold cheese sandwich and a cup of tea she was helping one of the women finish the scrubbing when rupert cardew arrived she was on her knees on the floor a brush in her hand a pail of soapy water beside her she heard the footsteps and then saw the polished boots stop about a yard in front of her she sat back and looked up slowly he was at least as tall as monk but fair where monk was dark and on his recent visits to the clinic to add to their funding so relaxed as to be casual monk on the other hand was always intensely alive waiting to move sorry rupert apologized with a smile didnt mean to catch you on your knees but if you were praying for more money then im here with the answer hester climbed to her feet declining his outstretched hand to assist her her plain blue skirt was wet where she had kneeled and her white blouse unadorned with lace was rolled up above her elbows and also wet in places her hairnot always her best featurehad been pinned back and adjusted several times as it had escaped and was now completely shapeless good afternoon mr cardew she could not call him sirand she did not think he wished italthough she was perfectly aware of his fathers title should she apologize for looking like a servant their friendship was recent but she had liked him immediately in spite of being aware that his beneficence toward the clinic sprang at least in part from a professional familiarity with some of its patients his father lord cardew had sufficient wealth and position to make work unnecessary for his only surviving son rupert wasted his time means and talents with both charm and generosity although lately he had lost some of his usual ease i wasnt praying she added looking ruefully at her wet rather red hands perhaps i should have had more faith thank you she took the considerable amount of money he held out she did not count it but there was clearly several hundred pounds in the bundle of treasury notes he put in her hand debts of pleasure he said with a wide smile do you really have to do that yourself he eyed the floor and the bucket actually its quite satisfying she told him especially if youre in a temper you can attack it and then see the difference you have made next time i am in a temper perhaps ill try it he promised with a smile you were an army nurse werent you he observed they should have set you at the enemy youd have frightened the wits out of them he said it goodnaturedly as if in approval would you like a cup of tea i should have brought some cake bread and jam she offered she could enjoy a few minutes break and the light superficial conversation with him he reminded her of the young cavalry officers she had known in the crimea charming funny seemingly careless on the surface and yet underneath it trying desperately not to think of tomorrow or yesterday and the friends they had lost and would yet lose however as far as she knew rupert had no war to fight no battle worth winning or losing what kind of jam he asked as if it mattered black currant she replied or possibly raspberry right to her surprise he bent and picked up the bucket carrying it away from himself a little so it did not soil his perfect trousers or splash his boots she was startled she had never before seen him even acknowledge the necessity never mind stoop to so lowly a task she wondered what had made him think of it today certainly not any vulnerability in her it had made no difference before he put the pail down at the scullery door emptying it could wait for someone else in the kitchen hester pushed the kettle over onto the cooktop and started to cut bread she offered to toast it and then passed the fork over to him to hold in front of the open door of the stove they spoke easily of the clinic and some of the cases that had come in rupert had a quick compassion for the street womens pain in spite of being one of those very willing to use their services with tea toast and jam on the table conversation moved to other subjects with which there was no tension no glaring contrasts social gossip places they had visited exhibitions of art he was interested in everything and he listened as graciously as he spoke sometimes she forgot the great kitchen around her the pots and pans the stove and in the next room the copper for boiling linen and the laundry tubs the scullery sinks the racks of vegetables she could have been at home as a young woman fifteen years ago before the war before experience passion grief or real happiness there had been a kind of innocence to her life then everything had been possible her parents had still been alive and also her younger brother who had been killed in the crimea the memories were both sweet and painful deliberately she steered the subject back to the clinic were very grateful for your gift i had asked lady rathbone to see if she could raise some more money but it is always difficult we keep on asking because there is so much needed all the time but people do get tired of us she smiled a trifle ruefully lady rathbone is she the wife of sir oliver he asked with apparent interest although it might merely have been the feigning required by good manners yes do you know them only by repute the idea seemed to amuse him our paths dont cross except perhaps at the theater and i dare say he goes for reasons of business and she to be seen i go because i enjoy it isnt that why you do most things she replied and then wished she had not it was too perceptive too sharp he winced but appeared unoffended you are about the only truly virtuous woman that i actually like he said as if surprised at it himself you havent ever tried to redeem me thank god good heavens she opened her eyes wide how remiss of me should i have at least for appearances sake if you told me you cared about appearances i should not believe you he answered trying to be serious and failing although for some there is nothing else he was suddenly tense muscles pulling in his neck wasnt it sir oliver who defended jericho phillips and got him off hester felt a moment of chill simply to be reminded of it yes she said with as little expression as she could dont look like that he said gently the miserable devil got his just deserts in the end he drownedslowlyfeeling the water creep up his body inch by inch as the tide came in and he was terrified of drowning phobic about it much worse for him than being hanged which is supposed to be all over in a matter of seconds so they say she stared at him her mind racing he blushed his fair skin coloring easily im sorry im sure thats more detail than you wanted to know i shouldnt have said that sometimes i speak too frankly to you i apologize it was not the detail that had sent the icy chill creeping through her for she knew all too well how jericho phillips had died she had seen his dead face it was the fact that rupert cardew knew of phillipss terror of water that meant that he had known phillips himself why should that surprise her rupert had made no secret of the fact that he knew prostitutes and was prepared to pay for his pleasure perhaps that was more honest than seducing women and then leaving them possibly with child but jericho phillips had been a different mattera blackmailer a pornographer of children of little boys as young as six or seven years perhaps rupert had known phillips only casually without realizing that he did was that one of the many scrapes from which ruperts father had bailed him out it should not surprise her how easy it is when you like someone to be blind to the possibilities of ugliness in them of weaknesses too deep to be passed over with tolerance what horror might be ahead for margaret if sullivan had been telling the truth about arthur ballinger and one day margaret was forced to realize it margarets loyalties would be torn apart the whole fabric of love and belief threatened margaret was loyal to her father of course she was as rupert was to his and perhaps he had even more cause his father had protected him right or wrong the cost to lord cardew must have been far more than money and yet he had never failed love does forgive but can it forgive everything should it which loyalties came firstfamily or belief in right and wrong what about her own father that pain twisted deep into places she dared not look her father had died alone in england betrayed and ashamed while she had been out in the crimea caring for strangers ignorant to his plight what loyalty was that hester ruperts voice broke through her thoughts she looked up she was glad that rupert was just a friend someone she was deeply grateful to but not tied to by blood or love youre right she agreed it sounds as if fate were harsher to phillips than the law would have been monk went to oliver rathbones office in the city late in the morning and was informed courteously by his clerk that sir oliver had gone to luncheon monk duly returned at half past two and was still obliged to wait it might have been simpler to catch rathbone with time to spare at his home in the evening but monk needed to speak with him when margaret was not present at quarter to three rathbone came back entering with a smile on his face and the easy elegant manner he usually had when the taste of victory was still fresh on his tongue hello monk he said with surprise got another case for me already he came in and closed the door quietly his pale gray suit was perfectly cut and fitted to his slender figure the sunlight shone in through the long windows catching the smoothness of his fair hair and the touches of gray at the temples i hope i dont monk answered but i cant let this go by default what are you talking about rathbone sat down and crossed his legs he appeared reasonably comfortable even if in fact he was not you look as if you have just opened someones bedroom door by mistake i may have monk said wryly the reference was meant only as an illustration but it was too close to the truth rathbone regarded him levelly his face serious now its not like you to be oblique how bad is it monk hated what he had to say even now he was wondering if there were some last desperate way to avoid it that night on phillipss ship after we found scuff and the rest of the boys you told me that margarets father was behind it i told you that sullivan said so he told me while you were occupied with phillips rathbone cut across him quickly sullivan had no proof and hes dead by his own hand now whatever he knew or believed is gone with him the proof may be deadmonk did not move his eyes from rathbonesbut the question isnt someone is behind it phillips hadnt the money or the connections in society to run the boat and find the clients who were vulnerable let alone blackmail them afterward could it have been sullivan himself rathbone suggested and then looked away monk did not bother to answerthey both knew sullivan had not had the nerve nor the intelligence it would have required hed been a man ruined by his appetite and eventually killed by it in the end hed been one more victim rathbone looked up again all right not sullivan but he could have implicated anyone as long as it wasnt himself theres nothing to act on monk the man was desperate and pathetic now hes very horribly dead and he took phillips with him which no man more richly deserved theres nothing more i can do or would the boat has been broken up the boys are free let the other victims nurse their wounds in peace his face tightened in revulsion too deep to hide pornography is cruel and obscene but theres no way to prevent men looking at whatever they wish to in their own homes if you want a crusade there are more fruitful causes i want to stop scuffs unhappiness monk replied and to do that i have to stop it from happening to other boys the friends hes left behind ill help youbut within the law monk rose to his feet i want whoevers behind it give me evidence and ill prosecute rathbone promised but im not indulging in a witch hunt dont you or youll regret it witch hunts get out of hand and innocent people suffer leave it monk monk said nothing he shook rathbones hand and left chapter it was early morning and corney reach was deserted the heavy mist lent the river an eerie quality as if the smooth sullen face of it could have stretched to the horizon it touched the skin and filled the nose with its clinging odor here on this southern bank the trees overhung the water sometimes dipping so low they all but touched its surface within fifty yards they were shrouded indistinct a hundred yards and they were no more than vague shapes suggestions of outlines against the haze the silence consumed everything except for the occasional whisper of the incoming tide over the stones or through the tangled weeds close under the bank the corpse was motionless facedown its coat and hair floated wide making it look bigger than it was but even partly submerged the blow to the back of the skull was visible the current bumped the body gently against monks legs he moved his weight slightly to avoid sinking in the mud want me to turn im over sir constable coburn asked helpfully monk shivered the cold was inside him not in the damp early autumn air he hated looking at dead faces even though this man might have been the victim of an accident if it was an accident he would resent having been called all the way up here beyond the western outskirts of the city it would have been a waste of his time and that of orme his sergeant who was standing five or six yards away also up to his knees in the river yes please monk answered right sir constable coburn obediently leaned forward ignoring the water soaking his uniform sleeves and hauled the corpse over until it was floating on its back thank you monk acknowledged orme moved closer stirring up mud he looked at monk then down at the body monk studied the dead mans face he seemed to be in his early thirties he could not have been in the river long because his features were barely distorted there was just a slight bloating in the softer flesh no damage from fish or other scavengers his nose was sharp a little bony his mouth thinlipped and wide and his eyebrows pale there seemed little color in his hair but it would be easier to tell when it was dry monk put out his hand and lifted one eyelid the iris was blue and the white was speckled with blood he let it close again any idea who he is he asked yes sir coburns face was shadowed with distaste es mickey parfitt sir smalltime piece o dirt around ere inter fencin pimpin generally makin a profit out of other folks misery youre certain no mistake sir see is right arm monk noticed nothing but the jacket covered the mans right arm to the base of his fingers then he glanced at the left arm and realized the right was at least three inches shorter monk gripped the arm and felt the wasted muscle the left one was thin but hard in life it would have been strong perhaps making up for the withered one who found him he asked orrie jones but es only alf there coburn replied tipping his head it were tosh as called us e worked fer parfitt ere an there as much as e worked at all that is nasty piece o work tosh not a tosher monk asked curiously referring to the men who worked stretches of the sewers fishing for valuables that had been washed down they found all sorts of things jewelry in particular given the right area there were rich pickings to be had was once so e says coburn replied got tired of it or maybe e lost is patch what was orrie jones doing down by the riverbank so early thats a good question coburn pulled his mouth tight in an expression of disgust e says as e were takin a breath of air before startin is days work do you think he killed parfitt monk said doubtfully no es daft but es armless but i reckon as e could a bin lookin fer im any idea why and why would he expect to find parfitt down by the riverbank at five or six in the morning coburn bit his lip good question sir orrie did odd jobs fer mickey rowed im about like fetched an carried fer im ran errands e must ave ad a good idea e was ere a good idea that he was dead monk suggested mebbe and who killed him coburn shook his head mebbe that too but e wouldnt tell us then wed better find mickeys friends and enemies monk responded i suppose theres no hope it could be an accident ope all you like sir but we dont often get so lucky that a piece o vermin like mickey as accidents monk glanced up at orme orme frowned he was a quiet solid man used to the river and to those who preyed on its business and its pleasures wonder if the blow killed him or if he drowned he said thoughtfully an what was he doing down here anyway was he alone how far upstream did he go into the water monk was thinking of the blood in the dead mans eyes the eyes did not look like those of someone who had drowned he bent down and lifted one eyelid again then the other it was the samestained with small hemorrhages carefully using both hands he pulled the jacket open and the collar of the wet shirt exposing the thin neck orme let out a sigh between his teeth oh gawd coburn said hoarsely the throat was horribly swollen but the thin line of a ligature was still unmistakable biting deep into the flesh irregularly every few inches there were spreading bruises as if whatever it was had knots in it that had further lacerated the flesh theres no way that happened by accident monk said grimly im afraid we very definitely have a murder lets get him out of the water and ask the police surgeon to tell us what he can and well speak to mr orrie jones who so fortuitously found him and tosh whats the rest of his name he looked at coburn never heard it coburn said apologetically they waded ashore orme and coburn dragging the body then the three of them lifted it awkwardly onto the bank scrambling to keep a footing as the mud gave way beneath their feet the last thing monk wanted was to land spreadeagled in the water soaked to the skin it was bad enough that his shoes were sodden and his trouser legs were flapping coldly around his ankles they laid the body in the cart that coburn had sent for and then followed behind it in a grim troop across the fields to the roadway then they climbed up into it for the rest of the journey monk was only slowly getting used to the tidal waters of the thames even this far upstream initially he had assumed that the body would have been carried down toward the sea but just in time he prevented himself from saying so how far do you think he was carried he asked coburn ignorance of the local tide was acceptable there were several factors involved speed currents obstacles as well as time depends where e went in coburn said chewing his lip he guided the horse to the right down toward chiswick could a bin carried both ways if nothing on the shore stopped im ard to tell many barges this far up monk asked he had seen only two all the time they had been there and it was now midmorning not many coburn replied an they usually stay as far out as they can nobody wants to get caught up on sandbanks fallen logs rubbish easier to find out what e were doin in the water at all than try to reckon where e went in by where we found im the town was barely a mile away and they arrived in clear sunshine the streets were full of carts drays wagons of one sort or another and the pavements were crowded with people several barges lay moored at the docks loading and unloading the police surgeon had come from the city and took charge of what was left of mickey parfitt promising a report in good time he seemed to be waiting for a challenge a demand for haste but he did not get one monk already knew that parfitt had been strangled and had taken a hard blow to the head firstthere was no sense in hitting a man after he was dead the weapon that had struck him could have been almost anything what had strangled him was more interesting but the shape of the bruises told him that the surgeon would have to cut the ligature off to find out more i want to see this tosh monk said to coburn as they left the morgue yes sir thought yer would got im at the station unusually elpful e is again the look of distaste twisted his mouth monk made no reply but followed coburn across the roadway and into the police station where tosh was sitting in the interview room sipping a mug of tea and eating a large sugary bun he looked suitably sober as befitted a man who had reported finding a corpse however monk detected a certain sheen of satisfaction in his long face as he rose to his feet slowly careful not to spill his tea morning gentlemen tosh said in a remarkably wellmodulated voice he was a tall man narrowshouldered with rather a long nose and decidedly frizzy hair which stood out all over his head sad business he turned to monk recognizing authority immediately tosh wilkin what can i do to elp you monk introduced himself ow do yer do mr monk tosh said soberly all the way up from wapping eh you must take it all very serious murder is always serious mr wilkin murder is it tosh affected mild surprise ere was i oping e were just unfortunate an fell in by imself really you didnt notice the ligature around his neck tosh affected innocence the what the knotted rope around his neck monk elaborated he watched toshs eyes his face the long scrupulously clean hands at his sides nothing gave him away cant say as i did tosh replied but then i didnt look more n to make sure orrie wasnt avin visions like police business either way dont do for ordinary folk to meddle dont touch is my watchword just called constable coburn ere he hesitated as if undecided about exactly how to go on he looked only at monk avoiding the eyes of the other two actually mr monk to tell the truth orrie came to me early about alf past six in the morning i could ave brained im for waking me up but e said e took mickey out to is boat about eleven oclock or so last night mickey told im to go back for im in about an hour well when orrie went there were nobody there no mickey no anyone e said e ung around for a while calling out looking but then e reckoned e must ave got it wrong an e went ome but when mickey wasnt there this morning orrie was scared something ad appened at half past six monk said with disbelief thats it tosh agreed you see i didnt believe im i told im to get out an leave me alone go back to bed like civilized folk and dont be so stupid an off e went monk waited impatiently then i got to worrying meself tosh continued looking at monk gravely so instead o going back to sleep i lay there for a while then i got up and dressed an i was on me way down the path just to check up so to speak when i saw orrie come up at a run all redfaced an out o breath monk looked from tosh to constable coburn and back again where is this boat that orrie took mickey to last night he asked moves around coburn answered moored up between ere an barnes tosh said and gestured upriver which dont mean to say poor mickey went into the river there tides can play funny games wi thingsfloaters in particular so orrie took parfitt to his boat shortly after eleven oclock last night and went to collect him an hour or so later and he wasnt there tosh nodded his fuzzy head yer got it given o course that orrie isnt always that exact with time is orrie short for horace tosh half hid a smile orrible when youve met im youll see why es not he tapped his forehead and left the rest to monks imagination monk remembered the corpses withered arm i assume mr parfitt was not able to row himself was this usually mr joness job yes e obeys well enough but not much use for anything else i see and do you know for yourself that what he says is true or do you just believe him toshs eyes opened very wide with exaggerated surprise sending a row of wrinkles up his forehead i believe im cos it makes sense and e asnt the wit to lie one of the benefits of employing idiotstheyre not imaginative enough to tell a decent lie and avent the brains to remember it if they did monk forbore from responding to that so after he had appealed to you at about sixthirty in the morning he continued you told him to go back to bed but in fact orrie actually continued to search for mr parfitt along the riverbank yes thats right tosh confirmed remarkable that in so short a time he actually found him dont you think monk asked its a big river lots of weeds and obstructions tides in and out and traffic tosh blinked adnt thought of it like that but o course youre right remarkable it is sir i think this would be a good time to meet this mr orrible jones monk observed oh yes sir tosh blinked and smiled showing very white and curiously pointed teeth they found orrie jones sweeping the sawdust on the floor of a pub just off one of the alleys leading down to the riverfront coburn pointed him out although there was no need he was stout and of less than average height he was an unusually ugly man his brown hair grew at all angles from his head rather like the spines of a hedgehog his nose was broad but it was his eyes that were his most unnerving feature mornin orrie coburn said cheerfully stopping in front of him orrie grasped the broom handle his knuckles white one large dark eye was fixed balefully on the constable the other wandered toward the far corner monk had no idea whether orrie could see him or not yer found oo done that ter mickey orrie demanded done what monk inquired wanting to know if orrie was aware of the strangulation before coburn mentioned it pushed im in the water orrie shifted his gaze or at least half of it could he swim monk asked not with is ead stove in orrie replied his face was so vacant monk was not sure if he felt anger pity or even disinterest it set monk at an unexpected disadvantage it doesnt surprise you that he is dead monk asked orries gaze wandered round the room dont surprise me when nobodys dead he replied monk found himself irritated it was a perfectly reasonable answer and yet it sidestepped the real question was that intentional how long did you look for him last night when you went back to the boat and discovered he had gone he persisted till i couldnt find im orrie said patiently dunno ow long it were int no use looking after that monk thought he saw orrie smile but decided to pretend he hadnt were you late going back for him he said sharply this time it was orrie who looked uncomfortable shifting his weight awkwardly yeah i got eld up some fool wouldnt pay an we ad ter ask im a bit arder crumblell tell yer monk looked at coburn crumble is one of parfitts pimps coburn replied orrie looked at him with disapproval yer shouldnt say things like that mr coburn crumble just looks after things coburn shrugged monk did not pursue it orrie was probably telling the truth and it was quite possible that none of them had a very clear idea of time monk would have to look further into the various sources of money to see whether orrible jones had any apparent motive either to kill parfitt himself or to shield anyone else who had they questioned orrie further but he had nothing to add to the simple fact that he had rowed mickey parfitt out to his boat which was moored upstream from the local island chiswick eyot shortly after eleven oclock he had waited until midnight to go back for him and then had been delayed by trouble in one of the taverns where a customer had refused to pay for several drinks monk had no doubt it was actually a brothel but for the purpose of accounting for orries time it came to the same thing when orrie had rowed back just before one mickey parfitt was nowhere to be seen he said he had looked for him until he believed it was pointless and then he had gone back home and gone to bed in the morning when orrie had called on mickey and found he was still not around he had been sufficiently concerned to go and waken tosh tosh had told him to go back to bed but instead orrie had begun to search for mickey in little more than an hour he had found the body monk excused orrie for the time being and went to find crumble who appeared to have no other name he was in the cellar of the pub moving kegs around with more ease than monk would have expected from a man so small he was less than five feet with round eyes and features so indistinct that they seemed about to blur into one another his eyebrows were ragged his nose shapelessperhaps the bone had been broken too many times he spoke with a soft curiously highpitched voice needed a little elp he explained when they asked him about orries delay in returning for parfitt the previous night werent thinkin o the time cant let people get away without payin or wordll get about an everyonell be tryin it mr parfitts money monk made a mental note to find out whose money it would be now and perhaps also roughly how much of it there was constable coburn would be well qualified to do that he went through the pattern of the evening once again then thanked crumble and left it was after six by the time monk and orme finally found themselves upstream toward mortlake they had borrowed a police boat and now rowed across from the north bank to the south finally they were approaching the large vessel moored close to the trees in a quiet easily overlooked place sheltered from the wake of passing barges and unseen from the road the north bank opposite was marshy and completely deserteda place no one would be likely to wander there were no paths in it no place to tie a boat and no reason to they rowed across the bright water the early evening sun was low on the western horizon already filling the sky with color it was not yet a year since monk had taken this job but even in that time the strength of his arms and chest had increased enormously he hardly felt the pull of the oars and he was so accustomed to working with orme that they fell into rhythm without a word he knew that parfitt had been murdered most probably on this boat that lay motionless on the silent river ahead of them still the movement the creak of the oarlocks the whisper of water passing the faint drip from the oars had a kind of timeless calm that eased the knots inside him he found he was smiling they pulled up alongside the boat and shipped their oars orme stood and caught the rope ladder that lay over the surprisingly high side they tied their own ropes to it and then climbed up the boat was larger than it had looked from the shore it was a good fifty feet long and about twenty wide at its broadest point given the height of it there would be two decks above the waterline and perhaps another below then the bilges what did mickey parfitt use something this size for moored away up here beyond the docks certainly not cargo there were no masts for sails and no towpaths on the shore monk glanced at orme ormes face was turned away but monk saw the hard lines of his jaw the muscles knotted his shoulders tight wed better go below monk said quietly they had brought crowbars in case it proved necessary to break open the hatches he wondered what had happened on this boat had someone crept aboard in the dark rowing out just as they had climbing on board silently creeping soundlessly across the wooden planking and taking mickey parfitt by surprise or was it someone he had expected someone he had assumed to be a friend and then he had suddenly horribly found that he was wrong orme was bending over the hatch well have to break it he said frowning he mustve been killed on deck or he never got this far monk replied orme looked up at him you mean it could have nothing to do with this why would orrie tell that story about bringing him here if he didnt if hes got the guts to lie at all surely hed say he knew nothing about it monk took one of the crowbars and levered it into the lock in the hatch maybe other people know he took parfitt out he might have been seen on the dockside at eleven at night orme said skeptically he slid his own crowbar into place and leaned hard on it but the heavy metal hasp of the lock did not budge monk put his weight behind his crowbar too working in unison with orme on the fourth attempt the wood splintered on the fifth it gave tearing the other end of the lock off and pulling the screws out what the hell has he got in here thats so valuable orme said in amazement smuggling brandy tobacco must be a hell of a lot of it unless whoever killed him took it monk did not reply he hoped that was what it was i think orries afraid of tosh dont you orme straightened his back pulling the hatch open you mean tosh told him what to say that would mean tosh has a fair idea of what really happened the sky was darkening around them the light draining out of the air there was no sound but the faint ripple of the water or else hes protecting someone else monk suggested he moved closer to the black square of the hatch only the new wood where the screws were torn out showed pale wed better get down there while we can still see well need a lantern below anyway they did not look at each other they both knew what they were afraid of the same memories crowded both their minds orme struck a match in the still air he did not have to shelter it carrying it carefully he started down the wooden steps into the bowels of the boat monk followed it was surprisingly easy and he knew as he went down and his hand found the rail that this deck was designed for passengers not cargo a sense of foreboding closed in on him even the smell in the air was disturbingly familiar the richness of cigar smoke the overripe sweetness of good alcohol but stale mixed with the odor of human bodies orme held the lantern high and shed its light onto the smooth painted walls of a wide cabin it looked something like a floating withdrawing room there were cupboards at one end and a bench with a polished mahogany surface a gleaming brass rail around the edges it brought back a memory of jericho phillipss boat so sharply that for an instant monk felt his gorge rise and was afraid he was going to be sick he strode across the carpeted floor to the door into the next cabin and jerked it open so hard it crashed against the wall and swung back on him orme followed him with the light monk heard his breath expelled in a sigh this cabin was similar only larger and at the far end there was a makeshift stage oh jesus orme said then apologized instantly the horror in his voice made his words scarcely a blasphemy more a cry for help as if god could change the truth of what the sergeant knew monk needed no explanation it was his worst imagining come true again this was another boat just like jericho phillipss where pornographic shows of children entertained those with a perverted addiction to such things and with an addiction to the danger of watching it live this was what phillips would have done with scuff and monk and hester would never have found him even if they had what of his heart and mind would have remained whole let alone his body were there boys here now locked behind other doors too afraid to make a sound orme moved forward and monk put a hand on his arm listen he ordered orme was breathing hard shaking a little for all his years on the river there were still times when the sight of pain tore through his control they both stood motionless ears straining the boat was well made even the joints in the wood did not creak with the faint movement of the water the tide had turned and was coming in again they must be here monk dropped his voice to a whisper they cant bring them out here for the show every time too many other boatstheyd be seen and too many chances to escape theyre here somewhere he could not even bring himself to say that they might all be dead a mutiny orme suggested with a lift of hope maybe they killed him one hit him with something two others strangled him that could be why the odd marks maybe it isnt a rope at all could be boys shirts all tied together he turned to face monk his features ghostly in the lantern light theyd have gone well never find them all the emotion of his unspoken meaning was in his face no point in even looking monk agreed murder by persons unknown he took a deep breath but wed better make certain therell be rooms for them below and a galley of some sort they have to feed them orme said nothing they found the ladder down and descended to the deck below immediately it was different the heavier more fetid air closed over them and the lantern shone on darker walls only a couple of feet away monk felt the sweat break out on his skin and then chill instantly his heart was knocking in his chest orme pushed at the first door but it held fast he lifted his foot and kicked it with all his weight it burst in and there was a cry from behind it he held the lantern higher and the yellow light showed four small boys thin narrowchested halfnaked and cowering together in the corner monk wiped his hand over his face forcing himself to focus its all right he said quietly nobodys going to hurt you parfitt is dead were going to take you away from here he stepped forward they all shrank farther back flinching though his hand was several feet away from the closest of them he stopped what could he tell them that they could believe they probably didnt know anything but this where was he going to send them anyway back into the streets some orphanage where they would be looked after by whom perhaps hester would know im not going to hurt you he repeated feeling useless they wouldnt believe him they shouldnt perhaps they shouldnt believe anyone are there more of you one nodded slowly well get you all and then take you ashore where to how many boats would they need it was night already what was he going to do with them a dozen or more small boys frightened hungry possibly ill certainly hideously abused then he thought of durban his predecessor and remembered his work with the foundling hospital well go where theyll look after you he said more firmly give you warm clothes food a clean bed to sleep in they looked at him as if they had no idea what he was saying it took monk and orme the rest of the night to find all of the fourteen boys and take them ashore a boatload at a time persuade them they were safe and then get them to the nearest hospital that would accept them later the hospital would send them on to a proper institution specifically for foundlings technically of course they were too old for that but monk trusted in the charity of the matrons in charge dawn was coming up pale over the east and lighting the water clean and chill soft colors half bleached away when monk stood with orme on the dock outside the wapping station of the river police he was so tired his bones ached he realized that in the three weeks since jericho phillipss death he had slowly let go of at least part of the horror of it now it was back as though it had been only yesterday it was the sweat and alcohol in the air the claustrophobia belowdecks but sharper and more real than anything else filling his nose and throat it was the smell of fear and death mickey parfitt was another jericho phillips one that catered to an upriver clientele away from the teeming closeness of the docks instead it was the quiet reaches of the river where deserted banks were marshy mistladen at morning and evening and stretches of silver water were treelined but in the night the same twisted brutality was enacted upon children probably the same blackmail of men addicted to their appetites to the danger of illegal indulgence the adrenaline pumping through their blood at the fear of being caught it was the same obliviousness to what they were doing to others perhaps because the others were children of the streets and docksides already abandoned by circumstance did monk want to know who had killed mickey parfitt not really it was a case in which he would be happier to fail but could he simply not try that was a different thing then he would be acting as both judge and jury about parfitt he was sure but what about the murderers next victim and the one after that could monk really set himself up to decide whose murder was acceptable and whose deserved trial and probably punishment he had made too many mistakes in the past for such certainty or was that the cowards fear of responsibility leave it to someone else then it cant be your fault where do we begin orme said quietly as the light broadened in the sky a string of barges was coming slowly up the river their wash barely disturbing the surface monk glanced sideways once seeing the anger and the grief in ormes blunt face they faced a long slow journey barely begun and ormes trust mattered to monk intensely find out more about him he replied slowly searching for the words perhaps his death was justified perhaps not it could have been a rival who was behind him who put in the moneyor took it out was he blackmailing people too orme nodded slowly he looked quickly at monk then back again at the river have some breakfast first and a little sleep get warm monk added with a slight smile chapter oliver rathbone waited in the withdrawing room for margaret to come downstairs they were going to dine with her parents and as usual it was a somewhat formal affair her two sisters and their husbands would also be present he walked to the windows and stared out at the darkening garden the september sun was warm on the last of the flowers in the herbaceous border purples and golds autumn colors it was the richest season soon even the leaves would flame berries would ripen blue wood smoke and early morning frosts were not far away for him the glory of autumn always held an echo of sadness a knowledge that beauty is a living thing delicate capable of injury even of death this would be the first time he would dine with arthur ballinger since the drownings at execution dock rathbone was dreading it yet of course it was inevitable ballinger was his fatherinlaw and margaret was unusually close to her family sullivan had made it hideously clear that he blamed the man behind the childabuse racket for his downfall from beginning to end but he had offered no proof that it was ballinger so legally and morally there was nothing rathbone could do about it sullivans words had been no more than those of a desperate man disgraced beyond recall outside a flock of starlings swirled up into the evening sky and clouds drifted in from the south for margarets sake rathbone knew he must pretend it would be difficult he did not find family gatherings easy anyway he was very close to his own father but their dinners together had the quiet comfort of old friends conversation about art and philosophy law and literature gentle amusement at the oddities of life and human nature there were companionable silences while they ate bread and cheese good pate drank a little red wine sometimes they had apple pie and cream by the fireside in the evening and shared a joke or two the door opened and margaret came in she saw rathbone standing and immediately apologized assuming she had kept him waiting she looked lovely in a gown of rich soft green the huge crinoline skirt bordered with a pattern of greek keys in gold i was early he replied finding it easier to smile than he had expected but i would have been happy to wait you look wonderful is the gown new surely i couldnt have forgotten it the stiffness disappeared from her back and became the grace he had first seen in her when he had been drawn to her sense of humor and the innate dignity that was her loveliest gift now he found his anxiety slipping away they would negotiate the evening whatever challenges it offered it was a family occasion the past and its unproved accusations should be left behind to entertain them was unjust come he offered her his arm the carriage will be at the door any moment he smiled at her and saw the answering pleasure in her eyes they arrived just after margarets elder sister gwen and her husband wilbert and followed them into the long oakpaneled withdrawing room wilbert was thin fairhaired and rather earnest rathbone had never discovered exactly what occupation he followed but apparently he had inherited money and was interested in politics gwen was only a year or two older than margaret and not unlike her to look at she had the same high smooth brow and soft hair her features were prettier but lacked a little of margarets individuality because of that to him she was less attractive the eldest sister celia was already present sitting on the couch opposite her husband george she was the handsomest of the three she had beautiful dark hair and eyes but rathbone noticed that she was beginning to thicken a little in the waist and was already more buxom than he cared for the diamonds at her ears must have cost as much as a good pair of carriage horses if not more mrs ballinger let go the embrace of her middle daughter and came forward to welcome margaret the last of her daughters to achieve matrimony but also the one who had done the best rathbone had not only money but now a title and he was very personable into the bargain how lovely to see you again oliver she said warmly i am so happy your commitments allowed you time for a little pleasure margaret my dear you look wonderful she kissed margaret on both cheeks and offered her hand to rathbone a moment later ballinger himself was shaking rathbones hand with a firm grip however his eyes were guarded offering no clues as to his inner thoughts had it always been like that or was rathbone noticing it now because of phillipss death and sullivans accusation they had barely time to exchange greetings and make a few polite inquiries as to health and recent social engagements when dinner was announced and they went into the enormous and lavish dining room with its hot indianred walls and glittering chandeliers its overspilling bowls of fruit on the sideboard the table which could have comfortably seated sixteen was superbly set with the best crystal and silver cutglass bowls of bonbons and snowwhite linen napkins folded like swans in the center there was one of the loveliest arrangements of flowers that rathbone could remember seeinglate roses in crimson and apricot and tawny bronze chrysanthemum heads it was given additional character by two spires of something deep rich purple mamainlaw he said spontaneously this is quite amazing i have never seen a more exquisite table anywhere she blushed with pleasure thank you oliver i believe even the best food is complemented by beauty to the eye she glanced at her husband to see if he had heard the compliment and when she saw that he had her satisfaction doubled they took their places and the first course was serveda delicate soup quickly finished it was followed by baked fish celia made some trivial remark about a display of drawings she had seen and her mother replied ballinger looked around them all smiling gradually the conversation embraced each one of them in turn there was laughter and compliments rathbone began to feel included ballinger asked his opinion a number of times on various subjects the fish was removed and saddle of mutton was served with roasted and boiled vegetables rich sauce and garnishes the men ate heartily the women accepting less and eating a mouthful or two and then resting before eating a little more conversation moved to more serious subjects social issues and matters of reform ballinger made a joke with quick dry wit and they all laughed rathbone told an anecdote they applauded it ballinger leading looking at them all to join in which they did as if given permission to be enthusiastic there was more wine and then pudding was served an excellent apple flan with thick cream or treacle tart for those who preferred most of the men took both rathbone looked across at margaret and saw the flush in her cheeks her eyes bright and soft he realized with surprise and considerable pleasure not only that she was happy but that she was actually proud of him not for his skills in argument or his professional reputation but for his charm which was so much more personal a thing the warmth inside him had nothing to do with the dinner or the wine they tried to get some curb on it through the house of lords several years ago he said in answer to a question of wilberts about industrial pollution in rivers in particular the thames i remember that george looked at ballinger then at rathbone narrowly defeated if im right ballinger nodded suddenly very sober lord cardew was one of the main backers of that poor man hopeless cause george said with a shake of his head far too much power behind it richer than the bank of england put all the filth there is into the rivers and were helpless to stop them we did stop them ballinger said sharply a ring of pride to his voice but it failed george pointed out in parliament yes ballinger argued but there was a civil suit a few months after that which they won on appeal a year later rathbone was interested pollution was a subject he cared about increasingly as he realized the human misery it caused but he knew the industrial might behind it and was surprised that an appeal could succeed really how on earth did anyone manage that it would come before the court of appeal and with that sort of money at stake most likely lord garslake himself would hear it garslake was master of the rolls the head of all civil justice appeals his leanings were well known his financial interests less so ballinger smiled he was persuaded to change his views he said quietly id like to know how george was openly skeptical ballinger looked at him with amusement i dare say you would but it is not a public matter did lord cardew have something to do with it mrs ballinger asked i know he felt deeply on the subject ballinger patted her arm lightly my dear you know better than to ask as i know better than to tell you you said poor man wilbert raised his eyebrows questioningly why ballinger shook his head oh because his elder son died boating accident somewhere in the mediterranean dreadful business his face was dark as if the sorrow of it were still with him in spite of the legal success margarets fingers rested gently on her fathers papa you grieved for him at the time i know it wont healperhaps such things never dobut you cant go on hurting for him at least he still has one son living ballinger raised his head a little and turned over his hand to clasp hers and hold it you are quite right of course my dear but not everyone is as fortunate in their children as i am you could not know nor should you but charles cardew was a magnificent young man sober honest highly intelligent with a great future in front of him rupert is in most ways his exact opposite handsomer to his downfall he stopped abruptly as if feeling that he had said too much is it a downfall to be handsome gwen asked curiously was poor charles plain then ballinger looked at her with a smile you know nothing of such men my dear rupert cardew is a wastrel a womanizer flattering and deceiving even married women whom one would imagine to have more judgment and more sense margaret looked uncomfortable she met rathbones eyes and then deliberately avoided them perhaps his grief sent him a little mad gwen suggested it can do so were they close i have no idea ballinger replied regarding her with slight surprise i dont think so and rupert was wild and selfish long before charless death it is generous of you to try to excuse him but im afraid his behavior is far worse than you imagine gwen would not let it go really lots of young men drink a little too much papa most of us know that we only pretend not to we have to pretend a lot of things celia added it is very foolish to admit to everything you know you can make life impossible for yourself really celia george remonstrated no amusement in his face whatever rathbone turned to margaret and saw the humor in her eyes it was a moment of understanding where words were unnecessary he found himself looking forward to the journey home when they would be alone in the carriage and then even more so to arriving im surprised if you havent heard word one place or another oliver ballinger lingered a moment before continuing poor cardew has had to bail rupert out of more than one scandal that would have blackened the family name if he hadnt i thought that was what you were referring to gwen said ruefully im afraid rupert cardew went a great deal further than that ballinger told her he has an ungovernable temper when he is roused he has beaten people very badly it is only his fathers intervention that has saved him from prison his voice dropped and yet he loves the boy as fathers do love their children no matter what sins they commit he looked at margaret then at gwen and finally at celia he sat quite still a large man heavyshouldered powerful his thickfeatured face benign until one tried to read the heavylidded eyes as black as coal under their drooping lids no one spoke there was an intensity of emotion at the table into which speech would have been intrusive even clumsy rathbone knew that hester had been accepting considerable donations of money from rupert for the financing of the clinic would she have taken them were she aware of his darker nature so different from the sunny charm he presented to her perhaps ballingers loyaltyone that could not be revealedhad also bound him to lord justice sullivan ballingers purchase of the obscene photographs that claudine burroughs had witnessed when shed followed arthur that night had not been for his own personal use but had been part of a last desperate attempt to rescue sullivan from himself that the attempt had failed was a grief ballinger could reveal to no one at all in that light arthurs sin was of a completely different weight and sullivan was dead it was sullivans surviving family that ballinger would be protecting the thought eased the knots inside rathbone and suddenly he was smiling it was mrs ballinger who resumed the conversation rathbone allowed the words to pass over him he thought instead of ballingers love for his daughters all of whom seemed to have brought him happiness rathbone looked at margaret now leaning forward listening to george as if what he was saying interested her though rathbone knew that it did not but she would never hurt georges feelings for celias sake the loyalty was deep always to be trusted relied on in hard times and easy he found himself gazing at her proud of her gentleness the last course was served and then the ladies withdrew leaving the gentlemen to pass the port and take a little cheese if they cared to in the withdrawing room the conversation was trivial again small matters of gossip and amusement rathbone found it hard to join in because he was not acquainted with most of the people they referred to and it was even harder to laugh at the humor the wit lacked the dryness that pleased him you are quiet oliver mrs ballinger observed turning from celia to face him her brow furrowed does something trouble you i hope it was nothing in the dinner of course it wasnt my dear ballinger said quickly he is out of sorts because over the port and cheese i criticized his friend monk who is i think a far more dangerous man than oliver wishes to accept his loyalty does him credit but i believe it is misplaced it is not an uncommon trait to think well of our friends in spite of evidence to the contrary he smiled a brief flash of teeth and it is in a way admirable i suppose he shrugged again very slightly merely a creasing of the fine fabric of his jacket but as he himself has just observed in the law we cannot afford such emotional luxuries we are the last refuge of those who desperately need no more and no less than justice bravo papa margaret said with a faint flush of pink across her cheeks how perfectly you balance the head and the heart you are right of course we cannot favor loyalty over justice or we betray not only those who trust in us but ourselves as well she looked at rathbone waiting for him to concede her fathers point in that instant he realized how deep her loyalty was to her father so deep that she did not even perceive that it was instinctive rather than a matter of reason it made her side against monk without hesitation was that what it came tothe loyalty of blood or was her devotion to her father stronger than any other love did he feel any less for his own father she was waiting now the question in her eyes it was not really about the law it was about monk and the long past they shared the battles margaret had not been part of and it was perhaps also about hester my loyalty has always been to the truth rathbone replied choosing his words with intense care but i believe that monks has also on occasion he has been mistaken so have i he was slipshod in his prosecution of jericho phillips and the man got off because i was more skilled and more diligent however if you recall phillips was undoubtedly guilty which means that monks judgment of the mans character was not at fault ballinger rested his large squareended fingers very gently on the leather arm of his chair that may be true oliver but you have missed the point monk has no right to be judging jericho phillips or anyone else he is a collector of evidence to present before the courtno more than that a sort of collector of moral refuse george added smugly glancing at ballinger and away again celia smiled then what are we oliver said hearing the cutting edge of his own voice sorters of that same refuse personally i am quite happy if the police at least begin the process and give me some sort of pattern either to confirm or deny oh really wilbert protested margaret looked unhappy a mounting shadow in her eyes rathbone realized with surprise that she had not expected him to argue in her opinion he should not have defended either monk or himself this quiet room was like thousands of other withdrawing rooms in london but in subtle ways he felt alien in it the painted walls were very similar to all the othersthe heavily swagged curtains the long windows onto the great garden certainly the busy red and green carpet even the brass fire irons in the hearth it was the beliefs that were foreign to him things as invisible and as necessary as the air perhaps we should speak of something else ballinger said leaning a little farther back in his armchair and crossing his legs i had a most amusing evening last thursday for the best part of the next hour he regaled them with a detailed and amusing account of his journey across the river with lurid descriptions of the ferryman and his interests apparently he had gone to visit an old friend named harkness who lived in mortlake when at last he finished celia began to laugh really papa you had me hanging on every word you said i could see the wretched ferryman bowlegs and all you think im joking to entertain you ballinger asked of course she rejoined and i thank you for it you are superb as always not at all he turned to rathbone go to the ferry at fulham and look for him youll find him there ask him about our conversation i challenge you any of you he looked back at wilbert and then george i believe you margaret stated still smiling it explains why you go to dine with a bore like mr harkness it isnt the dinner at all its the ride this time they all laughed they left late after more wine belgian chocolates and a last cup of tea thank you margaret said quietly as their carriage moved out into the traffic and she and rathbone sat side by side in the back the silk of her gown spread out and covered his knees rustling slightly as she turned toward him he could see her face in the flickering glow from the lamps of carriages moving in the opposite direction she was smiling her eyes soft for an instant he felt a complete belonging a sweetness that ran right through him he understood without effort exactly why ballinger found his other sonsinlaw irritating why he had to bait them and then in the end make them laugh whatever the trivial differences between all of them there was an underlying loyalty that remained steadfast through the surface ruffles caused by a moments annoyance or trivial misunderstandings one did not have to like in order to belong true loyalty was deeper than that stronger impervious to superficial emotions he put his hand out and took margarets where it lay on the silk of her skirt it was warm and her fingers closed over his with a sudden strength chapter monk began to look more deeply into the life of mickey parfitt his friends and enemies his patrons and the men he had used and cheated and whose appetites he had fed and if parfitt were truly like jericho phillips then of course there would also be those he had blackmailed but does a blackmailed man turn on the one who supplies his addiction only if he has reached the last shreds of despair and has nothing left to lose perhaps monk should see if any wellknown man had committed suicide in the last few days or had met with a death that was open to that interpretation mickey parfitt was not in himself a person of any importance people were dying up and down the river every week the river police could spare only a couple of men to investigate a crime of such little effect on the city or its population one petty criminal more or less did not stir fear or righteous outrage not really even interest it was a still hazy morning when monk and orme took a hansom from wapping all the way out to chiswick they would have gone by water but that would have meant following the twists and turns of the river and rowing that distance would have been backbreaking work they could certainly not have spared two more men for the task hardly know if i care orme said grimly as he sat staring straight ahead of him inside the cab it was going to be a mild day but he was dressed as always in a plain dark jacket and trousers with a cap pulled over his brow monk knew what was in his mind the frightened blankeyed children he had seen on phillipss boat and that other boys thin broken body they had pulled out of the water monk didnt care himself if they caught mickeys killer or not and to orme of all people he could not pretend that he did perhaps we wont find whoever did it he said wryly orme looked at him weighing how seriously he meant it monk shrugged of course murder deserves to be punished whoever the victim is if we get close well scare the wits out of him that was not a joke in the past many people had been frightened of monk it was not something he was entirely proud of some of them had been the men he worked with who were younger less able less agile of mind afraid of his cutting judgment hed been admired but also feared but that had been before the accident that had robbed him of his memory and when he had still been in the metropolitan police then after he had been dismissed he had worked for himself solving crimes for those whod employed him privately it was only after durbans death that he had been offered this position to lead the thames police on the river durban had not possessed monks ruthless skill in hunting down the truthfew people did but he had known how to lead men how to earn their loyalty draw out the best in them even inspire a kind of love above all they had trusted him monk had known him all too briefly they had been friends it was durban knowing he was dying who had suggested that monk take his place now monk had to justify that honor placed on him he had to learn the art of leading men starting with orme who had been durbans closest ally and well catch him if we can he added as if it were an unnecessary afterthought orme smiled as if he understood beyond the words and said nothing he sat back a little in the seat and his shoulders relaxed at the small local police station in chiswick they were greeted cautiously and taken into a warm poky office that smelled of strong tea and tobacco smoke the walls were lined with shelves the table was piled with papers monk and orme requested as much local knowledge as possible and monk asked the sergeant in charge a number of questions orme listened and took notes writing rapidly and with surprising neatness e were a nasty piece o work the sergeant said describing mickey parfitt cant let murder go but if we could ooever done im ind be my first pick not ter find as it were he sighed owever seems we cant do that or gawd knows where itd finish well do all we can to elp yer find the poor sod oo did it a look of amusement flashed across his broad face mind yerve got a lot ter choose from an thats the truth what was he doing out there on the boat by himself monk asked perching on the edge of one of the rickety chairs any ideas if you could prove anything youd have had him locked up already but whom do you suspect and dont tell me theres too many to choose from the sergeant smiled widely a warm spontaneous gesture that lit his bony face wouldnt think of it sir were too far up the river for smuggling there int nobody up ere worth thievin from although i used ter wonder if e were fencin stuff so i made the chance to go out an look but i didnt see a thing lot of people coming and going monk asked yeah thats part o why i thought e were fencin stuff what sort of people monk found himself tense waiting he did not look at orme but he could feel orme stiffen also no women the sergeant replied shaking his head so if thats what yere thinking yere wrong if it was that simple id ave stopped im meself always men an if yer looked close enough welltodo men at that gamblins my thoughts igh stakes life or death sort o stuff ad one top isself almost a year ago no doubt of itdid it isself shot through the ead his amiable face twisted in an expression of pity alone in a small boat pretty little gun there with im pearl andled spose e lost more n e could pay dunno wot gets into folk a tiredness touched him as if he had seen too much and it exhausted his pity monk thought of the man alone in the boat holding the gun in his hands probably cold almost certainly shaking it had to do with honor as the sergeant supposed but not moneythe dishonor of being exposed as a man who looked at obscene photographs and used the degradation and abuse of little boys to satisfy his dark hunger but monk did not need to tell the sergeant that now who works for him he asked i know about orrie jones and tosh wilkin and crumble what can you tell me about them orries a bit simple the sergeant replied but not as daft as e makes out e can be sharp enough if it suits im crumbles a follower does as es told tosh yer need to watch he shook his head es another bad un never bin able ter catch im in enough ter put im away his face brightened think e couldve bin the one ter do mickey i doubt it monk said with regret i think it was very much in toshs interest to keep mickey alive and profitable earning money for both of them was e an opulent receiver then that was the term for someone who bought and sold highquality stolen articles such as jewelry works of art ivory or gold no monk replied with near certainty he was a pornographer and probably a pimp of little boys for a few select customers the sergeant blasphemed quietly half under his breath he did not apologize so perhaps he was taking the lords name very much in earnest still willing to help us find whoever killed him monk asked a harsh smile twisting his mouth the sergeant looked straight at him blue eyes steady o course sir but im sorry to say i dont think as i know anything asd be of use to yer monk laughed a harsh oblique pleasure in it what a shame im sure you would have a list of ferrymen boatbuilders cabdrivers shopkeepers near the water the kind of person who might have seen something course sir did mickey often go out to his boat alone no idea sir ard to say on a misty night oo goes where thats the trouble with the river but being river police an all i expect you know that better than i do did mickey own the boat the sergeant looked startled dunno but i spose yer could find out i intend to monk thanked him and went outside into the brightening morning air the sharp light off the water shifted and glittered with the incoming tide barge sails showed rustyred canvases barely filled a few leaves were beginning to turn color some even drifted down already the street was busy carts rattled over the rough stones and men shouted to one another as they loaded and unloaded sacks barrels lengths of timber what dyou reckon he was out there for at that hour of night orme asked quietly as they walked over the road to the waters edge someone set him up possibly monk conceded hitting him over the head could be a crime of opportunity the assailant could have used any piece of wood lying around a broken oar half a branch anything but who carries around a rope with knots in it piece of rigging from a boat orme questioned always rope on boats or in a boatyard true monk agreed but did he carry it with him or did he kill mickey somewhere else then toss him into the water and let him drift there arent any boatyards upstream of where he was foundat least not near his own boat which is where we think he went in i suppose we could be wrong but if the next boatyard is miles upriver why carry him back again just to confuse us orme pursed his lips premeditated he said with certainty somebody came meaning to kill him not surprising considering his occupation whats surprising is that it didnt happen sooner maybe orrie crumble and tosh looked after him monk was thinking aloud in which case either they were outwitted or they turned on him and at least one of them sold him to his murderer orme looked at him sideways a rare amusement in his eyes perhaps at the justice of the idea then before monk could be absolutely certain of it he looked away again i suppose wed better look for who that could be he said expressionlessly they spent the morning speaking to the various men whose livelihood kept them on the river or close to its banks boatbuilders shipwrights chandlers breakers suppliers of oars sculls and other fittings for boats they learned nothing that added to what they already knew they had a lunch of bread cold ham and chicken and a glass of ale each then orme left to question the ferrymen monk went to find orrie jones again in the cellars of the public house moving kegs of ale i told yer orrie said his wandering eye veering wildly the other fixed on monk i took im out ter the boat summink arter eleven it were e tol me ter come back fer im but i were eld up an i were late when i got there bit before one e were gorn i dint see nobody else an i dunno oo killed im what did he go out to the boat for monk asked patiently he did not know why he was asking all this it probably made no difference he was doing it to convince himself that he was trying to find the truth and to prove who had killed parfitt orrie was staring at him incredulously leaning a little against a pile of kegs ow do i know yer think i asked im who else did you tell monk persisted orrie looked indignant nobdy yer sayin as i set im up did you it was a possibility a fight over the spoils course i didnt whyd i do a thing like that orrie protested for money monk replied or because you were more scared of whoever paid you than you were of mickey parfitt orrie drew in his breath to argue then let it out again clearly having thought better of it he looked sideways at monk for once both his eyes more or less in the same direction i dint tell no one but mickey went out there often like there were things that needed seein ter an e dint trust no one else ter do it right he didnt trust you monk pressed pretending surprise orries face tightened sensible to the insult it was clear from his furrowed expression that he was now taking a great deal more care before he answered mebbe somebdy were watchin he suggested e were clever were mickey but e got enemies king o that bit o the river e were who else did you see when you went back for him monk asked this time orrie weighed his answer for several moments monk waited with interest studying orries extraordinary face sometimes the lie a man chose could tell you more about him than the truth theres always people on the water orrie started cautiously monk smiled of course if there werent thered be no business right orrie nodded slowly still apparently watching monk people wi money he added so what did mickey parfitt sell to them monk asked him orrie looked totally blank as if he had not understood orrible what did mickey parfitt sell to these men with money monk repeated carefully he made a very good living or he couldnt have afforded a boat at all never mind one with fittings like those in his boat i dunno orrie said helplessly yer suppose e told the likes o me no orrie i suppose you had enough sense to see for yourself orrie shook his head not me i never bin on the boat i took folk out an i brung em back i dunno wot they done gamblin mebbe he looked hopeful monk stared at him with his swiveling eye it was impossible to tell if he was frightened halfwitted or simply physically disadvantaged monk considered asking him what the boys were for but perhaps it would be better to keep that question for later let orrie wonder for a while where they had gone to or perhaps he really didnt know it might have been crumble or even tosh whod looked after them orrie smiled ask tosh ell know he offered monk thanked him and went in search of tosh it took him nearly an hour and a great deal of questioning but at last he found him in a cramped but surprisingly tidy office there was a woodstove burning in one corner in spite of the comparative warmth of the day instantly monk knew what had happened and cursed himself for his stupidity he should have left someone following tosh and probably crumble as well then they would have found the papers in time to save them tosh and crumble might deny it but mickey was bound to have had certain things noted down debts and ious if nothing else tosh looked up at monk his face calm even affecting interest found anything yet as ter oo killed poor mickey he inquired politely today he had a yellow vest on and he flicked a piece of ash off it carefully monk stood still in the middle of the floor three feet from tosh and the stove controlling his anger with difficulty business rival or a dissatisfied customer he replied or one who couldnt take being blackmailed anymore like the poor sod who shot himself on the river last year toshs face tightened almost imperceptibly dunno why e did that he said smoothly could a bin anything mebbe is wife ran orff it appens rubbish monk snapped at him upperclass women with rich husbands dont run off with other men and create a scandal they stay at home and take lovers on the side they do it very discreetly and everybody else pretends not to know leaves the husbands the latitude to do the same should they wish to looks like you know em better n i do tosh replied with a slight sneer but then i spose you would bein police an all so youd be best placed to guess why at poor bastard shot isself dont see as ow it as anything ter do wiv oo croaked mickey in fact es fer sure one o them oo didnt seein as es dead isself monk ignored the jibe revenge he suggested one of the dead mans family coming after mickey maybe only makes sense if mickeyd killed im tosh was watching him very carefully now which e didnt monk smiled i thought youd know about it a flicker of anger crossed toshs face i dunno nothing about it what did mickey sell to his customers tosh and dont tell me again that you dont know youve just destroyed all the papers except those that prove his ownership of the boat so that you can keep it for yourself there was an ugly stain of color in toshs face now but he didnt attempt to deny it jus burned a few private things a mans a right ter that int you got no respect for the dead mickey were the victim of a murder int it your job ter be on is side he looked up his eyes gleaming with bright malicious innocence monk looked back equally blankly wondering where the blackmailing photographs were he glanced around the small room there were cupboards and drawers on every wall as if for an office of detailed business dealings here there would be just a record of debts and payments dates names amounts the pictures would have been far more carefully hidden as jericho phillipss had been perhaps even tosh didnt know that the thought of phillipss pictures still made monks stomach lurch with rage and disgust so violent that he was nauseous with it but he forced a smile looking for the pictures were you tosh was staring at him studying his face he must have considered lying and decided against it just wanted to find out oo owed im still an o course oo e owed got ter pay the bills he gave a tight ugly smile of course monk agreed i imagine his partners will be after their share of the takingspresent and future will you be keeping the business on tosh this time tosh was caught ow do i know he answered irritably i jus worked for im int none of it mine no of course not monk agreed and saw the anger harden in toshs face he would have liked it to have been his he would be waiting now for the silent partner whoever it was who had put in the money in the first place to turn up and take the lions share someone had backed mickey parfitt just as someone had backed jericho phillips sullivan had said that it was ballinger who been behind phillips was that true or the lie of a desperate man seeking a last revenge but to what end if ballinger was not actually involved because ballinger had seen his weakness and in some way used it and could ballinger be behind both of them or was monk only entertaining the idea because he was so desperate to believe he could end this hideous trade at least here on the river he had taken for his own and it was even more urgent to him to give scuff the illusion of safety that would stop the nightmares and make him believe there really was someone who could protect him from the worst fears and atrocities of life and did monk need for himself to be the one who saved scuff if so that was his own weakness and to pursue ballinger for it was worse than unjust it was vicious and irrational the kind of obsession he most despised in others tell me about the night mickey was killed he said abruptly tosh was startled but after the initial surprise his confidence returned as if now monk had moved away from the area of danger i told yer already he repeated the detailed account of his movements exactly as he had said before almost reciting it of course monk would check butlooking at toshs facehe was certain he would find it all well proved perhaps as well as if tosh had known he would need it to withstand investigation a faint satisfaction gleamed behind his anger now what do you think monk said to orme as they sat in the hansom on the way back toward wapping it was dusk and they had done all they could for the day monk was tired not his feethe was used to walkingbut in his mind he felt as if jericho phillips were back and he monk were retracing the pain of the old failure did he secretly want parfitts murderer to escape because he would like to kill all men like that himself especially if parfitt had like phillips been prepared to murder the boys who became troublesome as they grew too mature to satisfy the tastes of their abusers could it even be one of them escaped returned and now strong enough who had killed parfitt in revenge if it was then monk had no desire to catch him perhaps he would deliberately fail to even at the cost of his own so fiercely nurtured reputation he looked across at orme beside him trying to read his face in the flashes of lamplight from passing hansoms going the other way it told him nothing except that orme was troubled also which monk already knew who put up the money for the boat in the first place monk asked orme pursed his lips and whyd he kill parfitt getting above himself dyou suppose stealing the profits perhaps monk replied what did crumble have to say just what youd expect orme said lots of men coming and going mostly welldressed but keeping very quiet always after dark and trying to look like they were just taking a ferry or something like that ormes mouth was drawn tight his lips a thin line in the reflected lamplight its phillips all over again just this time somebody else got to him before we did one of his clients victims of blackmail one of his boys monk tried to frame the ugliest thought in his mind the one he did not want ever to look at but ormes own honesty was too allinclusive for monk to say anything less now without it being a deliberate evasion it cost monk an effort he had never worked with others before whom he trusted he had commanded but not led he was only lately beginning to appreciate the difference or his backer needing to silence him could be orme replied quietly dont know how well find that out let alone get evidence no monk agreed neither do i yet when monk finally reached home it had long been dark the glare of the city lights was reflected back from a low overcast sky making the blackness of the river look like a tunnel through the sparks and gleams and the glittering smear of brightness all around he walked up the hill from the ferry landing at princes stairs turned right on union road then left into paradise place he could hear the wind in the leaves of the trees over on southwark park and somewhere a dog was barking he let himself in with his own key too often he was home long after hester needed to be asleep although she almost always waited up for him this time she was sitting in the big chair in the front room the gas lamp still burning her sewing had slipped from her hands and was in a heap on the floor she was sound asleep he smiled and walked quietly over to her how could he avoid startling her he went back and closed the door with a loud snap of the latch she woke sharply pulling herself upright then she saw him and smiled im sorry she apologized i must have drifted off she was still blinking sleepily but trying through the remnant of dreams to study his face ill get us a cup of tea he said gently this was home comfortable familiar where he had been happier than he had thought possible here he was freer than anywhere else in the world and yet also more bound because it mattered so much to lose it would be unbearable it would have been easier to care less to believe there was something else that could nourish his heart if need be but there wasnt and he knew it hows scuff he asked over his shoulder fine hester answered bending to pick up the fallen sewing and put it away i didnt tell him you found another boat if he has to know ill tell him later she came up behind him are you hungry yes suddenly he realized that he was bread will do cold game pie she offered ah yes it was not until he was sitting down with pie and vegetables and a cup of tea that he realized she intended to draw from him all that he had learned so far not as much as the pie is worth he said what isnt she tried to look as if she did not know what he meant but ended with a brief laugh at herself is it another one like phillipss she said softly yes im sorry between mouthfuls monk told her what he knew so far keeping his voice so low that he would hear any creak of scuffs footsteps on the stairs she was very grave could it be arthur ballinger she asked when he came to a stop she knew of sullivans charge yes he answered not to have killed him of course but he could be the one backing the enterprise financially and taking a share of the profits could you prove it perhaps ill put orme on to the accounts tomorrow and see if he can trace the ownership of the boat back to someone although ill be surprised if its that easy she was sitting upright her back stiff the lamplight made her hair look fairer than it was almost like a halo so why would ballinger kill him or have him killed do you think phillipss death scared him and he was afraid you would pursue the issue until you found who was behind it monk considered the idea for several moments would he have taken sullivans word unverified as it was and continued to hunt for whoever had conceived the original idea found the rich men ripe for the danger and the titillation of child pornography perhaps the threat of the double disgrace of child abuse and homosexuality was part of the excitement these men had not considered the possibility that the very hand that tempted them and then fed them would in the end also administer the wounds that would bleed them dry for that monk had a shard of pity what he did not forgive was that they had not considered the wretched children who paid for mens entertainment with humiliation and pain sometimes with their lives yes he knew now here in the place of his own precious safety that he did not want to catch whoever had killed mickey parfitt the law would not recognize selfdefense because this murder had obviously not been done in hot blood the knotted rope embedded in parfitts throat alone proved that but morally that is what it was getting rid of a predator who destroyed the young and the weak william hester prompted he looked up yes i suppose ballinger might have been frightened by phillipss death sooner or later i would have gone after whoever was behind phillips but if parfitt hadnt been murdered it might have been later the shadow of a smile touched her mouth how much later a month two he shrugged slightly she was very serious now do you suppose parfitt knew that and got greedy put on a little pressure took advantage of what he thought was a vulnerability it was possible if parfitt were the opportunist he seemed then he might well have seized the chance to try to take over a far larger part of the business it was something monk could not evade wherever it led him as if reading his thoughts hester asked the question he did not want to answer could sullivan have been telling the truth i dont know he admitted looking up and meeting her eyes id give a lot for it not to be for margarets sake and even more for rathbones and scuff he frowned is it better for him to let it all go hoping hell forget it or to drag it out into the open and get rid of it if we can that means exposing it like a great new wound for him to see and feel all over again and all the other boys her voice was measured we cant heal the world he replied there will always be those we cant do anything about what we can touch is so small as to be almost invisible compared with what we cant it isnt how much you do its the question of whether doing anything or nothing is better for him is that what matters whats right for scuff he asked yes she breathed in and out and looked away from his eyes no of course thats not all but its where i start you didnt answer me which is better for scuff i know he still has nightmares i hear you get up in the night i know hes probably about nine or ten for all that he says hes eleven and has been saying for nearly a year in some ways hes far older than that fairy tales wont do for him the only thing hell believe is something close to the truth he lowered his voice he doesnt have a very high opinion of my knowledge or my common sense he takes great pride in looking after me but at least he thinks i dont ever lie to him its the only thing he knows for certain i cant break that i know hester was still chewing her lip youre right to try to protect him from it is ridiculous its a sort of denial of his experience as if we didnt believe him thats the last thing he needs i dont know how much hes a child and how much a man she smiled and he saw the hurt behind it and i dont think i really know very much about children anyway i think hes afraid of being touched in case he loses the independence he needs to keep in order to survive maybe one day youll do it right monk said gently youre good with the difficult ones he looked at her sitting across the table from him in the lamplit kitchen with its gleaming pans and familiar china on the dresser her eyelids were heavy her hair falling out of its pins from her sleep in the chair her plain blue dress vaguely reminiscent of her nursing days but she was ready now to fight anyone and everyone to defend scuff with a thrill of surprise monk suddenly understood what beauty was really about ill find whoever killed mickey parfitt and put an end to the pornography boats whoever is behind them no matter who gets hurt by it he promised even if its oliver she asked he hesitated only a moment yes she smiled and there was an intense gentleness in her eyes the man you used to be could do that but are you sure you can now whoevers behind this wont go down easily hell take everyone with him that he can think of what hes already done and youll know that it could be you meher voice droppedscuff anyone are you prepared for that this time he was silent for several moments before he answered this first surrender would only be the beginning he said if i back off now i may spend the rest of my life giving in every time i could lose anything she leaned forward a little and put her hand over his she nodded but she did not speak the following day monk and orme returned to chiswick to begin following the money invested in mickeys business and the financing of his boat the only part of it that would be clear was the payment to the previous owner and probably much of the maintenance costs and the occasional repair and improvement mickey must have handled a great deal of money at one time or another at least some of it would have left traces whoever had repaired the boat would also know where it had been think itll help orme said bleakly they were standing on the bank of the river just above the hammersmith creek the next bend eastward toward the city got a better idea monk asked we know what orrie crumble and tosh are going to tell us asking again wont make any difference the breeze was cool on their faces and smelled of mud and weeds orme stared across the water tosh is a bad un he replied but i cant see why hed kill mickey he hasnt the skill to take his place and hes not stupid enough to think he has crumble just does as hes told cant work out whether orries as daft as he looks or not fear or money monk said thoughtfully probably money sooner or later we have to find whatever records remain and recreate as much as we can from other people a lot of money passed through parfitts hands he will have had to account to the man behind it all orme winced one of his customers i hope so monk was surprised how intensely he meant that they spent that day and the following two searching for every trace of money or records that parfitt might have kept other than those tosh had burned they questioned ferrymen and bargemen workers in every boatyard on either side of the river from brentford to hammersmith every supplier of rope paint canvas nails or any other ships goods or tools they followed the course of the boats mornings its few trips up and down the river the repairs mooring fees quantities of food and alcohol made the nature of the business obvious the income must have been very large indeed the pattern of it also showed where the boat had been most of the time including where clients had been picked up in chiswick along the mall and in such places of pleasure as the infamous cremorne gardens by daylight cremorne gardens were a magnificent replacement of what vauxhall gardens had once been there were long smooth lawns shaded by elegant trees there were flower beds walks colored lamps grottoes illuminated temples conservatories a platform with a thousand mirrors where an orchestra played there were ballets performed a marionette theater even a circus on the greater open spaces there were fireworks displays and the place was famous for its balloon ascents by night it was also notorious for its lewd dancing its drinking and assignations of all kinds some consummated on the spot as the bushes narrower walks and grottoes allowed other assignations further outside the law would happen elsewhere less publicly who took em all out and back for their evenings entertainment from up here orme asked more of himself than of monk probably orrie or crumble monk replied as they watched the light fade over the stretch of the river flies dipping lazily on the water fish making little rings of ripples as they broke the surface but if they say it was gambling it would be difficult to prove otherwise what were the children doing orme said sarcastically serving their brandy dyou suppose they could tell us anything his voice cracked a little some of them are only five or six years old they dont even know what happened to them they think theyre being punished for something they did monk looked at ormes face in the evening light blunt almost bruised by this new realization about himself orme had served the law all his life and now he doubted what they were doing a few days ago monk had wondered if orme had thought monk was squeamish too soft to do his job now he saw in ormes averted face exactly the same pain he felt himself but victims need justice not pity he thought of scuff and wondered if either was really any good what they needed was for it not to have happened in the first place it was first thing the following morning when the police surgeon reported to monk regarding the death of mickey parfitt the surgeon was a dark man thinfaced with a gallows humor he found monk in the chiswick police station studying the records they had recreated regarding the finances of parfitts business morning the surgeon said cheerfully closing the door behind him firmly they had met several times before good morning dr gordimer monk replied i assume you have something on parfitts death came for the hospitality gordimer replied bleakly staring around the small chaotic office with its piles of books and papers balanced precariously on every available surface any misplaced addition would send at least one pile crashing this is better than the morguemarginally well warmer at least i prefer the dog and duck monk said drily gordimer grunted do you normally make this much mess have you lost something youll probably lose it all at this rate have you got anything new about parfitt i already know he was hit over the head and then strangled ah but what with gordimer said with satisfaction rope twine something better monk put down the paper he was reading and stared hopefully at the surgeons sardonic face much better gordimer said with a smile he fished into his pocket and brought out a length of cloth it was filthy and bloodspotted but very recognizably knotted at regular lengths monk reached for it gordimer moved it just beyond his grasp what is it monk said curiously looks like a rag gordimer nodded a very expensive silk rag to be precise from close and expert examination i believe that when it is unknotted and carefully washed even ironed it will prove to be a gentlemans cravat from the little i have learned it is made of heavy silk embroidered with gold leopardsthree of them one above the other very like those on the queens arms in the flag monks stomach lurched youre not no gordimer agreed drily im not i said like there is nothing royal about this any gentleman of meansand i would add good tastemight acquire such a cravat expensive very it was what killed him i dug it out of his neck man what more do you want can you take a photograph of it and have it attested to monk asked then we can undo it and wash it and see it more clearly if we can find out who owned it we shall be a great deal further forward probably gordimer agreed very probably thank you monk said sincerely my pleasure gordimer replied at least i think so not totally sure nasty little swine like parfitt monk smiled at him and said nothing but finding the owner of the cravat was easier to say than to do monk had not expected any help from tosh crumble or orrie jones nor did he receive it the best places to try after that were where customers of that wealth and fashion might be picked up for the boat such as cremorne gardens but there was no point in visiting during the day the people he was looking for were those of the night he began just before dusk the cravat itself was safely locked away as evidencehe could not risk being robbed of it he had with him a very accurate drawing of it as it would have been had the valet just presented it to its owner to put on it was even colored very carefully with paint the little gold leopards standing out he went in to cremorne gardens through the great arched wroughtiron gates with the name in huge letters over the top there were little knots of people standing around arms waving expressively and there was lots of laughter and the sound of music in the air he walked past them to begin with looking for the more discreet business not the idlers but the people who were familiar with the place and had come for a specific purpose those were the ones who might have the information he was looking for everyone he saw was drinking showing off always with a roving eye looking for more and greater pleasure when monk demanded their attention they were annoyed and disinclined to look at the drawing for more than a second or two before denying having seen such a cravat before monks temper began to fray he was still not sure he wanted to find whoever had wrapped this beautiful piece of silk around parfitts neck and tightened it until he was dead if the law had done it with an ordinary piece of hempen rope they would have called it justice what he wanted was the man whod put up the money to buy and furnish the boat who befriended those with weaknesses it was he who had brought men to that dark place on the river where they could feel the excitement of danger where the lazy blood suddenly pumped harder with horror the scent of pain and the knowledge that they were flirting with ruin he had carefully photographed the obscenity then when the blood was cold clogging again in the veins with familiar safety he would tell them that there was an indelible record of what they had done and their own private dabbling in hell would cost them moneyfor the rest of their lives monk followed a winding gravel pathway to a graceful pavilion under the trees and stood watching men and women parade by their faces garish for a moment under the lights a short man with a black mustache linked arms with a girl half his age her ample flesh strained at her bodice her laughter sounded vaguely tinny as if it were forced through her throat many of those women were paid for what they did another couple strolled past his hat was askew her red skirts swaying the men were buying pleasures they could not win at home perhaps they were clumsy greedy or inadequate perhaps the sanctity of the home prevented the passion they had been taught a lady did not enjoy it was more likely that love of any kind was the last thing in their hearts they might need pain danger or simply endless variety they were all around him laughing too loudly the women too brightly colored in all of it monk could sense a pervasive loneliness a compulsion not an enjoyment he approached a man selling tickets to one of the dance floors i want to be discreet he said with a very slight smile there are gentlemen here who would rather not have it known that they take their pleasures in such a place or should i say they perhaps prefer the darkness if you understand me yes sir the man said guardedly cant say as i can do anything about that yes you can i am from the thames river police i can come back here in uniform with a lot of assistance also in uniform if you make that necessary im hoping to find a little cooperation that will very quietly embarrass a few rather than more publicly embarrass many i see sir the man said quickly which few did you ave in mind im sure as i can elp yer i thought you might monk pulled out the drawing of the cravat specifically whoever wears a tie like this one the man regarded it with disinterest then something in it struck a chord of memory monk saw it in his face the man flushed weighing the chances of lying and getting away with it he looked at monks eyes and made his decision looks like the young man wot comes with mr bledsoe sir not that i could say for sure like describe him monk said curtly tall fair air andsome full o charm but then them gents is born to it i guess it comes on the silver spoon they got in their gobs i imagine so tell me about mr bledsoe how do you know his name cos i eard im called by it o course dyer think im a bleedin mind reader monk ignored the challenge what does he look like he asked curiously shorter dark air eyes a bit close tergether always wears a top at spose it makes im a bit taller he snickered at the idea big ands i noticed as e ad great big ands monk thanked him and left it did not take him long the next day to look up the bledsoe family and make a few inquiries at police stations in mayfair park lane and kensington he mentioned that a piece of jewelry had been lost and he wanted to return it to its owner discreetly no one argued with him and he had no conscience about lying he found the honorable alexander bledsoe who answered the description of the man in cremorne gardens with extraordinary accuracy his wellcaredfor but unusually large hands removed any doubt he chose to see monk without family or servants present what can i do for you officer he said with carefully judged casualness im looking for the gentleman who lost a rather fine silk cravat monk replied smoothly i believe he might be a friend of yours not that i know of bledsoe smiled slightly his shoulders relaxed and the uneasiness vanished but if anyone mentions it ill tell them its been found leave it at the local station theres a good fellow someonell pick it up he seemed to consider looking into his pocket for a coin his hand moved and then stopped he turned as if to leave monk pulled the picture of the cravat out of his pocket and held it up its rather distinctive he observed bledsoe glanced at it and frowned what the hell is this he said sharply if youve found the thing where is it at the police station in safekeeping monk replied well get the damn thing and bring it to me ill see that its returned bledsoe said irritably its important that i return it to the right person do you know who that is sir monk persisted yes i do bledsoe snapped now go and fetch it dammit man whats the matter with you monk folded the picture and replaced it in his pocket whose is it sir bledsoe glared at him rupert cardews at least it looks like one he wore for gods sake why are you making such a hell of a fuss about a damn cravat monk felt a void open up inside him he knew how much hester liked rupert cardew and how he had helped the clinic his generosity had enabled them to buy far more medicine than before and so treat more people are you sure he was startled by the hoarseness in his voice yes i am bledsoe was losing his temper now fetch it and ill give it back to him or ill see that you pay for your insolence im sorry sir i cant return it to you in the foreseeable future or to mr cardew it was used in a crime it will be evidence when the case comes to court what do you mean a crime bledsoe was taken aback his skin losing its color his stance suddenly changed it was used to strangle a man monk told him with some satisfaction the blood rushed hot into bledsoes face you tricked me he accused him i asked you if you knew whose it was you answered me monk said icily do you mean that had you known it was used in a crime then you would have lied damn you bledsoe said between his teeth i shall deny it monk looked at him lifting his own lip in a suggestion of disdain if that is what your code of honor says you must do sir then you must follow your conscience it is very noble of you bledsoe looked startled noble yes sir now that i know whose it is it will be easy enough to prove you will look something of a fool in court and everything of a liar but you will have been loyal to your friend good day sir he turned on his heel and strode away he was furious but far more than that he was filled with misery he desperately did not want the suspect to be someone he likedworse someone hester liked mickey parfitt had been a monster any of his victims could have been tempted to destroy him even if afterward they would have regretted either their rage or their loss of the fuel hed supplied for their appetite it simply had not occurred to monk that rupert cardew with his wealth his privilege and above all his charm should have become entangled in such filth why not dependency had nothing to do with position it was about need perhaps someone had stolen the cravat from him monk hoped so it would not solve the crime but then perhaps that did not matter over the next two days he traced rupert cardew to various prostitutes in the chiswick area and farther south along the riverbank the water and its people seemed to fascinate rupert as if there were both a vitality and a danger in its moods its sleeping surface so often smooth reflecting the light and hiding its own heart he found other witnesses who had seen rupert who knew his tastes women he had used from time to time it was not difficult to follow the trail of the money he had gambled and lost the debts he had paid only with his fathers help eventually there was no reasonable doubt left monk took orme with him and went to the magnificent house in chelsea where rupert cardew still lived with his father he chose to go early in the morning on purpose so there was little chance either lord cardew or rupert would be out the butler admitted him perhaps he should have gone to the back door but that was something he had always refused to do even when he had been a junior officer in the metropolitan police now as commander of the thames river police he did not even think of it i require to speak to mr rupert cardew regarding a most serious matter he said gravely as he was shown to the morning room to await ruperts convenience the interior of the house was magnificent in the manner of one that has been lived in by the same family for generations little was new the large hallway had a marbleflagged floor worn uneven by the passage of feet over generations the wooden banister sweeping down from the gallery above was darkened in places by the constant touch of hands there was a carved chest with animals on it which had been carefully mended in the morning room the carpet was beautiful but the sun of countless summers had muted the colors the leather on the chairs was scuffed in places at another time he would have loved the room today it hurt fueling his anger against mickey parfitt and all that hed soiled with his manipulation of weakness he told the footman that he would wait until mr cardew had had his breakfast and asked to see the valet he felt deceitful to show the picture of the cravat to a servant first trading on his innocence but in the end it was less cruel than placing him in the position where he could lie and would feel obliged to do so when it was identified monk waited until rupert came into the morning room he looked as easy and charming as when monk had met him at the clinic in portpool lane morning monk he said with a smile then he stopped god man you look dreadful nothing wrong with mrs monk i hope for a moment fear flickered in his face as if it mattered to him monk felt the deceit scorch inside him he pulled the picture out of his pocket again and held it up your valet says that this is yours its pretty distinctive rupert frowned its a piece of paper did you find my cravat if this is yours yes is it monk insisted rupert looked at him with complete incomprehension why on earth does it matter yes its mine why monk had a moments doubt had cardew no idea what he had done was parfitt so worthless that he really didnt think killing him mattered as if reciting something pointless monk told him it was used to murder someone called mickey parfitt we found his body in the water at he stopped rupert was ashen suddenly the meaning of it was clear to him and you think i did it he had trouble articulating the words he swayed a little put out his hand to grasp something but there was nothing there yes mr cardew i do think so monk said quietly i wish i didnt i wish i could believe he died of natural causes but that is impossible he was strangled with your cravat i rupert made a jerky little movement with his hand his eyes never leaving monks face is there any point in my denying it its not my decision monk told him i might choose to believe you whatever the facts say but you knew him you patronized his appalling boat he blackmailed most of his clients it was only a case of which one broke first i didnt kill him rupert said quietly his face scarlet i paid and lent someone your cravat to kill him with it was stolen or or i lost it i dont know ruperts expression said he did not expect to be believed monk wished rupert would stop it was hopeless please dont make it worse than it is he said have you told my father no you may if you prefer but dont run away rupert asked with a flash of agonizing humor i wont please wait here i shall return in a few minutes he kept his word ten minutes later he was in a hansom sitting silently between monk and orme chapter rathbone felt a touch of chill in the pit of his stomach when his clerk told him monk was in the waiting room looking tired and rather drawn send him in rathbone replied he wanted to get it over with he would find it hard to give his full attention to a client with his imagination racing as to what it was that monk had discovered the fact that he had come to rathbone at all made it inescapable that it had to do with mickey parfitts murder and the boat on which hed practiced his particularly filthy trade rathbone had tried to put from his mind sullivans words blaming arthur ballinger for his downfallfirst the temptation then the corruption had his mind been deranged and he had blamed ballinger because he could not accept his own responsibility for what he had become there had never been anything but words perhaps hystericalno facts not even any details sullivan could not have invented himself monk came in through the door and closed it behind him the clerk was right he looked tired and miserable almost defeated the iron fist inside rathbones stomach clenched tighter he waited i found out who killed mickey parfitt monk said quietly the proof seems pretty conclusive i thought youd like to know i would rathbone snapped so damned well tell me dont stand there like an undertaker with toothachetell me a smile flickered across monks face and disappeared rupert cardew rathbone was stunned he had difficulty believing it certainly rupert was a little dissolute but surely not more than many young men with too much money and too many privileges how on earth could he have become so degraded so young and yet even as a kind of sorrow washed over rathbone so did a relief it was ridiculous to think that arthur ballinger could really have been involved with pornography blackmail and murder if claudine burroughs had been correct and it really was ballinger she had seen in the alley outside the shop with the photographs then ballinger must have been helping a friend acting in his capacity of solicitor for some poor devil in over his head possibly he had even been attempting to pay off the blackmail by stealing the photographs with which the friend was being coerced yes of course a simple explanation as soon as rathbone thought of it he wondered why it had taken him so long im very sorry he said meeting monks eyes and seeing the sadness in them for hester no doubt cardew had given much to the clinic and she was not only grateful but she liked him how typical of hester to befriend the troubled someone others would shun when they knew until she knew also then she too would shun him many things she would forgive but she would never countenance a man who abused and murdered childrenvulnerable children cold hungry and alone like scuff monk stood very straight he always did with a kind of grace that was almost an arrogance except that knowing him as well as he did rathbone understood that most of it was defense his armor of belief in himself the more rigid since his loss of memory had left him uniquely vulnerable now it would be hester whose pain monk was preparing for there would be no way he could comfort her or ease the disillusion rupert cardew must be like the young officers she had known in the crimea the ones she had seen wounded dying still struggling to keep some kind of dignity she had been helpless then to save most of them and she could do nothing for rupert now monk gave a slight shrug i thought you would want to know he did not add anything about ballinger or margaret but it did not need to be said between them neither of them would ever forget that night on jericho phillipss boatthe horror and the fear that scuff was already dead and they were too late the stench of the dead rats in the bilges as they pulled him out small and very white his body shaking nor would they forget the corpses at execution dock you are sure it was him rathbone asked he was surprised how normal his voice sounded the bastard was strangled with his cravat monk told him the surgeon cut it out of parfitts neck where the flesh had swollen over it the design is unusualdark blue with gold leopards on it in threes rathbone felt the knots ease in his stomach even more it was proof he was filled with shame that someone elses despair should be such a relief to him he knew now with certainty that he had been afraid that ballinger was somehow involved as the fear slipped away he understood the power of it and was almost giddy at the release yes he said you are right that does seem conclusive im very sorry lord cardew will be devastated poor man monk said nothing his face was still pale and there was a bleakness in his eyes he nodded slowly gave rathbone a slight smile in acknowledgment then turned on his heel and left rathbone heard him outside declining the clerks offer of a cup of tea with the door closed again rathbone sat down behind his desk and found himself shaking with an overwhelming sense of having escaped a danger he had been bracing himself against until his body had ached with the strain of it he had failed to pursue the possibility of ballingers guilt because of the irredeemable pain it would have caused margaret were her father to be implicated she loved her father unconditionally with the same love that she must have borne for him in childhood and rathbone admired her for it it was the first time he had ever avoided seeking the truth and he was ashamed fate had allowed him to escape facing the possible reality and it was an undeserved gift this evening he would take margaret to the dinner party for which they had already accepted an invitation he would make it a celebration a time of happiness she would remember he allowed himself to think of that until the clerk told him the first client of the day had arrived the dinner party was magnificent rathbone had recently given margaret a beautiful necklace of garnets and river pearls with earrings and a bracelet to match it was a bit extravagant but exactly the kind of rich yet discreet setting she most liked this evening she wore them with a gown of deep winered silk it was fullerskirted than she usually chose and perhaps even a little lower at the bosom the jewels gleamed against her pale flawless skin and with a faint flush of happiness in her cheeks she was lovelier than he had ever seen her before they swept into the main reception room with a rustle of silk and to polite words of welcome there were nearly a score of people present the men were in elegant black women in a blaze of colors from the youngest in gleaming pastels to older doyennes of the aristocracy in burgundies midnight blues plums and rich browns diamonds glinted with suppressed fire ropes of pearls glowed on bare skin there was soft laughter the clink of glass slight movement like a wind through a field of flowers margaret held rathbones arm a little more tightly he could smell the warmth of her perfume sweet and indefinable ah sir oliverlady rathbone how delightful to see you the welcome was repeated again and again he knew them all and didnt need to rack his memory for a name a position or an achievement he replied easily shared a joke or an item of news a comment on the latest book or exhibition of art it was not until they went in to dinner that he realized there was an odd number of them something no hostess in england would ever allow intentionally what is it margaret whispered seeing his puzzlement there are nineteen of us he replied speaking almost under his breath something must have happened she said with certainty someone is ill she looked around casually trying to conceal the fact its a man she said finally there are ten women here then suddenly the answer was obvious as was the reason no one had mentioned it the missing man was lord cardew considering who had been invited rathbone was certain that when the ladies had retired after dinner the gentlemen would be discussing over port and cigars the vexed question of industrial pollution he remembered ballinger saying it was a subject lord cardew had been involved in for years rathbone wondered if it had been cardew who had somehow prevailed upon lord justice garslake to change his mind and thus the ruling of the court of appeal on the case he felt a sinking sensation of misery inside himself and guilt that he was here with his happiness unclouded it was in no way his fault that rupert cardew had murdered parfitt it was rathbones relief that shamed him and the fact that he had been prepared to look the other way when discomfort threatened his own happiness perhaps lord cardew had done that for yearsrefused to see what rupert really was face the truth and at least attempt to do something about it in that then they would be the same except that rathbone had not had to pay anything for it oliver margarets voice interrupted his thoughts he dismissed them immediately forcing himself to think only of the moment and of her yes he lied someone must have been taken ill let us hope it is slight and he will soon be better he put his hand over hers briefly then moved forward smiling and took his place at the table no one mentioned cardew or any other subject that could cloud the enjoyment of the occasion rathbone was happy to see margaret so forgetting her earlier shyness that she laughed openly making amusing and sometimes even slightly barbed responses to the opinions with which she disagreed more than once a ripple of laughter swept around the table a flash of appreciation for her wit rathbone was proud of her he thought of hesterher quick tongue the passion that made her outrageous at times her fury at incompetence and the pride that covered deceit the pity that made her crusade so inappropriately caring too little for the consequences he would always find her exciting but he had once mistaken that for love and imagined he would be happy with her thank heaven she had refused him at a dinner party like this he would always have been waiting for her to say something disastrous something so candid it could never be forgotten much less ignored he looked across the table now at margaret her face serious as she answered the man to her left talking about the enormous power of industry and the complexity of profit and responsibility there was nothing dismissive in his attitude he was not in the slightest humoring her as he explained how such giants could not be fought against rathbone smiled and then as if sensing his gaze on her margaret looked up and her eyes were warm bright full of happiness that sweet mood of intimacy lasted all through the carriage ride home and became more intense as they dismissed the servants for the night and went upstairs alone suddenly passion was easy and without hesitation there was no moment of reassurance necessary no asking to have spoken at all would have been to doubt the gift of such happiness but the next morning in rathbones office his peace of mind and heart was shattered lord cardew is here to see you sir oliver the clerk said gravely i told him that i would have to consult you but i took the liberty of asking lady lavinia stock if she would consult you at another time the matter is trivial and she was quite agreeable to postponing her appointment rathbone stared at him horrified the man was an excellent clerk and had given too many years loyal service for rathbone to dispense with him but this was nonetheless a liberty the clerk had a slight flush in his cheeks but he met rathbones eyes without blinking knowing you as i do sir i felt certain that you would offer him at least the kindness of listening to him even should you not wish to take the caseor not feel it is one you are able to handle rathbone drew in his breath to give a swift retort and realized with a mild amusement that the man had very neatly boxed him in he would never admit that he was not able to handle a case nor on the other hand could he refuse to listen to cardew in what must be the most appalling state of distress of his life you had better show him in since you have clearly made up your mind that i should take the case he said drily the clerk bowed it is not for me to decide which cases you take sir oliver i will show lord cardew in immediately shall i make tea or perhaps in the circumstances you would prefer something a little stronger perhaps the brandy tea will be excellent thank you i shall need to be very sober indeed to help in this matter and yes sir oliver we shall have words about this later yes sir ill bring the tea as soon as it is brewed he returned a moment later and opened the door for lord cardew he was in his early sixties although today he looked twenty years more his skin was drained of all color and dry like old parchment he stood straight shoulders squared but he moved as if his whole body were filled with pain anything as banal as good morning seemed ridiculous there could be nothing good in it for this man rathbone thanked the clerk and excused him then gestured to the big leather chair opposite the desk for cardew to sit down i am aware of what has happened rathbone said quickly to spare cardew the pain of telling him at least the rudiments cardew looked startled commander monk has long been a friend of mine rathbone explained he tells you of all his cases cardew asked with disbelief not at all sir but this one distressed him more than most because of its connection to the jericho phillips case a very short while ago cardew looked like an old man too stubborn to admit defeat rathbone had seen other men like that for whom surrender was too alien to be considered they were bewildered carrying on from force of habit and inability to think of any alternative why should he be distressed cardew asked he is doing his job in his place i would assume my son to be guilty such evidence as they have indicates it to be so that creature was undoubtedly killed with ruperts cravat even i could not argue against it the thing is distinctive i know i gave it to him apparently they cut it off the wretched mans neck did rupert confess that he did it rathbone asked a flush spread up cardews cheeks and he lowered his eyes cowardice was a sin neither his nature nor his upbringing could forgive a gentleman did not make excuses he did not complain and above all he did not lie to escape the consequences of his acts no he did not he said so quietly that rathbone barely heard him rathbone considered any words of comfort he could offer and all were inadequate trite or the very lies that cardew so despised what is it you would like me to do rathbone said gently cardew looked up do you know what parfitt was i know at least something of it memory assailed rathbone like a wave of nausea i know what jericho phillips was i was there on his boat i saw his corpse at execution dock and i could look at it without regret he died obscenely but i could feel only relief that he was gone im not proud of that indeed it is something i prefer not to recall then you will understand why i have no pity for mickey parfitt cardew replied is there not some plea of mitigation you can make for the man who killed himif only to save him from the gallows he said the last word as if sticking a knife into himself i can try rathbone said reluctantly how often had this man pleaded with someone for leniency toward the son who had let him down with such anguish did he never grow tired of it did he wonder now whether if he had made rupert pay for his errors earlier pay the full price then when theyd been so much less might rupert have learned the lesson and this would not now be happening did he go on exhausted as he was because he understood that his gentleness before had been only an evasion of the inevitable that in that space between it had grown until now the price would be his life cardew leaned forward his face tense his eyes fixed on rathbones he wont tell me what happened i was able to see him only briefly before they took him away but if he killed parfitt then perhaps it was in selfdefense or the defense of someone else is that mitigation in the law if it was to save the life of someone else who was in immediate danger of being killed then it is certainly more than mitigation rathbone answered if it can be proved beyond a reasonable doubt it is justification but im afraid that might be very difficult to convince a jury of now when rupert has been arrested since an innocent man would have said so at the time cardew winced of course yet i cannot believe that rupert would kill him without the most terrible compulsion to do so he has a temper but he is not a fool he swallowed hard as if he had an obstruction in his throat and in spite of his immorality in other directions he has a sense of honor in his own way killing a man in cold blood even a man like parfitt would not be acceptable it is a cowards way unconsciously his shoulders squared a little as he said this as though facing some threat himself rathbone smiled slightly but utterly without pleasure i have some difficulty in deciding for myself what cold blood really is at that moment the clerk knocked on the door and with rathbones permission came in with the tray of tea in a silver pot a silver cream jug and sugar bowl and silver tongs and teaspoons the porcelain was plain delicate and ornamented only by a small blue crown in spite of rathbones refusal the clerk had also brought a bottle of napoleon brandy and set it on the sideboard he poured the tea then excused himself and withdrew how civilized cardew said with a desperate edge to his voice how intensely british we sit here with tea in german porcelain cups with french brandy if we need the fire of it and we talk about murder justice and hanging we would sit exactly like this with the same tone of voice if we were speaking of the weather because we have to use our intelligence not our emotions rathbone answered the selfindulgence of feelings will not help your son selfindulgence cardew said with the first touch of bitterness that rathbone had heard in him ruperts sin which i never curbed in him i saw it and i let it pass as if he would grow out of it why is it we still see our sons as children who can be excused given time and love and patience even when they are grown men and need to know better the world will make no such excuses for them and it is deceit that we do unspoken of course but a deceit nevertheless because we love day by day inch by inch rathbone replied we dont notice the passing of time and the dangers that we should have prevented or at least should have warned of but none of that will help us now he looked steadily at cardew you obviously are familiar with parfitts name and reputation how do you come to know that sir cardew was startled then deeply uncomfortable rathbone had a nightmarish thought that perhaps cardew himself had once been tempted to such pastimes as parfitt had provided and then he dismissed it as ridiculous and repulsive nevertheless the question required an answer and he waited for it cardew avoided his eyes again rupert has caused me a certain embarrassment most of his adult life let us say the last fifteen years since he was eighteen often i have known in what ways because i i helped him when necessary it was an evasion of the ugliness of the truth and they were both embarrassingly aware of it even now cardew could not bring himself to be literal rathbone was not enlightened by euphemisms lord cardew he said grimly i cannot do anything useful for your son if i dont know what i am fighting against what trouble he paid for prostitutionunflattering but not unusual certainly not a crime for which any gentleman is punished by the law especially a man who is not married and therefore does not owe a sexual loyalty to anyone it is not worth mentioningand is far better than seducing a young woman of virtue and with expectation of marriage that is a moral offense of some weight but still not punishable by law cardews face was ashen his shoulders so tight that in places they strained the fabric of his jacket but he said nothing force would be a different matter rathbone continued rape is a crime no matter who the victim is although society would bother little if the woman were of questionable virtue anyway unless there were a great deal of violence involved is that the case rupert has a temper cardew said almost under his breath his voice cracking with emotional tension but so far as i am aware his quarrels were always with other men violent rathbone pressed cardew hesitated yes sometimes i dont know what they were about i preferred not to but they were not justified justified how can beating a man nearly senseless be justified selfdefense or defense of someone else weaker already injured or in some other way helpless i wish i could believe it was as excusable as that is that alljust fighting is that not enough cardew said miserably the use of prostitutes drunkenness brawling until you injure a man for the rest of his life good god rathbone rupert was brought up as a gentleman he is heir to all i have the privileges and the responsibilities how can i ever allow him to marry a decent woman i couldnt do that to another mans daughter rathbone had seen scores of men sit in this chair in his quiet office so racked with fear and pain that it filled the room like a charge of electricity but none deeper than this perhaps the worse because cardews pain was not for himself but for someone he loved had rupert any idea of the hell he was inflicting if he could even imagine it then he was close to inexcusable rathbone thought of arthur ballinger and how loyal his children were especially margaret to torture him like this would have been unthinkable how worthless rupert cardew was in comparison what utter selfishness governed him rathbone thought of his own father their friendship was perhaps the most precious thing in his life because it was the bedrock on which all else rested he could not remember a time when henry rathbone had not been there to advise to share a problem to encourage and at times to praise would he and margaret have sons one day and would he be as good a father what had lord cardew done or omitted to do that had led to this tragedy bought his sons love with a leniency that in the end corroded both of them averted the pain of confrontation the loneliness of the turning away even if only fleetingly rathbone understood it so easily but as he looked at cardews haunted face he could also imagine the price was that the guilt that cardew felt that somehow he should have prevented this a word a silence a decision carried through and it might all have been different there was nothing left to do now but try to help why would rupert kill mickey parfitt rathbone asked there must be some connection it wasnt a crime of rage mickey was hit on the head then when he was at least dazed possibly unconscious he was deliberately strangled with a cravat which was knotted to be more effective with pressure on the throat the windpipe the veins of the neck that is not impulse of fury or hot temper and i dont see how it could possibly be selfdefense he found it hard to keep his eyes on cardews face but he owed it to the man at least to look at him while he said such things cardew sat motionless no one happens by chance to find his best cravat in his pocket handily knotted so as to be a more effective weapon rathbone continued he carried it with him for the purpose of killing someone it is not a weapon of selfdefense the bough of a tree might be perhaps but if he had already struck him senseless with it and if escape from his own danger were the purpose he would have left then but he remained took off his cravat knotted it and then strangled the unconscious man lying at his feet not to mention then dropping him into the river cardew winced each time rathbone spoke parfitt was an abomination cardew said with loathing the most degraded of human beings scarcely fit to walk upright he preyed upon the weaknesses of others indulging them until his victims became almost as depraved as he was then he blackmailed them and if you think that was the depth to which he sank think of the children he used to do this they were blameless and they suffered the most and without escape any man who killed him has done a service as a doctor who has rid us of a filthy disease he took a deep breath and dont bother to tell me that that does not justify murder i am perfectly aware of it i need help sir oliver not a sermon on the sanctity of all human life rathbone smiled bleakly i have no intention of offering you one lord cardew i totally agree with you and believe me if it is i who stand in court before a judge and jury to plead ruperts case i will draw such a portrait of mickey parfitt that they will see him for what he was but i will need more than his depravity to justify his death the jury will require to know why rupert in particular of all his victims was the one who actually killed him i must tell it from his point of view in particulars not generalities they must walk in his shoes feel his fear outrage whatever it was that drove him to such an act the prosecutor will be clever and articulate also and will defend parfitts right to live as he would that of any of us of course i understand we cannot allow any one of us to be the unappointed judge and executioner of another the simple answer is that i dont know why rupert killed him i didnt have the chance to ask him and to tell you the truth i am not sure whether he would tell me he struggled for a moment to find words for what he could hardly bear to say rathbone put an end to it as one would put an animal out of its pain of course he said cutting across him it is often easier to speak to someone whose opinion does not touch your emotions it happens to many of the people i see in my office with your permission i shall go to the prison and speak to rupert immediately he rose to his feet i think we should address this as soon as possible i will see that he is being reasonably treated and that he has all that he is permitted for his comfort i will speak to you as soon as i have something of value to say he held out his hand cardew rose to his feet slowly it seemed to cost him some effort but when he clasped rathbones hand it was with surprising power a drowning man reaching for help amid the overwhelming waves by early afternoon rathbone was in the entrance of newgate prison the huge iron doors closed behind him and a sourfaced warden beckoned him along the narrow corridors toward the cell where he would be permitted to interview rupert cardew his footsteps sounded hard on the floor but the echo died almost immediately as if the stone of the walls suffocated it the place was a curious mixture of life and death rathbone was acutely conscious of emotional pain of fear remorse the dread of physical extinction and what might lie beyond in the nightmares of the soul and yet the place stifled life there was no energy nothing could breathe here nothing could grow or have will the warden walked ahead of him without ever turning to ascertain if he was following but then who would wish to wander alone in this maze of corridors all the same and all leading nowhere the man stopped took a key from the chain at his belt and unlocked the iron door swinging it open with a squeal of unoiled hinges thank you rathbone said curtly walking past him ill knock when im ready to leave the man acknowledged with a silent nod and slammed the door shut the sound of the lock going home on the outside was as loud as the clang of iron on stone had been the cell was bare except for two wooden chairs and a small table which was scarred and dented one leg was shorter than the other three so that when rathbone touched it the table wobbled before settling back to its place rupert cardew stood in the center of the small space he was wearing the shirt and trousers in which he must have been arrested and he was crumpled and unshaven however he held himself upright and met rathbones eyes without wavering im here at your fathers request rathbone began he was used to meeting accused men or women in circumstances like these but it never grew any easier for almost all of the major cases he dealt with it was the persons first time in prison and the sheer shock of it caused either numbness or a panic that was close to hysteria all too often the shadow of the hangmans noose darkened all reason and hope even the innocent were terrified there was no trust in the judgment of the law when it was your own life in the balance rupert nodded he found it difficult to speak and when he forced the words out his tone was uneven i knew he would help i im not sure what you can do the evidence seems to be to be he breathed in and out deeply if i were monk i would believe as he does the cravat is mineno argument rathbone heard the nervousness in his voice the tension he put his hand out and pulled the chair nearest him away from the table he waved at the other sit down mr cardew i need you to tell me as much as you can from the beginning it might be simpler if i ask you questions rupert obeyed unintentionally scraping the chair legs on the floor he sat down awkwardly but his hands on the table were strong and lean and rathbone saw with respect that they did not tremble you do not question that it was your cravat rathbone asked no rupert said wryly i dont imagine there are many like that my father gave it to me i expect he had it made his tailor would swear to it i see he was not surprised but it might have been an advantage if the point could have been argued what time did you leave home that evening i expected you to ask me that early it was a lovely evening he gave a twisted grimace not quite a smile as if the bitter humor of it were momentarily overwhelming i walked down by the river for an hour or more i lost track of time rathbone held up his hand to stop him down by the river where you dont live anywhere near chiswick of course not who the devil lives in chiswick but i didnt want to wander along the embankment and run into half a dozen people i know who would want to talk politics or gossip i took a boat up the river and ive racked my brain to recall anyone i knew who saw me but the whole charm of going up on the water is the peace of it the very fact that you dont meet anyone you know im sorry he shrugged very slightly with barely a movement of his shoulders you didnt row yourself rathbone observed well actually i did you hired a boat from whom theyll have a record of it no i have my own at least i share it with a fellow i know but hes in italy at the moment no use is it no rathbone agreed where did you goexactly chiswick i tied it up at one of the mooring posts up there opposite the chiswick eyot then i went along the mall and had a drink at the pub off black lion lane i spoke to a few lads i know but i doubt theyd remember it just stupid remarks about the weather that sort of thing then what rupert looked down at his hands on the table then i went and visited a woman i knowa girl is that a euphemism for a prostitute rathbone inquired a dull color marked ruperts cheeks yes her name hattie benson you know her other than in the carnal sense rupert looked up quickly yes but i dont imagine her word is going to help a lot i still had my cravat then i remember taking it off so it must have been before parfitt was killed with it unless someone killed him with another silk cravat exactly like mine thats a bit of a stretch isnt it there was a flicker of hope in his voice but he killed it himself before rathbone had the chance yes im afraid it is rathbone replied where did you go after you left miss benson i dont know i was pretty drunk i fell asleep somewhere i dont remember where when i woke up it was dark and i felt like hell i went over to the horse trough stuck my head into the water sobered up a bit and then rowed home he looked at rathbone waiting for the condemnation he expected the prosecution wont be able to make a case unless they can prove that you knew mickey parfitt and had some reason to want him dead rathbone told him tell me of all your dealings with him and dont lie to me if they catch you out even once it will be sufficient to shatter any credibility you might have with the jury rupert stared at him the skin tight across his cheeks his mouth drawn into a line of pain it is too late for discretion rathbone warned him i shall not tell anyone anything you can afford for me to hide particularly i shall not tell your father he will suffer quite enough in spite of all i can do rupert looked as if rathbone had struck him and bruised his face deeper than the flesh i did not kill parfitt he said clearly rathbone continued exactly as if he had not spoken what was your connection with him when and where did you first meet if any of this is verifiable id like to know that too rupert looked down at the scarred tabletop i met him just over two years ago i was out with a group of friends at black lion lane again we were all pretty high and bored somebody began telling tall stories about women theyd had not just in london but paris somebody said berlin and someone else said madrid the stories got taller and taller most of them lies i expect he took a deep breath then someone said he knew of a place a lot more daring than anything mentioned so far he said danger was the thing that really made your heart beat and the blood he stopped he was looking at rathbones exquisite suit his crisp clean shirt i can imagine rathbone said drily you dont have to fill in the details of what he described the risk of ruin was the ultimate temptation yes rupert said very quietly i cant believe now that i was so stupid it was a boat on the river you know what it was i still need you to tell me rupert winced i went out with the others i suppose there were half a dozen of us something like that the boat was moored up on the other side of the chiswick eyot quite a row with the cooler air i was close to sober when we got there at first it looked like another brothel except on a boat we were made welcome given some of the best brandy ive ever had then then there was a kind of performance very explicit men and little boys some of them were not more than five or six years old his voice cracked and his face was scarlet rathbone waited it it was a form of club there were initiation rites we had to take part and be photographed it was a darethe ultimate risk in which you could lose everything we all did it his voice sank to a whisper i didnt have the courage to refuse afterward i scrambled up the gangway and vomited over the side into the river i wanted to leave but there was no way other than jumping into the water and hoping to survive he gulped if id been worth anything id have done that wading out of the river covered in mud and sodden to the skin on the streets of chiswick would have been better than the hell that followed rathbone could imagine it more easily than he wished there had been some days at university when he himself had been less than sober less than discreet he would greatly prefer that his father did not know about those days even if he might guess his excesses had never been of this magnitude but the hot burn of shame was just as real please go on he said more gently i staggered back toward the gangway downstairs again and one of parfitts men came up behind me we collided and somehow the next thing i knew i was falling downward thumping and bashing myself against the walls until i landed at the bottom i can remember faces peering at me in a sort of haze and i felt dreadful then i must have passed out because the next thing i knew i was lying on a bed in one of the cabins and mickey parfitt himself was looking at me sneering shouldnt drink so much mr cardew he said with satisfaction oozing out of him fell downstairs you did but had your bit of fun first at the time i didnt remember the staged show with the little boys or the photograph so i didnt feel anything much he gave me a stiff jolt of brandy and helped me to my feet i went back over the river with my friendswhat a damn stupid word for them for a moment bitterness flashed across his face rathbone felt himself sympathizing and to his amazement also believing him then what happened he asked although he knew rupert looked down again about a week later parfitt sent a letter to my home inviting me to join them on the boat again i burned the letter but he wrote again yes i ignored it the second time burned it without opening it actually the third time he sent a letter to my father i recognized the writing i burned the one to my father but i read the one to me he said that i had entered into a contract with him and there was a photograph to prove it whether i went to the boat again or not i still owed him the money blackmail rathbone nodded it was cleverer than he had thought much harder to prove in court how could he show that there had been no gentlemans agreement such things were often unwritten especially regarding something like gambling or the services of a prostitute no one put those agreements in writing rupert nodded i realized it only then god i was so stupid his voice was heavy with selfdisgust did you pay ruperts face tightened with that photograph of course i did i meant to buy myself a little time and then think what to do i knew if i didnt do something the bastard would have me paying for the rest of my life rathbone looked at him searching his eyes he saw desperation profound embarrassment even shame but curiously no awareness of having just admitted to the perfect motive for murder was that because he felt himself justified and if he did could rathbone disagree with him if ever a man deserved to be gotten rid of it was mickey parfitt thinking of him it was as if jericho phillips had risen from the dead well youre rid of him now he said with asperity hardly rupert said bitterly hell take me down to the grave with him it almost makes me wish i had killed him didnt you ruperts head jerked up his eyes hot no i didnt rathbone was used to denial almost everyone claimed either that they did not do it at all or that if they did it was either an accident or the victim deserved it and yet he was on the brink of believing rupert cardew which was totally unreasonable every scrap of evidence pointed to him then who did he said grimly with your cravat i dont know whoever found it i suppose rathbone opened his eyes wide they chanced on your cravat lying wherever it was and thought ah i know what ill do with this ill tie a few knots in it and then ill strangle someone what about mickey parfitt wed all be better off without him rupert flushed hotly i dont know who killed him or why there could be a dozen reasons and fifty men with one at least as good as mine i only know that i didnt ive never been so drunk that i couldnt remember what id donejust not always where or with whom he gave a slight shrug and a flicker of humor lit his eyes for an instant then vanished rathbones mind raced was it conceivable that rupert really was innocent at least of the murder a reasonable doubt would prevent his conviction but not remove from peoples minds the belief that he was guilty some might praise him for it but the stain would still be indelible the only good answer would be to prove someone elses guilt what do you know about parfitt he asked apart from what you have told me where did he come from who are his partners in the boat he didnt find the money to buy it in the first place without help who was it who else shares the profit who are his other clients whom he might have pushed over the edge into ruin and did he blackmail only for money or for favors also favors rupert blinked you mean political favors rathbone corrected him or worse perhaps judicial favors judicial rupert began and then stopped as understanding swept over him god i never thought of that would he really i dont know but you see the possibilities rupert was pale now was he thinking of his father and the power he had in the house of lords the influence on members who fought for reform if ruperts own reputation were in the balance what might cardew have been coerced into doing to save him what made you think of that he asked do you know something there was fear in his voice now no anger left no rathbone said truthfully but that is what jericho phillips did and it seems an obvious thing phillips rupert asked yes then parfitt would too he learned all his skills from phillips he started by working for him downriver from chiswick nearer westminster and that way youre sure yes then you know more about him than the one visit youre telling me about rupert paled look i went three times and im ashamed of it the first time it wasnt so bad or the second young men but we all know that kind of thing goes on a bit of gambling and a hell of a lot to drink if id had any sense id have known that wasnt all there was to it but i didnt think i i wanted to stay in with the friends i had i havent been back ever against all his experiences of frightened men lying when accused rathbone believed him but at the same time it robbed him of a defense that he could hope to succeed with or at least use to mitigate the sentence sufficiently to avoid the rope he shrank from telling rupert this now he could not work with him paralyzed with fear he had to have as much of the truth as possible in order to defend against the evidence the crown would bring mickey parfitts death was not a cause celebre but rupert cardew in the dock most certainly would be do you know who has been rathbone asked rupert was stunned i cant tell you the names of my friends who were there for gods sake that would be a despicable thing to do even if one of them murdered mickey parfitt betray them all because one of them might have killed him is that what you would do sir oliver suddenly the challenge was sharp and very personal rathbone admired him for it you want me to answer that truthfully he asked yes i do would you no mr cardew but then my friends dont frequent places like that so far as i know but i wouldnt know because i dont ive seen what men like phillips and parfitt do to children and id be happy if the law allowed anyone who wished to get rid of them all but if we permit people to make their own decisions as to who should live and who should die it would be a license to murder at will we can always find excuses when we want them all of which you know as well as i do i still cant tell you the names of the men i know who went to that boat not yet when you know more of what parfitt did and how he used his power you may change your mind rathbone rose to his feet will you represent me rupert asked standing also his knuckles were clenched and he had to brace himself to keep his body from shaking yes rathbone replied without hesitation surprising himself by the firmness of his decision as if no other answer had occurred to him but none of it seemed so easy to explain to margaret that evening in their own quiet dining room with the faint aroma of apple wood burning in the fire and the gaslights soft rupert cardew she said with amazement how awful for his father the poor man must be devastated her face was bleak with pity yes i wish i could offer him more hope rathbone agreed they were at the dining room table the air was warm outside and the long curtains still werent drawn letting in the sweet smells of earth and leaves as the garden faded with the year there were golden chrysanthemums and purple asters in bloom the summer flowers were cut down but it was too early for the leaves to turn there was no rich perfume of wood smoke or bonfires yet theres nothing you can do oliver she said gently just dont shun him when he comes back into society again so many people do because they dont know what to say and its easier to say nothing than face other peoples pain if hes found guilty theyll hang him he replied there wont be any coming back her eyes widened with surprise for goodness sake i meant lord cardew not rupert of course theyll hang him theres no other possible answer he looked at her and saw no trace of indecision in her face and only a remnant of the pity she had felt for lord cardew nothing fresh for rupert parfitt tried to blackmail him he said reaching absentmindedly for the salt and then realizing that he had already used it putting it down again it would have gone on forever of course it would until his father refused to pay she said drily returning her attention to her meal they had an excellent cook both imaginative and skilled but tonight rathbone barely tasted his food you havent asked me if i believe he did it he pointed out and then realized how critical he sounded margaret put her fork down do you doubt it there must always be room for doubt dont be pedantic oliver she interrupted him i know that legally i mean do you personally doubt it yes i do he denies it and i believe he may be speaking the truth he is hardly the only one to wish parfitt dead there is all the difference in the world between wishing someone dead and making it so she said reasonably how much difference is there between a man who will pay others to torture and abuse small boys for his gratification and one who will kill the provider of such abomination rather than continue to pay for it he heard the anger in her voice and the revulsion he would not have expected anything less he felt it himself and yet he also understood ruperts horror when he realized what his blindness and stupidity had led him into was he naive to believe that rupert might actually be innocent of the murder of parfitt was he acting on exactly the kind of emotional loyalty devoid of reason that he saw in margarets family lord cardew reminded him of his own father and his pity was instinctive and immediate ive agreed to defend him he said aloud margaret froze now he was compelled to justify himself everyone deserves a defense margaret the benefit of doubt until guilt is proved of course he needs to be defended she agreed her eyes bright and angry but not by you you are the finest barrister in london maybe in the whole of england your very presence will draw attention to the case and make people believe there is something to be said for the whole repulsive business whatever you argue on the niceties of the law the vast majority of people will believe you are doing it because of his fathers title and money not because you have any real belief in his innocence no one will who knows me he said with a touch of chill her accusation hurt it caught him by surprise that she should think it most people dont know you she said reasonably but there was a pucker between her brows they will simply leap to the easiest conclusion and i should cater to them he inquired you are exaggerating she answered coolly i didnt suggest that you follow every whim of public opinion merely that you do not need to defend every criminal no matter how base their crime just to prove that the law must be honored let someone else defend rupert cardew you mean so that we may hang him and then go home and still sleep well yes i suppose i do mean that now it was a definite retaliation if you are going to hang anyone at all then rupert cardew deserves it the use of children in prostitution and pornography is bestial anyone who had a part in that of any sort deserves the rope she leaned forward over her plate the food now entirely forgotten and dont tell me he didnt actively participate that is irrelevant oliver and you know it he knew and he did nothing about it he could have called the police made the whole thing public but instead he chose to kill parfitt in order to spare his own embarrassment and that of his friends who are little better you cant defend him because it is indefensible he was stunned into silence i suppose lord cardew asked you to she went on and you were too softhearted to refuse him of course the poor man believes his son is innocent what else could he bear to believe perhaps he is right he said softly placing his knife and fork on the plate his food was halfeaten but he no longer wanted it nonsense she answered and cook will be offended if you dont eat at least most of that tell her im ill in fact ill tell her myself rathbone rose to his feet the thought of remaining at the table in a bitter silence was so unpleasant he would rather retreat into work any excuse would do as you have pointed out it will be exceedingly difficult to present any believable defense and if i dont make a reasonable show of it i will not only let rupert cardew down and his father i will damage my own reputation i cannot afford to do that he turned at the door dont wait up for me i shall probably be a long time margaret opened her mouth to speak and then changed her mind he would never know whether it would have been an apology or not he chose to think that it would but even so the laughter the intimacy of the previous evening seemed an age ago hard even to recall to the inner mind where treasures are stored chapter hester felt awkward standing on the steps of lord cardews beautiful house in cheyne walk at ten oclock the following morning it was a bright windy day and the river was choppy as the tide came in pleasure boats were bobbing up and down people clutching hats ribbons flying the russetcolored sails of a barge billowed out the hull listing over she had brought news of death before and of maiming burning disfigurement there was never an easy way to deal with grief nothing to say that could make it any different if there was healing with time then it came from within it was difficult to speak with someone whose only living child was accused of something as hideous as this if he had killed someone in a fight or more coldbloodedly in revenge it would have been bad enough but to be tied in the mind with a man as fearful as mickey parfitt to have known him used his services and said nothingthat left a stain that would be indelible and yet it seemed unacceptably cruel to ignore the fathers pain as if it were of no importance or an embarrassment one would rather avoid the door was opened by a butler whose expression was guarded his eyes already showing the strain good morning madam may i help you good morning she produced her card mr rupert cardew has been extremely generous to me and to the clinic for the poor that i run it seems an appropriate time to offer lord cardew any service i can perform for him she smiled very slightly sufficient only to show goodwill the stiffness in the butlers face eased certainly madam if you care to come inside i will inform his lordship that you are here she dropped her card onto the small silver tray then followed the butler through the hall with its carved mantel and exquisitely wrought plaster ceiling and cornices he left her in the firelit morning room with its faded carpets and the seascapes on the walls the numerous bookcases the spines lettered in gold but of odd sizes she knew at a glance that they were bought to read not for show the butler excused himself closing the door in other circumstances hester might have looked at the titles of the books it was always interesting to know what other people read but she could not keep her mind on anything at the moment even in the silence she kept imagining footsteps in the hall her mind raced to find words that would sound anything but futile she paced from the bookcase to the window and back again she was staring at the garden when the door finally opened catching her by surprise i apologize for keeping you waiting mrs monk lord cardew said quietly closing the door behind him it is gracious of you to see me at all she answered i would not have been surprised had you declined especially since now that i am here i hardly know what to say that makes any senseonly that if i can be of service to you then i wish to be cardew looked exhausted his skin was papery as if there were no blood in the flesh beneath it but it was the emptiness in his eyes that she found the most painful there was a kind of shapeless panic in them a despair too big for him to handle thank you but i have no idea what anyone can do he replied but your kindness is a small light in a very large darkness he was a slender man but he must once have been elegant supple like a military man he reminded her of the soldiers she had known in the past the whole crimean war seemed to belong to another age now he also made her think of her own father perhaps only because he also had looked older than he was as if the weight of failure were crushing him she had not been at home when her father had most needed her he had died alone while she was nursing strangers in sevastopol he had trusted where he should not have a man with every appearance of honor had deceived him totally her father was one of many so betrayed but the debts he could not meet had broken his spirit he had believed that taking his own life was the only course left him that too hester had not been at home to prevent or to aid her mothers grief what she could have done had never been spoken of it was simply her absence at the time of need that wounded we can find out what really happened she said impulsively it cant be as simple as it seems either it was someone else altogether who killed parfitt and rupert doesnt know who or he does know but he is defending them because he believes that is the right thing to do or possibly he did kill parfitt but for a reason that would make it understandable she waited for cardew to answer he struggled with an emotion so sharp the pain of it was visible in his face my dear mrs monk for all the help you give to the poor women who come to you in their distress you can have no idea what kind of world men like parfitt inhabit i cannot be responsible for your stumbling into such abomination even by accident but your kindness is most touching your compassion is pointless she interrupted him gently if you will not permit me to be what help i can i have been a nurse on the battlefield i walked among the dead and the dying after balaklava i was in the hospital in sevastopol with the rats the hunger and the disease i have nursed in a fever hospital in the slums here in london and i have waited in a locked house for the bubonic plague to run its course please dont tell me what i can or cannot do for a friend who is clearly in trouble he had no idea how to answer her she was an example of all the compassion he idealized in women and at the same time she broke the only mold with which he was familiar she seized the chance to continue i know at least something of what they did on such boats lord cardew i was there when they arrested jericho phillips and he escaped and then was murdered also if mickey parfitt was of the same nature there is much to argue in defense of anyone who rid the world of him but to defend rupert before a court we need to know the truth you are quite right in supposing such a creature is well beyond the knowledge of most people fit to sit on a jury surely the police he began it is not their job to find mitigating circumstances only to prove what happened did rupert tell you what that was i imagine he may not have wished to it is a little late to spare my feelings cardew said drily the ghost of a smile in his eyes he said he did not kill parfitt i would give everything i have to be able to believe him but he looked away from her then back again his eyes slowly filling with tears but his past choices make that impossible im sorry mrs monk but i do not see how you can help i would prefer that you did not risk any danger to yourself either in person or in the form of the distress such knowledge would cause you the things one sees one cannot afterward forget she gave him a tiny smile an echo of the one he had given her i will not do anything against my will lord cardew thank you for your kindness in receiving me she returned home deep in thought weighing lord cardews words he longed to believe in ruperts innocence and yet could not perhaps it was his fear that prevented him like the vertigo that draws one to the edge of a precipice and would have one plunge over it simply to be free from the terror but according to monks description of the knotted cravat the crime had not been committed in fear or panic it takes more than a few seconds to tie half a dozen tight knots in a silk cravat who would create such a weapon thereby ruining a beautiful garment unless they intended to use it no argument of selfdefense would stand against that kind of reasoning unless rupert were held prisoner somewhere with time unobserved and with his hands free to do such a thing she had offered to help remembering only his kindness his wit the unostentatious generosity with which hed given so much money but how well did she really know him all kinds of people could be charming it required imagination understanding the ability to know what pleases others and perhaps a certain sense of humor an ease of wit it did not need honesty or the will to place others before oneself and as she looked back now picturing him in her mind she also remembered an anxiety in him a sudden avoidance of her eyes which she had taken for embarrassment at being in a place like the clinic but perhaps it had been shame at the memory of his own acts uglier than anything those women had endured what she could not tell lord cardew was that for her own reasons she needed to know the truth of what had happened to mickey parfitt if some victim such as rupert had killed him then his trade was over but if it were a rival or even the man who had staked him the original price of the boat then as soon as parfitts murder was solved and the hue and cry had died down the whole hideous business would begin again exactly as before the only difference would be the men running it for the giant behind the scenes and probably another site to moor the boat she needed to know it was over for scuffs sake the dreams would not leave him until he had seen more than jericho phillips dead or mickey parfitt was rupert cardew no more than another victim one whod struck back and would die for it when she reached home she found scuff in the kitchen eating a thick slice of bread spread with butter and piled with jam he stopped chewing when he saw her his mouth full the bread held tightly in both his hands she tried to hide a smile at last he was feeling sufficiently at home to take something to eat when he wanted it she must watch to make certain it did not extend to more than breadfor example the cold pie put aside for tonights supper good idea she said casually ill have a piece too would you like a cup of tea with it i would she walked past him to fill the kettle and put it on the cooktop he swallowed she heard the gulp yeah he said casually shall i cut it for yer yes please but ill have a little less jam if you dont mind she did not turn to watch him do it but concentrated on the task of making tea where yer bin he asked elaborately unconcerned she heard the sawing of the knife on the crust of the bread she knew he was thinking about mickey parfitt monk had told him elements of the truth the details did not matter to see lord cardew she replied putting the blue and white teapot on the edge of the stove to warm im afraid i let my feelings run away with me and i offered to help him do something for rupert now she turned to look at him needing to know how he felt about it she saw a wince of fear in his face then the immediate hiding of it was he afraid for her of losing the new precious safety he had ow could we elp im if e done mickey parfitt he asked his eyes fixed on hers theyll ang im never mind as parfitt should a bin chucked in the river the day e were born well there must have been lots of people who would like to see parfitt dead hester began it is just possible it wasnt rupert who actually killed him but even if he did do it there might have been something that made it not as bad as straight murder like wot scuff was balancing the bread in his hands ready to cut more when he was free to concentrate on it im not quite sure she admitted selfdefense is one and sometimes its an accident maybe a real accident or maybe youre partly to blame because you were being very careless not so much that you didnt mean to kill anyone so much as you just didnt care he looked at her biting his lips anxiously e could a done that i mean killed im by accident like no she said honestly i dont think so actually his father said that he claimed he didnt do it at all and lots of people must have hated parfitt dyer believe im then i dont know his father said he has behaved pretty badly in the past but not as badly as that i need to know more about him perhaps things his father doesnt know about because rupert was too ashamed to say ill be out for quite a while i think oo are ye gonna ask then other toffs an the like will is friends tell yer i wouldnt tell on a friend specially not to a coppers wife then he realized that was silly ceptin i dont spose youll tell em oo yer are she smiled taking the now steaming kettle off the stove and warming the teapot before putting the leaves in of course not im going to the clinic first to ask a few questions of the women weve got in at the moment there at least i have something of an advantage then tomorrow ill move a little farther afield he nodded yer think as mebbe e done a good thing killin mickey parfitt an all i wouldnt push it quite that far she said cautiously but not totally bad yere right scuff nodded again more vehemently we gotter chip in yer gonna make that tea its steamin its ead off an theres more jam when hester arrived at the clinic she began by going over the books with squeaky robinson were doing well he said with considerable satisfaction he pointed to the place on the page where the final tally was even his lugubrious nature could not but be pleased by it and we dont need much he added just new plates as they got broke weve got sheets even spare nightshirts towels got medicineslaudanum quinine brandy all sorts hester avoided his eyes i know its excellent what are you going to do then he asked she thought of pretending that she did not know what he meant use it wisely she replied yeah you better he agreed int no more where that come from poor bastards gonna hang by all accounts less of course someone does something about it what did you have in mind squeaky then immediately she regretted asking whatever he had was probably illegal he had not lost his connections in the criminal underworld nor had his nature changed only his loyalties he had not needed to go looking for claudine burroughs when she had gone on the wild adventure that had ended with her seeing a man she thought was arthur ballinger in the alley outside a shop that sold pornography but he had done so out of loyalty to claudine because ballinger had been looking at a picture so obscene it had horrified her she had fled into the deeper alleys finally to become totally exhausted and lost only squeakys perseverance had saved her he had never been a hero before he loved it well hester pressed him dyou reckon cardew was framed he asked his eyes narrowing i dont know she said frankly there are certainly plenty of other people who might have wanted parfitt dead yeah squeaky agreed thing is how come parfitt didnt know that what kind of an idiot stands alone on the deck of a boat and lets a man get on board he knows hates him i wouldnt and believe me if youve got a nice little business in the flesh trade you know who your rivals are youre prepared you keep folks around you as you can trust to take care of your back like he was watching her waiting to see her reaction yes i suppose you would so he must have been attacked by someone he thought was safe yeah like someone what had come to pay him money for something theyd want more of in another little while you dont bite the hand that feeds you she let out her breath slowly unless you have a temper you cant control and you dont think very far ahead and also you are used to having someone else clean up behind you so you get out of paying the consequences i think i had better find out a lot more about rupert cardew if i can and help him squeaky confirmed i dont mind dealing in women what wants to be in the business anyway but kids is another thing and blackmails bad for business charge a fair price and when its paid youre square i say she gave him a weary look he shrugged fairs fair he retorted you save mr cardew for any reason you like i say save him because mickey parfitt needed putting away anyhow he gives the business a bad name and cos mr cardew was very generous to us we could get used to living this way does a lot of good to them that cant get nobody else to help them very pious squeaky hester said thank you he replied it had indeed been a compliment rather than sarcasm but there was a gleam in his eye that was definitely understanding and might even have been humor there was a brief knock on the door and before hester could reply it opened and margaret rathbone came in she was dressed in very smart deep green but there was little color in her face and her eyes were cold good morning hester am i interrupting not at all hester assured her i was about to leave she felt more awkward than she could explain to herself as if she were being devious in intending to help rupert cardew as much as was possible why it had nothing to do with margarets father except that in her mind she still at least half believed that he had some interest in the boat even if only to find the vulnerable men who would participate i wouldnt consider buying any more new crockery than necessary margaret continued im afraid our source of funds has been radically reduced there was a look in her face that might have been pity but hester felt it was distaste i am aware of that she responded as expressionlessly as she could manage but there was still a touch of asperity in her voice but it is only an accusation so far it has yet to be proved margarets brows rose surely you dont think mr monk is mistaken she too was trying to keep the irony from her tone and like hester was not entirely successful i dont think he is mistaken hester retorted but i am aware as he is that it is always a possibility evidence can be interpreted more than one way new facts emerge sometimes what people say proves to be untrue margaret gave a tight little smile im sorry hester but you are deluding yourself i understand that you found rupert charming but im afraid he is a thoroughly dissolute young man if you could see him as he really is i cannot believe that you would have such pity for him it belongs far more to his victims like mickey parfitt hester snapped back i cannot agree with you she turned briefly to squeaky robinson however lady rathbone is quite correct about the funds in the meantime we shall spend only as necessary and then with due caution she swept past margaret on the way out without inquiring whether it was she or squeaky whom margaret had come to see disliking herself for her anger and unable to control it she went first to the kitchen for a mug of tea then back upstairs into the first room along the corridor in it was phoebe weller a woman somewhere between twentyfive and thirtyfive with lovely auburn hair a lush body and a face disfigured by the scars of pox how are you phoebe hester said conversationally phoebe was lying back in the bed her eyes half closed a tiny smile on her face she was not in a half coma as a casual observer might have thought but was halfasleep dreaming that she might always sleep alone in a clean bed and need do nothing hard or dangerous to assure the next cup of hot tea or slice of bread and jam she woke up when she heard hester saying her name oh i dont think as im well yet she whispered probably not hester agreed tongue in cheek would a fresh cup of tea help phoebe opened her eyes and sat up smartly ignoring the bruised leg and wrenched ankle and the heavily dressed wound on her leg that had brought her here yere right an all so elp me it would hester passed it to her and she took the tea with both hands hester sat down in the chair next to the bed and made herself comfortable smoothing her gray skirts as if she meant to stay im gonna get better phoebe said i just need another few days im sure you are hester agreed amiably youve worked in one or two different places havent you yeah the answer was guarded in some of the posh areas chelsea way and farther up the river yeah ever heard anything about rupert cardew lord cardews son i need to know phoebe and i need the truth phoebe stared at her just a friendly warning hester went on i dont care what the truth is good or bad but if you lie to me and i catch you next time someone beats you youll be in the street and the cabsll run over you before i stretch out a hand to help do you understand the truth is what i need phoebe considered it clearly weighing one possibility against the other hester waited wot dyer wanna know phoebe said at last do you know girls whove slept with him for money course fer money phoebe said patiently dont matter if es andsome as the devil isself an kind an makes yer laugh a girls still ter eat and theres yer protectors wot needs their share do you know anyone who slept with rupert cardew yeah told yer dunnit meself couple o times hester squashed the flicker of revulsion it was stupid what had she imagined rupert had done that he knew the street women so well even cared enough to give money to someone helping them what is his character like she said cripes yer int thinkin o no im not hester assured her tartly but if i were yer int i told you but why not cos es funny makes yer laugh till yer burst yer stays an e int never mean about payin but es got a temper like a cornered rat e as did he hit you hester felt cold and there was a churning in the pit of her stomach phoebe opened her eyes wide me no but e beat the shit out o joe biggins fer crossin im up not only im spoiled i reckon int used ter bein told no by anyone an dint take it kindly i eard say e near killed some bleedin pimp wot got on the wrong side of im dunno wot about beat one other poor sod once jus another bleedin punter wot got up is nose paid im a lot o money not ter make a fuss why do you know phoebe shrugged pale smooth shoulders no could a bin anythin eard it were bad alf killed the stupid sod broke is arms an is face an cracked is ead told yer es got a temper like yer wouldnt credit someone wot acts the gentleman most o the time treats yer right like yer worth summink please an thank yer on the other and never takes less than his moneys worth neither ealthy as an orse she gave a shrug and a smile woman to woman hester nodded trying to keep her expression one of mild interest no more there were things she would prefer not to have known it was peculiarly embarrassing does he drink a lot pretty fair seen worse do you know other girls hes been with dozen or so wots this about wots e done hes accused of killing someone if its a pimp then i reckon as theyre probably right never growed up that one loses is ead an smashes things like a child wot no one ever walloped when they should ave my pad ave tanned me backside till i ate standin up fer a week if i carried on like e does sometimes sorry miss but yer wanted the truth an thats it he used lots of different women why do you think why not stick to the same ones bored i spec some o them toffs bore easy ever like little girls really young wot phoebe looked horrified not as i knows of perhaps go fer older e would more experience filthy temper like i said but e could be kind too wouldnt do nothin filthy with little girls like never took advantage o no one new or scared far as i know an yer get to ear who ter be careful of we got ter take care o each other and boys wot yer mean boys jeez she looked genuinely shocked yer never sayin es doin it wi boys ell not im its against the law but that dont stop them as want tergirls or boys but not im are you sure course im sure jeez hester thanked her and went to ask several other patients for their opinions also then armed with names she went to other street corners where she found old patients who knew her name and reputation and were willing to speak to her most had never heard of rupert cardew but those who had bore out what phoebe had said funny honest at times kind but with an uncontrollable temper for which he seemed to take no responsibility they believed him perfectly capable of killing in a rage but no one had heard even a murmur that his taste ran to anything except women wellendowed ones rather than thin and certainly not childlike he appreciated laughter a little spirit and most definitely good conversation all of that she reluctantly recognized in them and thus she could not help but believe them she went home late in the evening tired and hungry her feet sore she had a whole lot more information but she was not sure that she was really any wiser rupert could certainly have killed someone in a rage in fact he was very fortunate that he had not already done so but the more she learned of him the less he seemed to have any reason to kill mickey parfitt in particular lord cardew had paid his sons debts when they must have outgrown his allowance time and time again he had rescued rupert from the consequences of his selfindulgence and lack of discipline surely parfitt of all people he would have paid off or had there been some quarrel between rupert and parfitt that was deeper than blackmail money parfitt made his living from pornography and blackmail he would know just how far to push before he drove any of his victims to despair and after jericho phillipss death wouldnt he have been even more careful erring on the side of caution rather than ruthlessness a blackmail victim driven to either murder or suicide is of no use monk was quiet and sunk in his own thoughts over their late supper he mentioned only that he was still trying to examine the trade on the boat and see if there were any other witnesses who would be useful under ormes supervision the foundling hospital matron had spoken to the boys from the boat but they were too frightened and bewildered to say anything of use and she had very quickly drawn the interviews to a close the matron understood what was in the balance but her first care was to the children she had there not future victims whitefaced and holding a child in her arms she had told orme to leave he had understood and had gone out silently sick with grief now hester cleared away the dishes and said nothing scuff looked from one to the other of them troubled but he asked no questions he went upstairs to bed early monk had already gone the next morning by the time hester served breakfast for scuff and herself she had made porridge because she knew he liked it and it kept him from being hungry well up to midday did e do it then he asked when his bowl was empty and he was ready for the toast jam and tea his face was earnest his eyes searched hers trying to understand looking for something to stop the fear growing inside him she hung up the striped dish towel she had been drying the dishes with and came back to the table she sat down and poured herself a cup of tea you know im still not sure she said honestly its very difficult to be certain that you know all the things you need to in order to be right scuff nodded slowly as if he understood but she could see from the trouble in his eyes that he didnt wots mr monk doin whys e all angry his voice dropped did i do summink no hester said keeping her voice level with difficulty trying to swallow back the emotion were all upset because we like rupert and we dont want him to have done it but we cant help thinking that he did oh his face cleared only slightly would yer still like im even if it turns out yere right an e did yes of course we would you dont stop caring about people because they make mistakes but that wouldnt save him from the law theyll ang im probably the idea was so horrible she found her throat tight and the tears stinging hard behind her eyes she tried to force the picture out of her head and failed scuff took a deep breath then wed better do summink eh he said his eyes steady on her face yes id intended to start this morning he stuffed the rest of his toast into his mouth and stood up she started to say that he shouldnt come because it could be dangerous and because he really couldnt help then she knew that both were wrong instead she took the last swallow of her tea and stood up as well he needed to be part of this she already knew all she could learn of rupert and none of it helped now she needed to know more of mickey parfitt the business in general and his part in it in particular her first instinct was to protect scuff from the details of such a trade then she remembered with misery that he was already more familiar with them than she was the only question was how much reminding him of them might increase his nightmares or would he ever get over them if he always looked the other way might they even grow larger and larger fed by her belief that they were too terrible to be faced where are we gonna begin he asked standing by the front door thats the problem hester admitted there are a lot of maybes and not much certainty it might be useful to speak to ruperts friends but i doubt they would say anything to me if it made them look bad which most of it would scuffs face was creased up with disgust we can try other prostitutes she suggested there may have been talk that we could follow up but i think that could take a long time squeaky robinson gave me a few names we can begin with scuff looked at her guardedly wot kind o people people who owe squeaky a favor or two and i know some like that myselfa couple of brothelkeepers an abortionist an apothecary i could go an ask mr crow if yer like he offered we could go and ask she corrected him i think thats an excellent idea but do you know where to find him course i do but it int no decent place fer a lady ter come now he looked worried scuff she said seriously ill make a bargain with you he stared at her dubiously ill look out for you but not look after you if you do the same for me she held out her hand to shake on it he considered for a moment or two then gripped it in his small thin fingers and shook deal he confirmed they went straight from paradise place to princes stairs and took the ferry across to wapping past the police station that monk commanded then they turned west along the high street at scuffs direction toward the pool of london and the biggest docks they did not talk scuff seemed to be watching and listening his jacket was buttoned right up to his chin and his cap was jammed hard onto his head he had on new boots his first that were actually a pair hester was sunk in her own contemplation of what she needed to learn and how much she could ask without endangering both of them pornography and prostitution were vast trades and there was a great deal of money to be made in either of them and of course there was a corresponding danger from the law not only profit but survival depended on knowing what not to say and particularly who not to say it to it took them most of the morning amid the noise and traffic the wagons and cranes and piles of cargo and timber before they eventually found crow in a tenement building on jacob street it was just inland from st saviours wharf on the south side of the river crow was a lanky man in his midthirties with coalblack hair which he wore thick swept back off his high forehead and long enough for it to sit on his collar at the back he had a lugubrious face until he smileda broad flashing grin showing excellent teeth they had only just caught him he was coming down the steps with his black gladstone bag in his hands he was dressed in a shabby frock coat and black trousers barely adequate to cover his long legs he was clearly delighted to see scuff and his eyes went to him first before he greeted hester hello mrs monk what are you doing in these parts trouble of course she replied holding out her hand he spread his own lean fingers and looked at them in distaste im filthy he said shaking his head his glance went to scuff again as if to reassure himself as to his wellbeing crow had dropped every other business to help search for scuff when the boy had been kidnapped by jericho phillips hester dropped her hand smiling back at him you heard about the murder of mickey parfitt she asked falling in step beside him as they walked back along the narrow street toward the river stepping carefully to avoid the gutter of course crow acknowledged no ill will mrs monk but i hope you dont find the poor sod that did for him if youve come to ask me to help you sorry but im too busy youd be surprised the number of sick people there are around here he looked up at the dense tenement buildings to the left and right of them grimed with smoke and constantly dripping water from the eaves she glanced at him his face was set in hard lines the easy smile vanished she had known him off and on since monks first case on the river nearly a year ago now but she realized she had seen only the thinnest surface of his character he was a man who never spoke of his background but he had had a good deal of medical training and used it to help those on the edge of the lawanimal or humanor in the iron grip of poverty he took his payment in whatever form was offereda debt in hand if necessary and kindness in return when it was needed she had no idea what had happened to prevent him from gaining his qualifications and practicing as a full doctor his speech was not from the dockland area but she could not place it he cared for scuff and that was all that mattered one knew far less about most people than one imagined parents place and date of birth education all told less of the heart than a few actions under pressure when the cost was high im afraid we already have a very good idea who it was she answered his challenge while watching her step as she picked her way over broken cobbles im trying to find a reason to cast doubt on his guilt or if not that then at least to show that he doesnt deserve the rope crow was surprised you want him to get off hester would not have put it quite so bluntly and she drew in her breath to deny it then she saw scuff looking at her and realized that perhaps crow was right that that was what she wanted it was difficult to answer the question honestly with scuff between them grasping every word i want the trade finished wiped out she said to do that i need to break the man behind itthe one with the money id rather not sacrifice rupert cardew in the process crows eyes widened incredulously would you like the crown jewels at the same time maybe just as a nice finish he skirted around a pile of refuse and a rat scuttled away not particularly hester answered keeping her face perfectly straight i havent sufficient use for them one would have to walk terribly upright to keep a crown from falling off i dont think i could do that scuff was puzzled shes joking crow told him putting his hand on the boys shoulder at least i hope she is half hester conceded then she smiled i might be able to but if i dropped anything somebody else would have to pick it up for me if you were wearing a crown i expect theyd feel obliged crow answered scuff laughed but the fear of being lost again separated from her was tight underneath as sharp as a knife point they all walked in silence for a couple of hundred yards past more boxes barrels and piles of wood finally they reached the steps to the ferry to the north bank the tide was turning and the water was choppy strings of lighters were making their way upriver laden with coal timber and round wooden barrels lashed together a coastal barge passed by sails fullset billowing out the light was bright on the water and the wind caught the edges of the waves whipping up a fine spray i want to know the details the police wont be able to find hester told crow after they were ashore on the north bank any whispers she did not really know what she was asking for the facts said that rupert was guilty but might a jury be persuaded to ask for leniency or when they heard what bestiality parfitt sold might they believe that any man whod become involved no matter how ignorant hed been initially was little better than parfitt himself or was it just that she liked rupert and for scuffs sake she was desperate to find the man behind parfitts business so she could prevent him from starting up again with someone new scuff needed to see them succeed to believe it really could happen and that he was a part of it crow she began do you think it could be something as simple as a business rivalry parfitt must have earned a lot of money from that boat if someone else took over his trade and his clients theyd make just as much wouldnt they perhaps what i really need to know is how the business was run who profits from his death in a business way never mind the blackmail or the moral side of it lets look at the money he nodded very slowly his smile widening give me a couple of days he tilted his head a little to one side i suppose you want the details rather than just my conclusions yes please my conclusions might be different he did not answer that but a brief flash of amusement lit his eyes itll be ugly he warned of course it will thank you there was really nothing more to be added now and she thanked crow and left where we goin now scuff asked keeping up with her by adding an extra skip into his step now and then we int just leavin it to im are we no hester answered decisively we are going to see if someone else with an interest in the boats profits might have been there the night parfitt was killed owre we gonna do that well if it is one of the people i think it might be he will have to have come up the river from his home if i can find someone who saw him it would be a start she had not told scuff anything about what sullivan had said of arthur ballinger and she assumed monk hadnt either if there was really anything behind it ignorance would be the safest shield for him like a cabby i think ill begin with the ferryman cabbies dont see a lot of peoples faces especially after dark course scuff said eagerly yer sittin in a boat an the ferrymans gotta see yer eh so if e dont wanna be seen an ave folks remember im ed row up the river isself or if e couldnt then ed cross where ed least likely be noticed a ole lot definitely she agreed lets try the ferrymen in chiswick first it took them well into the afternoon to get from the eastern end nearer the sea and the great wharfs and docks right across the city by omnibus to the statelier greener western edge and then beyond that again into the lush countryside and over the river to the southern bank there was no omnibus across barn elms park to the little township of barnes itself and finally to the high street right on the waters edge they were both tired and thirsty and had sore feet by the time they stopped at the white hart inn but scuff never complained hester wondered if his silence was in any way because he was thinking about this utterly different placegreen well kept almost sparkling in the bright hard light off the water on the surface it seemed a world away from the dark river edge where jericho phillips had kept his boat there the tide carried in and out the detritus of the port the broken pieces of driftwood some halfsubmerged bits of cloth and rope food refuse and sewage there was the noise of the city even at night the clip of hooves on the cobbles shouts laughter the rattle of wheels and of course always the lightsstreetlamps carriage lampsunless the mist rolled in and blotted them out then there were the mournful booms of the foghorns here the river was narrower there were shipbuilding yards on the northern bank farther down the shops were open busy occasional carts went by people called out but it was all smaller and there was no smell of industrial chimney smoke salt and fish no cry of gulls a single barge drifted upriver sails barely arced in the breeze scuff could not help staring around him at the women in clean pale dresses walking and laughing as if they had nothing else to do hester and scuff ate first a very late luncheon of cold game pie vegetables andas a special treata very light shandy scuff finished his glass and put it down licking his lips and looking at her hopefully when youre older she replied ow long do i ave ter get older he asked youll be doing it all the time afore i can ave another one o these he was not about to let it go about three months she had difficulty not smiling but you may have another piece of pie if you wish or plum pie if you prefer he decided to press his luck he frowned at her ow about both she thought of the errand they were on and what had driven them to it good idea she agreed i might do the same when there was nothing at all left on either plate she paid the bill scuff thanked her gravely and then hiccuped they walked down to the river and started looking for ferries fishermen anybody who hung around the waters edge talking pottering with boats or tackle generally observing the afternoon slip by it was more than two hours pleasant but unprofitable before they found the bowlegged ferryman who said he had carried a gentleman from the city over late on the night before the morning mickey parfitts body was found in corney reach aw i dunno is name lady the ferryman said dubiously never ask folkss namesgot no reason ter ave i don ask where theyre goin neither taint none o my business jus be civil talk a little ter pass the time like an get im ter the other side safe an dry i recall though as this gent were a real toff knowed all kinds o things hester felt the grip tighten in the pit of her stomach and suddenly the possibility of profound tragedy was real truly how old would you say he was the man bent his head a little to one side and looked at her then at scuff then back at her again why yer wanna know missus e done yer wrong someow she knew what he was thinking and she played on it without a moments shame i dont know unless i know if it was he she answered keeping the amusement out of her eyes deliberately she wanted to laugh then she thought of all the women of whom it would be true and the amusement vanished a knot of shame pulled tight inside her for her callousness dont think so love he said sadly biting his lower lip this fellerd be a bit too old fer you too old she said with surprise she gulped it could not be rupert he was not much more than thirty younger than she are you sure she was fishing for time trying to think of an excuse for asking him to describe the man in more detail the ferryman sucked in his cheeks and then blew them out again mebbe i shouldnt a said that still an andsome enough figure of a man fair hair hester asked thinking of rupert standing in the sun in the doorway of the clinic slender but quite tall no the ferryman said decisively sorry love ed a bin sixty like as not dark air near black close as i could tell in the lamplight like but a big man e were an not tall as yer might say more like most considering that the ferryman was unusually short hester wondered what he considered was average however it might only insult him to ask and apart from anything else she needed his help did he come back again later she asked changing the subject she felt awkward now that she had established that it was not the mythical deserting husband she had suggested then a new idea occurred to her you see im afraid it could have been my father he has a terrible temper and she left the rest unsaid a suggestion in the air he wasnt hurt was he yer do pick em dont yer the ferryman shrugged but e were fine bit scruffed up like e ad a bit of a tussle but right as rain in isself walked down the bank an leaped inter his boat dont you worry about im dont know about the young feller with the fair air i never seed im perhaps he wasnt here she said it with an upsurge of relief she knew it was foolish even as she welcomed it it meant nothing only one difficulty avoided of a hundred wot does it mean scuff asked as they thanked the man and walked away along the path is it good im not sure hester replied that at least was true it certainly wasnt rupert even in the pitch dark you couldnt mistake him for sixty and if this man were scruffed up he would have been in a fight which from the sound of it he won like chokin mickey parfitt and sending im over the side yes something like that she agreed he shivered was there other people in the boat not that evening apparently except for the boys locked in belowdecks he hesitated where are they now hester heard the strain in his voice saw the memory bright and terrible in his eyes theyre all safe she told him unwaveringly looked after and clean and fed it was a moment or two before he was satisfied enough to believe her gradually the stiffness eased out of his back and shoulders so oo were it then were it the man oo killed mickey parfitt quite possibly ow do we find out oo e is i have an idea about that right now we are going home we int gonna look fer im he was shivering very slightly trying to stand so straight that it didnt show he pulled his coat tighter deliberately although it was not any colder i need to ask william a few questions before that i dont think i will get two chances to speak to him about this so i need to do it properly the first time e int gonna let yer scuff warned i wouldnt if i was im i dare say not she did not bother to hide her smile which is why i wont ask him and neither will you i might she looked at him it wasnt a threat he was afraid for her she saw it in his eyes like a hard twisting pain he had found some kind of safety for the first time in his life and it was threatened already he was used to loss although this was too deep for him to handle alone he was too used to loneliness to be able to share too vulnerable even to acknowledge it ill come wif yer he said watching her face waiting for her to refuse him thank you she accepted it was rash perhaps it would cost them both if william is angry later ill tell him you came only to make sure i was safe he smiled and pushed his hands deeper into his pockets right he agreed overwhelmed with relief what hester actually wanted to know from monk was what he had been told about where arthur ballinger had been on the night of parfitts death the ferrymans description fitted him extraordinarily wellalthough of course it also fitted several thousand other men closely enough she hated even thinking that it mightve been ballinger because of how it would hurt rathbone and of course margaret but for scuffs sake whoever was behind the boats run by men like phillips and parfitt he had to be stopped and to be hanged for murder was as good as being imprisoned for the kidnapping and abuse of children blackmail she doubted could ever be proved because no one would admit to being a victim that was part of the blackmailers skill why monk said immediately they were standing side by side with the french doors ajar in the calm late evening the smell of earth and damp leaves in the air dusk had fallen and there was little sound outside in the small garden except for the wind through the leaves and once or twice the hoot of an owl flying low the sky was totally clear the last light on the river below like the sheen on a pewter plate up here the noise of boats was inaudible no shouts no foghorns a single barge with a lateen sail moved upriver as silently as a ghost why monk repeated watching her hester had never intended to deceive him just to keep her own counsel a little because i was speaking to crow this morning in case he can help help whom he asked softly rupert cardew i cant blame him for killing mickey parfitt but the law wont excuse him hester no matter how vile parfitt was not unless it was selfdefense and honestly thats unbelievable can you imagine a man like parfitt standing by while cardew took off his cravat and put half a dozen knots in it then looped it around parfitts throat and pulled it tight didnt he hit him over the head first she argued if parfitt were unconscious he wouldnt be able to stop him rupert might she stopped it was exactly the argument monk was making yes i see she admitted if he was unconscious then he was no danger to rupert or anyone else precisely you cant help him hester there was sorrow in his voice and defeat and in his eyes a bitter humor she knew he was remembering with irony their crossing swords with rathbone when he had defended jericho phillips in court and they had been so sure of victory taking it for granted because theyd been convinced of his total moral guilt she wanted to argue but every reason that struggled to the surface of her mind was pointless when she tried to put it into words it all ended the same way she didnt want rupert to be guilty she liked him and was grateful for his support of the clinic she was desperately sorry for his father she knew perfectly well that rupert was not the power nor the money behind parfitts business and she wanted to destroy the man who was she was trying to force the evidence to fit her own needs which was not only dishonest it was in the end also pointless no i suppose not she conceded he reached out his hand and took hers gently there was nothing to add since scuffs rescue from phillipss boathurt frightened and very weakhe had made a point of going out during most days as soon as he was well enough just to prove that he was still independent and quite able to look after himself both monk and hester were careful to make no remark on it it was the evening of the third day after hester had met with crow that scuff came in well before supper sniffing appreciatively at the kitchen door as the aroma of a hot pie baking greeted him and he saw hester take down the skillet and set it on the top of the stove crow got summink for yer he said cheerfully said ter tell yer ell meet yer at the riverside opposite the chiswick eyot termorrer at midday wi wot yer asked fer cheapestd be if we got the train ter ammersmith an then an ansom ter the ammersmith bridge an along that way i know where it is he inhaled deeply s that apple pie hester and scuff were at the appointed place a quarter of an hour early the following day standing watching the boats on the river there was a movement hester caught almost at the corner of her vision and she turned to see crows lanky figure striding along the quayside his coat flapping his black hair flying in the wind she started toward him he glanced at scuff as she reached him but he was still standing a few paces away staring upriver is it something he shouldnt know hester asked quickly i can send him off on an errand he insisted on coming hes looking after me surely she did not need to explain that to crow its an even worse business than i thought he said quietly but i dont know what good thatll do your friend if id known what that bastard did to little boys id have killed him myself and not as nicely as a quick blow on the head his face was hard lips tight id have practiced a spot of surgery he wouldnt have approved of and made damn sure he saw and felt every bit of it hed have watched himself bleed to death he looked at scuff and as scuff turned and saw him the rage was wiped from crows eyes he made himself smile back the wide grin that was so characteristic of him you got summink for us scuff asked expectantly crossing over to them of course crow replied dyou think id come all the way up here to the end of the world if i hadnt its this way and without any further explanation he led them along the road ships and taverns on one side the steep drop to the river on the other after about a hundred yards he crossed the street dodging the few carts there were and went into the narrow entrance of a lane running inland between shops and houses then he led them past a stretch of open green and into a small alley off chiswick field he knocked on the door of one of the houses then after a slight hesitation knocked again with exactly the same pattern it was opened immediately by a girl of about nineteen or twenty she was plump with very fair skin completely without blemishes and hair so pale as to be almost white in the dark hallway she saw crow and her face tightened with fear but she made no attempt to close the door again crow gave his huge smile all shining teeth and pushed the door wider so it almost touched the wall behind it hello hattie he said cheerfully good time to call is it i brought someone to see you without looking back he beckoned to hester and scuff to follow him in scuff closed the door and trailed behind looking from one side to the other almost treading on hesters heels hattie took them to a narrow kitchen where a small fire kept a cooktop hot and a pump in the corner dripped water into a tin bowl wot yer want she said gulping with tension she had wide light blue eyes and she kept them on crow as if there were no one else in the room tell mrs monk what you told me about rupert cardew crow replied his voice was gentle almost coaxing but there was a quality of power in it that belied his easy expression hattie gulped hester saw that her hands were shaking i took it she said not to hester as directed but still to crow you took what hattie he pressed she put her white hand up to her throat is tie e ad it orff anyow an when e werent lookin i id it e were stupid drunk an e never noticed ed gone wifout it his cravat what color was it hattie blue wi little yeller animals on it she made a faint squiggle in the air with her finger why did you take it i dunno yes you do was it mickey parfitt who told you to no it she gulped again it were the night before e were found in the river who did you take it from hattie mr cardew i told you and who for who did you give it to she shook her head and her body stiffened until her muscles seemed to lock no i dunno who got it i int sayin nothin its more n me lifes worth crow turned to hester i cant get any more out of her than that im sorry hester looked at the girl again perhaps it would place her life in jeopardy that was not difficult to believe it doesnt matter she said quietly all that is important is that rupert didnt have it so he couldnt have been the one who knotted it and put it around mickey parfitts neck thank you that makes all the difference she smiled back at crow and felt her smile grow wider and wider on her face of course she would have to press hattie later as to whom she had given the cravat to but it might be possible to find out through someone else there would be others around who would have seen a strangeror any visitor for that matter for the moment the relief that rupert was not guilty was all she needed the identities of the murderer of mickey parfitt and the man behind the pornographic business on the boats were next a piece at a time she smiled across at hattie and thanked her again chapter monk went across the river on the early morning ferry it was a cool quiet day barely a ripple on the water in the slack tide swathes of mist half veiled the ships at anchor strings of barges seemed to appear out of nowhere he had been collecting the evidence against rupert cardew to present when he came to trial it was a miserable job and in truth he had little more taste for it than hester had but the more he learned the easier it became to see rupert as a spoiled young man whose louche style of life and ungoverned temper had finally caught up with him in mickey parfitt he had met the one problem his father could not solve for him no amount of money would have been sufficient to stop the blackmail that had clearly worked so well the only inconsistency was that parfitt was a professional at extortion he had been thirtyseven years old and had survived for the last ten of these by profiting one way or another from other mens weaknesses there had been at least one suicide among his victims possibly more but no one had ever attacked him before it seemed he had judged very precisely where to draw the line in his bloodsucking or his threats a dead victim is bad for business and he never forgot thatat least not until recently was that a weakness in the case or simply a fact yet to be explained rathbone had not merely beaten monk in the trial of jericho phillips he had humiliated him and laterwhen she had testifiedhester as well he had done it with the knowledge of how to hurt that only a friend possesses monk still felt a tide of anger burn up in him when he remembered it perhaps it hurt him more on her behalf than it had hester herself they had never spoken of it as if it were a wound still too painful to touch this time monk would make sure that rupert cardew was guilty and that he had proved it beyond any doubt reasonable or not or else monk would find the man who was guilty and prove that of course what he wanted far more than the poor devil whod killed mickey parfitt was the man who had set him up in business and had found his clientele among those whose weakness for the excitement of the forbidden the illegal and the obscene he had fed and exploited monk would find and prove that whoever it was even if it were arthur ballinger himself as sullivan had claimed indeed even were it lord cardewanyone without exception the ferry reached the far side monk paid the fare and climbed the slippery steps up to the dock he was reluctant to prosecute rupert cardew but there was no possible way to avoid it what grieved him most was that the whole thing was so utterly pointless he would never have taken off his distinctive silk cravat deliberately knotted it and then strangled an unconscious man it seemed such an unnecessary thing to doand monk realized one that would give him no emotional satisfaction there was no bodily contact no release of the pentup violence there was something coldblooded about it but that was the only part he did not understand the passion to destroy parfitt he understood perfectly he reached the top of the steps as the sun came through the haze and made the dew on the stone momentarily bright he walked quickly toward the road had rupert really been naive enough to think that would end the trade was he so spoiled so cosseted from reality that he believed a man like parfitt was the power behind the business the one who found the vulnerable patrons and then judged exactly how far to bleed each one but it was the man behind parfitt that monk wanted and that was what he had in mind an hour later when he called to see oliver rathbone after a short wait he was shown into rathbones neat and elegant room good morning monk rathbone said with some surprise a new case he indicated the chair opposite his desk for monk to sit down thank you monk accepted leaning back as if he were relaxed crossing his legs the same case rathbone smiled sitting also and hitching his trouser to stop it from creasing as he crossed his legs and he too leaned back since we are on opposite sides this should prove interesting what can i do for you perhaps save cardew from the rope rathbones smile vanished a look of pain in his eyes monk saw it and understood monk was glad it was not his skill or judgment on which rested the weight of the saving or losing of a mans life im sorry monk apologized it was probably inappropriate but for a moment they were not adversaries they felt the same pity and revulsion at the thought of hanging i have no wish to prosecute him at all he went on when i first found parfitts body i considered not even looking for whoever killed him after id seen the boat and the boys kept there but when the cravat turned up i had no choice rathbones face was bleak i know that what is it you want monk the man behind it dont you of course but i have no idea who that is he met monks eyes directly without a flicker was he remembering the night when sullivan had killed phillips so hideously and then himself after he had said that the man behind it all was arthur ballinger why had he pointed to ballinger had it been anger ignorance madness while the balance of his mind turned had it been revenge for something quite different or the truth rathbone could not afford to think that the man was margarets father the price of that would be devastating yet nor could he afford to ignore it monk did not want to do this either but he also could not look away for cardew and more important to him for scuff no monk said slowly but if the right pressure were put upon cardew then he might give enough information for us to find out why should he rathbone asked his voice tight and careful surely by doing that he would automatically be admitting to the most powerful motive for killing parfitt i know that you believe you can prove that he did kill parfitt but he swears he did not and you believe him monk said actually there is no point in your assuming that even if you are right it is what the jury believes that matters if he will give us a record of every payment he made to parfitt dates and amounts we might be able to trace it through parfitts books if it comes out in the open in court it could shake other things loose and hang cardew for certain rathbone said quietly his own society will never forgive him for frequenting a boat like that whether he killed the bastard who ran it or not his mouth pulled into a delicately bitter smile apart from anything else it would betray the fact that men of his social and financial class were the chief clients and enablers of creatures like parfitt and while that is true making it public is another thing altogether i know that monk conceded but his revulsion when he learned the real nature of the business but was still bled dry will earn him some sympathy that is your job not protecting the reputations of others like him i know no evidence that his story on that account is anything but the truth rathbone put his elbows on the desk and his fingertips very gently together you are offering me life in prison in exchange for full admission with details you can prove of his visit to the boat the nature of what went on there and his payment of blackmail money to parfitt and all this is in the hope that it will somehow lead you to the man behind it there was no point in arguing the shadings of meaning yes ill ask him but im not sure if i can recommend it is in his interest god what a mess monk did not answer him monk worked on the river the rest of the day there had been a large theft of spices from an east indiaman in the pool of london and it took him until nearly midnight to trace the goods and arrest at least half the men involved in the crime by quarter to one a new moon in a mackerel sky made the river ghostly ships were riding at anchor sails furled like a gently stirring lace fretwork against the light beautiful and totally without color there was only a faint murmur of water and the sharp smell of salt in the air monk stepped off the ferry at princes stairs and walked slowly up the hill to home hester had left the light on in the parlor but it was only when he stepped in to turn the gas off that he saw she was curled up in the large armchair sound asleep his first thought was clear shed been waiting for him or she would have been in bed was scuff ill no of course not if he were she would have been with him he remembered how many nights she had spent in the chair beside scuffs bed when he had been injured hunting the assassin in the sewers he bent down and spoke her name softly not to startle her hester she opened her eyes and sat up smiling pushing her hair back off her face where it had fallen out of its pins he didnt do it she said with intense pleasure monk was confused and too tired to think who didnt rupert cardew she stood up so close to him that he could feel the warmth of her and smell her skin and her hair clean cotton and very faintly soap im sorry she went on i know that leaves the case open and you have to go back and start again but im just so glad it wasnt rupert he told you that he asked im surprised they let you in to see him did his father take you a look of disgust flickered across her face william for heavens sake im not a complete simpleton no i havent been to see him nor would i expect him to say anything different she smoothed her skirts without much effect they were creased beyond any help but a flat iron with help from crow i found a prostitute rupert visited earlier that day and she admits that she stole his cravat and gave it to someone else but shes terrified to say who but if rupert didnt have it then he couldnt have used it to strangle mickey parfitt and thats the only real evidence against him all the rest just bears that up he never denied having been on the boat or having been blackmailed for it but so have many other people she had just broken his case against cardew he should have been disconcerted even angry but instead he felt an absurd sense of relief she saw it in his eyes and put her arms around his neck pulling his head down gently and kissing him monk woke late and hester was already up it was a moment or two before he remembered what hester had told him about the cravat when it came back he leaped out of bed washed shaved and dressed as fast as he could he had a new idea forming in his mind and he had to draw the pieces of it together prove them one by one he ate the most perfunctory breakfast and left the house with only a brief word to scuff and a quick moment of meeting hesters eyes touching her cheek and then going out of the door as he crossed the river again in the rhythmic movement of the ferry his mind was absorbed in what this new revelation meant he had no doubt of what hester had said but later he would go and see this young woman and make certain that she had not been influenced to swear shed taken the cravat her testimony might have to stand up in court was it conceivable that lord cardew had hired someone to find her and had possibly even paid her to come up with such a lie he did not believe it but it was necessary that he be thorough if they ever found anyone else to accuse that person would no doubt hire a barrister to defend him who was something like as clever as oliver rathbone the question would be asked but monk would put it off until he had explored other possibilities orme had gone over parfitts financial records such as they were and had found nothing to suggest that parfitt had withheld any of the proceeds from the man who had given him the boat if he had then it was well hidden and certainly not spent on his own pleasure he lived no more comfortably than could be accounted for by the obvious takings of the boats trade without the blackmail whoever was behind it had had no apparent motive to get rid of parfitt he would only have to be replaced with someone just like him did he already have someone in mind a friend a relative a creditor to whom he owed some favor that was the man monk wanted to catch so intensely that he could taste it like a bitter flavor in his mouth was it ballinger or was it even possible that ballinger was another victim like sullivan had been except turned to recruit more victims perhaps as the price of his own survival a dangerous tactic ballinger was not a man whose flaws one could manipulate before anything else monk needed to know as much as possible of the facts where had ballinger been on the night of parfitts death hester had told him of the ferryman rowing a man resembling ballinger across the river and then later bringing him back it would not be difficult to ascertain if it had been ballinger if he had been visiting a friend he would have no occasion to deny it certainly ballinger said with a smile when monk visited him in his offices in the city bertie harkness he sat at ease behind a large desk the room was unostentatiously comfortable bookcases lined two walls filled in a disorderly manner with dark leatherbound volumes clearly there for use not ornament there were old hunting prints on the walls personal mementoes on sills a portrait of his wife in a silver frame a bronze bust of julius caesar a pair of pearlhandled opera glasses known each other for years ballinger continued in fact far longer than i care to remember i drop by for a late supper and a little conversation every now and again he looked puzzled why does this concern you inspector i find it impossible to believe that you suspect harkness of anything his eyebrows rose or is it me you suspect he said it with faint amusement but his eyes were unnervingly direct monk made himself look surprised of what you might have some sympathy with whoever killed mickey parfitt many people might have myself included but i dont think you would lie to protect him he gave a slight shrug unless he were a member of your own family for example but i have no reason whatever to suspect that ballinger still appeared puzzled monk looked at his hands on the leather inlaid surface of the desk they were motionless deliberately held still monk smiled i have an idea as to the time you crossed the river by ferry he saw a very faint smile lift the corners of ballingers mouth and in that instant monk knew that in spite of ballingers affectation to the contrary he was not surprised naturally we questioned anyone that we knew would be in the area monk went on almost expressionlessly such as ferrymen it is always possible that any witness might have seen something that would later have meaning for them i did not see rupert cardew ballinger replied studying monks face at least not so far as i know i observed a few other people on the river some of them looked to be young men no doubt about private pleasures i could not responsibly identify any of them im sorry even so monk persisted if you could tell me the time as closely as you know it and exactly what you did see it might help ballinger hesitated as if still puzzled as to its importance even if it merely confirms someone elses story monk added or proves it false i couldnt identify anyone ballinger said and gave a slight gesture of helplessness apart from the ferryman of course stanley willington of course monk agreed but if you saw one person or two it could help or if you saw no one at a time someone claimed to be there he allowed it to hang in the air selfexplanatory yes i see let me think ballingers eyes never left monks as if it were a kind of duel to which neither of them would admit i took a hansom as far as chiswick i think i arrived there about nine there were still a number of people around although it was dark i saw them as figures on the quayside talking laughing i smelled smokecigars i recall that it is a highly recognizable aroma and it suggests gentlemen monk nodded it was a clever observation and he acknowledged it i waited about ten minutes for a ferry i preferred to have stanley he entertains me the description was good and it matched willingtons own account as no doubt ballinger knew it would ballinger continued all of it was in accordance with what monk already knew but it served the purpose he intended he would check on it not only with the men on the river all the way up to mortlake a distance of nearly a mile and a half but with bertie harkness whose address ballinger also offered thank you monk said when he was finished and standing by the door it may help us catch someone in a lie i admit i dont see the purpose ballinger replied was i misinformed that you have evidence sufficient to bring rupert cardew to trial monk smiled perhaps a little wolfishly memory harsh in his mind he is defended by oliver rathbone he replied so i need every scrap of evidence i can find there must be no surprises no loopholes im sure you understand ballinger inhaled deeply then let out a sigh and smiled back of course he agreed not bothering to conceal the pleasure in his eyes monk spent another complete day checking on all the accounts he had from orrie jones crumble tosh and various other people on the river who had serviced the boat before he finally called on bertram harkness harkness was a portly man in his early sixties roughly ballingers own age he had a military bearing although he professed no retired rank and made no mention of service his hair was short and graying as was his bristling mustache he received monk in the study of his house a room lined with books drawings and a curious mixture of exotic seashells and miniature bronzes of guns mostly napoleonic cannons i dont know what you think i can tell you he said rather abruptly i was reasonably near the river that night but i saw nothing and heard nothing i had a late supper with arthur ballinger whom i have known for years since our school days actually he often drops by been a bit out of it since my injury took a bad fall from my horse he tapped his right thigh good of ballinger keeps me up with the news i cant get from the papers you know i see yes it must be pleasant to hear a little deeper insight than is printed for the general public monk agreed damned right so what on earth is it you want from me young man ballinger came up by river pleasant way to travel on an autumn evening but for gods sake if hed seen something of this wretched murder dont you think hed have told you there was challenge in his voice and the slightly aggressive cock of his head yes sir monk said politely increasingly aware that harknesss temper was thin he has already told me precisely what he saw but it is the timing that matters and he is not certain about it i thought you might be able to help in that harkness appeared mollified ah bad business sorry for cardew poor devil lost his eldest son and spoiled the younger happens easy mistake now hes going to pay for it up to the hilt both sons gone family name ruined damned grief children id have the bastard horsewhipped if they werent going to hang him anyway the time mr harkness monk reminded him it would help a great deal if you could tell me enough for me to know precisely when mr ballinger was on the river both coming here and going home again doesnt the damn ferryman know no sir well i didnt look at the clock he said brusquely we sat down to supper about ten as i recall talked for an hour or so afterward dare say he left at midnight whatever he says thatll be the truth harkness regarded monk with disfavor good sportsman ballinger always admire that you know no i dont suppose you do he looked monk up and down dont look like a damn policeman ill give you that monk swallowed his temper with considerable difficulty good sportsman he inquired thats what i said good god man isnt that simple enough for you damn good at the oars and wrestling strong you see yes sir monk breathed out slowly there it was the sudden gift in all the other irrelevant evidence the idea burned hot and bright in his mind thank you mr harkness harkness shrugged i like to be fair he replied standing a little straighter monk forbore from making any reply to that although one rested on his tongue he thanked harkness again and allowed the butler to show him out into the blustery darkness of the street with the damp smell of the river in the air he took nearly half an hour to find a ferryman willing to row him back from mortlake to chiswick and he timed how long it took while he was sitting in the boat he considered what harkness had told him and went over in his mind all the times and details that he had been able to confirm of course none of the times was exact the only way to check them was against what other people had said orrie had taken parfitt over to the boat where it was moored upriver just short of corney reach and had left him there after quarter past eleven for what purpose he had said he did not know orrie was supposed to have gone back for him within the hour but had been held up and when he had done so at about ten to one parfitt had not been there crumble had verified orries departure and return on both journeys tosh had backed him up giving his own movementsnot difficult since he and crumble had been together most of the time ballinger had boarded the ferry at approximately ten past nine and had been rowed all the way up past the eyot along corney reach right to mortlake where harkness swore to his arrival and later his departure the ferryman affirmed having collected him again at half past midnight and reached chiswick at one in the morning more or less whereas rupert cardew had been drunk and unaccounted for for most of the evening after he had left hattie benson who said she had stolen his cravat and given it to someone she refused to name fear or had she been paid to say this and her fear was for the consequences of lying parfitts body had been found almost halfway along corney reach upriver from where his boat had been moored the questions burned in monks mind how far had it driftedor been dragged where had he actually been killed was it necessarily on the boat could he have had orrie take him to the boat and then left it again in some kind of dinghy from the boat itself or could someone else have come by water and he had gone with them monk needed answers to all of these questions had mickeys murderer taken him away and dropped his body overboard higher up for it to drift downstream misleading them all the more monk thought of that the more it seemed to make sense he could have been approaching the whole crime from the wrong direction from the beginning it had looked like a murder of desperation committed by a man angry and afraid of exposure or bled dry by blackmail and facing exposure but perhaps it had been more carefully planned than that and by a far cooler headnot a crime of passion but a business decision could parfitt have been rebelling against his backer his greed jeopardizing the whole project or had he been skimming to keep a higher percentage of the profit for himself which brought monk back to the question he both dreaded and most wanted to answercould ballinger himself have killed parfitt or was that thought ridiculous he went over the times of every movement again carefully if everyone were telling the truthtosh orrie jones crumble the ferryman harkness hattie benson even rupert cardewthen it would have been possible for ballinger a strong rower according to harkness to have taken harknesss own boat from its moorings and met parfitt somewhere along the river out of sight he could have killed him and put his body in the water then rowed back to moor the boat again and taken the ferry back to chiswick exactly as he had said it was tight but still possible the thought churned in his stomachheavy sick and impossible to get rid of how honest was his own thinking in this did he want the answer so desperately that he would settle for anything except defeat what he needed was proof that ballinger had known parfitt and if possible jericho phillips as well that would take a long and very careful retracing of all the evidence examining it looking for a completely different pattern from before he must start straightaway as soon as he had seen this hattie benson and had verified for himself her evidence regarding the cravat he found her by the middle of the following morning sitting in the kitchen of her small shared house in chiswick she looked tired and puffyeyed but even with a torn wrap around her nightgown and her hair tousled and falling out of its pins there was a beauty in her flawless skin and the naivete of her face i int done nothin she said before monk even sat down on the ricketybacked chair at the other side of the table from her he smiled bleakly i dont want to prosecute you miss benson i believe you can help me she rolled her eyes oh yeah this time o the mornin an all yer should be ashamed o yerself wotd yer wife say then eh you can ask her if you meet her again he replied with a rueful smile i would like you to tell me what you told her about taking rupert cardews dark blue cravat with the leopards on it hattie stared at him her mouth open she came here with a man called crow i believe monk continued you told them what happened the afternoon before mickey parfitts body was discovered in the river i need you to tell me again with rather more detail she froze i cant yes you can he insisted unless of course you were lying how could he persuade her to tell him and be sure it was the truth perhaps she had been merely a witness at the time she had spoken to hester and crow but now she realized what danger she would be in if she told the police that cardew was innocent she might only now be grasping the fact that they would begin to investigate the case all over again going back to people she knew and who knew her hattie he leaned forward a little across the table forcing himself to speak gently i dont want to charge you with stealing the cravat whether it was to keep for yourself to sell or to give it to someone else i certainly dont think it likely that you strangled mickey parfitt with it although it isnt impossible he let the suggestion hang in the air yer mad you are she said in horror ow in gawds name dyer think i could strangle a man like mickey e may a bin skinny as a broomstick but e were strong ed a bashed me ead in he was violent he asked o course e were violent yer stupid sod she shouted at him beat the shit out o anyone wot crossed im like who yer thinkin they killed im i tell you an yer dont think theyre gonna come arter me you could have killed mickey he went on thoughtfully someone hit him hard on the back of the head probably with a piece of fallen branch from a tree then when he was unconscious they strangled him it doesnt take a lot of strength to do that well i didnt i ad customers all night till past two in the mornin then i were knackered she said defiantly names would help me to believe you oh yeah im gonna be in great shape fer me business if i give yer a list o toffs wot come ere fer a bit o fun arent i do wonders fer me reputation that would i expect i can find them from somebody else he said it lightly as if it were an easy thing to do i can ask one of the pubs along the mall who was there that evening her face went even paler her skin as white as milk please mister yerll ruin me if i lose all me customers i int got nothin else i can do an i owe money theyll come arter me she leaned toward him and he could feel the warmth of her a faint smell of perfume and sweat if i tell yer i took the cravat that afternoon then yerll know it wasnt mr cardew as killed mickey an then yerll start all over again wi tosh an ell skin me alive for bringin trouble on im ell beat the ell out o me an then i wont be able ter work youre right monk said gently that would be unfair she took a deep shaky breath and made an attempt at a smile better to let rupert cardew hang he said quietly who do you suppose did kill mickey her hands were gripped so tight there were white ridges on her knuckles i dunno she whispered hell need to come back and make sure you dont tell anyone he pointed out rupert will remember that you took his cravat hell say so in court even if no one believes him i dare say the prosecution will call you to give evidence just to deny it close off all escape for him as it were jesus yere a bastard she said huskily worse than tosh yer are no im not hattie he shook his head although he felt a sharp stab of truth in what she said i want you to tell me the truth then ill keep you safe yeah she said contemptuously an ow are yer gonna do that then buy a nice little room somewhere where theyll never find me will yer an food an summink ter do then the answer was instant in his mind yes actually thats exactly what ill do but to do it i need the truth preferably with some way you can prove it she blinked hope flickering in her eyes like ow describe the cravat to me eh it were just a dark blue tie that sort o shape she made a picture in the air silk she added how long again she gestured holding her hands just under three feet apart go on he prompted what else its narrer in the middle an wide at both ends she said one end bigger than the other longer like was it plain or patterned patterned yer know that fer gawds sake it ad little yeller animals on it three at a time cats or summink how one on top o the other three of em thank you hattie i believe you now go and pack some clothes into a bag get dressed and i will take you to a safe place she remained sitting down where in the city portpool lane you will be safe there you will be fed and have your own room youll work for it at whatever mrs monk tells you to do he saw the look on her face it used to be a brothel he said with a broad smile its a clinic for sick women and injured ones she swore at him colorfully and with profound feeling but she did as he told her they took a hansom from the chiswick mall all the way into the city it was a long and expensive ride but monk felt it was more than warranted by the circumstances he did not wish her to be seen with him in fact he could not afford it it would be so easy for anyone to make a few inquiries and find the clinic perhaps he should warn squeaky robinson to keep a close eye on hattie and see that she did not show herself in the rooms where casual patients came for treatment or help at least until the case had come to trial and she had testified after that her safety could be reconsidered as the wheels rumbled over the streets he engaged her in conversation as much in order to take her mind off her present situation as in the expectation of learning anything more either way he failed yer gotta keep im from findin me she said hugging her arms around her body and sitting forward on the seat ell do me e will who he asked tosh o course she answered angrily i int scared o crumble e couldnt squash a fly feared of is own shadder an fearder still o tosh what about orrie jones i dunno sometimes i think es alfwitted other times i int so sure but e wouldnt do nuffink less tosh told im ter wotever e thought fer isself did you ever hear the name of jericho phillips no oos e hes dead now but he used to run a boat like mickeys but down the river an now mickeys dead eh she said thoughtfully could mr cardew a killed im no we know who killed phillips the man who did it killed himself also she gave a little grunt why did you think it was the same person he asked do you think mickey and phillips knew each other dunno mickey dint work for isself e come from chiswick same like the rest of us e never ad money ter get a boat someone else staked im mebbe it were the same person rupert cardew dont be daft she retorted whyd e have me steal is necktie ter make it look like e killed mickey if e were behind it all its someone wi twice the brains e as more than mickey or tosh they got cunning it int the same he did not argue deliberately he guided the conversation to other more pleasant subjects and finally they arrived at portpool lane he took her inside introduced her to squeaky robinson and then to claudine burroughs explaining the need to keep her safe she can help me claudine said decisively i wont let her out of my sight monk thanked her wondering wryly how hattie would take to that it might well be the best care she had ever known in the morning monk went to see rathbone and told him that he had now found evidence that made it extremely unlikely that rupert cardew was responsible for the death of mickey parfitt rathbone was startled and the cravat was it not his he asked as if unable to believe in the release from the responsibility of an impossible task yes it was his monk replied sitting down in the chair opposite rathbones desk without being invited a prostitute stole it from him that afternoon and gave it to someone she is too afraid to name but i believe her she can describe it far too precisely for her to have only seen it around his neck she had seen it undone felt it and knew it was silk she admitted to taking it rathbone drew in his breath as if to speak then changed his mind monk smiled sitting back a little in the chair did lord cardew pay her to say this he said aloud what he knew was in rathbones mind you could always ask him where is she rathbone did not bother to express his opinion of that remark i would prefer not to tell you monk replied for your safety as well as hers rathbones eyes widened for a moment then his face was expressionless again now what will you do about it he asked are you happy to mark the case as unsolved and move on does anyone really want to know who killed parfitt lord cardew might monk observed a shadow hangs over his son as long as we dont know but whether he does or not i do not because i give a damn about parfitt but i need to find out who was behind him oliver he did not look away he knew exactly what rathbone was thinking remembering and what the weight of it would be if monk were right for several seconds they stared at each other then monk rose to his feet im sorry he said very quietly little more than a whisper i cant let it go rathbone did not reply monk let himself out passing the clerk in the entrance lobby and thanking him in spite of the sun the air outside felt cold monk spent the next two days questioning everybody who had anything to do with mickey parfitt or who might have seen anyone on the river or the dockside at either chiswick or mortlake the night of parfitts death orrie crumble and tosh repeated their stories almost word for word and he could not shake them nothing was changed it was still possible that ballinger could physically have killed parfitt but without a motive without proof that they knew each other it was nothing more than an idea monk was pacing the path by the side of the river along corney reach when he ran into the fisherman dont walk up beind a man like that the fisherman spat i could a taken yer eye out wi me rod yer great fool where dyer grow up then in the middle of a desert he was a skinny little man with a long nose and a lantern jaw the cap pulled forward over his eyes hid whatever hair he had left monk apologized which was received with ill grace he was about to move on when out of sheer habit he asked the question do you spend a lot of time here the man squinted at him course i do yer daft sod i live up there he jerked his head back toward the lane leading out of the town into the fields do you have a boat yeah but it int fer ire i dont want some great lummox crashing about in it who dont know one end from the other i grew up in boats monk said testily the fact that he had only the briefest flashes of memory about that time was none of the mans affair im looking for witnesses not to go rowing myself witnesses ter wot i int seen nothing int even seen a bleedin fish terday not today the day before mickey parfitts body was pulled out of the river the man narrowed his eyes seen like wot people coming and going other than the ferrymen anyone you know behaving differently from usual anyone in a hurry frightened quarreling running away the man shook his head jeez yer dont want much do yer all i saw were tosh racin up ter mickey on the dockside yellin at im ter wait then e pulls a piece o paper out of is pocket an gives it to im mickey reads it swears summink orrible grabs a pencil from tosh an writes summink on it then e gives it back to im arter that e calls the ferryman and tells im es changed is mind e rushes away lookin all excited an far as i know nobody gone after im nobody it im nor strangled im nor threw im in the river monk felt a sharp flicker of excitement stir inside him but mickey changed his mind about where he was going he urged i jus said that yer damn fool int yer listenin the man snapped what time was this roughly about alf past ten thank you im most obliged what is your name if i need to speak to you again he nearly added in case he needed him to testify then thought better of it he would send orme for him and allow no choice orace butterworth the man replied grimly now get out of it yer frightenin the fish monk considered carefully how to make the best use of this delicate piece of information was this the message that had taken mickey out to the boat and then upriver toward mortlake to meet his death who was it from what had he believed he was going for it must have been urgent to take him back out again at that hour tosh would be very unlikely to tell monk nor would he tell him who the messenger was or where hed come from it would too easily implicate him in being party to the murder that had followed he would simply deny it all say that butterworth was wrong probably made it all up a good lawyer would demolish the story in minutes he must build a chain of evidence who was the weakest link orrie jones that was where to begin he found orrie in a boatyard patiently sanding a piece of wood there were other men around all sawing planing chiseling carefully fitting planks easing tongues into grooves the ground was covered with sawdust and it was in the air with the smell of wood and sap and there was the constant irregular sound of friction banging and someone whistling half under his breath lower down closer to the waters edge one old man with tattooed arms was caulking the sides of a boat his feet now and then shifting as the water seeped up through the shingle and soaked his boots they were sheltered from the breeze the tide slurped on the stone of the slipway there was a smell of river mud and wet wood orrie looked up and saw monk approaching and his face took on a look of infinite weariness you again he sighed int it enough yer ang the poor bastard yer gotta it every nail inter is coffin as well have to be sure it fits orrie just like those pieces youre putting together so wot is it now then orries good eye swiveled around when did mickey ask you to row him out to the boat i dunno yes you do think orrie met his eyes and gave him that rare focused look of total clarity why what does it matter now dont make no difference to oo killed im you tell the defense lawyer that orrie if you cant answer hell pick your life apart detail by detail and i dunno when e decided ter go out ter the boat orrie protested angrily but e dint ask me until a bit before eleven i know cos i jus started a pint an i ad ter put it down at the pub o course at the pub dyer think i were pullin it out o the river i dont care where you got it why did mickey decide so late were you at his beck and call anytime orrie stiffened no i werent i werent is bleedin servant summink came up monk nodded trying to curb his impatience and look encouraging an appointment unexpectedly right and he thought it was important enough to go not so convenient for him either was he angry or afraid no e werent e were appy why orrie drew in his breath looked at monk weighed up his best advantage and decided to answer well it dont matter now the poor sods dead eh e thought as it were a good chance o new business but dont waste yer breath askin me wot cos i dunno of course you dont did he come for you personally or did he send you a note he made his tone deliberately insulting maybe someone read it for you i read it meself orrie snapped jus cos i got a walleye dont mean im stupid really what did you do with the note i kept it o course never know when yer gonna need paper for summink orrie fished in his trouser pocket and slammed a grimy piece of paper onto the wood he was working with he glared at monk monk picked up the paper and saw written in an untidy but obviously educated script excellent new opportunity for business meet you on the boat midnight be there or ill give it to jackie and underneath was a further note scrawled in a completely different hand meet me at the dock oclock dont be late mickey monk looked at the paper a few moments longer feeling the texture of it between his fingers it was good paper pale blue and smooth torn from a larger sheet he turned it over and saw on the other side what had apparently been part of a longer letter or a list this one was written in ink but the words were harder to decipher as if it were another language perhaps latin although with only half of some of the words it was hard to tell the letters were well formed the script disciplined he wondered where it came from thank you orrie monk said in a whisper letting his breath out slowly that is just about perfect chapter the charges had been withdrawn against rupert cardew and he was released from custody once again the case was open monk stood in the station at wapping with the note orrie had given him in his hand it was strong evidence but against whom the pencil had smudged until it was only just legible and the dirt and finger marks on that paper made it impossible to place it could have been written by anyone monk was not even certain if it was the man behind the blackmail except who else would parfitt have turned out for at that time of night anyone else he would simply have told to come at a more convenient hour who else but someone he knew and trusted would he have met alone at night on the boat has to be orme agreed but we arent going to tie it to anyone with the note in that state all it proves is that someone baited him to go there and we know it was premeditated anyway and with cardews cravat orme picked up the paper turning it over in his hands any idea where it came from he asked squinting a little as he tried to read it then looking up slightly at monk no monk said honestly ballinger orme said could be parfitt knew who it was from or he wouldnt have gone obviously he knew him well enough that no signature was necessary ormes face was grim in the yellow glare of the lamplight outside the wind was rising and it was beginning to rain it was going to be a choppy crossing on the ferry has to be the man behind the blackmail orme said quietly we have to get it right this time monk felt a faint heat in his face a remembrance of shame orme had never referred to it but monk had let them both down with his carelessness in the jericho phillips case he had underestimated rathbones skill and his dedication to the processes of the law after all his years dealing with crime he had still been naive because his emotions had been so intensely involved he must not ever make that mistake again rathbone was his friend and he would feel a desperate pity for him if ballinger were guilty but monk must not for an instant forget that if that were so then rathbone would be the enemy and would fight with every art and skill he had to defend arthur he would for any clientthat was his duty but for margarets father he would go to the very edge of the abyss perhaps even further wouldnt monk himself for hester orme shook his head weve got nothing except coincidence he said warningly lot of possibles that wont carry any weight with a jury maybe wouldnt even get us to court i know monk told him ballingers a highly respectable man orme went on one of their own so to speak a solicitor his wife and daughtersll be in the gallery all looking sweet and supportive and like they believe every word he says what weve got are out of the gutter and look like it orrible jones with his eyes all over the place like a horse thats been spooked crumble all quiet and sneaky tosh wilkin whos a villain if ever i saw one hattie benson whos a prostitute an scared stiff looks like shes lying even when she isnt all right monk said sharply i know we havent got enough weve got the ferryman stanley willington but he just bears out what ballinger says himself picked him up at chiswick took him over the river and brought him back again and of course he has mr harkness swearing to his being in mortlake all the time between its all very tidy and hard to shake he had time to row down as far as the boat then back again and catch a hansom to where willington picked him up and we know from harkness that he was a strong rower but will harkness say that on the stand when he understands what that means probably not monk conceded he took the piece of paper from where orme had left it on the desk we need to make enough sense of this for certain the man who killed mickey parfitt wrote this to lure him to his death god knows no man better deserved it i know orme gave him a tight smile understanding in his eyes and a surprising gentleness weve still got to find him monk went back to chiswick to learn more about the boat and its patrons it was late october more than a month since mickey parfitts body had been found floating at corney reach the air was much colder the last echoes of summer were completely gone and the leaves were falling it had stopped raining but there was a smell of damp in the air and occasionally a drift of wood smoke from bonfires the late flowers were richly bronze and purple heavier darker than the blue and gold of spring the few stubble fields he passed were brazen almost barbaric in their beauty vividly and unmistakably waning it had always been monks favorite season he had flashes of memory sometimes of the great barren hills of northumberland where he knew hed been born so different from the lush easiness of the south the earth there seemed to be all bones no flesh the skies unending he would go back one day soon and see if it was still as beautiful or if it was only the familiarity then that had made it seem so now he had to follow the dirt and violence of mickey parfitts life and all the people he had known used cheated and betrayed it was time to face the details of what had happened on the boat monk had been putting it off perhaps as much for himself as for them but he must speak to the boys himself gently persistently ruthlessly he must have the hospital matron there as a witness so nothing rested on him alone but this time he could not allow her to intervene he realized how deeply he had been dreading it why he had sent orme instead of going himself telling himself that orme had children and would be better at it it took him two days of gentle endlessly repeated questions and it hurt more profoundly than he had imagined the matron looked at him as if he had been a criminal himself but she did not stop him more than two or three times his assumption about crumble had been correct cook companion laundryman gang master for cleaning chores and jailer sometimes here and there abuser as well the boys pale blurred and frightened faces reflected more misery than anger they were too young to understand that it could all have been wildly and beautifully different they might well have known hunger cold and exhaustion but without the added horror they could have had safety in sleep been touched only in tenderness or in the occasional wellearned chastening they could have been spared all their lives from the obscenity of degraded human appetite from the sight of men who despised others because they despised themselves now having questioned the boys it was monk who had dreams he could not bear he woke in the night his body aching and drenched in a sweat tears on his face he lay in the dark staring up at the faint shadow patterns on the ceiling as the wind moved in the trees outside he wanted to waken hester even if he did not tell her why just so he would not be alone with what was in his mind even if he just touched her felt the warmth of her but she would hurt for him she would need him to explain it at least a little and how could he do that if he gave it words it would recreate the reality in his mindthe white faces the frightened eyes the small bodies shivering with memory selfloathing and the terror of new pain and she would think of scuff she would wonder about all the other children and that was a burden selfish of him to share just to lighten it a fraction for himself could he tell her without weeping perhaps not she could not heal his sense of horror for him he would keep it closed inside him she would always know it was there because she had seen phillipss boat but she did not need to hear it again and see it through his eyes memory was a necessary tool in life sometimes it was a blessed thing and sometimes it was a curse if he even got up he would disturb her he might pretend there was nothing wrong but his need his pain would creep through she would unravel it all he turned over as if he were halfasleep and lay on his other side he would go back to sleep in some time and if he were lucky the dreams would be different he woke exhausted the following morning his eyes gritty and his head aching hester did not even ask him how he was she looked at him her face bleak and tender and words would have been superfluous anyway she got up and went to the kitchen raked out the ashes and lit the stove banking it up to get hot quickly it was early and she did not waken scuff today was sunday they could stay here together perhaps even go to church like a regular family scuff liked that because everyone could see them together see that he belonged she gave monk piping hot tea and fresh toast with his favorite jam then sat opposite him at the table there was no sound in the kitchen and the only light was from the gas bracket on the wall casting a yellow glow shadows everywhere when he had said nothing for several minutes she prompted him do you really want to find who killed parfitt she asked quietly pushing the toast across the table toward him yes of course i do he said vehemently then looked at her face he knew he had to be more honest even a half lie to her built a barrier he could not live with no not entirely parfitt was vile and if it was one of his victims id be happy to let him go if it was one of the boys or even two or three of them i dont even know if ill arrest them even if i could prove which ones i might not try to she said nothing he took the toast and buttered it but if its the man behind the whole trade probably behind phillips as well then yes i want to find him and i want to hang him monk fished the note out of his inside pocket where he carried it carefully in an envelope it was both a talisman and a weight dragging him down he took the note out of the envelope and put it on the table between them well away from the jam or the teapot this was written by a literate person adult its a strong hand used to writing she looked at him then down at the torn piece of paper she picked it up and read it but you have no idea who wrote it no its goodquality paper and perfectly ordinary pencil the envelopes mine she turned the note over in her hands the silence seemed to stretch until he could hear the ticking of the clock on the mantel over the stove her shoulders were stiff a tiny muscle clenched in her jaw was flickering hester his voice was quiet and yet filled the room she looked up at him the words are latin theyre medicines this is part of a list of things we order regularly for the clinic he stared at her this was the last thing he had expected her to say you recognize the handwriting he asked claudines she said but she could have given the list to several people margaret he replied isnt she the one who keeps the money and buys such things yes but so does squeaky sometimes her voice was tight full of grief he reached across the table and put his hand over hers he knew what she was afraid of squeaky had kept a brothel when theyd first met him he had seemed on the surface to have reformed his ways under duress perhaps but still quite genuinely he had even taken a kind of pleasure in his respectability had it all been an act to cover an even darker side had they been too blinded by hope and wish to look at him more closely how big a descent was it from running a brothel for women to investing in pornography with boys monk felt a little sick he knew how much hester had believed in all the people in the clinic considered them friends colleagues people she trusted with a common passion i have to ask him he said i cant no she cut across his words i will i wont let him dupe me i promise hester she stood up i will nowtoday its sunday i know he looked at her stiff straight back the way she walked the very careful manner in which she picked up the plates and put them into the basin to wash deliberately as if in a moments absence of mind she might grip them so hard she would break one perhaps he should let her speak to squeaky then she would not feel so powerless so incapable ill wait outside he told her she was standing at the basin and she turned to give him a swift look something close to a smile ive got to leave bread out for scuff and butter and jam ill waken him and then im ready squeaky looked up from his ledger as hester came into his room and closed the door behind her you look as if you lost sixpence and found nothing he said dourly her ladyship giving you difficulties no not at the moment she replied she took the envelope out of her pocket and then the list as well she put them both on the table in front of him but kept her finger on the list leaning forward a little so her weight was on her hand there was not a flicker in his face its torn he observed int no use like that whatre you giving it to me for get claudine ter make it out again is it claudines hand she asked course it is you gone blind or summink he squinted up at her you look sick whats wrong now he was anxious even concerned for her she turned the paper over he frowned looking at it reading it what in hells that he demanded it means summink or you wouldnt be looking at it with a face on you like a burst boot whos supposed to go oh jeez the usual trace of color vanished from his sallow face its to do with that bleeding murder isnt it you cant think claudine had anything to do with it thats just stupid youve taken leave of your wits if you think shed even know about things like that you think she went up there and done in mickey parfitt with cardews necktie and all you think he left it behind here and she no squeaky i dont but did you even as she said it she thought of hattie benson safe downstairs in the laundry with claudine apparently looking after her and squeaky supposed to keep everyone else from going down and seeing her his face was full of conflicting emotions anger hurt fear and also a kind of gentleness no i didnt i spose i had that coming for my past life and if idve known what parfitt was i might have id also have more sense than to write him a note on paper from here is it from here hester asked he looked at it again no we dont spend that sort of money on paper even the ledger isnt that good but just cos its quality dont mean claudine had anything to do with it she may be an odd old article but when you get to know her shes solid shes got guts and she dont never tell no lies you cant think that of her its wrong i didnt she admitted he winced you thought i did it it was a statement well i could have he needed doing best at the end of a rope and i wouldnt help you catch whoever did do it but it werent me she believed him thank you she said quietly tomorrow ill ask claudine if she remembers writing this and what she did with it dont you let her feel you think as she done it he warned itd hurt her something terrible and she dont deserve that in spite of herself hester smiled she could remember very clearly how claudine and squeaky had hated each other in the beginning she had thought him obscene both physically and morally he had seen her as arrogant useless and cold a middleaged woman sterile of mind and devoid of passions it had been her crazy pursuit of phillipss pornographic photographs at fearful risk to herself that had finally changed his mind and it was his effective if rather quixotic rescue of her that had changed her mind about him i wont she promised hester was in early on monday morning but a brief and businesslike meeting with margaret in the pantry delayed her meeting with claudine we are rather short of laundry supplies margaret warned i have just been down there and cautioned them to be a little less generous in their use we cannot afford to replace them at this rate thank you hester said briefly is there anything else margaret hesitated seemingly on the edge of saying something more then changed her mind and went out of the room hester heard her footsteps on the wooden floor brisk and purposeful she found claudine in the medicine room and showed her the paper holding out only the side with the list on it claudine frowned then looked up and met hesters eyes what happened to it i wrote it out for margaret and she got me all those things that list is several weeks old hester felt bruised suddenly tired how many weeks i dont know four maybe five why it hardly matters claudine replied youre sure you gave it to margaret hester insisted yes of course i am she actually got all those things for you yes if she hadnt i would have written it out again but i didnt have to what is this about hester is something missing no nothing at all it doesnt have to do with the clinic i dont understand claudine looked thoroughly puzzled hester shook her head a little you dont want to she said gently its the message on the other side thats important not this what happened to the list after she brought you the items on it ive no idea i didnt see it again after i gave it to her you didnt check off the items against it hester suggested i had the receipts from the apothecary those are all i need for the ledger are you quite sure you didnt ever see the list again not until now why thank you hester gave her a tiny smile almost more of a grimace and went out of the room closing the door softly she gave the list back to monk he waited its claudines list for margaret to shop from she told him margaret never gave it back because claudine took the prices from the apothecarys receipts she swallowed hard i wish it werent i know he murmured im sorry i cant leave it if its ballinger i must still find him not for parfitts sake but because of the children she nodded oliver will defend him he cant refuse she watched monks face well have to have irrefutable proof rupert cardew closed the door of the morning room behind him and stared at monk he still looked tired as if the shock of arrest had not completely left him even though he was now free however he was composed and courteous and as always beautifully dressed what can i do for you mr monk he asked monk felt churlish and it put him at a disadvantage i apologize what i have to ask you is extremely unpleasant but this is a case i cannot afford to leave rupert looked surprised really you care so much that parfitt is dead on the contrary if that were all i would be delighted to turn my time to something more important monk admitted but i want to find the man behind the blackmail rupert smiled very slightly not in amusement but in selfcriticism are you going to warn me that i am still vulnerable i assure you i know that i assumed you were aware of it mr cardew monk told him that is not why i came oh rupert looked surprised but not worried i need to know a great deal more from you than you have told me so far monk replied im sorry he meant the apology more than cardew would understand or believe i dont know anything more rupert said simply i really have no idea who killed parfitt for gods sake man dont you think id have told you already if i did of course if you had realized or thought for a moment that i would believe you i think it was arthur ballinger who did it if not personally then by using one of parfitts own men he saw cardew start with surprise and ignored it but i have to prove it beyond any doubt he continued if ballinger is charged he will be defended by oliver rathbone and i know from experience that rathbone could get even jericho phillips off how hard do you imagine he is going to fight for his fatherinlaw ruperts mouth tightened and the corners went down i see but i still dont know anything you know about the trade monk said grimly rupert blushed i dont know about his side of it i didnt expect you to i can deduce a good deal of that i need to know his clients how the blackmail was paid the sort of amounts and exactly what the performances were like and who attended rupert went white monk ignored that also and i need to know about the suicide a few months ago what led up to it i cant tell you that rupert was appalled that would be a betrayal i knew you would see it that way monk said quietly yes you would in a sense be betraying the other men who used the abuse of children for their entertainment he saw rupert wince the shame filling his face he had expected it it hurt monk to have to be so blunt but it changed nothing whereas if you dont tell me you will be betraying the children on that boatand all those like them and if you think carefully and with absolute honesty youll realize you will be betraying your father and perhaps the better part of yourself rupert shook his head slowly you dont know what youre asking really monk raised his eyebrows do you think your social class are the only people who feel loyalty toward their friends or to those to whom they are bound by promises of conspiracy and hiding their shame you are ashamed of it arent you a flame of anger lit ruperts eyes yes of course i am you he struggled for words and could not find them and you think embarrassment and an apology are enough to make the balance even again no i dont ill regret it the rest of my life rupert was shouting now but i cant undo it remorse is excellent monk said levelly but it isnt enough nor is money if you want any kind of redemption then you must help me stop at least some of it from happening again how many times do i have to tell you i dont know who killed parfitt rupert said desperately it may well have been ballinger but i dont know anything to help you prove it i didnt see him and i wouldnt recognize him if i had i dont even remember half that evening except as a nightmare telling you the names of my friends who went there isnt going to do anything except embarrass them and make me a social outcast thats the price monk replied and is their friendship worth that much to you dont be such a damn fool ruperts voice was high and angry again touched with fear everyone will despise me for ratting on friends not just the men concerned and their families and their friends monk felt the resolve harden in him like a cold gray stone in his gut then tell me about the performances he accentuated the word where did you meet did you all go to chiswick separately or together shared a hansom perhaps you wouldnt go in your own carriagesthey might be recognizedor want your coachman to know for that matter separately mostly rupert answered grimly what has that to do with ballinger or anything else monk ignored the question how do you get from the shore to parfitts boat someone rowed us either that revolting little man with the walleye orrible jones if you say so or the other why monk ignored that question too by agreement how did you know he wasnt just a ferryman how did he know who you were and that you wanted to go to that boat and not just to the other shore how did he know you were one of parfitts clients you could even have been police its not illegal rupert said miserably just immoral monk asked sarcastically thats why you do it up there in chiswick miles from home and at night on the river rupert glared at him i didnt say i was proud of it just that it isnt anything to do with the police actually torturing and imprisoning children is illegal monk told him we didnt do that to anyone you just watched other people do it monks disgust made his voice shake his throat straining with the force of his emotions and homosexuality is illegal too ruperts face was scarlet apart from the question of legality mr cardew monk went on ruthlessly would you like to be forced to have anal intercourse with another man for the entertainment of a crowd of drunken lechers did that happen to you when you were six or seven years old and you screamed and bled and thats why stop it rupert shouted his voice cracking all right i understand it was bestial and i shall pay for it in shame for the rest of my life and you will also tell me who else was there monk said every man whose face you recognized i cant arrest them for it but i can question them for information im going to hang the creature behind this and im going to use every perverted bastard i can find to do it youre going to talk to them rupert whispered horrified if i have to and you are going to tell me step by step what happened every filthy act every scream every injury and humiliation every terrified and weeping child that was tortured for your amusement ill have nightmares too maybe for the rest of my life but im going to paint such a picture that your friends will never doubt that i know what happened as well as if id been there too he drew in his breath he was shaking and his body was covered with sweat and the jury will know exactly what those men were paying to hide perhaps theyll wake up terrified as well and theyll be as passionate as i am in helping to get rid of at least some of the obscene trade youll help me willingly or unwillingly mr cardew i imagine for your fathers sake if nothing else you would prefer to do it here and now in private while it is still a voluntary thing and perhaps partially redeem yourself believe me if you dont and i have to force you in front of a jury it will be a lot worse rupert stared at him defeat in his eyes and a depth of misery that for an instant almost weakened monks resolve then monk thought of scuff the trust that was just beginning between them and the moment of indecision vanished now he prompted detail by detail make me feel as if i am there rupert began haltingly still standing motionless in the quiet morning room with its sunfaded carpet and old books his voice was low and strained frequently he stopped and monk had to prompt him to go on he hated doing it he felt as if he were beating an animal and he knew he would feel unclean afterward tarnished with cruelty but he did not stop until rupert had told him every detail of the entire hideous business his face was mottled and stained with tears perhaps he would never forget this either and not ever be the same as he had been before and the man it broke monk persisted the one who took his own life shot himself alone in the small boat tadley rupert whispered he couldnt pay did parfitt drive him that far on purpose an example to others of what happens if you dont honor your debts it wasnt a debt rupert snapped back at him it was extortion i told you i didnt know about it until afterward not that i could have paid it for him if i had so what was it a misjudgment of parfitts is suicide good for business or bad rupert shot him a look of utter loathing it stung monk more than he would have expected perhaps because he knew the loathing was fair it is a salutary reminder to pay on time instead of letting the payments mount up rupert replied coldly and it is bad for business but then murder is worse tell me about tadley monk instructed he was a family man but unhappy lonely i think i dont know that he particularly cared for boys i had the feeling he wanted to experience some kind of excitement some danger a sense of being completely alive i know that sounds no monk cut across him it sounds like many people whose lives are suffocated by tedium duty trying so hard to live up to what other people have expected of them that they become imprisoned inside it without dreams you die rupert stared at him im sorry he said quietly i misjudged you i thought i know monk smiled bleakly you thought i had no devils inside no idea of what they are even youre wrong rupert nodded almost close to a smile monk bit his lip now tell me the names of the other men who went to the boat rupert stared at him but the anger had gone from his face please monk added rupert gave him a list and monk wrote it in his notebook thank you monk said when it was finished ill get him this time perhaps it was a dangerous thing to say almost a promise but he risked saying it and committing himself it felt good monk decided to retrace ballingers footsteps on the night of parfitts death he should duplicate all the conditions as closely as possible the first part of his journey did not really matter it was the return that counted nevertheless he went to the street outside ballingers house at the time in the evening when ballinger said he had left of course one thing he could not duplicate was the daylight in september it would have been dusk later and the weather would have been milder but he did not think that would substantially alter the time if anything ballinger would have found it easier and therefore faster monk caught a hansom without more than a few minutes wait and settled himself for the long journey to chiswick it was tedious and his mind wandered over all he had learned so far juggling the pieces to try to make a picture that would hold against the assaults of doubt and reason it was still all too tenuous too full of other possible explanations he reached chiswick cold and irritable his legs cramped from sitting still he paid the cabby and walked down across the street onto the dockside it was fully dark now with a gusty wind blowing off the water this far upriver it did not smell of salt but rather of weed and mud the clouds raced past and for a few moments the moon showed about half full gleaming briefly on the water there was a ferry twenty yards away a couple of young men were sitting in it and the sound of their laughter happy and more than a little drunk drifted across the distance between them monk waited until they docked then walked down and asked the ferryman to take him across at the far side he thanked the man paid and walked up to the road to look for a hansom that took rather longer but even so he was in mortlake by the time ballinger had said hed arrived at harknesss house now he had more than two hours to wait until harkness had said ballinger had left he spent it walking along the waterfront with a lantern looking at the boats pulled up in slipways at the moorings judging how long it would take to get any of them waterborne and how wet he might get doing it he looked ahead and saw the sign for the bulls head swinging gently in the wind creaking a little he decided to go in and have a sandwich and a pint of ale monk asked the landlord casually about hiring boats just to row a bit up and down the water not really fishing just being by himself and forgetting the city and its life and its noise the man seemed to find that odd but he told monk of half a dozen different people who might be happy to oblige him monk thanked him and left he found one light fast boat he could hire for a couple of shillings and promised to return it before morning if they thought he was eccentric no one said so he walked back up toward harknesss house and reached it a few moments before the earliest he could leave and still be following ballingers path he stared around there was no one in sight but he had not expected anyone a witness would have been a stroke of luck too far some moments later he walked briskly back downriver toward the bulls head the wind was sharper from the west and carrying the smell of rain with it he imagined the marshes and the fields beyond damp earth turned by the plow past that woods with heavy leaves falling berries turning red the pungency of wood smoke crows in high nests for the winter he found the boat he had hired and after only a few moments fumbling he got it down the slip and into the water he reached for the oars fit them into the oarlocks and pulled away from the shore out into the stream after a few more strokes he settled to row down the river to corney reach tonight the tide was against him it had turned while he was in the bulls head and was now coming in he must check what it had been on the night of parfitts death it would make a difference but perhaps little enoughunless high or low water had occurred during the time ballinger had actually killed parfitt which was unlikely but it was a detail to be sure of so absolutely nothing caught him by surprise anyway since he had to row back up to mortlake the tide would be with him one way and against him the other it was a pleasant sensation to feel the power of the boat sliding through the water it was silent here apart from the bow waves whisper and the rattle of the oarlocks as the oars turned now and then a small night bird called from the trees along the shore once far in the distance a dog barked he saw the dark hull of parfitts boat before he expected to he had lost all sense of time he pulled over to it and rested on his oars he imagined himself going up on deck how long would it take to climb the ropes up the sides an estimate but rathbone would ask him it would destroy the validity of the whole experiment if he had to admit that he had not actually done it damn he bent to the oar again and pulled the boat closer what if there were no ropes there anymore then he would have to do the whole thing over again when the ropes had been replaced he was right up to the boat now he could see almost nothing there was one riding light simply to avoid the boat being struck in the dark orrie must have been keeping it burning it shed no more than a glimmer onto the deck and nothing at all on the steep sides monk put out his hand and met wooden boards overlapping carefully he pulled himself along the boat moving jerkily under him it was three yards before he found the ropes and tied the boats painter to one of them awkwardly skinning his knuckles he climbed up and hauled himself onto the deck he stood there for several moments trying to judge how long it would take to strike someone then loop the cravat around their neck and tighten it until they choked to death then finally put them over the side into a boat or straight into the water he mimicked hurling overboard the branch that had been used to strike parfitt as well and remembered that it might have been even more difficult climbing up with that slung over his back he would have to allow for that but since parfitt had been expecting ballinger perhaps he had let down a rope ladder there was one inside the boat there would have to be for the guests to climb aboard in their expensive clothes and boots no one would be amused by falling into the water and most certainly no one would want to be soaked chilled and smelling of river mud all night he must also check that ballinger had no injury or muscular disability that would make it impossible for him to climb rathbone could and would nicely catch him out if that were so he smiled grimly imagining describing all this to the jury and then having rathbone produce some doctor who would swear that ballinger couldnt lift his arms above his shoulders he heard an owl hoot on the farther bank and a small animal slipped into the water with only the faintest sound he saw the ripple of its movement more than he heard it it was time to go back over the side and row back to mortlake then find a hansom back to the far side of the chiswick crossing when he finally stood on the dockside waiting for the ferry back it was less than five minutes later than ballinger had done so as the ferryman had confirmed for him on the night of parfitts murder monk had a ridiculous sense of exhilaration for the small victory that it was he had proved that it was possible thats all but he had not proved that it was so the next day he went to see winchester the lawyer certain to prosecute the case against ballinger were it to be brought to court ah so youre monk he was a tall man maybe an inch or so taller than monk himself broadshouldered with a mane of straight black hair liberally threaded with gray he had a somewhat hawkish face with a long nose and intensely dark eyes the most remarkable aspect of him was the humor in his features the readiness for wit which seemed to be always just beneath the surface winchester he introduced himself sit down he gestured toward a wellworn comfortablelooking leather chair he himself half sat on the edge of the desk tell me your evidence he invited monk detailed it meticulously and only what he could prove good winchester said pursing his lips i can see that youre remembering the last time you faced oliver rathbone and got mauled he said it without apology a rueful amusement in his eyes we need to do better this time i intend to monk assured him he told him detail by detail how he had copied ballingers trip up to mortlake exactly as he had sworn to leaving time to kill parfitt and then back again winchester did not laugh but his eyes betrayed that inside he was highly amused ballinger was an excellent oarsman in his youth monk went on but of course you will need to find testimony that he is still perfectly capable of rowing the distances now and of climbing up the rope ladder at the side of parfitts boat thank you winchester said wryly i had thought of that monk did not apologize and i have a great deal of evidence as to exactly what trade parfitt carried on monk added he recounted that as well hating the words even more the pictures they conjured in his mind now all the light was gone from winchesters face and he looked almost bruised his anger was palpable ill call whoever i believe may help the case he said grimly i cannot promise to spare anyone i hope you havent made any guarantees because i will not keep them i havent not to your wife or margaret rathbone not to anyone cardew are you prepared to crucify cardew if its unavoidable wordlessly monk passed him a copy of the list of names rupert had given him including tadley with a note of his suicide winchester read it his mouth pulled tight and crooked with revulsion thank you that cannot have been easy i dont intend to spare anyone either monk told him for the love of heaven take good care of hattie benson winchester said grimly she is the one thing preventing them from blaming it all on cardew the only question i have to ask you is are you certain in your own mind that it was ballinger could it not have been a business rivalrypure greed on the part of tosh wilkin for example hes a particularly nasty piece of work all rathbone has to do is raise a reasonable doubt monk realized that winchester was watching him extremely closely memory rose up in him hot and powerful of having lost the trial against jericho phillips and how ashamed he had been how naked he had felt as the entire courtroom had stared at him and his failure his mistakes no im not certain he said i believe it was ballinger because sullivan said so before he died it had to be someone of ballingers social standing to see the weakness of men like sullivan pander to it and feed it until it was out of control and then blackmail them for it tosh wilkin hasnt the imagination or the connections to do that and if he were the one taking the blackmail money i dont believe he would have the selfcontrol not to spend it and that he hasnt done but could he have killed parfitt on ballingers instructions winchester insisted he could have i dont believe ballinger a master at blackmail would give such power over himself into the hands of a man like tosh who would certainly use it winchesters long fingers touched the list that monk had given him what about someone on this list they would have much to gain if parfitt were dead the end of paying blackmail has been motive for more than one murder the jury wouldnt have much difficulty believing that reasonable doubtmore than reasonable you dont bite the hand that feeds your addiction monk replied then you have to find a new supplier and where would you do that and why winchester nodded slowly youd better be right monk and dont imagine ballinger wont fight you in every way he can think of he wont go down easily rathbone will fight for him and you dont need me to tell you hes a very clever man and far more ruthless than his charming manner would lead you to believe i know yes of course you do but dont allow yourself to forget it simply because you believe ballinger is guilty and therefore you are fighting a just cause monk looked steadily at winchesters curious longnosed face with its subtle wit and wondered if ballinger had already started to fight and whether winchester knew it it will be personal winchester warned your reputationperhaps your wifes monk felt his muscles clench i know are you prepared for it he may call her to the stand with reference to rupert cardew yes she will be prepared this time winchester offered his hand then well get him mr monk deo volente monk rose to his feet yesgod willing he echoed and took winchesters outstretched hand winchesters mention of hattie benson sent monk straight to the clinic at portpool lane just to assure himself that she was still safe and well and that her courage had not failed her he was met in the outer hallway by a grimlooking squeaky robinson she isnt here squeaky said flatly monks stomach lurched and he found it hard to catch his breath what happened where is she no need to look like i hit you squeaky said reproachfully shes gone to help buy some more surgical stuff dunno where cos she had to look for it heard of some doctor what was selling old stuff im not looking for hester monk said almost choking in relief i want the young woman i brought here a week or so back where is she squeaky looked monk up and down from his shiny leather boots to his elegant coat wet on the shoulders and then he sighed down in the laundry washing sheets like she should be i aint bringing her up here cos im told not to so youd better go down there and find her thus dismissing monk he sat down to study his figures again monk thanked him a trifle sarcastically and went along the narrow passage and down a couple of flights of steps through the kitchen and into the laundry beyond a lean dark young woman with freckles was poking a wooden pole into the huge copper moving the sheets around the pot was belching steam and the air was thick with it wheres hattie monk asked dunno the young woman replied without turning away from the task monk took a pace toward her and spoke more sharply that wont do if you want to stay here and be looked after youll tell me where she is she stopped poking and let the long pole slip onto the floor she turned and looked at him indignantly her hair damp streaked onto her face her skin pink i dunno where she is an yer can call me everything you want an i still dunno she were sposed ter be ere cos it were er turn ter elp an she int so you go an bleedin find er monk turned on his heel and strode out of the room taking the steps up again two at a time back in the scullery he found a young woman with a red face peeling potatoes he could smell the sharp astringency of onions and there were strings of them hanging from the ceiling beams have you seen hattie benson he demanded she turned to look at him startled by his voice no i int seen er sincei dunnoyesterday yer tried the laundry thats where she is most times yes i have where else he controlled his rising fear with difficulty his heart was pounding his breath ragged already he was being absurd she was probably making beds or rolling bandages or any of a dozen other tasks the woman shrugged i dunno without bothering to press her since she was clearly useless he left the scullery and tried the medicine storage room the linen closets and then all the bedrooms one by one he went from the far end of the three old houses joined together by a warren of passages and interlocking rooms which had once been squeaky robinsons brothel and was now the clinic nowhere did he find hattie benson or anyone who had seen her in the last three hours now three and a half nearly four the fear inside him was close to panic hester was not here nor was margaret and he was not sure if he would have asked margaret even if she were he did the next best thing after that and looked for claudine he found her in the medicine room she was becoming quite proficient in nursing hester had said she was intelligent and more important deeply interested her long unhappy marriage had eroded her selfbelief to an almost crippling level curiously it was her adventure where she had finally seen arthur ballinger outside the shops selling pornographic photographs and from which squeaky robinson had eventually rescued her that had liberated her from that now she stood carefully measuring what was left in the various jars and bottles and writing it down in a notebook she was standing straight and there was a slight smile on her face she turned as she heard monks footsteps stop it needed only a glance at his face for her to realize his distress whats happened she asked immediately putting down the bottle she was holding and closing the notebook what is it hattie bensons gone monk replied ive been from one end of the building to the other and asked everybody no one has seen her since about nine this morning claudine did not reply for several moments but it was not because she was dumbfounded she was clearly calculating what to do next we must think she said she knew not to go anywhere outside she would not have run errands for anyone even a few yards she was quite clever enough to be frightened there are no doors to the outside here where a stranger could come in unseen have you spoken to squeaky yes he didnt see her leave and hes been at the front all morning at least since she was last seen he replied ive got i know she agreed calmly her voice reassuring he looked at her pleasant face it was far from beautiful but full of strength andat this momenta quiet courage then she went out at the back he said more steadily that means she did it deliberately she tricked someone into leaving her alone why what on earth would make her do that did someone here threaten her who have you had in since she came an old woman upstairs with a fever claudine replied shes delirious and probably dying and a young woman with a stab wound and a broken collarbone all others were just in and out he stared at her one of us she said with a catch in her voice she seemed about to add something else then changed her mind he knew from her face that she was thinking of margaret and trying to deny it to herself he was thinking the same there had to be some more complex explanation but just at the moment it did not matter ive got to see if i can find her monk said although he had no idea where to begin should he even tell hester there was nothing she could do except run into danger herself where will you look claudine asked him i dont know if she was alone or escaped from whoever she went with shell probably go back to the places she knows all i can do is ask can i help no thank you just dont tell hester yet i wont have to claudine said grimly shell know monk left without adding anything more once outside in portpool lane he walked as rapidly as he could not even aware of the rain he would like to have run but it was pointless and he needed his strength he could not stop until he found hattie he asked questions of street peddlers a seller of matches another with bootlaces one with hot chocolate and ham sandwiches the sandwich man had seen a young woman with pale skin and very fair hair in company with a woman a little older brownhaired going down leather lane toward high holborn at almost half past nine they had been on foot and hurrying it was confusing was that hattie or not with a woman who it was the best lead he had standing in the traffic people passing him by the rattle of wheels and clip of hooves on the road the spray of dirty water from the gutters soaking his legs he was overwhelmed with the uselessness of it it might have been hattie or equally easily it might not and she could have been going anywhere in london there was no point in waiting here he might as well see if anyone else had seen them he could think as he walked he might realize something that had eluded him so far but he did not and in the late afternoon as it was growing dusk he knew nothing more than half a dozen sightings which might have been hattie or any other fairhaired young woman he decided to take a hansom and go out to chiswick at least there she was known and any sighting would be real it was just possible she had become homesick and gone back to the one place where she had friends and which was familiar to her she might feel safer there even if in fact she was not the ride seemed interminable every dark street looked like every other lamps were lit glaring eyes in the increasing gloom everything was full of shadows the moving carriage lamps were yellow and there was the hiss of wheels on the wet cobbles even though the rain had stopped finally monk reached the chiswick mall on the edge of the river opposite the eyot he leaped out of the hansom paid the driver and strode over toward the lights moving down by the stretch of mud and stones left by the low tide he could hear voices if it was the police he would ask for their help as he reached the steps his stomach was churning his breath tight in his chest throat aching one of the men held his lantern higher and monk could see that there were four of them grim wet feet and ankles caked with river mud there was a womans body on the stones and the yellow light shone on her face and on the pale blond hair that was almost silver monk knew it was hattie even before he was close enough to see her features chapter rathbone was at his parentsinlaws for dinner again when the butler announced that a mr monk had called to see mr ballinger and was waiting for him in the morning room what an inconvenient time to call mrs ballinger said stiffly her eyes wide she looked at the butler tell him to wait in fact better than that tell him to come back tomorrow morning at a reasonable hour she turned to rathbone im sorry oliver i know he is a friend of yours more or less but this is too much the man has no breeding at all the butler had not moved what is it withers ballinger said tartly tell monk if he wants to wait ill see him when ive had dinner and when the evening is over and my visitors have gone home the butler acutely embarrassed moved from one foot to the other his face a dull pink rathbone stood up ill go and see what he wants he offered going toward the door as he spoke for heavens sake oliver let the man wait george snapped youre not his lackey to go jumping up and down after him simply because he arrives at the door rathbone felt margarets eyes on him as he left but he did not turn back he realized as he closed the drawing room door behind him and walked across the wide hall with its sweeping staircase that he was afraid he knew monk too well to imagine that he had called at this hour without a very compelling reason rathbone had seen the pride and the pain in monk when rathbone had beaten him in court over jericho phillips he knew monk would not let that happen again he opened the morning room door and came facetoface with him why are you here rathbone asked closing the door behind him and remaining standing in front of it im sorry monk apologized i thought this better than at his place of business this affords him a less public exhibition at least for the time being what the devil are you talking about rathbone demanded although he felt a hollow fear that he knew and you are here also monk continued your clerk said that you would be perhaps it is as well monk rathbone kept his voice level with difficulty monk straightened up and put his shoulders back altering his weight from the easier stance he had held before i have new evidence that is compelling i have come to arrest arthur ballinger for the murder of michael parfitt he replied dont be ridiculous rathbone said sharply it was like a bad dream spiraling out of control ballinger was at bertram harknesss house you know that and if you dont i certainly do i know monk said calmly it is not far from where parfitt was found and the movement of the tide can account for the difference dont make this any harder than it has to be ill make it as hard as i can rathbone heard his own voice rising losing control you cant come in here to the mans own house and accuse him just because of what sullivan said he was desperate and on the brink of suicide you know that as well as i do oliver monk began rathbone thought of margaret in the quiet family withdrawing room across the hall just beyond the closed doors he must protect her from this with an effort he lowered his voice think of it monk even if you were right and ballinger had some involvement with phillips and even with parfitt why on earth would he kill parfitt from what sullivan said supposing he were sane and right about the factswhich we dont knowballinger would have had every reason to keep him alive he would be a source of considerable income for him monk made no move to go round him his face was grim eyes hard and steady but there was an emotion in them that rathbone found chilling rathbone tried again he might have been acting for a client he protested after all he is a solicitor perhaps he was trying to get parfitt to stop blackmailing someone had you considered that there was a flicker of uncertainty in monks face there and then gone again yes it occurred to me he answered but if that is the case then the charge would be accomplice to murder or at best accessory before and after the fact he lured parfitt to the boat and he was in the immediate vicinity so far we cant place anyone else there dont make a scene it will only be harder for the family im quite willing to have him come with me of his own volition without anyone else knowing the seriousness of it rathbone was still prepared to argue but the door opened behind him and george came into the room what on earth is going on cant you deal with this oliver he asked angrily rathbone felt his own temper rise he wanted to snap back at someone and held himself in check with difficulty it would be better if you asked papainlaw to come out here george stared at monk look i dont know what you think you want inspector or whatever you are but this is not the time to arrive at a gentlemans home delaying dinner and making a vulgar scene for gods sake george just go and fetch him rathbone snarled his voice thick with anger if it were as simple as that dont you think id have dealt with it georges temper flared in instant response how the devil do i know what youd do hes a friend of yours the drawing room door opened wider sending a stream of brighter light into the hallway margaret crossed to the entrance of the morning room the silk of her gown gleaming her face tight with anxiety what is it oliver nothing george told her sharply please ask your father to come out oliver contradicted him she hesitated it was monk who moved forward now please lady rathbone ask your father to come out it will be less distressing for your mother and sisters if we can discuss this matter privately she looked at rathbone and then as he nodded she turned and went back into the drawing room george followed her a moment later ballinger came out but he left the door ajar behind him the room was silent as if everyone within it was listening well what the hell do you want he asked monk you had better have a very good explanation for bursting in here like this rathbone walked quickly to the drawing room door and closed it then returned i have monk said quietly i have a warrant for your arrest on the charge of murdering michael parfitt what ballinger was aghast the wretched little pimp who was drowned in chiswick thats absurd youve really exceeded yourself monk youve let your hunger for revenge addle your brain ill have your job for this i advise you to say nothing rathbone cut in desperately trying to prevent it from getting even worse ballingers face was red ugly with anger he swiveled to face rathbone then seemed to recall his composure and very deliberately forced himself to relax lower his shoulders and breathe out that was not a threat he said to monk you are an incompetent fool jumped up beyond your ability but i mean you no harm i will do everything according to the law of course you will monk agreed with a flash of humor so brief it was barely visible you are far too wise to add assault of a police officer to the situation are you intending to take me into custody at this hour of the night ballingers tone was tinged with disbelief i imagined you would prefer it in the dark monk responded but i can come back to your office in daylight if you would rather and if you should not be there i can send police to look for you god almighty man ballinger swore your reputation will never recover from this monk did not answer he looked for a moment at rathbone then turned and went out to the front door waiting there for ballinger to follow when the door closed behind them rathbone went at once to margaret she was whitefaced her eyes hollow the muscles in her neck and shoulders suddenly looked as hard as cords as if she might snap you must get this stopped oliver her voice shook tonight before anyone knows ill tell mama and the others that monk needed help with something i wont have to think what because ill just say that he didnt tell us you must margaret he put his hands on her shoulders lightly and felt how rigid they were monk would not have come here if he didnt believe that she pulled away from him eyes blazing are you saying hes right no of course im not his answer was instant and not wholly honest he took a deep gulp of air im saying that he must think he has some evidence or he wouldnt dare come here and make such a claim then prove him wrong hes made some idiotic mistake because he wants rupert cardew to be innocent thats unfair monk has never he knew before he finished the sentence that it had been a mistake to defend him her eyebrows rose been wrong of course hes been wrong i was going to say deliberately unfair i will find out from him exactly what he thinks he has and then i will figure out the best and most complete way to disprove it tonight she insisted papa cant possibly spend the night in prison itsits appalling you know it is margaret theres nothing i can do tonight thats why he did it is it he arrested papa at this time of night so you couldnt do anything about it if hed done it in the daytime you could have gotten him out oliver you have to show them what a personal vengeance this is papa said monk was an erratic and spiteful man but i couldnt believe him out of loyalty to you but papa was right monk cant ever forgive him for taking on jericho phillips and getting you to defend him you made him and hester look bad in court made fools of them and hes having his revenge nowon both of you margaret his voice was sharp peremptory stop it yes monk lost in court the first time with phillips and im not proud of my part in that but i did what the law requires what justice demands monk knew that and understood it margarets eyes were brilliant with tears but they were tears of shock and anger and fear of a horror she could not grapple oliver listen to me he said grimly monk wants to get that filthy trade off the riverand it is filthy its far worse than anything youve heard of in portpool lane some of those children are not more than five or six years old he ignored the wince of pain that twisted her mouth perhaps he is a little overzealous but we need someone with a passion to destroy it someone who cares enough to risk getting dirty or hurting themselves this time hes made a mistake but hes only going where he thinks the evidence is taking him she blinked hard and the tears spilled onto her cheeks youll act for papa you must youll only if he wants me to that has to be his choice he may prefer someone else of course he wont she was indignant but beneath the anger he saw the rising desperate fear you have to help oliver or are you saying that your friendship with monk makes you he said the only thing he could he is your father margaret of course i will act for him as long as it is what he wishes but be prepared for him to prefer someone else perhaps because i am too close he did not add that ballinger himself might distrust him because of his friendship with monk a little of the fear slipped away from her of course she said quietly im sorry i it is so unjust its like a nightmare one of those dreams when everything you love changes in front of you you go to pick something up and it turns into something else something horrible a cup of tea turns into a dish of maggotsor a person youve known all your life changes into an animal a horrid one now the tears slid down her cheeks and she could not control them hesitantly he reached his arms out and touched her then drew her closer to him and held her he was not sure if she would resist but her panic was only momentary after a second of realization she leaned against him and let him hold her tighter more completely i must go and tell the rest of the family he murmured they will be distressed and we must assure them that we will do everything necessary to get this all dealt with as quickly and as discreetly as possible yes she pulled away from him reluctantly of course he took a deep breath and walked away from her and into the withdrawing room he closed the door behind him and faced them the women were sitting upright tense staring at him the men were all standing what the devils going on oliver george demanded where is papainlaw rathbone faced mrs ballinger im sorry mamainlaw but he has had to go with the police for the time being tomorrow morning i shall tomorrow george interrupted angrily you mean youre just going to go home to bed and leave him in a police cell what the mrs ballinger looked from one to the other of them her face flushed and unhappy celia took a step toward george then changed her mind and moved to her mother instead be quiet rathbone snapped at george his voice hardedged and loud he turned again to mrs ballinger there is nothing anyone can do tonight there are no judges or magistrates available at this hour but he is an innocent man and of some substance they will treat him reasonably they know therell be hell to pay if they do anything else george snorted trust your friend to choose this time for precisely that reason the mans despicable wilbert gwen accused why do you just stand there like a piece of furniture do something theres nothing to do he retorted olivers right theres no one to appeal to at this time of night as i said george glared at him thats monk for you he turned to rathbone as if it were his fault rathbone felt his face burn would you rather hed come during the day and arrested papainlaw in his offices in front of his staff and possibly his clients the tide of color rushed up georges face what will you do tomorrow oliver celia asked there has to be some mistake what is he accused of and wheres margaret she must be desperately upset she was always the closest to papa thats not true gwen said instantly oh hold your tongue celia snapped we have to stop quarreling among ourselves and think what to do what is it about oliver rathbone tried to smile as if he were confident but he knew it was sickly on his lips it is in connection with the murder of an extremely unpleasant man named mickey parfitt he was strangled and thrown into the river up beyond chiswick chiswick mrs ballinger said in disbelief why does mr monk imagine arthur would have anything to do with it thats absurd he was on the river that night rathbone replied he crossed at chiswick if you recall he went to see bertie harkness he told us about it over dinner this is farcical george interrupted again surely harkness can tell the police where he was monk deserves to be punished for this its totally incompetent the man has a personal oh do be quiet wilbert said impatiently youre talking about the police he isnt some nincompoop running around doing whatever he likes anyway why should he have anything personal against papainlaw he doesnt even know him georges heavy eyebrows shot up are you suggesting there is something in this that papainlaw had something to do with this wretched mans murder dont be stupid of course im not it probably has to do with a client he could be acting for someone who does oh really mrs ballinger protested mamainlaw rathbone seized the chance wilbert had given him if he could act for jericho phillips he could act for anyone ill go to the river police first thing in the morning and find out from monk himself exactly what evidence they have and what they have made of it and of course ill see papainlaw and find out if he wishes me to act for him then well sort it all out with an apology george added mrs ballinger looked at both of them blinking her face composed with an obvious effort thank you oliver i think it would be best if we all retired now how is margaret as brave as you all are rathbone replied hoping it would remain true he had been aware even as he spoke that he had promised more than he was certain he could fulfill rathbone was at the police station on the rivers edge the next morning as monk came up the steps from the ferry it was not yet eight oclock the october light was bleak and pale on the water washing the color out of it the wind smelled salty with the incoming tide gulls were circling low screaming as they scented fish diving now and then in the wake of a twomasted schooner moving upstream to the north and south there were forests of masts all crisscrossing moving slightly on the uneasiness of the water long strings of barges and lighters were threading their way through the ships at anchor carrying loads inland or to limehouse the isle of dogs greenwich or even the estuary and the coast monk reached the top of the steps and smiled very slightly when he saw rathbone neither of them said anything perhaps the understanding was already there rathbone could see in monks face in his eyes the knowledge of the complexity the mixed emotions he felt the embarrassment the struggle of loyalties they walked almost in step across the dockside to the police station steps then into the building monk said good morning to the men who had obviously been on duty overnight he checked that there was nothing urgent that required his attention then led the way to his office and closed the door are you representing him monk asked not yet because i havent seen him but i expect i will monk hesitated a moment before he asked are you sure thats wise if he wants me i have no choice rathbone replied and was startled to hear the bitterness in his voice he felt trapped and was ashamed that he did if hed totally believed in ballingers innocence if hed trusted him as he wished to then he would have been eager burning with the urgency to begin monk looked away not meeting his eyes anymore and rathbone had the brief thought that it was because he did not wish to intrude he did not want rathbone to see how much he understood what do you have rathbone said aloud circumstantial evidencea letter which has yet to be proved genuine yet to be dated and yet to be proved relevant what else we already know that ballinger was on the river near chiswick he said as much himself at the time you say this prostitute wouldnt tell you who she gave the cravat to so you cant connect it to ballinger isnt it far more reasonable to suppose she gave it to someone she knew and why would ballinger kill a wretched creature like parfitt you cant produce a single person who can show that the two men ever even met each other he stopped abruptly he was talking to monk as if he rathbone were new at this and had no confidence in himself he knew better this is why a good lawyer did not instantly represent family emotions got in the way right from the start arthur ballinger was not his father how different it would have been if it had been henry rathbone he would have known passionately and completely that he was innocent but then monk would have known it too im not supposing personal enmity monk replied his voice level and quiet i have ballinger at the time extremely near the place and a note which only he could have written inviting parfitt to be in his boat to meet with him for a business venture profitable to parfitt such as what rathbone retorted you have no proof of anything not even a suggestion we know what parfitts business was oliver you saw phillipss boat you know perfectly well what they do if you want me to i can describe parfitts boat as well and the children we found there rathbone felt his control slipping away from him you have no evidence that ballinger was involved he pointed out absolutely nothing or youd have prosecuted him for it already i know how desperately you want to catch whoevers behind the trade dont you yes of course i do but not enough to risk prosecuting the wrong person just because sullivan accused ballinger that doesnt make him guilty perhaps ballinger was trying to rescue sullivan from his own foolishness and he failed sullivan might have blamed everybody but himself weve both seen that before i dont know why ballinger would kill parfitt monk said still keeping his voice level and under tight control i dont have to know all the prosecution has to show is that he had the opportunity he could have had the means and that he was the one who told parfitt to be in the boat at that time for a meeting if parfitt hadnt known him and believed there was a business connection he wouldnt have gone rathbone had no argument except that there must be something more some evidence undiscovered so far that would change the entire picture im sorry monk added ill go on investigating it but largely to find the links between them and to destroy the trade i wish the trail hadnt led to ballinger but it did if you can get him to confess it might at least spare his family some of the shame rathbone felt bruised stunned as if he had taken a heavy blow and it had left him dizzy there has to be another answer i hope so monk smiled bleakly it would be very nice to think it could be someone neither of us cares a damn about but wishing doesnt make it so rathbone could think of nothing more to say he thanked monk and excused himself he was in the outside office on his way to the dockside again when he almost bumped into a tall thin man with white side whiskers and intense blue eyes he was dressed in an expensive and very wellcut suit rathbone knew him by sight and on this occasion would have avoided him if he could have morning commander birkenshaw he said briefly and continued walking but birkenshaw was not to be avoided he came across the few yards between them and followed rathbone outside into the brisk fresh air on the dock thought youd be here early he said matching his stride to rathbones wretched business i was hoping we could get it all untangled before it comes to anything youve known monk for many years havent you yes eight or nine i think rathbone replied reluctantly birkenshaw was monks superior and he was clearly very unhappy his face was pinched with anxiety and he kept his voice low even though there was no one within earshot in the bright sharp morning the noise of the wind and water would have made overhearing unlikely anyway would you say you know him well there was no evading an answer yes weve worked together on many cases clever birkenshaw conceded but reliable i know durban thought highly of him he recommended him for the post when he knew he himself was dying but he hadnt known monk all that long just the one case ive heard from others since then that monks a bit erratic farnham my predecessor was uncertain as to his integrity if it came to a difficult decision and monk was personally convinced of someones guilt then its as well that you are now in command and not farnham rathbone said tartly and immediately regretted it he saw the surprise in birkenshaws face and then the irritation it was not the answer he had been seeking i dont think you fully appreciate the difficulty of the situation sir oliver birkenshaw said patiently murder is a desperately serious charge and monk has brought it against a man of means position and spotless reputation i know he is my fatherinlaw im sorry of course it must be appalling for you and unspeakable for your wife all the more will you wish to see that we are not acting precipitately if monk has made a mistake however sincerely then we will have damaged an innocent mans reputation and put his family through needless pain it is good of you to be so concerned rathbone began dammit man birkenshaw exploded i am concerned for the honor and ability of the river police to carry out their job if we prosecute a man of high profile unjustly and the case is shown to have been flawed from the beginning and brought by a man consumed with a personal vengeance or even a preoccupation with one crime then our reputation is damaged and our work crippled it is my responsibility to see that that does not happen in spite of wishing not to rathbone could see that birkenshaw was right but if birkenshaw overruled monk then monk would no longer be able to command his mens loyalty or respect and he would have to resign that also was unfair and rathbone could not be party to it of course it is he said as calmly as he could and if you have some proof that monk has acted for personal motives without just cause then you must override him and withdraw the charges with apology if you do that you will also have to dismiss him from office i birkenshaw shook his head trying to deny the idea as he would shoo away some troublesome insect thats far too extreme no it isnt rathbone contradicted him you will have made public your lack of confidence in him and his men will no longer have sufficient confidence in him either very possibly ballinger will want some compensation i could not represent him in that but he would have no difficulty in finding someone else willing to particularly someone who had another client at some time prosecuted by monk if you weigh it carefully commander birkenshaw i think you will find that the river police will suffer even more you will have to go to trial and arthur ballinger will either be cleared or be hanged rathbone birkenshaw started i have said all i can rathbone replied and with a brief nod he turned on his heel and walked as rapidly as he could toward the high street with luck he could catch a hansom cab from there westward back into the city but even though he was extraordinarily fortunate and found one within five minutes he felt awful sitting in it bowling along at a brisk pace wheels rattling over the road toward familiar streets he had been loyal to monk and to his own conscience but had he in a way betrayed margaret he would not tell her of this conversation and that in itself answered his doubts it was not confidential he knew before he even considered it that she would feel he had not acted in her fathers best interest and perhaps that was true of course rathbone could make an argument that ballinger was definitely innocent and should have his chance to prove it so no one could ever imagine that there had been pressure to withdraw the charge that might appear a trifle like the scottish verdict of not proven particularly if no one else was ever successfully brought to trial for parfitts death if it were his own father what would rathbones decision be it might well be to go ahead and prove his innocence but then he might also be afraid that some lie some misread evidence some quirk of the law would allow an injustice to happen there were only three short weeks between conviction and hanging that was no time at all in which to reverse a verdict or even raise sufficient doubt to stay an execution now he must prepare to face ballinger himselfsomething he was dreading he realized how little he really knew the man he did not even know whether ballinger would be frightened angry humble accusatory or even so shocked as to be almost numb and unable to think of how to defend himself rathbone leaned sideways and peered out of the cab to the streets looking to see where he was he recognized st margarets arch they were just coming into eastcheap they would probably go up king william street then bear left along poultry and cheapside to newgate perhaps there would be a traffic jam and he would be granted a little more time in which to compose himself and think what he would say ten minutes later the cab lurched to a stop he sighed with relief but that lasted only moments all too soon he was on the pavement again in the sun crossing the road and then on the steps of newgate prison his thoughts still whirling and uncertain he was granted access to ballinger almost immediately although he had been more than willing to wait they met in a small cell with a stone floor and plain wooden furniture sufficient only to seat both of them rather uncomfortably with a battered wooden table on which to place books or papers should they wish it was not the same room in which he had seen rupert cardew but the differences were negligible ballinger looked rumpled and angry but not as embarrassingly out of control as some people did when faced with sudden and appalling misfortune he was shaved and his hair was tidy there was no sign in his face of hysteria and his eyes looked no more puffy than was natural from a night with little or no sleep good morning oliver he said without preamble before you waste time on it they are treating me perfectly well and i have all i require in the way of such comforts as i am permitted margaret sent my valet with everything you cannot yet begin to appreciate what a fine woman she is if you are blessed with such daughters you will be a most fortunate man now will you act for me in this this farce i want to get it explained and discussed as soon as possible before half the world knows about it he smiled grimly with only an echo of humor perhaps i will have more understanding of my clients fears in the future and more sympathy of course i will act for you if you are sure it is what you wish rathbone replied but have you considered the wisdom of having a member of the family in such a position there are ballinger waved his hand sharply dismissing the objections you are the finest lawyer in london oliver perhaps in england and i have no doubt whatever that you will fight for me harder than anyone else would in spite of your past friendship with william monk you are my soninlaw part of my family i am well aware that we should not have favorite children but margaret is still mine she always has been there is a loyalty and a gentleness in her that is beyond even that of my other daughters you will do everything that is humanly possible ballinger shook his head not that it should be necessary the whole charge is a tissue of coincidences piled upon one another because monk has little idea of a solicitors responsibilities to his clients he is also emotionally involved on a personal level through his wife and the little mudlark she has become attached to because the poor woman apparently cannot have children of her own rathbone felt a stab of guilt so acute it was hard to believe it was not an old physical injury torn open again at the trial of jericho phillips he had ridiculed hester when she had given testimony against phillips painting her as a childless woman who had half adopted a street urchin to fill her own loneliness and implying that her judgment had become warped because of it the jury had believed him and had discounted her testimony he had not spoken of it since with hester and he did not know if she had entirely forgiven him for such a betrayal he had not forgiven himself we need to answer evidence rathbone controlled his emotion with difficulty he owed his loyalty to ballinger who was his client and if the case actually came to trial would be fighting for his life he was margarets father which made him a part of rathbones life that could never be turned away from or forgotten of course ballinger agreed what evidence is it that monk thinks he has i cannot imagine a note written by you inviting parfitt to meet you on his boat handed over to him in front of witnesses an hour or two before his death when parfitt read it he immediately sent for orrie jones to row him out the color drained out of ballingers face leaving him ashen for a moment he seemed unable to speak it might have been shock disbelief but rathbone had a terrible fear that it was guilt thats impossible he said at last who says so monk yes and he must have such a letter or he would not dare claim to even if you think him immoral enough to try then its a forgery ballinger said immediately for gods sake oliver why on earth would i have business with a creature like parfitt to buy him off for a client rathbone answered he was sinking into a morass of nightmare and yet strangely his mind was going on quite reasonably as if he were something apart almost a bystander watching this desperate highly civilized discussion of murder and betrayal ballinger hesitated weighing his answer rathbone watched him feeling the sweat trickle down his body in fear that ballinger was going to admit that it was his own blackmail hed been dealing with after his years of criminal prosecution and defense nothing ought to have surprised rathbone but he could not believe that arthur ballinger could have become involved with parfitts vicious pornography why not did he believe ballinger was so moral so happy in his present life or so careful what did rathbone think of him not as his soninlaw the husband of his admittedly favorite daughter but as his lawyer bound by duty to see the truth because only by knowing it could he best defend him rathbone realized again how very little he knew the man except in his role of successful husband and father alone what was he like what were his dreams his fears his pleasures who was he without the mask rathbone had no idea ballinger was staring at him still trying to decide how to answer were you acting for a client rathbone repeated ballinger appeared to have reached a decision no i spent the evening with bertie harkness then i returned as i had come crossing the river again at chiswick i may have passed parfitts wretched boat but i neither saw nor heard anything untoward which the ferryman will tell you my time is accounted for and if i had paid parfitt on some clients behalf i would have had more sense than to do it secretly and alone with such a man he breathed in deeply for gods sake oliver think about it would you go creeping around boats alone at night in order to conduct a perfectly legal piece of business for a client however desperate or foolish that client had been and would you go alone no rathbone said without hesitation it all sounded very reasonable but it was not a defense we will have to have far more than a mere denial ballinger managed a tight bleak smile they have to prove that i was there that i was in possession of rupert cardews cravat and that i had a compelling reason to kill parfitt they can do none of those things because none of them is true i was on the river crossing it from the south side on my way home i was in a ferry and the ferryman will vouch for it from there i took a hansom straight home no one can prove differently because thats the truth and you are sure you didnt have any dealings with parfitt rathbone pressed for heavens sake what dealings would i have ballinger protested from what you say the mans unspeakable you were prepared to act for jericho phillips rathbone pointed out and for sullivan who was using the filthy trade and paying phillips blackmail money the prosecution would not find it difficult to suggest you did the same for parfitt or on the other hand for one of his victims ballinger swallowed there was still no color in his face and he looked cornered and embarrassed i acted for sullivan because the man was desperate rathbone could no longer put it off without very deliberately lying both to ballinger and to himself he had pretended that he did not need an answer and it lay like poison inside him sullivan told me that you were the one who introduced him to the pornography and that you were behind phillips financially ballinger stared at him seconds ticked by ballinger gulped he told you that he said incredulously yes and you said nothing until now i chose to believe it was the hysterical accusation of a man whose mind was turned by despair and who was about to take his own life and so it was ballinger took an enormous breath and the sweat beaded on his face although the cell was cold my god that makes sense of monks insane behavior you spoke to him didnt you that was a statement not a question close to the edge of blame rathbone found himself off balance he almost started to make excuses for himself are you telling me that you were not involved with sullivans behavior he said measuring his words very deliberately arthur ballinger hesitated he glanced down at his hands strong and heavy on the table then met rathbones eyes sullivan blackmailed me into representing him he said quietly not for anything i did but for cardew helping him was his price for keeping cardew out of it rathbone was so amazed that for a moment he could think of nothing to say ballinger stared at him waiting cardew rathbone said at length you were prepared to get involved with that sordid mess to save cardew ballingers face softened his shoulders eased a little bit and he almost smiled ive admired him immensely for a long time he was involved with phillips and you admired him rathbones voice carried his disgust and his disbelief rupert cardew was involved with phillips for gods sake i admired his father ballinger said witheringly and i was desperately sorry for him you havent children yet oliver you have no idea how you can love your child regardless of how they behave or what wretched things they do you still care you still forgive and you can never abandon them or stop hoping they will somehow change and be at least something of what you want for them rathbone was totally confused was it possible ballinger leaned forward across the table i did all i could to save sullivan for his own sake i should not have been surprised that he took his own life but i regret to say i did not see it beforehand or i might have stopped him or perhaps not he was a man with nothing left and death was the only answer remaining thank god that at least he took with him the evidence that would have ruined rupert cardew as well took with him rathbone echoed i meant into oblivion ballinger elaborated i dont suppose he had it literally in his pockets it was his one halfdecent act poor devil but he blamed you so you say halfdecent but not entirely he reached out his hand toward rathbone but i will not say this in court oliver i must clear my name without destroying cardew possibly no one can save rupert but leave his father out of it how is his father involved rathbone found the words difficult to say he knew of lord cardew only by repute for his crusade against industrial pollution the man had apparently found some means to change lord justice garslakes mind heaven knew how oliver himself had had only one highly emotional meeting with him over the danger against rupert but he could not imagine lord cardew having anything to do with parfitt or phillips unless he were tricked into it monk would have no interest in that you dont need to know ballinger said softly leave the man a little dignity oliver and if you can leave his name out of the court proceedings you can defend me from this without mentioning phillips or sullivan or any of the others who were dragged down by him i did not kill parfitt nor do i know who did or specifically why the man was human filth and must have had scores of enemies if you cant find the one who killed him at least oblige the jury to know what type of person that would be dont ruin cardew in the process please rathbone felt as if certainty had crumbled in his hands he was holding a dozen shards none of which fitted together to make a comprehensible whole perhaps you can do it without destroying anyone else ballinger went on but if you cant save monk from himself then you must follow the law and your own sense of right and wrong you did not do this to him he did it to himself ill do everything i can rathbone said gravely as it stands at the moment i will be able to challenge the prosecutor on just about every point but of course i shall not stop working until the case is thrown out ballinger smiled thank you i knew you would chapter it was the evening before arthur ballingers trial began rathbone sat in his armchair before a fire not really necessary yet but vaguely comforting margaret sat opposite him playing at a piece of needlework and unpicking as much of it as she sewed who will they call first she asked looking at him intently her face strained tiny lines around her eyes were visible in the light shining sideways from the gas bracket at her left he had never noticed them in the daylight he felt an intense pity for her and longed to be able to give her some comfort but promises that could not be kept were worse than none at all after they were broken she would never be able to trust him again and he could not rob her of that oliver she prompted who will they call first probably monk he replied why he didnt find that wretched mans body why not the policeman who did maybe theyll call him but its rather tedious and adds nothing to the case its a dangerous thing to bore a jury for heavens sake its not an entertainment she said savagely the jury is there to do the most important job of their lives not to be amused rathbone tried not to let any emotion sharpen his voice they are ordinary people margaret they are frightened of making a mistake awed that the responsibility is theirs for a decision they have had no training to reach a mans life hangs in the balance and they know it they will find it difficult to concentrate almost impossible to remember everything and if either winchester or i allow their minds to wander from what we are saying they will forget half of it winchester is no fool believe me he will not repeat anything that is irrelevant what do you mean irrelevant she demanded how can the truth be irrelevant it is somebodys life are they stupid her voice was growing higher less within the tight effort of control that she had kept up with difficulty since her fathers arrest he leaned forward a little the description of the river where they found parfitt is not important enough for the jury to hear it from both the local policeman and monk he explained it has nothing to do with who parfitt was or who killed him they dont need it twice they will cease to listen and that matters what will monk say she persisted hell shade everything because he hates papa hes never forgiven him for choosing you to defend jericho phillips men like monk cant bear to be beaten what are you going to do to show the jury that its personal that he wanted papa to be guilty for his own reasons rathbone saw the anger in her face and the fear it was as if some part of her were facing an ordeal from which she might never recover he ached to be able to reach out to her and simply hold her to feel that intensity of closeness where pain can be shared but she was too tightly knotted within herself to allow it as if he were also the enemy margaret monk wants to end the abominable trade in child pornography not persecute any one person if he wanted revenge over phillips for heavens sake dont you think he got it at execution dock she stared at him you dont believe me do you youre siding with monk he swallowed back the exasperation that filled him i am trying to defend your father personal attacks on the police are not going to accomplish that unless monk makes a mistake if he does i will take him apart for it friend or not will you she said doubtfully that was unfair and at any other time he would have told her so you know i will he said gently didnt i do that to both monk and hester to defend jericho phillips and i despised the man how much more so would i do it to defend your father you know hes innocent dont you now she was really afraid shivering where she sat on the sofa only a couple of feet away from him what could he possibly say he did not know that ballinger was innocent of the murder of parfitt he probably was because why on earth would he do such a senseless and unnecessary thing but of any involvement with those who used the boats and the wretched children on them no he was not certain of ballingers innocence at all oliver she was trembling now so intensely he would have thought the room ice cold if he had not felt the heat of the fire scorching his legs i know he didnt kill parfitt he answered her of course i do im afraid he might have gone further than he would like to have in defense of some of parfitts victims im not absolutely certain that he doesnt know who did kill him and he might be protecting them why why on earth would he defend a man who who murderedoh her voice dropped you mean they might be his professional client yes of course he would go to trial and endure all the pain and the blame to protect a victim of parfitts blackmail all because he had given his word she stopped shivering and the fabric that was stretched tight across her shoulders eased a little it was not what rathbone had meant at all he had been thinking of something far less noble but now he had not the heart or perhaps the courage to deny it he looked at her soft eyes and her sudden reassurance and the words died before he spoke them its possible i need to be prepared for surprises wouldnt he trust you she pressed after all you are his lawyer and what he tells you is in confidence of course it is he agreed with an attempt at a smile even from you my dear oh she searched his eyes trying to read in them what he might be unable to tell her what about this winchester she said at length what is he like very clever he replied rather personable he is deceptively charming and at times amusing but underneath it he has a very sharp mind indeed youre frightening me she snapped you sound as if youre saying he could win of course he could win he answered her and if i forget it for even a moment then i open the door for him to do just that he took a deep breath and tried to calm his voice and make it gentle margaret they have a case if they didnt we wouldnt be going to court tomorrow if i could have had it dismissed dont you think i would have yes yes i know but its ridiculous my father how can anyone who knows him ever imagine that he would be paddling about in the river murdering some pornographer rathbone reached across and touched her hand and she grasped hold of him she clung so tightly she pinched his flesh but he did not pull away and forced himself not to wince precisely because they do not know him he replied it is my job to show the jury that he is exactly what he looks to be and claims to bea respectable husband and father a good solicitor who in the course of his professional duties has had clients both good and bad just as i have myself he has done his best to help all of them without making personal judgments as to their worthinesswhich is what the law requires and justice demands she tried to blink back the tears that filled her eyes but they spilled down her cheeks youre right oliver and i love you for it im sorry im just so frightened that somehow it will go wrong i have no belief in justice if it were real he wouldnt even be facing trial at all and im sorry but i think monk is ruthless and i dont even trust hester anymore i think shell do anything for him even lie if she has to to stop him from looking badagain he cant afford to make another terrible mistake or hell lose his job you truly think she would lie for him he asked for goodness sake oliver she loves him she responded with exasperation shes loyal shes his wife is that loyalty he said very softly she looked puzzled what do you mean of course it is i dont believe it is loyal to help someone do something that is wrong something that could end in another persons death you would be helping them to commit a sin they would regret and pay for for the rest of their lives would you want that i wouldnt she looked confused if you loved them he pressed i i dont know i would want to defend them wouldnt you now she was frowning perhaps if i loved them enough i wouldnt even think that they could be wrong not as wrong as that and would you sacrifice your own judgment i dont know but that isnt going to happen she shook her head fractionally im not married to william monk im married to you i cant grieve over hesters problems thats up to her rathbone had a sharp flash of memory so vivid that it seemed hester was in front of him now her face as intense as margarets but angry vulnerable passionately concerned for the problems of someone else needing to find an answer for them unable to rest or sleep until she had she had frightened him and excited him and he had loved her for that he lowered his eyes away from margarets gaze he did not want to see into her emotions in case it left an emptiness in him and he did not want her to see into his he let go of her hands and stood up im going back into my study i need to read it all one last time try to sleep ill see you in the morning it was a lie he did not need to or intend to read it all again he simply wanted to be alone where he also could rest for all his attempts to comfort margaret he was a good deal more anxious than he wished her to know the courtroom was packed and people were turned away even before the preliminaries of the trial commenced by the time the first witness was called the atmosphere was like that before an electric storm rathbone was not surprised he had expected it because the prospect of a respectable lawyer charged with murdering a seedy riverside pimp in particularly squalid circumstances had driven the more lurid journalists to speculate up to the legal limit and beyond in what it was permissible to print even thought he had expected the crowd he dreaded the pain he would see in margarets face he had considered asking her not to come but had known that she would see it as an invitation to cowardiceworse than that to betrayal winchester called monk first as rathbone had expected monk climbed the spiral steps up to the witness stand high above the body of the court and stood there elegantly as always he looked assured only rathbone who knew him so well could see the tension in his body the uncharacteristic complete stillness as he waited for winchester to begin winchesters first questions were simple a matter of identifying monk so the jury knew exactly who he was and his seniority then establishing time and place and who had called monk to the scene for what reason you were standing on the riverbank in the early morning mist winchester said actually in the water monk corrected him shallow over the knees and muddy monk gave a slight wince at the memory of it and no doubt cold winchester added yes and the reason the local police had sent for you the body of a man fully clothed floating in the water they turned him over to identify him which was actually fairly easy in spite of a degree of water damage because he had a withered arm withered winchester questioned his right arm was shorter than the left and the muscle was badly wasted it looked as if it was almost unusable whose was this body a local man called mickey parfitt did he appear to have drowned winchester sounded no more than curious his voice mild do they call you for every drowning no monk replied there was a nasty injury to the back of his head slightly to the right of the crown and we discovered there was a tight ligature buried in the swollen flesh of his throat ligature as in something long and thin tied around his throat and pulled so tight as to strangle him yes did you notice what it was that had done this not at that time we only really looked at it later later when the police surgeon cut it off and brought it to me winchester raised his hand in a slight gesture as if to prevent monk from saying anything more we will come to that later at that time mr monk standing in the water in the early morning light did you believe that mr parfitt had come to his death from natural causes i believed it extremely unlikely an accident i could not think of any that would meet such evidence so it was murder i thought so yes what did you do then mr monk monk described hauling the body out of the water heavy and dripping with mud then carrying it up to the cart and finally back to chiswick leaving it in the morgue for the police surgeon to perform a postmortem then what mr monk winchester looked relaxed comfortable rathbone knew him by reputation but he had not faced him across a courtroom before and he could not read his mood he seemed deceptively bland almost casual as if he imagined this case would require only half his attention i started to make inquiries as to the nature and business of mr parfitt and why anyone might have wished to kill him monk replied routine winchester said quickly yes then unless sir oliver wishes to go into detail he swiveled a little to glance at rathbone his face sharp with inquiry but it was rhetorical he looked back at monk i would be quite happy not to bore the gentlemen of the jury with every step of the way what did you discover for example what was mr parfitts occupation as far as you could ascertain and please be careful to keep precisely to the facts monk smiled bleakly he knew that for all winchesters casual air he was as tightly coiled as rathbone concentrating just as intensely on every word every nuance the police told me that mr parfitt owned a boat which he kept at various different locations at that time it was moored farther up corney reach something like halfway between chiswick and mortlake i went to the boat taking sergeant orme with me the local man no my own sergeant from the station at wapping why was that mr monk would not the local man have been of more assistance given his knowledge of the area the tides and possibly of mr parfitt himself he was still speaking with mr parfitts associates and we found his local knowledge to be more advantageous in that undertaking i see we will hear from him later my lord i shall call mr jones mr wilkin and mr crumble in due course i think it would be simpler for the court to hear all mr monks evidence in one piece even if it does disturb the narrative a little if it so please your lordship the judge nodded and made a small impatient gesture with his hand winchester inclined his head slightly to convey his thanks did you board this boat mr monk he asked rathbone realized that he was sitting with his muscles clenched and deliberately forced himself to relax them one by one he could not look up at the dock to his left where fifteen feet above him arthur ballinger was sitting immobile staring down at them if he did he would draw the jurys attention and he might regret that later even one fleeting expression that looked like arrogance or indifference could be interpreted as guilt however little it actually meant better that they watch monk yes monk answered we boarded it with very little difficulty it was just a matter of coming alongside tying our boat and climbing up the ropes the main hatch was locked so we broke it open and went down the steps you mean the ladder winchester interrupted would you describe it for us please rathbone hated this but he must keep it from showing in his face the jury would watch him too from the way in which winchester had asked the question and the horror in monks face it was clear that the answer to the question mattered monk was standing stiffly his hands now on the railing in front of him holding on to it as if for balance his face was pale eyes hard lips drawn back a little from his manner he was in some pain that he could barely control the boat was about fifty feet long as near as i could judge he began quietly i did not measure it there appeared to be three decks including the open deck on top this later proved to be the case there was one mast and a wheelhouse we went down the first hatch which was wide and gave easy access the way down was not a ladder it was strong and comfortable steps which led into a large room fitted out rather like the bar of a gentlemans club we found alcohol in the cupboards and several dozens of glasses rathbone saw the jury staring at monk puzzled as to why this very ordinarysounding account was of any importance at all let alone should stir the emotions of horror that were so clearly in monks face and his voice even in the attitude of his body rathbone felt his stomach twist he knew exactly what monk was doing please continue winchester prompted his voice grave he was an unconsciously elegant man with his height good shoulders and unusually handsome hair the other half of that deck was a second room roughly the same size monk went on but it was arranged rather like a theatre with a stage at the far endjust a bare platform and lights a curtain winchester asked room for musical players monk winced no curtain no music winchester nodded the judge grew more impatient mr winchester is this leading somewhere yes my lord i am afraid it is mr monk we went down to the deck below that monks voice dropped and he spoke more rapidly as if he wanted to get it over with there were several small cabins no more than cubicles each big enough to hold a bed in the room at the back we found a locked door which we forced open inside the space were four small boys aged from four to seven years old there was a gasp from the body of the courtroom a woman in a brown dress and bonnet gave a cry and instantly put her hand over her mouth to stifle it one of the jurors let out his breath in a low sigh they were whitefaced crouched togethermonks voice crackedand terrified we had to convince them that we did not intend to hurt them they were cold starved and halfnaked winchester glanced at the judge and frowned at monk as though he would ask monk if he was exaggerating then after several seconds of meeting monks eyes he rubbed his hand over his own face and shook his head i see what did you do then mr monk made every arrangement i could to get the children evacuated fed clothed and safe for the night monk replied there were fourteen in all we got in touch with a foundling hospital that would take them until they could be identified and if they had homes returned to them where did they come from winchester asked making no attempt to hide his own distress if you had dropped a pin in the room the sound of it would have been heard up and down the river monk said orphans unwanted children ones whose own parents couldnt feed them winchester shivered when did they get to this boat what were they doing there they were found and picked up at different times they were used to participate in various sexual acts with older boys or men for the entertainment of mr parfitts clients these acts were rathbone rose to his feet the judge looked at him yes sir oliver i was wondering when you would object to this mr winchester how does mr monk know all this surely it was not apparent to the naked eye when he broke into the lower deck of this boat and you have not yet shown any proof that it was indeed mr parfitts boat it could have been anyones my lord i was going to ask what any of this appalling story has to do with mr ballinger rathbone responded mr winchester the judge raised his eyebrows winchester smiled i admit my lord i was attempting to show for members of the jury what a particularly repulsive character the victim was before sir oliver would do it for me as i fear he will so that we may all appreciate that he is likely to have had a great number of enemies and very few friends indeed there was a sigh of relief in the public gallery and a few faint titters of laughter even the jurors seemed to relax a little in their highbacked seats in the double jury row on the opposite side of the floor rathbone could do nothing but concede the point the judge looked at monk i hope you are not going to describe these acts commander monk if you intend to i shall have to clear the court at least of all ladies present i did not see them performed my lord monk said stiffly if i had been present they would not have been i was going to say that they were photographed and the resulting pictures used to blackmail the wealthier men taking part the judge frowned i was not aware that it was possible to photograph people who are moving mr monk does it not take between five and ten seconds exposure even with the very latest equipment yes my lord monk replied these pictures were posed for deliberately it was part of the initiation ceremony into the club an added element of risk that for these men heightened their pleasure and their sense of comradeship did you know this at the time no my lord but because of previous experiences on another very similar boat farther down the river i suspected much of it he looked at the judge coldly his face hard and hurt i see the judge turned from monk to winchester i shall expect you to prove every step of this mr winchester beyond reasonable doubt yes my lord i shall leave the jury with no doubt at all i wish that none of this were so he turned to the jury i apologize gentlemen this will be distressing to all of you but for the sake of justice i cannot spare your feelings i he spread his hands helplessly rathbone knew exactly what winchester was doing and there was no way rathbone could prevent it he had expected winchester to be clever but had hoped he would be sure enough of his case to be careless now and then and take one or two things for granted where rathbone could trip him so far he was treading almost softly and it made the details all the more terrible there was nothing for rathbone to attack nothing hysterical nothing unnecessary to question it would seem desperate the first sign that he himself was not sure of his case he could not turn to look for her in the gallery but he knew that margaret would be watching him waiting in an agony of tension for him to do something anything but sit there helplessly rathbone was allowing winchester to go on and on as if he rathbone were tonguetied how could rathbone explain to her and her mother that to make useless attacks weakened himself not winchester he should put her out of his mind all else must be forgotten except the defense the battle was everything monk was talking again in a low shaking voice describing the photographs he had seen winchester held a packet in his hand my lord if you believe it necessary they can be shown to the gentlemen of the jury just so they are without doubt that what mr monk says is indeed quite a mild description of the terrible truth the judge leaned forward and held out his hand winchester walked across the floor and gave him the packet his lordship opened it and looked rathbone had not actually seen the pictures but looking at the judges face was perhaps more powerful a flame to the imagination a pain sharper than the actuality could have been because it was a living thing in his mind a monstrosity that changed and that he could never control damn winchester he looked across at the jury and saw their expressions one man was white his eyes blinking fiercely not knowing where to look another kept rubbing his face with his hands as if embarrassed one man coughed then blew his nose hard others were looking around the room staring at the judge fidgeting breathing rapidly sir oliver the judge said sharply as if he had said it before and rathbone had not heard him rathbone rose to his feet yes my lord are you content that the jury does not need to look at this material rathbone knew he must answer immediately he must be right had the suggestion the emotional charge in the room made the pictures seem worse than they really were perhaps the reality would be an anticlimax if i may see them my lord and i presume mr winchester will demonstrate to us how he knows beyond doubt that they we taken on the boat belonging to the victim naturally the judges face tightened but he beckoned the usher over and gave him the packet to pass to rathbone rathbone took it and looked at the first two pictures they were pathetic and obscene beyond anything he had expected but what had not even occurred to him was the worst of all he recognized the man in the second one with a shock that brought the sweat out on his body burning and then cold should the jury see it would it work in their favor raise a reasonable doubt as to ballingers guilt because surely a man who would do this to a child for pleasure would stoop to anything at all even murder but the man in the photo was a public figure how would the jurors respond to having their illusions so terribly crushed torn apart soiled forever rathbone could not know sir oliver the judges voice cut across his racing thoughts i feel he had to stop and clear his throat i feel my lord that because of the men also depicted here and the ruin it would bring upon them and their families that that is a separate issue and not one i wish to pursueat least not here i would ask only that your lordship would inform the jury that hideous as they are none of them in any way whatsoever involve mr ballinger the judge nodded slowly and turned to the jury that indeed is so gentlemen and no doubt sir oliver will reaffirm that when he questions mr monk please proceed mr winchester i think you have more than adequately established for the jury that mr parfitt was occupied in a trade vile beyond the imagination of a sane man although that fact seems to some to serve the defense rather more than the prosecution winchester smiled ruefully as though he had been caught out perhaps i have not served my own interests as well as i hoped he gave a very slight shrug i am obliged to go where the facts lead me he looked up at monk where did you find these photographs mr monk indeed how do you know they have anything to do with mr parfitt is he shown in any of them no it is possible he was behind the camera monk replied we found that on the boat but not immediately it was very carefully concealed in what looked like a piece of nautical equipment would these men be likely to know that they were being photographed winchester asked not unless they were told monk answered where did you find the photographs that you have shown us with the equipment i see and do they depict the inside of the boat you saw yes to your knowledge mr monk was mickey parfitt alone in this ghastly trade no monk replied his mouth tight he had at least three men we have been able to question who worked quite openly for him but of course there may be many others that we have not found really what brings you to that conclusion mr monk winchester continued to look innocent rathbone felt himself stiffen in his seat this was what winchester had been leading up to and monk even more so rathbone had to make an intense effort to look unconcerned any anxiety confusion or surprise they saw could be read as guilt the silence of strain in the room was palpable the photographs monk replied to winchester but you said you thought parfitt took them himself winchester sounded surprised probably monk conceded but not merely for his own pleasure he sold them winchester asked with a gesture of distaste i suppose there must be a market for such he searched for a word acceptable in court that would describe what he felt and did not find it monk smiled sourly undoubtedly he agreed but the market that would pay most highly again and again is the men who are shown in the pictures there was rage in his voice almost choking him but looking up at him across the space of the open floor rathbone saw a pity in him also and it took him by surprise oh winchester bit his lips of course how dullwitted of me blackmail and have you some reason to suppose that parfitt did not commit the blackmail himself parfitt came from a poor family of manual laborers and petty thieves on the riverside monk answered he was uneducated and lived by his wits according to those who knew him he had neither good looks nor charm and was not particularly eloquent his skills were his cunning and his encyclopedic knowledge of human weakness and depravity how could he find the victims for such blackmail it is hardly his social circle and one cannot advertise the goods he had for sale winchester looked as if he had been suddenly enlightened his eyes widened then he smiled at his own attempt at playacting he looked at the jury as if to apologize to them several of them smiled back at him of course he said mildly there has to be a man of more sophistication higher social connections and possibly money to have provided him with this boat and obviously excellent photographic equipment in the first place yes rathbone considered objecting but a look at the jurors faces and he knew he would earn only their contempt he would seem to be making ridiculous objections by which to try to distract them which would only lend more credence to what winchester was saying and if he was honest rathbone himself believed there was someone behind parfitt pretty much as monk and winchester assumed but you do not know who he is winchester pursued i believe that i do monk contradicted him but the proof is what i came here to present the jurors looked stunned there was a buzz of excitement in the public gallery rustles of movement and indrawn breath winchester himself played it for all it was worth are you suggesting mr monk that it was this this investor who murdered mickey parfitt why for heavens sake was the boat not making him a fortune rathbone stood up at last my lord this is the wildest speculation it is indeed the judge answered tartly mr winchester you know better than this i apologize my lord winchester said humbly im sorry it was only at that moment that rathbone realized that winchester had had nothing more to add anyway rathbones intervention had saved him from the jurys realizing it have you anything else pertinent to say mr winchester the judge asked with evident impatience for example something tangible such as either of the weapons used in the attack of mr parfitt or a timetable of his movements or for that matter a witness to anything at all you have so far only a handful of obscene and repulsive photographs and a web of speculation none of which you have connected to the accused winchester looked suitably chastened and once again addressed monk sir his lordship has excellent points and has graciously reminded me that i have yet to mention the weapons used to take the life of this repulsive man did you seek them and did you find them i did not find the weapon with which his head was struck monk replied it is difficult to know what that would have been but any strong length of branch from a tree would have served or a broken plank of wood or an oar there were many such lying on the bank or floating in the water winchester looked faintly disconcerted but he did not interrupt however we did find the weapon with which he was strangled monk continued it was a dark blue cravat with an unusual pattern on it of leopards very small and in threes one above the other in gold it was made of silk and there were six very tight knots in it at slightly irregular distances matching the bruises perfectly winchester allowed the jury a few moments to absorb this information really and where did you find the cravat mr monk the police surgeon cut it from around parfitts neck monk answered there was a sigh of breath and a buzz of movement around the court and did you trace its owner winchester asked yes sir it belonged to a mr rupert cardew monk could not continue because of the uproar when the judge had regained control winchester thanked him and invited monk to proceed mr cardew said that the item had been stolen from him the previous afternoon and we later found evidence that that was indeed so did this evidence implicate arthur ballinger no sir so what did mr monk so far as im sure sir oliver would be quick to point out there is nothing in the course of your investigation to suggest his name to you much less to imply his guilt in the matter at all a short handwritten note inviting parfitt to meet the accused at the boat on the evening of his death monk replied again there were gasps and cries in the body of the court and it was several moments before the judge managed to restore order and where did you find this extraordinary document winchester inquired written above another note given to me presumably without appreciating its importance by mr jones one of mr parfitts employees monk told him parfitt wrote down the time he wanted jones to ferry him to his boat indeed and was this note signed by the accused no it was written on the back of a piece of paper on the front of which was a list of medicines to be purchased for the use of patients in the portpool lane clinic winchesters black eyebrows shot up good heavens are you certain yes we took it to the clinic and asked those who work there to identify it just a moment what made you consider the possibility that it had anything to do with them mr monk i asked my wife who is a nurse there if she recognized the items on the list she did she also knew who had written the list and when because of the writing and what was listed the silence in the courtroom was so thick someone wheezing in the back row was momentarily audible thoughts raced through rathbones mind as to what he could ask monk how he could tear this apart and looking at monks face he knew that he was already prepared even waiting was it possible that this time he really was sure she wrote this list winchester asked skeptically and you did not immediately recognize her hand mr monk that strains credulity no she didnt write it monk replied with the vestige of a smile it was written by mrs claudine burroughs a woman of good society who gives her time to helping the sick and the poor i did not recognize her hand because i am not familiar with it but my wife did i see and how did you deduce from this recognition that the subsequent note on the same piece of paper was written by mr ballinger because mrs burroughs said she gave the list to lady rathbone to purchase the there was another explosion of sound in the courtroom the judge banged his gavel and commanded silence on pain of peoples forcible removal from the room rathbone felt the heat sear up his face until he could hardly breathe he did not dare look at margaret or her family although he knew exactly to the inch how far he would have to turn his head to do so to purchase the medicines from the apothecary monk continued which lady rathbone did for she gave the receipts to mrs burroughs but did not return the original list it seems reasonable even inevitable to assume that she discarded it where mr ballinger her father found it and tore off a piece to use for this note to parfitt not knowing that what was on the back was so distinctive i see winchester said gravely and did you subsequently ask mr ballinger to account for his whereabouts that evening yes sir monk replied he never pretended that he was not in the area but he did say that he was in mortlake some short distance up the river from corney reach where the body was found he was in the company of a friend which the friend verified however it is possible if you are a strong rower to take a boat from mortlake to corney reach and come back again then catch a hansom at the south side of the river to the ferry where mr ballinger originally crossed all in the time that he stated and his friend confirmed really winchester affected surprise are you sure yes sir i did it myself at the same time of the evening remarkable thank you commander monk winchester turned to rathbone with a smile rathbone rose to his feet with a very slight tremble in his hands he had just realized an astounding possibility neither monk nor winchester had mentioned hattie benson either by name or occupation was that to spare lord cardews feelings or had she withdrawn her testimony refusing now to take the stand without her rupert was still a prime suspect could he discredit this wretched note somehow suggest it had a different date a different meaning even that it had originally been addressed to someone else he needed time it is late my lord he said with exaggerated courtesy i have several questions to ask mr monk of fundamental importance to the whole casethings that may lead us in an extremely different direction i would prefer out of respect to yourself and the jury to begin this when there is the opportunity to carry the matter to its conclusion the judge pulled out a magnificent gold pocket watch and regarded it soberly i hope your substance will equal your words sir oliver very well we shall adjourn until tomorrow morning rathbone spent a miserable hour with ballinger ive no idea who wrote the damn note ballinger said furiously the burroughs woman is lying or is forgetful margaret would have given it back to her with the medicines from the apothecary and she left it lying around anyone could have found it and used it what about robinson the old whoremonger who runs the place for them thats the obvious answer use your brains oliver go for them go for him hell never make a credible witness tear him apart rathbone said nothing he disliked the idea but it was reasonable and perhaps the only course he had i did not kill that filthy little man ballingers voice was raised brittle with anger and fear for gods sake do your job margaret was already at home when rathbone arrived how is he she said as soon as rathbone was through the door even before he had given his coat to the butler full of courage he said gently kissing her cheek there was no point in telling her anything else she pulled away from him so she could see his face as if from studying it she could better tell if he was merely trying to comfort her he looked at her steadily lying superbly finally she smiled her face catching some of its old calm and the loveliness that had first drawn him to her hes brave she said simply and of course he is innocent he knows you can get this ridiculous charge thrown out after this oliver you cannot remain such close friends with monk she looked at him gravely he has not the honor or the integrity you thought i know that disillusion is terribly painful but pretending it does not exist helps nothing it doesnt change the truth im so sorry she smiled slightly a warm little gesture actually im sorry for myself too because i admired hester so much and i shall lose her friendship over this as well i doubt it will be practicable for me to remain at the clinic he was taken aback margaret all hes done is answer winchesters questions and he has no choice in the matter the warmth vanished from her eyes how can you say that he was the one who went after papa in the first place we wouldnt even be answering the charge at all if he had simply followed the evidence to rupert cardew suddenly he was cold his whole fabric of certainty was tearing apart he had drawn in his breath to say that hattie could prove cardew innocent but he realized it was only her word that did and margaret would argue that monk had coerced her rathbone knew that monk was a man of passions and convictions brave enough and perhaps ruthless enough to follow whatever he believed to be right what if monk were tragically wrong what if it had been cardew all along and monk had simply refused to believe it it is so easy to believe what we need to he had been wrong before everyone has margaret was talking again consider it oliver think honestly you know that monk is convinced papa had something to do with jericho phillips because as jerichos solicitor papa convinced you to represent phillips monk doesnt understand that that is what lawyers do i think he has never really forgiven you for defending phillips in court he doesnt like to be beaten she took a step closer to him poor people with little education can be very proud very stiff unable to accept criticism let alone defeat especially from a friend he admires you and he cant bear to be wrong in your eyes its an ugly trait of character a weakness but it is not so rare was she right monk was prickly but a bit less so since his marriage to hester however victory still mattered intensely to him rathbone could see in his minds eye monks rage when rathbone had beaten him in court over phillips was this his revenge even if monk had not been aware of it himself was this the old monk reasserting himself the man who had been so feared before his accident and the loss of memory had made him so vulnerable he looked at margaret the gentleness was back in her face i plan to take him through all the evidence tomorrow ill show the jury just how preposterous it is he promised we will not be able to protect rupert he took a deep breath i wish he were not lord cardews son poor man she touched his arm with her fingers and he felt the warmth of it briefly you cant do anything about that my dear the exposure of the law is cruel there is nothing we can do but bear it with dignity and loyalty to one another she smiled and turned dinner will be ready soon you must be hungry i worry about you sometimes when you are in a big trial like this do you look after yourself rathbone followed her comforted until another thought came to him it struck him so hard it was as if he had fallen and bruised himself almost to numbness knowing the pain would follow what if monk were so desperate to stop the pornographic trade on the river that he was prepared to hang ballinger for the death of parfitt not because he believed ballinger was guilty of it but because he knew he was the man behind the trade and behind phillips one reason was as good as the other in fact perhaps he saw the death of parfitt as the lesser sin maybe the actual killer of parfitt was some petty thief or extortioner like tosh wilkin or even one of parfitts victims even rupert cardew himself but monk chose to overlook that rather than ruin the real killer for ridding the world of a man they were all grateful to see deadand monk used the circumstances to frame ballinger because he was the architect of the greater crime was monk capable of such twisted thought even as the question formed in his mind rathbone was tempted to think the same way if ballinger were behind ituntraceable uncatchable simply going to walk away and begin againwould not rathbone also have been tempted to let him pay the price for the secondary crime who had killed parfitt orrie tosh wilkin any one of his wretched victims first led into fornication then abuse then blackmail it was a soft path to hell one shallow step at a time invitednot driven not chased but led rupert cardew margaret turned aware that rathbone was not immediately behind her he moved more quickly and caught up with her it was warm in the drawing room comfortable to the body and familiar to the mind it was not cold yet outside but the fire gave an added pleasure it should have allowed him to relax think of something other than the anxieties and the dangers of tomorrow but it did not he wanted to go to bed and pretend to be asleep he needed to be alone away from her fears and her loyalties but if he did he would have to explain it to her and that would make it worse the effort of finding small conversation now was unbearable but he knew that she needed him needed to draw on his strength to calm the mounting fear inside her and he must do that that it was difficult was irrelevant in the morning the courtroom was packed once again there were people lining up outside angry to be turned away when rathbone stood up to begin his crossexamination of monk the tension in the air was palpable winchester was silent appearing at a glance to be at ease but the constant slight movement of his head the flexing of his fingers betrayed him everyone was waiting all eyes on rathbone he walked out into the middle of the floor and looked up at the witness stand mr monk let us discuss this curious note that mr jones found in his pocket and gave to you as i recall you said he had been given it so as not to forget the time mr parfitt was to go to keep his appointment on his boat that is what mr jones told me monk agreed and you traced it back with the help of your wife to the clinic on portpool lane where she works helping sick women in the area yes did you trace it any further than that by which i mean did you ask lady rathbone where she had left it after shed purchased the items and given them to mrs burroughs she didnt give the list back monk replied there was no need all the items that were bought had the apothecarys receipts so the note could have ended up anywhere rathbone pointed out in the possession of mrs burroughs on a table somewhere in the rubbish basket on the apothecarys counter or even in the possession of mr robinson the man who keeps the financial accounts for the clinic monks face became suddenly bleak his body stiffer where he stood in the witness box as rathbone met his eyes he saw that monk knew exactly what he was going to say next rathbone smiled very slightly mr monk what was mr robinsons occupation before he kept the finances of the clinic monks face was almost expressionless he ran the same premises as a brothel which you know perfectly well it was you who perceived his skill at bookkeeping and the use he could be if he remained indeed rathbone conceded his smile a little wider he had many acquaintances in the district and an excellent knowledge of where to buy things at a good price and since the patients are largely prostitutes he would be familiar with their associates their lives and habits he would be hard to deceive however unfortunate as it may be is it possible that mr robinson could have reverted to his original profession and be involved with the trade in prostitution on the river monk hesitated rathbone had caught him exactly as hed meant to to say it was not possible would be ridiculous and would leave rathbone the way open to make monk seem absurdly naive of course its possible monk said harshly it is possible almost anyone could invest in such a trade by its very nature it is well hidden naturally rathbone agreed no one is likely to admit to such a vile thing would it be true to say that you have been looking with some diligence for this mysterious investor for some time yes might you have failed to find him precisely because he has been under your nose the whole time there was a ripple of laughter around the courtroom tense a trifle highpitched as nerves were stretched in both horror and excitement monk smiled wolfishly with no pleasure the deepest sin is too often right under the noses of good people he replied it remains hidden precisely because good people cannot imagine that those they trust could do such things perhaps i am so blinded on the other hand perhaps you are winchester put his hand over his face to hide his expression george rose to his feet in the gallery and was sharply pulled back by wilbert a sigh of horror stifled laughter and apprehension swept around the gallery a juror had a fit of coughing and could not find his handkerchief someone lent him one rathbone had a choice and he had to make it instantly he could either attempt to defend himselfand there was no defense monks shot had been deadlyor he could retreat with dignity he chose the latter it had the virtue of grace indeed he said with an inclination of his head but considering the comparative history of your bookkeeper and my client my assumption is more reasonable than yours my bookkeeper is not in the dock monk pointed out not yet rathbone agreed now smiling also the judge glanced at winchester but winchester made no objection he was enjoying the battle rathbone took a deep breath and steadied himself the point at issue mr monk is whether this note could have fallen into the hands of mr robinson even more easily than into the hands of mr ballinger who after all has never even visited the clinic that depends upon whether lady rathbone left the list at the clinic or at her home or her parents home monk replied since the accused is her father and she is your wife her testimony has to be compromised or it is possible that she simply does not remember now rathbone really had nowhere to turn except to abandon that line of question he started again mr monk you said in your testimony yesterday that you discounted mr rupert cardew as a suspect in the murder of mickey parfitt this was in spite of the fact that it appears to be absolutely undeniable that his cravat which he was seen wearing earlier in the day was the ligature used to strangle parfitt you gave as your reason for this a witness who swore that this highly individual cravat had been stolen from mr cardew late in the afternoon of the same day i am sure the jury wonders as i do how a man can have a cravat stolen from around his neck and we wait eagerly for mr winchester to call this person so that we may hear rathbone could see the sudden misery in monks face in spite of his attempt to disguise it the previous moments triumph had vanished he stiffened a little and his shoulders altered almost indefinably pulling the fabric of his excellent jacket a little more taut did the court see it also winchester would surely monk did not speak winchester did not rise to his feet and ask if there was a question in all this preamble that in itself was indicative of danger complexity something hidden how did you find this witness mr monk rathbone went on at the time we suspected mr rupert cardew of having killed parfitt monk replied levelly his voice sounded emotionless belying the tension in his body that was from having found the cravat and having identified it as being his in following his actions on the day parfitt died we learned where he had been and of the loss of the cravat and exactly how did you find out that it was rupert cardews rathbone affected innocence even admiration there was a reasonable assumption that it belonged to someone who knew parfitt monk replied since it was clearly expensive that suggested one of his wealthier patrons such people do not fall within parfitts social circle nor could he seek them out it is far more likely that his reputation spread by word of mouth and by suggestion from his patrons since we could not go to them rathbone interrupted because you do not know who they are exactly monk was forced to agree therefore we started at the type of place where word of mouth would spread or gentlemen with such tastes might be easily found which is cremorne gardens among others there was a flicker of recognition in the faces of the jurors and a rustle of indrawn breath in the gallery the reputation of the place was known to many what led you to cremorne gardens rathbone asked common sense monk replied with a quiver of his lips that might almost have been a smile it is a natural place to seek clients for a trade such as parfitts rathbone nodded with satisfaction i imagine so and did you find mr cardew there no i found someone who could identify the cravat monk answered him and shall we hear their testimony if mr winchester wishes it although i can see no reason mr cardew does not deny that it is his nor does he deny that it was stolen from him that afternoon the police surgeon will confirm that he took it from around parfitts throat and this elusive witness whose name i have not yet been toldcuriously enough mr winchester has not spoken of him or her are you aware of why that is mr monk monk breathed in deeply he will not be calling miss benson his voice was quiet roughedged even the judge leaned forward to hear him rathbone affected amazement but his pulse was racing his mind suddenly filled with excitement indeed this miss benson would appear to be key to your case mr monk if you do not call her you leave speculation in the minds of the jury either that she does not exist or that if she did testify she would not say what you wish her to can you explain such a decision to the court he made a slight elegant gesture with his hand to include the rest of the room monk was pale yes i can fearing for her safety i had miss benson moved from her lodgings in chiswick into the clinic in portpool lane i believed she would be safe there however she chose to leave without telling anyone where she was going i assume that she was afraid ah yesthe clinic where the dubious mr robinson keeps the books are you saying that you now do not know where she is yes there was something tight and strained in monks face a pain that possibly only rathbone knew him well enough to recognize the look that passed over monks face troubled rathbone but he did not know why he had the feeling that he had missed something then we must draw our own conclusions both as to why miss benson came up with her original story and why she now has taken flight and refuses to come forward and repeat it to us thank you mr monk i do not believe i have anything further to ask you monk moved to leave the stand oh just one more thing rathbone said monk stopped and turned back his face bleak will mr winchester be calling mr cardew to explain this theft i have no notice that he will be a witness i dont know quite possibly rathbone inclined his head satisfied he waved dismissal graciously and returned to his seat winchester rose and called mr horrible jones to the stand the judge frowned is that his lawful name mr winchester it appears to be the only one he knows my lord winchester responded very well i suppose we have no choice proceed orrie climbed awkwardly up the winding steps to the stand and stood clutching the rail as if the whole edifice were swaying like a ship at sea one eye swiveled dangerously the other looked with grave apprehension at the jury who either stared back at him or painfully avoided his gaze he was sworn in and winchester asked him with considerable courtesy to state his occupation and describe his relationship with mickey parfitt when that was answered winchester asked him about finding mickeys body with tosh wilkin calling the police and later the arrival of monk and orme it was all very predictable and there was nothing for rathbone to object to and nothing for him to add winchester obtained an account from orrie of the entire evening of parfitts death complete with reasonably accurate times orrie had an extensive knowledge of tides and that was included as well as the skills of rowing and general management of all river craft the jurys attention might have been lost were it not for orries remarkable appearance and the occasional wry observation that winchester put in which made people laugh thank you mr jones he said at length you have given us an excellent account he invited rathbone to question the witness rathbone looked up at orrie so you were deeply involved in parfitts affairs he relied on you for much especially personally you rowed him when he was on the river was that necessary because of his withered arm yes sir orrie replied his tone indicating his contempt for such a foolish question was it always you or did other people row him also orrie looked indignant grasping on to the rail till his knuckles gleamed it were always me wot ford e want anyone else no reason at all rathbone assured him he did not care what orrie thought but he was aware already of antagonizing the jury winchester had been scrupulous in avoiding any mention of parfitts occupation as if orrie could have been unaware of it if rathbone raised it now he would prejudice the jury against orrie and therefore his testimony mr jones in the course of your assistance to mr parfitt did you ever meet mr arthur ballinger no i didnt orrie said vigorously or hear his name mentioned rathbone suggested perhaps mr parfitt might have had other meetings with him no i didnt did you ever hear any of your colleagues speak of him no ow many times do i ave ter tell yer i int got nothin ter do wif im at all orrie said indignantly i quite believe you mr jones rathbone assured him i am certain your path and mr ballingers never crossed as neither did mr parfitts thank you winchester next called the police surgeon who testified to all the more lurid details of the corpse the injuries exactly what had caused parfitts death and how it was most likely that it had been accomplished including the surgeons removal of the cravat imbedded in the swollen flesh struck on the head with a blunt instrument such as a log of wood a piece of a branch winchester repeated yes and then when he was lying there unconscious his killer looped mr cardews silk cravat around his neck after having tied the knots in it the surgeon corrected him winchester looked as if he had been caught in an error although rathbone knew that he had done it on purpose of course i apologize after having tied the knots either then or earlier the assailant looped the cravat around mr parfitts neck and then tightened it until he choked to death yes why the knots sir to exert a greater pressure on the windpipe i assume the surgeon replied it would be much more effective but take time not if you did it in advance of course then hardly a crime of impulse would you say impossible vandalism to do that to a good piece of silk winchester nodded a premeditated act thank you sir there was nothing rathbone could do except not call more attention to the doctors testimony by going over it again he declined to crossexamine after luncheon winchester called stanley willington the ferryman who had taken ballinger from chiswick to the lonsdale road on the south shore and then back again at about twelvethirty in the morning all the times were exactly as ballinger had told rathbone and there was nothing to add nothing to doubt winchester then called bertram harkness who was a very different proposition he was both nervous and angry he clearly wanted very much to account for ballingers time in such a way as to make it clear that he could not possibly have killed parfitt and yet he was not aware of what the ferryman had said since being a later witness he had not been permitted in court at that time he blustered he did not like winchester and winchester was clever enough to play on it he was charming even amusing in a mild way as if to give them all a respite from the seriousness of the crime some people in the audience even laughed although possibly more out of nervous relief than humor harkness was furious you find this amusing sir he demanded his face scarlet you drag a good man here blacken his name in front of all and sundry accuse him of murder and by implication god knows what else then you stand around in your elegant suit and make jokes you are a nincompoop sir an irresponsible nincompoop winchester looked startled then embarrassed rathbone swore under his breath it was harkness who looked ridiculous not winchester the crowd in the gallery was already on winchesters side now they were all but rising to defend him i apologize if i have hurt your feelings mr harkness winchester said gently perhaps you would explain to me again exactly what happened and the lie of the land around the area in which you live so the jury may have that uppermost in their minds and not some frivolous remark of mine but harkness had lost the thread of the story he had been trying to concoct somewhere between the truth as he guessed it and a later and longer version that would protect ballinger i understand your predicament winchester said softly you would have had no idea that you would be called upon to account for every minute of your time with such precision let us agree that your judgments are approximate ballinger did not kill that wretched creature harkness said tartly if you knew him as i do you wouldnt even have entertained the idea look among parfitts own ghastly confederates or some miserable victim of his disgusting trade your loyalty does you credit sir winchester replied its not loyalty you damn fool harkness shouted at him its simply the truth man if you cant see that you should be occupied in some trade where you can do no harm winchester smiled patiently and turned to rathbone your witness sir oliver rathbone considered for only a moment weighing judging deciding thank you mr winchester but i believe mr harkness has already told us exactly what happened he drew in his breath and plunged on this witness of yours miss benson is apparently reluctant to testify as to the theft of the cravat that mr cardew was wearing that afternoon you have conclusively proved it to be the instrument with which mr parfitt was strangled to death without this witnesss testimony it seems to me as it must to the jury that there is every reasonable doubt of mr ballingers involvement with any part of this unhappy matter let alone his guilt in parfitts death surely the answer is exactly what it appears to be the man was killed by some victim of his revolting trade for once winchester was genuinely startled my lord he began that that is an unjust conclusion regarding miss bensons reluctance whether it is doubt remorse or fear that some punishment will be visited on her for lying rathbone responded now suddenly sure that winchester was hiding something that is surely irrelevant she is not here to tell us about the cravat or to suggest that it ever left rupert cardews possession now winchester was pale the tension in him palpable hattie benson is not here to testify because her dead body was carried out of the thames at chiswick three days before mr ballinger was arrested he said hoarsely strangled exactly the same way as mickey parfitt a woman in the gallery screamed someone else muffled a cry and a man let out a gasp one of the jurors lurched forward as if to rise to his feet the judge banged his gavel and demanded order and was ignored rathbone felt himself go cold as if there were ice water in the pit of his stomach his mind was numb darkness at the edges of his vision how in gods name had that happened no wonder monk looked like a ghost he must have known suddenly rathbone was overwhelmed with pityand a profound and terrible fear chapter im sorry monk said quietly as he and hester sat in the parlor i wanted to have a better answer before i told you i hoped i could find out enough to say that there was never anything you could have done hester sat perfectly still as though she were frozen tears prickled in her eyes and she was furious with herself because they could be out of guilt and an sense of overwhelming failure as much as out of grief for hattie was she too used to the death of street women even young ones long before their bloom was gone and they were riddled with disease they came in injured and she knew that patching them up was often only temporary but hattie had trusted her monk himself had trusted her to keep hattie safe im sorry she whispered i should have been able to protect her i suppose it ruins the case too and ballinger will get off without hatties testimony there has to be reasonable doubt and ruperts name will be shadowed again too oh damn damn damn she wanted to cry properly to let the sobs come and to swear as she had heard soldiers do words monk had never heard and she would rather he never knew that she had heard them let alone remembered them but there was no time for that now and there were far more urgent uses for her energy one of the worst things she would have to do was tell scuff because he had been with her when theyd first met hattie it was after nine in the evening now but there would be little time in the morning she would have to stay with him tonight judge very carefully how much comfort to offer she had no idea how he would take it he had grown up on the dockside and must have seen death many times before possibly the deaths of people he knew how she reacted would mark him perhaps for all his life she must not show fear but neither must she ever let him think she did not care monk was saying something she looked up and saw the anxiety in his eyes im sorry she said very gently i didnt hear you what did you say do you want me to tell scuff hell have to know no she shook her head you have enough to do you need to sleep ill tell him and stay with him besides if he needs to cry we can do it together she smiled and the tears slid down her cheeks hell expect it of me and itll be all right she stood up and turned to go hester she looked back yes she thought he was going to thank her and she did not want to be thanked it wasnt as if shed given him a gift i love you he said quietly she drew in a shaky breath using all her strength not to go back and cling to him and let the tears come i know if i didnt do you think i could do any of this then without waiting for him to answer she went up to waken scuff and tell him hattie was dead she knocked on the door because she always did he must have a place where no one else entered without his permission as she had expected there was no answer she turned the handle and went in the nightlight was still burning he had to have enough to see by if he woke up he must never have that first moment of terror not knowing where he was of imagining the bilges of jericho phillipss boat even for an instant scuff she said quietly he did not move she could see his head on the pillow hair ruffled still damp from his bath scuff she repeated more loudly he stirred and when she spoke a third time he opened his eyes and sat up holding his nightshirt around himself with one hand she came and sat on the end of the bed where he could see her face in the light wos wrong he asked noticing the tears wos appened his perception of her grief was instant and it filled him with fear she realized with a sharp stab how much of his world was bound up in her hatties dead she replied so he would not be afraid that it was something to do with monk she was killednot an accident though william just told me he wanted to wait until he could find out exactly how it happened but it came out in court today he blinked somebody killed er he gulped then reached forward and put his small thin hand over hers so lightly she saw it rather than felt it dont cry for er he whispered she were always gonna finish bad this way it wont urt so much quick like yer should pull a tooth out if yerve gotter like she wanted to hug him but it would be an intrusion too far not everyone liked to be hugged you are quite right she agreed angry with herself because her voice trembled but i still feel that i need to know how she left the clinic and who helped her you understand he nodded his eyes never leaving hers still full of fear if she wavered even slightly all his doubts would storm back drowning his courage dyer reckon as someone took er he asked no i think they more likely tricked her told her shed be safe or told her a lie of some sort i want to know who because i mustnt ever trust that person again did that sound too extreme as if she never forgave a mistake would she make him fear that if he made a mistake he would forfeit love forever if they did it on purpose i mean she added owd they kill er he whispered like mickey parfitt yes exactly like that i expect she didnt even know what happened were it the same person wot done im yes i expect it was she was found in the water as he was and pretty close to the same place int mr ballinger in jail he pulled the bedclothes a little tighter round his body he is now but he wasnt when she was killed but neither was rupert cardew his eyes opened wider yer think as e done er no i dont but they might try to make it look that way to get mr ballinger off yer like mr cardew dont yer yes but that doesnt have anything to do with it at least it shouldnt he looked puzzled you wouldnt like im anymore if e done it his hand was still lying on top of hers as if he had forgotten it she was careful not to move i might still like him you dont stop liking people or even loving them because theyve done something horrible i suppose first you try to understand why and it makes a difference if theyre sorryreally sorry but it doesnt mean they dont have to pay for it or put as much of it right as they can you have to have right and wrong the same for everybody or it isnt fair he nodded so wot are we gonna do find out what happened termorrer yes im sorry i woke you up to tell you but there might not be time in the morning and he waited eyes shadowed i just wanted to tell you now his mouth tightened you thought i were gonna cry he was on the very edge of it and angry with himself no she told him i thought i was i still might he smiled at her widely as if it were funny and two large tears spilled over and rolled down his cheeks this time she did put her arms around him and hug him at first he merely let her then quite suddenly he hugged her back hard hanging on to her and burying his face in her shoulder where the hair that had slipped out of its pins was loose in the morning monk went back to the court and hester and scuff went to the clinic you dont have to be here squeaky said as soon as she was through the door and into the room where he was working at a table spread with receipts nor you neither he added to scuff yes i do hester responded and scuff can help me there was no allowance for argument in her voice and no prevarication i want to find out exactly what happened to hattie benson why she left here and who said something to her that prompted her to go squeaky regarded her dismally wont do no good maybe she lied to you have you thought of that yes and i dont believe it it came out in court yesterday squeaky she was murdered exactly the same way as mickey parfittstrangled and put in the river up at chiswick gawd almighty woman squeaky exploded what dyou want to go and say that for in front of the boy sometimes youre a coldhearted mare and thats the truth scuff charged forward fists clenched glaring at squeaky across the table dont yer dare talk to er like that yer bleedin worm yer int fit ter clean er boots hester thought of pulling him back and then decided not to she could not rob him of the right to defend them both but she had to bite her lip to hide a weak smile squeaky backed off a little only a matter of leaning away while still in his chair yint fit ter scuff went on then he drew in his breath and regarded squeaky with disgust dyer think im some kind o baby then that you cant tell me the truth yer gotta pretend as if yer think i can ear yer squeaky considered for a moment i grant that pound for pound youre worse than a wild cat he opined never mind defending you i should be looking after myself from the pair of you he turned to hester his eyes bright with a strange almost embarrassed amusement as if he were pleased but did not want them to know and how are you going to find out who took poor hattie to the door and pushed her out then im going to ask hester replied we will begin with a full account of who was here when they arrived and what they did exactly like the bleeding police squeaky said with disgust hester caught scuff just as he was about to launch forward at squeaky again his fists clenched yes she agreed what did you expect that i would first ask everyone nicely if theyd set hattie up to be murdered i spose you want me to write it all down he said accusingly dont blame me if they all walk out in a huff hester thought of several retorts and bit them all off before she said them she needed his help who was in that day you think i can remember he countered i think you will know exactly who was here what they did that was useful and how much they ate she replied i shall be disappointed in my judgment of your skills if you dont he considered that a moment or two weighing up her precise meaning then he decided to take it as a compliment and dug his books out of the desk drawer finding the appropriate pages for the day of hatties disappearance scuff watched him fascinated does e ave it all there in them little squiggles o writing scuff whispered to her yes marvelous isnt it she replied scuff gave her a sideways look she had not yet persuaded him of the necessity of learning to read he could count he considered that to be enough squeaky read out who was resident and who had arrived that morning and at what time he also listed what duties they had performed and if in his opinion they had been requisitely appreciated for their efforts hester made a couple of notes on a piece of paper borrowing his pencil for the task then set out to question each person in turn to begin with the people were defensive imagining their work was under attack and frightened of losing the safety of food and a place to sleep scuff followed hester most of the time as if he were protecting her although he had no idea from what shes lyin he said casually as they left one young woman in the laundry her sleeves rolled up her hands red from hot water and the caustic soap necessary to clean sheets that had been soiled by body waste from the sick and injured well check with claudine hester replied mrs burroughs to you shell know if kitty was there or not she werent scuff told her ill bet she were at the back door doin summink as she shouldnt are yer gonna throw er out no hester said immediately not unless she did something to hattie oh she glanced at him and saw the smile on his face she questioned two more womenpatients not well enough to leave yet but able to be of assistance in cooking and cleaning their accounts contradicted kittys and one of the other womens they found claudine in the pantry checking rations there seemed to be plenty of the staples such as flour and beans of several sorts barley oatmeal and salt other things such as prunes and brown sugar were in considerably shorter supply claudine smiled when she saw hesters eye on the halfempty pot of plum jam and then scuffs wide with amazement at what to him was a lifetimes supply of luxury ill give you a slice of toast and jam later if youre good she told him hester nudged him thank yer he said quickly unless you would rather have a piece of cake claudine added her eyes were bright as if she were laughing inside yes he said instantly then he glanced at hester yes i wouldplease hester told claudine of the discrepancy between the accounts of who was working where on the morning hattie disappeared claudine had already judged that it was important that cant be right she agreed she turned to scuff if you go to the kitchen youll find bessie there tell her that i said you could have a piece of the plum cake in the third jar along dont forget the third jar then shell know that you are telling the truth no one else knows it is there scuff drew in his breath and then let it out again ill ave it later he replied taking a step closer to hester yere gonna tell er who opened the door an let attie out ter get killed i gotta be ere thank yer claudine looked at him then at hester is he right hester nodded yes im afraid so she had strict instructions not to go out for any reason at all not even to go into the main rooms where other people come and go she knew she was in danger and she was scared stiff that they would kill her claudines face filled with misery and did they yes claudine i have to know who persuaded her to go out what good will it do now claudine asked the poor girl is beyond help it seems it was just a piece of stupid behavior but if she was lured out on purpose then i need to tie it together the trial is going badly it looks as if nothing will be proved and ballinger will get off on reasonable doubt we will be back where we started she did not add that the trade in pornography would begin again exactly as before as soon as the man behind it had replaced mickey parfitt although she feared that leaving this unsaid would not deceive scuff for long claudine looked at her and her eyes were suddenly tired and bitterly unhappy then you had better ask lady rathbone she was here that morning working in the laundry and the medicine room just checking on supplies she will know who is lying hester was stunned margaret was here claudines face was unreadable yes how long about an hour that i know of claudine watched her steadily in the laundry yes hester i dont believe any of the women here would lie to you in addition to their gratitude and perhaps fear for their future chances of treatment why would they theyd lie to anyone else to protect you as easily as breathing but not this they all knew you wanted hattie protected hester knew that was true it was margaret whod had every reason to fear hatties testimony it had just never occurred to hester that she would do this in fact for hattie to have gone back to chiswick and ended in the river margaret must have done far more than simply getting hattie to leave she done it scuff asked looking from hester to claudine and back again not killed her hester said quickly but yes it does look as if she took her away from here then who killed er he said his eyes full of disbelief i dont know i dont know exactly what she did or what she meant to happen but im going to find out she turned to claudine thank you i think its best if you dont say anything more to people here even if they ask you please of course i wont claudine seemed about to add something more then changed her mind hester guessed that it was some kind of warning and from the troubled gentleness of her face a sympathy she smiled back not needing words after a short very firm discussion in which she told scuff he was definitely not coming with her hester put him in a hansom and paid the driver to take him to the wapping police station she gave him fare for the ferry home and she went on to the court even the pavement outside was bustling with people all eager to catch any word about what was going on inside it was only with the help of an usher who knew her that hester managed to get in at all he escorted her through the hallway and with some use of his authority into the very back of the courtroom she had not long to waitjust a few minutes of winchesters argumentand then the judge adjourned the court for luncheon hester was buffeted by the crowd pouring out first from the back of the gallery and then at last from the front she saw lord cardew palefaced looking a decade older than he had just a few weeks ago she was ashamed of being so relieved that he did not see her what could she say to him that would even touch the pain he must be feeling how much courage did it cost just to come out of the house let alone to sit here and listen as the horror grew deeper and the doubt ate into all that had once been so bright and safe then she saw margaret and her mother side by side just behind two other couples palefaced and tense they also looked neither to right nor left as if they could see no one the resemblance in the womensomething in the angle of the head a shape of eyebrowmade hester believe that they were margarets sisters and their respective husbands but it was margaret she needed to speak to and alone she stepped forward blocking mrs ballingers way it was discourteous to say the least but she had no better alternative mrs ballinger stopped abruptly her face filled with alarm but margaret hesitated only an instant then grasping the elements of the situation turned to her mother mama it seems mrs monk needs to speak to me something must have occurred at the clinic then it can wait mrs ballinger said between her teeth it is not even imaginable that anything there could be of importance to us now mama margaret i do not care if the place has burned to the ground does she expect us to pass buckets of water she swiveled away from margaret to glare at hester it is regarding evidence mrs ballinger hester replied needing a considerable effort to keep her voice level and polite i would prefer not to take it to mr winchester but that is my alternative the last vestiges of color drained from mrs ballingers face are you threatening me mrs monk hester felt the anger brew inside her i am trying to gain your attention mrs ballinger or to be more accurate margarets attention the matter in hand is more important than our personal feelings margaret took her mothers arm briefly i shall find you when court resumes mama go with gwen and celia and without waiting for her mothers reply she let go of her and faced hester we had better go to olivers rooms whatever you have to say need not be made a spectacle of out here come then walking as briskly as possible through the last few people still in the corridors she led the way to the room where rathbone was permitted for the duration of the trial to keep his papers and to speak with anyone he might need to the clerk recognized margaret and without question allowed her in and hester because they were clearly together margaret swung round as soon as the door was closed well what is it after your husbands accusations against my father you can hardly expect me to be pleased to see you or to imagine you have my welfare in mind it was not so long since they had been close friends sharing laughter dreams even the excitement of margarets courtship with rathbone and her anxieties that he would never actually propose to her she had not said so in as many words but there had been a time when margaret had feared that he would always love hester and had secretly imagined that hester would have made him happier it had been some time before she had realized that was not true now they faced each other several feet apart in the small room with its table chairs and bookcases a world apart in emotion there was no time to waste in prevarication or in an attempt to smooth the way to any kind of understanding you were at the clinic the morning hattie benson left hester stated margaret was stiff her shoulders high and straight a very faint color in her cheeks you came here to tell me that she said with surprise youve lost your evidence i know that she wont testify to save your friend although how you can be a friend to rupert cardew is beyond my imagination but then you have not been in court and perhaps that is some excuse i assure you your loyalty is misplaced all kinds of bitter retorts rose to hesters lips especially as margaret herself had not been in court the previous day but hester did not speak them it would break the frail thread of contact between them and she needed to know the truth i want to know what happened to hattie margaret thats all im concerned with at the moment i promised to look after her i want to know why i failed regardless of what she might have said on the stand what she might have said is that she lied to you margaret answered you were kind to her and she wanted to please you i imagine she also had a very good idea of where her best future interests lay should she ever be sick or injured or need your help for any kind of problem and she wouldnt be the first who lied to please the police out of fear or for revenge or simply because its easier than keeping up a resistance you know as well as i do that street women survive by pleasing others frequently those they are afraid of she made a slight gesture half pity half disgust they know what people want and they give it to them its their trade hester shook her head fractionally as if to rid herself of something is that how you think of her as someone who lies to please thats all oh for heavens sake hester dont be so selfrighteous this is the time for truth yes that is what i think of girls like hattie maybe if i had had the misfortune of being born into her lot in life i would be the same i wasnt i had fine parents good health good examples to follow and i married a fine man i show my gratitude for it in service to those less fortunate but im not blinded by sentimentality regarding their nature or their weaknesses sometimes i think you are hester was overtaken by an anger that astounded her she stood for a moment trembling a little i imagine we both have thoughts about others that are less than flattering she said almost between her teeth or even downright unkind i want to know why you took hattie at least as far as the door and watched her go outside when you knew that i had her in the clinic to keep her safe so she could testify at the trial why did you you sound like a policeman margaret said with a slight curl of her lip you are giving yourself airs to which you have no right i gave my time to help at the clinic because i believe in the work you do there i am not your servant to answer your questions either i ask you or william does hester said grimly then william may try margaret snapped back i do not have to account to you for where hattie went even did i know you dont have to tell me hester began furious with herself because her voice was shaking that is what i just said margaret told her because i already know hester snapped she went back to chiswick where she was strangled and her body thrown into the river now it was margarets turn to blanch and to find herself gasping for breath now perhaps you can see my concern hester added tartly also why william may very well ask you where she went and why you took her to the door margaret regained her control with difficulty obviously rupert killed her so she would not be called to the stand and say that shed lied before and shed no more taken his cravat than i had he kept it as everyone supposes and later strangled mickey parfitt with it because he could not go on paying him blackmail if you were a little less blinded by your own crusades you would have seen that in the first place im sorry hattie had to die for you to face reality hester could feel her fingernails dig into the palms of her hands the reality throughout is that hattie was the one person who could have cleared rupert she answered and you took her to the door and let her out into the street out of the place where she was safe and someone killed her it might have been rupert cardew it might just as easily have been your father he was the one her testimony would have hurt and you were the one who sent her out margaret stared at her her face white to the lips her eyes glittering are you likening my fathermy fatherto rupert cardew rupert is dissolute weak and perverted a a vile man who for some unknown reason in your own morality your memory or your need you dont seem able to see for what he is of course i can see hes weak hesters voice was rising in spite of her efforts to keep it level i dont know how dissolute he is and neither do you but your loyalty to your father blinds you from seeing that he too could be just as greedy as cruel and in his own way as dissolute he may not watch little boys being raped and abused but is he any better if he imprisons them and causes it to happen so he can blackmail the wretched men who do it is corrupting others any better any nobler than being corrupt yourself i think its worse my loyalty makes me know it could not be true margaret said between her teeth but you wouldnt understand that you were in the crimea being noble saving strangers when your own father needed you he died alone in despair while you were off gloryhunting and if that werent enough who supported your mother in her grief not you you didnt even come home for his funeral hester was speechless she could not catch her breath her whole body hurt as if she had been beaten you dont know what loyalty is margaret went on seeing her advantage and forcing it home i used to be sorry for you that you dont have any children of your own only that little urchin youve picked up from the dockside to fill your emptiness when it comes down to it you dont understand what family is youre too selfish too absorbed with the image of love to know what the reality is she took a gulp of air then pushed past hester and went out into the hallway again leaving the door swinging on its hinges was it true only part of it hester had had no idea of her fathers despair no idea he had been cheated lied to and betrayed she heard of his suicide only after it had happened letters to and from the crimea took weeks and often she was away from scutari when the ships from england landed could she have known should she have her brother james had kept it from her her younger brother had already been killed in action was there something else she should have done should she have stayed at home in the first place no she had followed not only her heart but her beliefs in joining the nurses in the hellhole of scutari and even on the bloodsoaked battlefields she had eased pain saved lives and she had loved her father more than margaret could ever know and she loved monk she would have wanted children to please him to give him everything love can ever give but she did not ache for them for herself yes she loved scuff why should she deny that but for who he was not to ease an emptiness within herself monk alone was sufficientcompanion ally lover and friend had she made mistakes perhaps even profound ones yes of course but never through indifference she stood still dizzy the room blurring in her vision and waited until she was sufficiently composed to return to the courtroom and observe the afternoons trial rathbone was fighting for the defense as hester had known he must do he had no choice legally or emotionally he called witnesses who one by one painted a picture of the trade parfitt had run and its patrons among the rich and dissolute including most pointedly rupert cardew only the rich he pressed the witness an oily deviouslooking man who stood very straight in the witness box his hands by his sides course the man replied no point in blackmailin the poor there was a faint snicker around the gallery which died immediately and the fashionable rathbone continued the socially prominent the witness regarded him witheringly int no need ter pay if yer got no position to lose if yer nobody yer tell im ter sod off an sell the pictures to whoever e wants quite rathbone agreed succinctly thank you mr loftus he turned to winchester your witness sir winchester rose to his feet he moved just as elegantly as before but hester noticed the pallor of his face and that the hand resting at his side was clenched mr loftus you seem to be very well informed about this whole business far more for example than i am even though i have had to learn as much about it as i can for this trial how is that sir oh i know all sorts loftus tapped the side of his nose as if to suggest some extraordinary sensory awareness i accept that you do sir but how winchester pressed he smiled very slightly for example how much are you involved in it yourself loftus drew in his breath then caught winchesters eye and apparently changed his mind well i see things see things winchester repeated dubiously what things mr loftus welldressed men coming from and going to a boat moored on the river would you say thats right late at night an believe me they int there ter fish there was another titter of laughter around the gallery a juror raised his hand to hide a smile late at night winchester said gently in the dark then o course loftus sneered you dont think theyre gonna be about when folks can recognize em do yer yer int bin listenin sir he exaggerated the sir slightly they int there for any good too dark to be recognized and yet you know who they were winchester smiled back at him eyebrows raised inquiringly loftus knew he had been trapped all right he said angrily i elped now an then on the outside only i never done nothing to those boys you helped on the outside winchester echoed him out of the goodness of your heart or you were paid in kind perhaps a few pictures to sell on to others after youd had a good look at them yourself perhaps to sell back to the miserable wretches in them caught in acts that would ruin them if their friends knew is that how you were so sure that rupert cardew was involved rathbone rose to his feet might we have no more than two questions at a time my lord i am going to have trouble working out which answer fits which question there was another nervous ripple of laughter around the room im sorry winchester apologized my confusion must be contagious he looked back at loftus your reward for this help sir what nature did it take money loftus said indignantly pure money like you own sir you have none of my money mr loftus winchester responded with a smile but since you know mr cardew was there you must surely know the names of others who else attended those parties loftus made a movement across his mouth code o silence sir you understand all kinds o gents like their excitement a bit on the spicy side ruin alf o london if i were to speak out o turn i could not to mention your own future income and that of the man behind the business who will have to find another manager now that parfitt is dead could that be you mr loftus suddenly the courtroom was silent all the small rustles of movement stopped one could almost hear the rasp of breathing rathbone rose to his feet my lord mr winchester is assuming facts that no one has proved he keeps making suggestions as to this gray presence behind parfitt but no one has shown that he exists let alone is going to pay mr loftus for anything my lord someone sent the letter of instruction to mickey parfitt so that he was alone on his boat the night he was killed winchester pointed out someone put forward the money to buy and to furnish the boat someone found watched and then tempted the men susceptible to this kind of indulgence someone blackmailed them and drove at least one to suicide and it appears one to murder and since mr loftus has sworn that rupert cardew was a victim of this trade and other witnesses have told us very graphically of his descent from bystander and gullible friend to witness of degraded and revolting scenes it cannot have been him one does not blackmail oneself the judge considered for a moment then lifted one heavy shoulder in a gesture of resignation mr winchester appears to be right sir oliver you cannot have it both ways with mr cardew either he was the blackmailer or he was the victim who struck back my lord rathbone bowed it seems to me beyond a reasonable doubt that mickey parfitt was a vile man who provided a ready path to total degradation a depravity that must disgust all decent people he charged his victims for it twice over once to purchase it and then a second time to keep themselves from the disgrace of having it known to their friends and to society in general how he was able to target those vulnerable to such weakness we do not know many answers are imaginable if there was indeed a mastermind behind it we do not know who that is personally i should like to see him hang as i dare say so would you but it is repulsive to me that in our disgust we should vent our anger by hanging the wrong man there were smiles of approval in the gallery one voice even cried out in agreement the judge looked around but did not reprove him rathbone allowed a moment for them to settle down again then he resumed we are here to try arthur ballinger on the charge of murdering mickey parfitt i put it to you that for all mr winchesters elegance and his masterly exposure of the deeply vile nature of mickey parfitts trade he has not shown us that mr ballinger had anything to do with it either as investor or as victim he looked specifically at the jury i propose in the next day or so to demonstrate to you the violent and deceitful nature of others involved on the edges of this trade and how easy it would have been for any of them to have killed parfitt i shall show you a score of reasons why they might have primarily involving greed as has been amply demonstrated there is a great deal of money to be made and lost in blackmail mens reputations are destroyed fortunes ruined and lives ended such circumstances breed murder hester did not stay to listen rathbone would carefully lay all kinds of suggestions that would make the issue even less certain he would probably not try to prove specifically that rupert cardew was guilty but it might not be difficult to create at least sufficient belief that it was possible so no jury would convict ballinger then it would all begin again perhaps only to end in more doubt she walked out into the late afternoon the noise of the street the traffic almost another world she tried not to think what it would mean for monk if the trial ended in acquittal margaret would not forgive him what would the river police think that he had charged the wrong man or that he had been right and had failed to produce the evidence either way he had lost she forced herself to remember that it was being right that mattered not looking right she needed to know what had happened to hattie if margaret had taken her to the door and suggested she leave why had hattie obeyed her where had she gone to whom who had known where to find her and had killed her to keep her from testifying what would she have said that rupert was innocent or that he was guilty now they would never know to whom hattie had given the cravat if indeed she had ever actually stolen it was it possible that rupert had killed parfitt after all why did that thought hurt simply the pain of disillusion or the humiliation of being wrong or the wrenching pity for his father the following morning hester was at the clinic early again asking questions ascertaining as closely as possible what time hattie had left it was a still heavy day with rain threatening as she stood outside the door on the street and looked right and left people were passing as always which of them would do so every morning who had regular errands trips to the baker or the laundry jobs to go to it was too late for the reid brewery workers they would have started hours ago factories or shops had been open for a couple of hours at least was there a peddler none that she could see she tightened her shawl around her and walked down to leather lane and then turned north a hundred yards away there was a running patterer telling the news in his singsong voice she interrupted him to his displeasure and asked him if he had seen hattie describing her as accurately as possible he knew nothing she retraced her steps and went south almost as far as high holborn but no one had seen a young woman answering hatties description discouraged that it was now too many days ago she went back up to leather lane along portpool lane again into the shadow of the brewery and all the way along to grays inn road at the other end she walked north and was almost level with st bartholomews church when she saw a peddler selling sandwiches she stopped and bought one not because she was hungry but in order to engage him in conversation it must have been desperately boring standing all day virtually alone just exchanging a word or two with strangers hoping to sell them something needing to she ate the sandwich with pleasure it was actually very good and she told him so he smiled gaptoothed and thanked her i work just down the road she indicated with her hand still clutching the last of the sandwich portpool lane i know who you are he replied she was surprised do you she was half convinced he had mistaken her for someone else yeah yer takes in street women wot are sick or beat up she had no idea from his expression whether he thought that was good or bad but there was no point in denying it thats right im looking for one now who left tuesday of last week and is now missing shes still pretty sick and im worried about her hester was not sure how much of the truth she should tell panic was rising inside her and she had to force it down refuse to follow the fears of what would happen if she failed perhaps she was almost as afraid of what knowledge success would bring things she would not be able to ignore i wouldnt worry about it love the sandwich man said kindly shell come back fast enough if she needs ter hester was momentarily at a loss she fished out two threepenny pieces may i have another sandwich please that hams extremely good actually she did not want it she had eaten enough he gave her one with pleasure and tuppence change i dont think she knows how ill she is she improvised some of those things are catching i think she wasnt alone she could give it to others the story was getting wilder as she tried to interest him maybe someone with children children get sick so quickly he shook his head well i dunno ow yer gonna find er the street is full o girls this one was unusuallooking she had very fair hair almost white and a lovely skin she wasnt terribly pretty but sort of innocentlooking very clean if you know what i mean she looked at him hopefully tuesday last week yer said yes did you see her about this time of day or a little earlier who did yer say she were with i dont know another woman maybe older eh sort o respectablelookin bit dumpy brown air yes yes that could be right she had no idea who it could have been but she had nothing else to follow you saw them where did they go ow do i know up that way he pointed north again past the church to the church to st bartholomews he rolled his eyes no sweet eart to the cabbies wot usually wait around there best place ter get one oh she felt the heat rush up her face yes of course what did the other woman look like did you say can you remember what was she wearing wot dyer think i am course i cant remember it werent nothing special i can tell yer that cept er gloves she ad real good gloves on leather andstitched wi a little piece o toolin on the cuff about ere he pointed to his wrist must a lifted em or ad a customer wi a lot o money can you describe her a bit more what was her skin like her teeth wot her skin her teeth hester repeated ow do i know the peddler said indignantly er teeth were just like teeth kind o good come ter think of it hester felt her heart racing little bit crooked at the front but nice yeah thats right yer know er she one o yours then perhaps was he right or had she put the idea into his mind and he was simply trying to please her and get rid of her questions thank you she finished the sandwich and thanked him again then walked quickly toward the place he had pointed to for the hansom cabs the description he had given fitted one of the women who had been in the courtroom with margaret and her mother or any other woman in london with pretty and slightly crooked teeth and enough money to buy good gloves but margarets sister was the one who would help her and her father by taking hattie benson away towhere had margarets sister known it was to her death or had she imagined it would be simply a house where hattie could be kept until it was too late to testify it took hester the rest of the dayand more money than she could really spare in cab fares sandwiches cups of tea and petty bribesbefore she found as many of the answers as she was going to so long after the event two women answering the descriptions of hattie and gwen or celia had taken a hansom from near st bartholomews to avonhill street in fulham just short of chiswick almost half an hour after margaret had shown hattie out of the door of the clinic in portpool lane another hour of tedious questions and invented excuses and by the time it was growing dark hester had found the house where hattie had been for a few hours yeah the woman said grudgingly after hester questioned her she wiped her wet hands on her skirt wots it ter you then this is a respectable ouse an there aint no oring goes on ere it were a right lady as brought er ere an said as shed be stayin fer a few days but she didnt stay for a few days did she hester pressed she was gone in a matter of hours so she changed er mind she still were paid fer so why should i care who did she go with hester felt her throat tight her hands clammy said is name were cardew didnt see is face but real nicespoken e were hester thanked her and turned to leave stumbling against the doorpost but barely feeling the bruise to her hand that doesnt make sense monk said gently as they sat in front of the fire late that evening the clock nearing midnight hester was exhausted and still cold in spite of the warmth of the room why would margaret help rupert cardew in anything i dont know she said miserably maybe he lied to her she knew as soon as she had said it that it didnt make sense she looked up and saw it in monks eyes maybe hattie lied and she didnt steal the cravat at all perhaps rupert paid her to say she did then she lost her nerve and wasnt going to go through with it that explains why he would kill her if he killed parfitt in the first place he agreed but why would margaret take her to the door wouldnt margaret want to keep her there and have her take back her story perhaps hattie was afraid to do that maybe she just wanted to escape and say nothing at all monk nodded slowly thats possible she couldnt face youor meso she ran away as far as defending ballinger is concerned her failure to appear comes to much the same result her first story would be disbelieved so margaret helps her and then probably her sister gwen it sounds more like her than like celia hattie goes to a house where she believes shell be safe but rupert finds her anyway how perhaps shes been there before hester buried her head in her hands william what have we done chapter rathbone rode home in a hansom sometime after margaret had left the courtroom with her mother it had been another good day when winchester had first presented his case rathbone had feared that there would be no effective defense now he was more than hopeful he knew there was a real and very considerable likelihood that the jury would have a reasonable doubt as to ballingers guilt although the irony of it was that the picture that emerged of parfitt was so repellent that the jury would be reluctant to hang the man who had killed him in fact rathbone judged that several of them would want to shake the killers hand and turn a blind eye to the law and there was a level at which this entire trial was not so much about who had killed parfitt quickly and more mercifully than he deserved but about who had staked him used him and reaped the lions share of his profit rathbone had seen the anger in monks face that drove him to pursue the deeper levels of the affair and the guilt that his instinct had been too powerful to simply abandon the murder case in the beginning there must have been moments when he would gladly have marked it unsolved and shelved it now monk was going to fail anyway because no one would hang for the crimeeither the lesser crime of strangling parfitt or the greater crime of having created his opportunity in the first place and then fed him with money and skill until he became a monster he understood monk and wished that his failure were avoidable particularly that rathbone himself did not have to be such a powerful instrument in bringing it about but he had no choice the hansom pulled up outside his house it was dark and the streetlamps were shedding yellow light in the misty evening branches swayed the leaves drifting in the wind the air smelled of earth and rain the butler opened the door margaret was waiting for him in the withdrawing room she was standing in the middle of the floor as if she had heard him come and had risen to her feet she looked tired there were signs of strain in her face and she was definitely pale but her eyes were bright as soon as he had closed the door behind him she came to him quickly putting her arms around him and kissing him on the cheek and then the mouth then she pulled away quickly were going to win arent we i can see it in the jurors faces theyll acquit him she closed her eyes thank god for that he held her tightly were not there yet but yes i think theyll acquit she opened her eyes again they have to know that he didnt kill that wretched man not just that monk cant prove it it isnt monk margaret its yes it is she responded vehemently monk is the one who arrested him and brought the charge i know he doesnt run the prosecution in court because he isnt a lawyer but hes behind it and everyone knows that dont quibble you have to have them know it was somebody else probably rupert cardew they arent bringing that girl to say she stole his cravat are they no of course not they cant shes dead he watched her face afraid of what he would see in it im sorry to hear that she said quietly but im afraid prostitutes come to a bad end quite often and she lied i dont know why maybe he threatened her but it doesnt matter now you have to make sure the jury understands that she was killed almost certainly by rupert cardew thats a good thing for the case then theyll really know papa was innocent do you hear what you are saying margaret he asked pushing her a little farther from him looking into her face he saw the fear there tightly controlled the fierce protection the urgency there was no awareness at all that she had said anything to cast a shadow over her integrity that justice will be done and well be safe again she replied should he argue was there any point or would she only be angry and then push a further wedge between them he knew he should not say it and yet the words slipped out of his mouth dont you care that shes dead perhaps murdered of course im sorry im not heartless she retorted with a touch of anger but she had a life that was always going to end badly she shook her head theres nothing we can do about it we have to fight for complete justiceexoneration for papa and then perhaps monk will put it right by charging rupert cardew again he can cant he i mean theres no double jeopardy or anything like that because he didnt stand trial he might even have killed hattie as well then if you cant prove he killed mickey parfitt you could always hang him for killing her you said it as if you would like that he observed why was he provoking a quarrel pushing her away all she wanted was for her father to be free from all taint or suggestion of wrongdoing was that not natural wouldnt he do exactly the same if it were his father wouldnt lord cardew fight just as hard and as ruthlessly for rupert when that time came would he ask rathbone again to defend him would rathbone accept would monk even be in command of the river police anymore to pursue it or by then would it be some new man hester would not have found this loyalty so cut and dried she was far more complex more torn by conflicting passions and convictions and yet at this moment at least she was easier for him to understand she would weep for hattie she would not accept that it had been inevitable and she would weep for rupert cardew and his father what about for monk he was her own she would fight for him blindly without care for injury weariness even temporary defeat just as margaret fought for her father but would hester be sure that monk was right he thought not it would not lessen her love for him but she would consider the possibility that he had been mistaken even that the error had been moral as well as factual was that good or bad margaret was staring at him her eyes puzzled and angry if hes guilty then he deserves it she replied i dont like it but i accept it dont you i dont know i dont find the difference between right and wrong so simple he murdered parfitt and probably hattie as well and he was looking to see my father hang for it what is complicated about that there was challenge in her face a stiffness nothing anymore that he could reach out and touch proving it he said coolly but i will go to see your father tomorrow and ask how hard he wishes me to press the issue he has until monday morning to decide as it is now i think we have a good chance of reasonable doubt i could call him to testify and he can swear his innocence but that will allow winchester the opportunity to crossquestion him he may prefer not to do that it is his choice not yours or mine he put a finality into his voice closing the subject from any further discussion he sounded cold and he knew it but he felt cold inside as if a door had been shut and he did not know how to open it again in the morning he went to see arthur ballinger in newgate prison he had to wait some little time before at last ballinger was brought to see him in the gray light he looked tired and for the first time rathbone was acutely aware of how afraid he was pity twisted inside rathbone for margaret and he wished he had been gentler with her but he did not know now how to retrace his steps oliver ballinger said sharply why are you here i thought it was going well it is rathbone replied why did this man make him feel so uncomfortable he had spoken to scores of clients in circumstances like these both the guilty and the innocent he cleared his throat i need to know if you wish to testify yourself or not you dont need to make up your mind until monday morning but you must give it very serious consideration why wouldnt i because it will give winchester the opportunity to crossquestion you and i cant protect you from anything he says nor can i foresee what it might be dont underestimate him as it is i believe we have a very good chance of a verdict of not guilty because there is more than reasonable doubt doubt ballinger said unhappily reasonable doubt is the same as saying they believe i am guilty but they cant prove it i need not guilty oliver with certainty he took a breath i need them to believe that someone else killed that wretched creature they will say not guilty rathbone assured him and you cannot be charged again it is finished in court perhaps but not in the public mind there i am still ruined for gods sake man cant you see that ballinger controlled the panic rising in his voice with obvious difficulty saying that the case was inadequate is not enough he fixed rathbone with an intense gaze i need them to know that they had the wrong man oliver i need that there is another man out there that the police should be pursuing i imagine it is rupert cardew they must go after him as diligently as they did after me i dont give a damn if his father is a decent man that everyone admires or how sorry for him they might feel my family is decent too he hesitated for several seconds and rathbone was about to speak again when ballinger seemed to reach some decision and continued and you have no idea what good ive done that i dont boast about or seek reward for but that wont stay anyones hand or their tongues rathbone looked at him and felt profoundly sorry for him he was right the talk the suspicion would remain the belief that somehow he had escaped justice he would be saved from the punishment of the law but not of society are you sure you want to arthur he said gently this case is still very lightly balanced emotions are high dont ever mistake winchester for a fool because he occasionally makes people laugh he will go for your throat if he has the chance then i wont give him the chance ballinger said bitterly rupert cardew is a dissolute and violent young man and he should answer to the law like anyone else parfitt was a scab on the backside of humanity but hattie benson was simply an ignorant young woman who made her living in the only way she could imagine she had little alternative but the match factory or a sweatshop somewhere whoever killed her should hang for it and i can see that in the jurors faces even if you cant rathbone knew that he was right but he was still afraid of the risk it seemed brutal to warn ballinger but it would be a betrayal of rathbones duty not to you would be safer to leave it as it is he said gently i have to tell you that the risk is considerable what does considerable mean ballinger said sharply the balance is with us now but not heavily that could alter they could hear something the mood could change on an attitude an answer they dont understand a witness saying something ill take that chance i will not leave that courtroom with the world believing i am guilty but i escaped because i had a good lawyer there is a chance you could be found guilty rathbone said it and the words all but choked him sometimes it depends on a thing as trivial as a like or dislike its skill and chance as well as justice for heavens sake arthur you know that are you advising me against trying to clear myself rathbone hesitated he was not sure if it were he and he knew himself innocent the practicality of not seeking more than to escape the noose might not be enough for him he might believe more deeply than at an intellectual level that truth would prevail would he insist on fighting or would he be cautious careful willing to settle for the lesser prize perhaps he would monk would not hester wouldnt even consider it she would always fight for the best the ultimatewin lose or drawhe had no doubt of it but was she wise more to the point would she do that when giving medical treatment to someone unable to make their own decision lacking the strength or the knowledge and depending upon her no he knew the answer without even considering she would not take the risk with someone elses life but she would cut off a gangrened limb rather than let the patients whole body become infected and die oliver ballinger said sharply i think you should find another way of clearing yourself perhaps do all you can to help monk or anyone else to prove who it was and bring them to trial it will be slower but no ballinger said firmly i will do it now i wont subject my family to this horror any longer and for gods sake you cant expect me to leave my fate in the hands of william monk but are you refusing to take my instructions oliver no i am advising you but in the end i will do as you wish he felt like a coward saying it as if in some oblique way he had betrayed ballinger but he had no choice they spoke only a little longer and he left outside a fine rain soaked him thoroughly before he was able to get a hansom and it perfectly suited his mood he was unable to let the matter go he went straight to portpool lane to the clinic on the chance thatin spite of the fact that it was saturdayhester might be there he might learn more about exactly what had happened to hattie benson he felt guilty as he walked in through the familiar shabby entrance one of the girls who had seen him before greeted him cheerfully he was guilty because he wished to see hester even if she was abrasive unsympathetic or told him things he would prefer not to know there was something clean even astringent about her beliefs he could not remember a time in all their friendship when she had tried to manipulate him heaven knows there had been some uncomfortable times some quarrels many differences of opinion he had thought her outrageous and he had said so she had thought him pompous and had said that too but they had been honest not only in word but in intent just at the moment he would welcome that he realized as he spoke to squeaky robinsonwho lived here and so was always aroundthat he also felt a different guilt this one was edged with acute discomfort he was afraid of what he might learn here upstairs squeaky said pointing a finger over his shoulder cant leave it alone should be at home that one but the boys off with monk boating or some such thank you rathbone said quickly and walked on past him before he could be ensnared in conversation he went up the stairs two at a time in spite of their narrowness he knew every turn and creak every unevenness and did not miss his step he found hester making beds in one of the larger rooms which was unoccupied she heard the creak of the door as he pushed it wider and turned to see him surprise widening her eyes oliver she dropped the sheet and it fell on the bed in white folds and he smelled the pleasant cleanliness of fresh cotton is something wrong she looked at him more closely what is it there was no point in trying to approach it obliquely with her of all people i need to know more about how hattie benson left here and anything else you can tell me about her she studied his face why that was the one response he had not foreseen what do you mean why she was going to testify then she left here and was found later that day floating in the river she was unquestionably murdered and almost as certainly by whoever murdered parfitt you know all this if i knew who killed her oliver i would say so whoever it was she replied i have the confidences of no one and no loyalties other than to pursue the truth i had a duty to protect her and i failed i have no duty to protect whoever killed her you might have she did not fill in the rest of the thought it was unnecessary it made him hesitate for a moment i i believe the only way i can best serve my client is by knowing as much of the truth as i can he said slowly you may find it hard to believe it was rupert cardew who killed her but if it wasand it is possibleit would not only gain an acquittal for arthur ballinger but it would restore his reputation without which he is ruined he hesitated again seeking a way of saying what he had to more gently there was none and i appreciate that an acquittal for ballinger means that monk was wrong and you cannot separate your emotions from that i wouldnt ask you to its loyalties again she said with a twist of irony in her smile yours is to ballinger because he is margarets father mine is against him because that would make william wrong but its hardly the same depth of importance is it it was not a question so much as a reproof do you think i would see an innocent man hanged rather than have my husband shown up in a mistake what would that make me or him nor would i see a guilty man go free because he is my fatherinlaw he responded he is your client she corrected him that binds you to give him the best defense you can unless you actually know that he is guilty then you would have a problem with which i could not help you but you dont know that or you wouldnt be here asking me about hattie dont chop logic with me hester he pleaded you dont know who is guilty either or you would have told monk and it would be all finished except for the sentencing a sudden deep compassion filled her face he did not immediately understand it then he realized what his own words had beenall finished except for the sentencing not except for the trial some part of him feared that ballinger was guilty and she had seen that i have to know hester he said his throat dry he wants to testify i need to know what to prepare for cant you understand that oh there was a finality in her voice an intensity of emotion that made him suddenly afraid what is it he said you know how she went you would have insisted on finding out tell me her face was pale her eyes terribly blazingly direct he knew that whatever the truth was it was going to hurt one of them the only question was which one and how much margaret took her to the door hester said quietly there she met another woman who was well spoken and wore ordinary clothes at least an ordinary shawl but had excellentquality and most unusual leather gloves handtooled with a little design above the wrist rathbone felt as if he had been punched the shock left him without breath it cant be he said after a moment regaining his voice you must be wrong who said margaret took her to the door someone is lying it was margaret herself oliver she doesnt deny it she was afraid rupert cardew had paid hattie to lie for him and she wanted to prevent her from doing that he shook his head refusing to believe it but hattie was strangled and put in the river he was almost shouting you cant imagine that margaret had any hand in that it isnt possible hester touched him just gently a hand on his arm he could feel the slight warmth of her through the fabric of his jacket of course i dont think she had any willing or knowing part in it she agreed she took hattie to the door and persuaded her to leave someone else met her there i would guess it was gwen but i cant be certain that second woman took her to a house in avonhill street in fulham less than a mile from chiswick somewhere she would be safe he said quickly she must have left it herself and run into one of parfitts men margaret couldnt know that would happen of course not hester agreed but there was no light in her face no relief from the sadness and the landlady said a man was with her he called himself cardew and you werent going to tell me he said incredulously you just said you have no duty of loyalty to anyone only to the truth that was definitely an accusation it was hard to believe hester of all people to be such a hypocrite and she hadnt had to tell him of her loyalties she had just proved where they lay by keeping the information about cardew quiet he felt more deeply betrayed than he had thought possible he realized with a jolt of surprise how profoundly he had still cared for hester perhaps idealized her it brought a sting to his eyes and his throat too much that he loved was melting under his hand and slipping away do you really believe that margaret and gwen were working in cooperation with rupert cardew to murder the one witness who could have saved him and thus condemned their father she asked no of course not they he stopped yes they what she waited perhaps she wasnt going to save him he replied maybe cardew paid her to lie and she wouldnt go through with it he realized that and thats why he killed her with margarets help hesters eyebrows rose in disbelief but there was no triumph in her face and gwens can you imagine what winchester will make of that idea on the stand she was right it was unbelievable did you really want to know that oliver her voice broke into his nightmare if you did then i apologize for not telling you i made a wrong judgment and im sorry i know that you have to act honestly i thought it would be impossible for you if you knew that he felt dizzy as though the room were whirling around him she was rightof course she was right but he did know now the terrible thing was that he could believe it he remembered margarets face as she looked at her father she obeyed him without thought without judgment he was part of the life she had always known the fabric of her beliefs the order in everything that was natural perhaps henry rathbone was the cornerstone of rathbones own life he could not think of any values any thought or idea that they had not shared with each other over the years their trust was so deep it had never needed expressing it was as sure as sunrise it was the safety that reassured all other doubts so he never feared an endless fall oliver he heard her voice but it was a moment before he could recall himself to the present the small room in the clinic the bed with the clean sheet on it and hester looking at him what are you going to do she asked anxiously i dont know i really dont know i suppose you are certain of all this yes her voice was gentle margaret told me herself when i faced her with it she didnt evade it she didnt say it was gwen though that i deduced by going out and asking people in the streets i found a peddler who saw hattie with another woman and described her i found the hansom they took to fulham right to the house i took the same cab to the same house and spoke to the woman who owns it there might be one chance in a hundred that im wrong it was another woman who looked just like hattie at the same time on the same day and another mr cardew rented the place for her and our hattie turned up dead later that day in the river just a mile away one chance in a hundred he said bitterly perhaps in a million im sorry did this landlady see cardews face it was a desperate last throw rathbone knew how he sounded even asking no he stood well back in the shadows and he had a heavy coat on and a hat he could have been anyone he could think of nothing to say nothing that eased the increasing pain inside him thank you i hester shook her head i know winchester wont call me and you shouldnt i cant testify to anything firsthand do whatever you feel is the right thing the right thing the words escaped with a wild bitterness for gods sake what is that do you believe ballinger is guilty she asked i dont know i honestly dont know i suppose i fear it it will be a kind of hell if he is he meant it he was not exaggerating the horror he saw in his own imagination she looked at him steadily would you have rupert cardew hanged to save him because he is your family and rupert isnt if you would oliver then what is the law worth what if lord cardew felt the same way and would have anyone else hanged guilty or innocent as long as his own son didnt have to face himself and his deeds would you accept that is that really what you believeone law for your family another for anyone else what about loyalty what about love he asked what have you left to give if you have already given away yourself hester im sorry i dont always like it but i cant believe anything different it doesnt mean you stop loving if you could care only for those who are good all the time we would none of us be loved im sorry he nodded then he touched her hand briefly and turned to go he reached home at lunchtime margaret was waiting for him where have you been she asked her voice sharpedged you didnt say you were going out i left before you were up he found himself defensive i went to see your father he wants to take the stand i think he shouldnt but i couldnt persuade him why shouldnt he take the stand she demanded she was wearing pale blue her hair pulled back a little severely and she looked angry he must defend himself the jury has to hear him deny all the charges and explain that he is a solicitor he acts on behalf of all sorts of people even men like parfitt are entitled to legal advice and to a defense if they are wrongly accused they are entitled to it even if they are rightly accused he pointed out dont quibble she snapped why dont you wish him to testify you havent explained that to the juryi dont know why not because i dont want to say it more than once he replied tartly it sounds like an excuse if i push it too hard like protesting too much i am keeping it for my final address to them well papa should still testify hell look guilty if he doesnt youve said that often to me it seems to them like running away if they hear him see him theyll know what kind of a man he is and that the whole charge is ridiculous its monk trying to make a name for himself he probably knows hes wrong by now but he darent back out of it or hell look a fool rathbone felt as if a nightmare were tightening its coils around him margaret did you go to hattie benson in the clinic take her to the street door and persuade her to leave there were two spots of color in margarets face she lifted her chin a little higher she was going to lie about rupert cardew and hester would have seen that she went through with it if you think i could allow my father to be hanged for something he didnt do then you have no idea of either love or loyalty love doesnt mean betraying what you believe in margaret and no one who truly loved you would ask it he replied his voice trembling she closed her eyes you pompous fool she said between her teeth love means caring passionately it means sacrificing yourself for another person because they are more important to you than your career or your ambition or the way other people admire you or your money or even your own life her voice was shaking but you wouldnt understand that you like you want perhaps at times you can need but you dont love youre a cold pious selfrighteous man you dont want a wife you want someone to hold on your arm at parties and organize your household for you rathbone felt as if she had struck him he tried to think clearly find the reason the balance but all that filled his mind was crippling emotion hesters words rang in his ears but he knew even trying to repeat them to margaret would be useless and they would sound like hester which would make matters even worse he should leave now before he said something that he could never take back but as he stood on the outside step again he was at a loss to know of anything that could have made it worse he took a hansom and rode in it all the way to primrose hill not even considering the possibility that his father might be out only as the cab set him down on the pavement and he fished in his pocket for the money to pay the driver did he think of it it was a mild saturday afternoon why should henry rathbone be at home when there were a hundred other things to do friends to visit wait a moment he told the cabby he may be out ill be right back to tell you he turned and strode up the path now in a hurry as if every second counted he banged on the door and thirty seconds later banged again there was no answer his heart sank with a ridiculous overwhelming disappointment he was angry with himself for behaving like a child he stepped back and the door opened henry rathbone looked grubby and disheveled a gardening fork in his hand he was taller than oliver lean and just a trifle stooped his gray hair was sparse and windblown his blue eyes mild you look terrible he observed looking oliver up and down youd better come in but pay the cabby first oliver had already forgotten the cab he strode back paid the man and thanked him then went back to the door and into the house wheres whatshisname he asked he could never remember his fathers manservants name saturday afternoon henry rathbone replied poor man has to have some time to himself hes got a grandson somewhere go and put the kettle on the cooktop while i wash my hands and put my tools away then you can tell me whats happened i presume it is something to do with your fatherinlaws case quarter of london is talking about it he rarely exaggerated oliver obeyed ten minutes later they were sitting in the large old armchairs on either side of the fire in the familiar sitting room with its watercolors on the wall and its shelves upon shelves of books the tea was poured but still too hot to drink although its steamy fragrance filled the air there were also several slices of fruitcake on a plate it was rich and inviting even if oliver had thought he might never feel hungry again what is your dilemma henry asked i dont know that i have one oliver replied i can see only one acceptable choice but i hate it i suppose he stopped uncertain what it was he wanted to say henry took one of the slices of cake and began to eat it waiting oliver started to sip his tea trying not to scald himself several minutes passed in silence comfortable but still needing to be filled with words to frame the burden you are required to do something repugnant to you henry said at last if you are certain ballinger is innocent then probably you need to show some evidence that someone else is guilty rupert cardew is it lord cardew you are so loath to see suffer i cant do that oliver replied the evidence is flawed very badly flawed winchester would demolish it and leave ballinger looking even worse and you are afraid that ballinger is guilty if not of killing parfitt then at least of something presumably of financing this boator worse of using parfitt for the blackmail there it was simple and astonishingly painful the truth in his fathers mild exact voice oliver had no need to answerit must have been clear in his face nevertheless he did so they had always been frank with each other his father had never asked for trust or said how much he caredat least not that oliver could rememberbut it would have been totally unnecessary even absurd a stating of something as obvious as breathing yes worse than that im afraid that hester is right and he killed the girl who would have testified that she stole rupert cardews cravat and gave it to one of the men who worked for parfitt or even to ballinger himself henry straightened up a little in his chair his face even graver you havent told me about this i think perhaps you had better do so now quietly with simple words oliver told him all he knew including his conversation with hester that morning his quarrel with margaret was still too painful and he brushed over it more by implication than detail i see henry said at last im afraid you are in for a great deal of distress i wish i could remove it for you but i cant there is no honorable way except forward and eventually anything else would hurt even more im sorry the pain in his face the sharp note of helplessness in his voice made further expression redundant it was growing late and outside the light was failing at this time of the year sunset came early and the long twilight slowly drained the color from the land the wind was gusty and warm sending the yellow leaves flying henry stood up lets walk a little he suggested there are still some good apples left on the trees i really should have picked them by now oliver followed him and they went out of the french doors onto the grass and down the garden the hedge was full of bright berries scarlet hips from the dog roses darker bloodred haws from the may blossom there was a rich sweet smell of rotting leaves and damp earth and the sharper tingling aroma of wood smoke a few purple asters were in bloom shaggy and vivid and the tawny bronze and gold chrysanthemums beyond the poplars in the distance a cloud of starlings swirled up into the darkening sky making for home the scene was all so familiar so deep in his heart and mind that it was woven through every memory and dream he could imagine it would be absurdembarrassing evento say so but his love for his father was so intense he could not bear to think of life without his friendship would he place his fathers safety his happiness before margarets he did not really have to ask himself he knew the answer before the question formed yes he would to betray him would be unbearable but at the same moment he also knew that henry rathbone would never do the things that arthur ballinger had he made mistakes had flaws in his character of course he did everyone did oliver did not wish to think of them but he knew they were there he could have named them if forced to but he also knew that henry would never have asked someone else to pay the price or take the blame for him perhaps margaret believed the same of ballinger were her memories just as deep as woven into her own life her beliefs was he being unfair to her but his withdrawal from her had nothing to do with ambition or even with love it had to do with rathbones own identity she was asking him to destroy himself but if he did that there would be nothing left for either of them what she was asking of him was not a case of personal sacrifice that might have been a more difficult decision it was an issue of doing something he believedno something he knewto be wrong he looked up at the sky as the starlings wheeled back again into the wind still flying as if to some understood pattern all going home to roost for the night henry seemed to know he had reached a conclusion he did not raise the subject again they turned and walked together back through the apple trees toward the house at home rathbone and margaret passed the weekend in bitter silence the politeness between them was like walking on broken glass at dawn on monday morning rathbone went again to see arthur ballinger to try to persuade him not to testify as it was he had a good chance of acquittal he could prove his actual innocence later if someone else were charged but ballinger was obdurate he would not leave the courtroom with this accusation still hanging over his existence crippling his life shadowing and tainting the lives of his family even the possibility of a guilty verdict did not deter him he simply did not believe it could happen was that supreme hubris or was he actually innocent and rathbone had badly misjudged him he entered the courtroom still uncertain as soon as he called ballinger to the stand there was a rustle of excitement a movement a stiffening of attention ballinger mounted the witness stand he looked pale but composed as grave as an accused man should and with appropriate humility he was clearly taking all the advice that rathbone had given him he looked the model of a good man unjustly afflicted by circumstance nevertheless rathbone was as nervous as if he were on trial himself his mouth was dry and his muscles ached with the builtup tension of going over and over every possibility in his mind he was afraid his voice was going to betray him by cracking he did not even glance at margaret who was sitting with her mother and sisters in the gallery he could not bear to see the coldness in her face nor to wonder where their lives were going after this whatever the outcome he dared not fail ballinger was sworn in and faced rathbone expectantly mr ballinger rathbone began he cleared his throat he was unaccustomed to being so nervous did you know mickey parfitt i met him once several years ago very briefly ballinger replied i dont remember him i know only because of the transaction concerned indeed and what was that mr ballinger rathbone knew that he had to draw this out now because it was a matter of record and if he did not then winchester would make more of it it was the sale to mr parfitt of a boat by a client i represented ballinger replied levelly was this boat the same one we have heard about used for pornographic performances and the imprisonment of children rathbone kept all expression from his face i dont know i only advised my client in the sale of the boat and was this client whom you represented mr jericho phillips the same jericho phillips you later represented when he was tried for murder earlier this year there was a rustle of movement a sigh of indrawn breath around the gallery the jury sat motionless faces pale it was ballinger answered quietly i believe that every man is entitled to the protection of the law and a fair and just trial so do we all mr ballinger rathbone nodded gravely that is why we are here neither of them even glanced at the jury they could have been alone in rathbones office have you ever visited this boat mr ballinger he continued once at the time of its sale it looked a very ordinary sort of craft i was merely assuring myself that it was described correctly in the papers concerning it which it was did you ask mr parfitt how he intended to use it no it was none of my business a slight flicker crossed ballingers face but if indeed he used it as has been described it is hardly likely that he would have told me quite rathbone allowed himself the ghost of a smile were you to your knowledge acquainted with any of the men who frequented either boat after they were turned to the use of pornography certainly not but of course men who practice this kind of behavior do not tell people other than those who share their vices from what i have heard during this trial it seems they indulge in them together therefore they would know each other quite rathbone found that the fullness of ballingers answer made him uneasy he had advised ballinger to be extremely careful to say only yes and no but ballinger was either too nervous to obey or too sure of himself to heed advice rathbone should leave that subject mr ballinger where were you on the evening that mickey parfitt was killed ballinger carefully repeated the exact story he had told before and which had been borne out by the witnesses rathbone smiled inspector monk has testified that he followed your route to the minute and discovered that he could find a small craft and row down to parfitts boat at its moorings spend the time on board that it would take to kill parfitt and then row back to mortlake again he took a cab back to the crossing opposite chiswick eyot and still was there at the time you said you were did you do that ballinger smiled back mr monk is the best part of a generation younger than i am and leads a very physical life he is a river policeman he probably rows a boat every day i wish i were as young and as fit as he is but unquestionably i am afraid i am not i did not do it nor had any desire to but even had i wished it would have been beyond my ability you did not i did not it is my misfortune that i happened to spend that particular evening visiting an old friend in mortlake instead of at home with my wife or out to dine in a public place it is my additional misfortune that inspector monk has never forgiven me for acting for jericho phillips insofar as i obtained your services to defend him when he faced trial monk appears not to believe that a man accused of evil acts is not guilty until he is proved so in law and he is entitled to a lawyer to defend him of as high a quality as the one who accuses him it is the very foundation of justice there was a murmur of approval from the gallery ballinger eased a little where he stood in the witness box and met rathbones eyes across the distance between them rathbone felt a sense of warmth himself as if he had achieved what duty required of him thank you mr ballinger please wait there in case mr winchester has any questions to ask you he returned to his seat winchester stood up and walked forward oh i have i most certainly have he looked up at ballinger rathbone had been very careful hattie bensons name had not even been mentioned winchester was bluffing putting off the acknowledgment of defeat lengthening out the tension a most moving testimony mr ballinger winchester observed and interesting i notice that sir oliver very wisely did not ask you if you were acquainted with the prostitute hattie benson who was so sadly murdered in the exact manner that mickey parfitt was even to the use of the knotted rag to strangle her leaving bruises at intervals around her throat because he knows that i have no knowledge of it ballinger replied levelly i may speculate of course as we all may because we know with whom she was involved by his own admission ah yes winchester nodded mr rupert cardew but of course since she is dead her testimony remains unspoken it might have remained unspoken even if she were alive ballinger pointed out it is possible she repented of it and told him that she could not go through with it rathbones sense of ease was slipping away from him he rose to his feet my lord this is a piece of speculation that has no place here we cannot know what miss benson would have said nor can we question her to prove its truth or otherwise if my learned friend has something to ask mr ballinger please instruct him to do so otherwise he is wasting the courts time the judge leaned forward but before he could speak winchester apologized im sorry my lord i shall proceed mr ballinger you said that you had no direct knowledge of the trade that was carried on by mr parfitt in the boat you helped him purchase thats right none at all ballinger replied coolly and to the best of your knowledge you were not acquainted with any of the men who patronized it and indulged in these acts and as a result were blackmailed rathbone stood up again my lord mr winchester is merely repeating evidence we have already been through the judge sighed mr winchester is there some point to all of this yes my lord i intend to call mr ballingers honesty into very grave doubtin particular with regard to this last issue to what purpose rathbone demanded he has said that he does not know any of these men as far as he is aware none of us knows what weaknesses or vices people may have and thank god for the most part it is none of our business they may be men you know or any of us knows he spread his arms in a wide gesture to include the whole room the jurors the gallery even the judge and since the court does not know who they are this is futile sir oliver is right the judge agreed move on mr winchester if you have anything else upon which to crossexamine mr ballinger otherwise let us put the matter to the jury but we do know who these men are my lord winchester said clearly at least i do suddenly there was total silence in the room no one stirred no one even coughed i beg your pardon the judge said at last i know who they are winchester repeated rathbone felt the sweat break out on his skin and a prickle of fear sharp inside him although he did not even know why he stared at winchester were you aware of this sir oliver the judge asked no my lord i would question its veracity and why mr winchester has not referred to it before i came by it only this weekend my lord winchester replied to the judge from whom the judge demanded rathbone knew the answer the moment before it was spoken from mr rupert cardew my lord winchester said in the interests of justice he provided it rathbone lurched to his feet how can that possibly be in the interests of justice he demanded it has nothing to do with the case except possibly to prove that there were a large number of men who may well have had motive to wish parfitt dead and who is to say that this list is accurate it could be the complete fabrication of a man who has an intense interest in seeing mr ballinger convicted in order to remove all suspicion from himself he will testify to the names if necessary winchester replied and with diligence it should be possible to prove that all of them have visited the boat at some time or other most of them fairly regularly a long and tedious job rathbone rejoined and irrelevant to this case my lord not irrelevant my lord winchester said i mention it to throw extreme doubt on mr ballingers innocence in this matter sir oliver paved the way for me in his own examination by asking the witness about his knowledge of the boat and mr ballinger replied that he did not know its business nor was he aware of knowing any of the men who patronized it i have the list of names my lord i regret to say that i myself am acquainted with two of them the judge was rapidly losing patience mr winchester you appear to be behaving in the worst possible taste titillating the most vulgar aspect of public curiosity in a matter that is repellent and does not further your case in the least my lord every one of the men on this list is personally acquainted with mr ballinger every one of them without exception why would he lie about it to this court under oath if it were not something he wished toindeed needed toconceal there was a gasp a rustle of movement right around the room then a terrible stillness rathbone felt his muscles clench like a vise he would like to have believed that it was rupert cardew making a desperate move to save himself from the suspicion that would inevitably follow ballingers acquittal he turned and looked at the gallery and saw rupert immediately ashenfaced and perfectly steady this would ruin him society would never forgive him for betraying the names of those who had soiled the honor most of them aspired to but had not the courage to defend winchester broke the silence i will call mr cardew to the stand to name them should anyone doubt him sir oliver can naturally question him on the issue and require him to prove what he says but i shall not do it unless your lordship insists this knowledge would ruin many families and call into question legal decisions possibly even acts of parliament the possibilities for blackmail are so momentous that the damage would affect he stopped leaving their imaginations to fill in the rest sir oliver the judge said a little huskily it was defeat and rathbone knew it he would not bring down the whole order of society to save ballinger even would such a thing have done so and it would not he could see in the jurys faces that the balance had tipped irrevocably against him they knew ballinger had lied possibly about everything and strangely enough even if rupert had turned on his own social class for which he would never be forgiven the jury believed him possibly even admired him he had chosen the honorable thing to do at a terrible price to himself i i have nothing to add my lord rathbone answered only as he sat down again did he even consider that perhaps he should have demanded that the names be made public then in the instant afterward he knew he should not winchester had them if there was anything to be done he would do it he would investigate examine and if necessary prosecute any corruption it did not occur to rathbone even as a fleeting thought that winchester was bluffing cardews face and ballingers denied that he made a desperate final summation but he knew he could not succeed the tide was against him and he had no more strength to turn it the jury was out for an hour which seemed like eternity when they came back their faces told the verdict even before they were asked guilty simple final rathbone was in a daze as the black cap was brought to the judge he put it on his head and pronounced sentence of death mrs ballinger cried out in horror margaret slipped to the ground in a faint without thinking rathbone scrambled from his seat and went to her just as she was stirring gwen was with her holding her celia and george were trying to support mrs ballinger margaret margaret rathbone said urgently margaret he wanted to say something anything to comfort her but there were only empty promises things that were meaningless she stirred and opened her eyes looking at him with utter loathing then she turned her face away toward gwen he had never felt so completely alone he rose to his feet trembling and walked back to his table the court was in an uproar but he neither saw nor heard it chapter when a person was sentenced to hang it was the law that three sundays should pass before the execution was carried out it was both the longest and the shortest period of time in the sentenced persons experience unquestionably it was the most painful toward the end of the first week rathbone was alone in his room in chambers when his clerk entered and told him that hester wished to speak with him at first rathbone was not sure if he wanted to see her pity would only add to his hurt especially from her and there was nothing she could say that would help there was no help and yet he had never had a better friend except for his father i have a few minutes he told the clerk come back after about ten minutes and say there is a client wishing to speak with me yes sir the clerk withdrew and a moment later hester came in she looked calm and composed but still very pale she was dressed in the same bluegray she often wore and it still suited her just as well rathbone stood up what can i do for you he asked quietly she sat down in the chair opposite the desk as if she meant to remain he sat also not to would have been discourteous probably nothing she said with a tiny smile i wanted to know if there was anything i could do to help you william told me there was nothing and that you might even prefer not to see me i would understand that but i would rather come and be asked to leave than not come and then afterward learn that there was something i could have done or said how like you he replied always do never hesitate and never abdicate a shadow crossed her face a moment of hurt that was a compliment he said wryly i have spent too much of my life weighing and judging and in the end doing nothing not this time she answered there was nothing more you could have done if rupert hadnt come forward you would have won im not sure that would have been a good thing even for margaret not in the end it would have been a bad thing for monk he said frankly everyone would have said he had made a second mistake gone after the wrong man because he had a personal vendetta against ballinger over the phillips affair he might even have lost his job im glad that didnt happen surprisingly he meant that he had not thought he would the void inside himself was too big to allow much thought for anyone else hester gave a slight shrug thats true and i thank you for it but its past now what about you i doubt ill lose any clients over it no one wins every case for heavens sake i know that she said impulsively most people know perfectly well you only took the case because he was family and you had no choice no one else would have managed a defense at all and you nearly won he looked at her steadily did monk persuade rupert cardew to speak no she did not evade his gaze i did not for williamat least not only for him it was for scuff and all the boys like him that wont put an end to the trade hester the moment the words were out of his mouth he regretted saying them i know she conceded softly but it will stop some of it maybe quite a lot at least for a while people will know that were prepared to fight and those who get caught will pay for it above all scuff will know for a moment he could not speak his throat was so tight so choked and aching she put out her hand across the desk she did not touch him but she left it where if he moved even a few inches he could reach her im sorry oliver i really am sorry i know she said nothing more for several moments there was a knock on the door come rathbone answered the clerk came in sir oliver ah yes rathbone said quickly please bring some tea and a few cookies if you can find some yes sir the clerk withdrew obediently his face calm with understanding perhaps even a touch of relief hester smiled thank you id like tea he had asked for tea without thinking but now he realized how much he wanted her to stay he did not know how to begin but the confusion inside him was an almost overwhelming pain in a matter of months all the certainties he had begun to take for granted had gone how is margaret she said quietly i thought of going to see her even though i have no idea what to say sometimes just being there is worth something but i dont think she would receive me we parted on bad terms she wouldnt he agreed she blames you at least in part she blames everyone except her father most of all she blames me he knew there was bitterness in his voice but he could not control it his anger and pain came welling up and it was a relief to let it flow she is convinced ballinger is innocent and that its all a monstrous conspiracy of vengeance cowardice misplaced loyalty and error and on my part professional ambition over love of family he needed hester to deny it to tell him he was right and that it was not true she looked stricken im sorry her voice was so low he could barely hear her there was nothing else i could do he protested i know that she answered quickly but disillusion is one of the worst pains we experience nobody can let go of their dreams without tearing themselves apart too its like killing pieces of yourself shed blame everybody who sees what she cant bear to see because we wont let her pretend anymore whether we mean to or not we are the ones forcing reality on her what good would it do if i were to lie to her he protested any hope now would be false hope of what she asked that he is innocent or of saving him from the gallows he shrugged helplessly i dont know of saving him i suppose i dont think she has even faced the possibility that he is guilty of any of it not of parfitts murder certainly not of hatties and not of blackmailing the wretched men who used the boat if she believed any of it i imagine the rest would have to follow i dont know what to do even what to say shes treating me as if it were my fault hester shook her head fractionally thats because youre the only one who isnt to blame and youre the one who wont support her illusions i cant he said desperately lying is no good now it wont stop it from happening it doesnt affect the truth or that everyone else can see it sooner or later shes going to have to face the fact that her fathers guiltynot just of corrupting other people finding and feeding on their weaknesses but of blackmailing them for exactly what he has helped them to do he profited from the torture and humiliation of children and he murdered parfitt i still dont know why that seems to have been a pointless piece of violence and completely unnecessary and he murdered hattie benson because she would have testified that it wasnt rupert cardew the only other obvious suspect he took a shaky breath and went on if margaret doesnt even acknowledge that then shes going to spend her whole life angry and bitter because her father was unjustly hanged thats a kind of terrible madness it will destroy her hester put out her hand and touched him very gently give her time oliver some things we cant face immediately as long as he protests his innocence she cant turn her back on him whatever the evidence could you if it were your father my father would he stopped what he had been going to say only supported hesters point his father would never do such a thing no he wouldnt but then perhaps margaret believed just as passionately in her father regardless of evidence hester was right she would not be released from it until ballinger admitted his guilt perhaps she couldnt be without betraying herself and the guilt for that would destroy her also how terribly wide the damage spread hester smiled i know i love your father and i dont believe he would ever even think of anything like this but then margaret would feel the same sometimes we only know one side of a person we love so intensely he could think of nothing to say parents especially are part of who we are she went on she looked down away from meeting his eyes i still cant tell myself that my father failed because he took his own life i wonder if i fight so hard over the things i believe in to prove im not like that i dont give in she looked up again and her eyes were full of tears i identify with the soldiers i nursed in the crimea and delude myself im like them because i saw how they suffered and i loved their courage so much rathbone realized that he too was suffering a disillusion not in ballinger because he had never cared for him but in margaret herself perhaps he had expected her to be more like hestermore able to face the unbearable more foolishly passionately brave and yet it was those very qualities in hester that had frightened him and had made her such an unsuitable wife for him he had wanted hesters virtues but without the danger he loved margaret but not with the reckless fervor that counts no risk and no price too high was he disillusioned in her or in himself she wants me to mount an appeal he said remembering the scene vividly although it had been a couple of days ago they had been standing in the withdrawing room the dusk heavy outside the gas lamps burning but the curtains still open onto the garden she was dressed in dark gray as if ready for mourning and her face was colorless she was so angry she trembled are you hester asked interrupting his thoughts do you have any grounds did winchester make some mistake no he said simply she swallowed and cleared her throat did you not so far as i know tactical perhaps maybe if i had tried harder i could have persuaded him not to take the stand himself but he was adamant i dont think you can refuse to let a man speak in his own defense if you have warned him of the danger and he still insists but perhaps i should have thought of something you cant go on retrying a case every different way until you get the verdict you want she pointed out he looked down at the desktop he knew he shouldnt say what he was going to and yet the words spilled out margaret says i should have built in some error so that i could have appealed afterward she believes i have put my own career before her fathers life because i am ambitious and essentially selfish he met her eyes is that true if i really loved her more than i loved myself would i have have you ever made a deliberate mistake she asked as if turning the thought over in her mind no he smiled bitterly not deliberate many accidental would an appeal court know the difference possibly she granted but unless you were totally incompetent it wouldnt make them grant a new trial would it anyway what good would a new trial do theyd only come to the same decision except that someone else would be representing ballinger probably less well and certainly with less dedication it isnt reasonable oliver dont try arguing with her you wont win because she isnt listening she is terrified everything she is and believes is slipping out of her grasp im still here he said simply she just doesnt want me ive done everything i can to save ballinger i failed but i think i failed because hes guilty shell realize that in time he knew in that moment with an overwhelming grief that he was not sure he would ever see margaret with the same tenderness and trust even if eventually she did accept the truth she has made it a condition he said aloud a condition for what hester looked puzzled if i do not manage to appeal for her father margaret will leave me go back to comfort and care for her mother now that hed said it it was real not just a nightmare hovering around him like a covering darkness and yet the house was unbearable they walked around each other icily polite he came to bed late she was either asleep or pretending to be he did not speak it was over a week since they had touched each other even in the smallest gesture it was infinitely worse than being alone hester was looking at him her face a little pinched with anxiety and if you could manage to think of some way of bringing about an appeal which you would still lose because the evidence is the same then she would forgive you she asked he started to answer and then realized that he did not know she is grieving oliver hester answered her own question she is in too much pain and confusion to listen to reason she wants a way out of the truth at least part of her knows she will have to accept it one day but now she cant face it she wants you to rescue her from it and she blames you because you cant shes not a child he said with a flare of his own confusion and loss the truth of it is that she has to choose between her father and me and she chooses him guilty or not saying it was like cutting his own flesh you wouldnt have done that you would always choose monk i dont know what i would choose she said honestly i havent had to theres part of all of us that chooses the most vulnerable the one who needs us most because we cant live with the guilt of turning our backs on them are you thinking of scuff i dont think so he would never expect me to sacrifice anything for him im not sure he would even understand the idea although he would do it himself without thinking thats what margaret wants from me loyalty without thinking if you love someone you do not ask them to destroy the best in themselves she answered love also means the freedom to follow your own conscience if you cant be true to yourself you dont have much left to give anyone else again she touched his arm through the cloth of his jacket dont give in to temptation because it would be more comfortable for you in the short term she needs you to be the best in yourself in time she will be glad of it do you think so rathbone was asking for the answer he wanted to hear i hope so was all she could say he looked at her steadily thinking that she possessed a kind of beauty he had not really appreciated before her face was too angular but there was an intense gentleness in it he saw only now she was awkward at times too quick far too clever her honesty was sometimes painful to receive but there was a generosity of spirit he needed and always always there was courage she blushed very slightly and stood up give her time she said again and perhaps it would be better not to tell her i called she hesitated then decided not to add any more she passed close to him on her way out but only smiled briefly as she reached the door thank you for the tea and she was gone and the silence washed in again surrounding him with loneliness the following morning the message came from newgate prison that arthur ballinger wanted to see him urgently rathbone had no choice but to go he was dutybound as ballingers lawyer apart from the fact that ballinger was margarets father and a man condemned in a matter of days to be hanged less than two weeks were left rathbone could not even imagine how that would feel he dreaded finding the previously bluff and rather arrogant ballinger now a pathetic ghost of himself would he be frightened of death now surely a priest was the only one who could help him would he plead for rathbone to find some way any way at all to save him from the rope that would be embarrassing even repulsive and rathbone would wish for any form of escape from that he might even feel nauseated his throat was tight and his stomach was churning already the hansom ride was all too brief the prison gates opened and clanged shut behind him he made all the usual civil remarks and followed the prison guard down the narrow corridors to ballingers cell did the place smell of human fear and despair or was it his imagination the huge iron key turned in the lock the door opened with a faint squeak of hinges and rathbone was facing arthur ballinger the floor was black draining the light from the room the whitewashed walls made everything ghostly giving back a dead reflection of the air and the glimpse of sky outside behind him the door was shut and locked after everything that had happened what on earth was there to say how could they speak as normal it would be absurd what can i do for you rathbone said simply to ask ballinger how he was would be farcical appeal of course ballinger replied he did not look as crushed as rathbone had expected rathbone should have been relieved he would avoid the revulsion of weeping begging the sight of a man robbed of every dignity and yet looking at ballingers facehis bright angry eyeshe wondered if it was madness he was seeing but perhaps insanity was the only refuge left to him how should he answer ballinger was waiting on what grounds rathbone played for time had the verdict really snapped ballingers hold on reality he looked afraid but not panicky not wildeyed and certainly not confused ive reviewed the caseof course i havebut i can see no legal errors and there is certainly no new evidence i dont care on what grounds ballinger answered coming a step closer to him rathbone was aware of a sense of physical fear ballinger was a big man broad and heavy he was going to be hanged in two weeks anyhowwhat had he to lose did he also blame rathbone for his conviction sweat broke out on rathbones body and his stomach knotted his mind raced can you tell me something with which to plead for clemency he said surprised how steady his voice sounded so far you have claimed that you are not guilty but if parfitt attacked you there might be some way of making his death a matter of selfdefense and say im guilty ballinger responded angrily havent you got any bloody sense at all if i killed parfitt then obviously i killed hattie benson as well what excuse do i give for that rathbone felt the heat burn up his face ballinger was right it had been a stupid suggestion given without thought i need the verdict reversed not some pathetic plea for clemency ballinger went on prove rupert cardew killed parfitt because he was blackmailing him and he couldnt pay anymore rathbone was cold the room could have been walled with ice the man he saw in front of him was a stranger did you kill parfitt he asked of course i did ballinger snapped but the verdict was only on balance of probability you could still make it look like cardew clearly the same person killed the girl as well so id be free of both charges now rathbone was shivering it was a nightmare he must be at home asleep uncomfortably and he would wake up all this would disappear ballinger took another step toward him i cant rathbone said grimly refusing to move backward there are no grounds for appeal then make some oliver rathbone said nothing this was ridiculous he could understand desperation he had seen it many times before even refusal to acknowledge the fact of ones own death but it was usually an insane hope not a demand for something of which there was no possibility and ballinger had seemed anything but a weak man dont stand there in selfrighteous horror ballinger said sharply you know nothing about it parfitt was filth a parasite on human depravity i know that rathbone replied and if i could have mitigated your killing him i would have but i will not blame someone else for it you think rupert cardew is so worth saving now ballingers voice was a snarl his face ugly with contempt hes another kind of parasiteuseless worthless utterly selfish not even an honest passion of vice just bled his father dry then when he was in trouble turned on his friends his friends being the other men who used those wretched children and were blackmailed for it rathbone asked weak cruel cowards of men ballinger said with contempt bored with the ease of their lives and looking for a little danger to sharpen the appetite ive seen it all before i didnt create their vice i merely fed it and profitedand for a damned good reason in spite of his revulsion rathbone was curious a good reason his voice grated as he said it ballingers face twisted sometimes your stupidity astounds me you live in your safe prudish little world posturing as if you fight evil and letting it pass by under your nose because you wont break the rules and risk your own neck you dont look because you dont want to see rathbone tried to interrupt but ballinger ignored him his voice harsh he was sweating in spite of the cold and his physical presence dominated the room i told you i stopped pollution of the river by that damn factory how the hell do you think i got garslake to reverse the judgment on appeal hes master of the rolls head of the entire civil appeal system and half his friends own factories like that suddenly rathbone was horribly afraid sickening thoughts swirled in his mind at last ballinger breathed out slowly how would you influence men like that oliver they have all the money they can imagine all the power all the deference the respect the glory you cant bribe them and they dont need to listen to reason or mercy but by god in heaven they need to listen to the threat of exposure i have pictures of lord justice garslake that would make your stomach heave and hell make the right damn decisions or ill ruin him and he knows it rathbone could think of nothing to say words fell over themselves in his mind and all were inadequate for the understanding and the horror that filled him think ballinger shouted at him think of a way to appeal oliver because i have very vivid and explicit photographs far more than the few you saw in court of a large number of gentlemen performing acts that are not only obscene but are with children some of these gentlemen are of excellent family and hold high offices in law and government one or two are even close to the queen if something unfortunate should happen to me such as my death other than of disease or old age these photographs will fall into someone elses hands and you do not know who they are or what they would do with them you would not like that because they may not use them as judiciously as i have they are very very sharp weapons indeed so regardless of what you feel about me you will see to it that i remain alive and in good spirits rathbone was so appalled he could not speak he started at ballinger as if he had risen out of the ground like some hellish apparition and yet was so horribly passionately human it all made sense the temptation the logic the rage and the success and dont bother to look for them ballinger went on you will not find themnot in two years let alone two weeks he smiled the judiciary in particular would suffer so you had better find some way to see that my conviction is overturned whatever you have to do to bring that about i dont think i have to explain it for you but if necessary i can and i will there will be more than just me asking you for rescue or blaming you should you fail rathbone had thought the nightmare could get no worse and now it had doubled tripled why did you kill parfitt he asked it hardly mattered he was just curious was he growing greedy or threatening to bring the whole thing down himself no there was nothing wrong with parfitt ballinger said quite casually almost as if it were by the way no more than incidental then suddenly his voice filled with intense emotion and he stared at rathbone unblinkingly but i have to keep this power there is so much still to be done not just about pollution but slum clearances child labor his eyes were brilliant feverish watching rathbones every flicker of expression what can you do oliver with all your brilliant arguments in court can you move those men one inch from their comfort and their power rathbone did not bother to replythe question was rhetorical they both knew he could do nothing i can ballinger went on but i knew that monk would never let it go he believed i was behind jericho phillips and he was determined to get me hanged parfitts death in the same trade would draw him like a magnet if he hanged rupert cardew for it wrongly it would finish him in the police forever god almighty rathbone swore incredulously it was to get monk no you fool ballinger snarled with sudden savagery it was to save me monk is like a rat he would never let go i dont intend to spend the rest of my life looking backwards over my shoulder to see what new plan he has to ruin me and poor hattie was going to testify that she stole cardews cravat and gave it to whom someone of yours tosh wilkin if it matters no not really rathbone knew the moment he said it that tosh would not have the photographs find a way rathbone ballinger said between his teeth you have too much to lose if you dont rathbone did not move his limbs felt heavy his chest as if there were a tight band around it dont stand there like a damn footman ballinger said with a sudden blaze of fury you havent got time to waste wordlessly rathbone turned and banged on the door to be released hester had come home from the clinic a little earlier than usual but monk was barely through the door when rathbone arrived at paradise place he looked so ashen hester was frightened for him his hollow eyes and the dragging lines of his face made it clear that he was almost at the end of his strength she offered him tea immediately and went to put the kettle on without waiting for his answer also without asking him she put in a stiff dash of brandy when she returned with it already poured out in a large kitchen mug rathbone was sitting next to the fire in monks usual seat and he was still shivering monk sat on a hardbacked chair hester put the tray down on the table between them with rathbones mug nearest to him and then she looked at monk his face was pale too and the lines in it were more than those of tiredness monk gestured to her chair opposite rathbone and she sat obediently ballinger has photographs monk said simply theyre with somebody wholl make them public if ballinger is hanged we dont know whos in them but what theyre doing is obvious ballinger said theyre all kinds of people in government judiciary business even the royal household he blackmails them not for money but for power to bring about the reforms he believes are just at least thats what he told rathbone any of that might be true or might be lies but we cant afford to take the risk he wants me to mount an appeal rathbone looked at her thats the condition for his silence but i cant there are no grounds for a moment hester was stunned it was monstrous then the more she thought of it the more it made sense it might all be true it would be a passionate and almost understandable reason for all he had done she could see the temptation if she had had such power to use in the reform of nursing she would have played with the idea and please god discarded it but perhaps not but then it could also be a brilliant way of defending himself because they could not afford to ignore him im surprised he trusted someone else with the pictures how do you know they are all together with one person hester asked rathbone stared at her horror in his face im sorry she said quietly but i wouldnt give everything to one person would you oh god he said in utter wretchedness there was no hope in his voice you are certain that ballinger killed parfitt it was not one of parfitts other victims who did it monk asked oh yes he told me as much a painfully bitter smile touched rathbones lips actually he did it to ruin you get you off his trail forever he meant you to go after rupert cardew and then he would have proved him innocent at the last moment carried lord cardews everlasting gratitude and seen you off the force with your reputation shattered nothing you said about him after that would have been listened to even evidence would have been disregarded monk looked startled he knew you suspected his part in phillipss boat and it would be only a matter of time before you came after him rathbone went on with your care for scuff you wouldnt have let it go hester looked across at monk and felt a sense of warmth fill her as if even in this ghastly situation she still wanted to smile still trusted in a goodness an inner beauty that would survive im sorry monk said with a little shake of his head what can we do if we could think of any way of appealing would you i dont know rathbone admitted but there isnt theres no new evidence and no legal grounds i suppose the only thing i can think of is to find the photographs and destroy them but i have no idea where to look who would he trust with such things there cant be so many people are we sure he was telling the truth monk looked from one to the other of them rathbone pushed his hand through his hair i believe him he still wants to go on forcing through the reforms he cares about but i cant think of any way of proving it and can we afford to take the risk hester spoke slowly weighing her words uncertain of her own feelings even if we could find these photographs and destroy them and we were certain they were the only ones do we want to it is a sin and a crime to abuse children in such a way why do we want to protect men who are doing such things im not sure that i do and im not sure that i want to have that kind of power over people in anyones hands even my own how do you decide what to use it for when to stop how many peoples lives you can destroy along with the guilty she shook her head minutely her shoulders rigid aching with the muscles knotted no one i see i see rathbone said sharply his voice rawedged he pushed his hand through his hair again i should have seen it but whatever he could do i still dont have grounds for an appeal then we have to look for the photographs monk replied at least it will tell us who is vulnerable even if we have no guarantee that they are the only copies god what a nightmare rathbone said softly he seemed about to add something more and then changed his mind well need help hester said practically we cant possibly do it all by ourselves we dont even know where to look or how to make the right people listen to us rathbone raised his hand who else could we trust the people at the clinic she replied thinking as she answered squeaky robinson perhaps claudine what on earth could she do rathbone said incredulously make inquiries in society hester replied i dont mix with the sort of people who would be worth blackmailing for power and you can hardly ask rathbone blushed very faintly and she knew he was thinking that at any other time they would have asked margaret to help but now it was impossible but hester would not say so or even that he himself would hardly be wishing to move in his usual social circle he had not even considered how life would be after his fatherinlaw was hanged there would be no waking up from this nightmare and crow monk added ill ask orme his knowledge of the river is better than mine ill ask rupert cardew hester said looking at monk then at rathbone she expected them to argue and she had her rebuttal ready he could be putting his life at risk after what hes already done monk warned her i know and ill remind him of it but i have to ask its a long path back from where he was and i believe he means to take it if he stays in london hes ruined rathbone said grimly doesnt he understand that hell never be forgiven for what will be seen as betraying his own he knows she assured him remembering ruperts ashen face when she had asked him to testify hes ruined anywhere in england i expect hell go to australia or somewhere like that start again what hell for his father rathbone murmured poor man better he go having made amends than stay here as he was hester shook her head a little he hasnt left himself such a lot of choices this is the bravest thing the cleanest but he can do this one thing more before he leaves he may be the only one who knows some of the people ballinger knew and ballinger probably gave the pictures to someone who was in them himself it would be the best way to make sure he obeyed monk swore under his breath but he did not argue he stood up then wed better start wheres scuff she was horrified youre not taking him he raised his eyebrows of course i am you think hed be better off staying here alone you think he would stay at least if hes with me ill know where he is she let out her breath slowly he was right but it was not good enough not safe enough but then probably it never would be life wasnt safe they worked for six days starting before dawn and stopping only late at night monk and orme went up and down the river rathbone went through every social acquaintance and business connection of ballingers that he could trace claudine listened to society gossip and asked inquisitive and even intrusive questions squeaky robinson put out inquiries among all the brothelkeepers prostitutes and petty criminals that he knew crow sought all the dubious medical sources procurers and abortionists rupert cardew risked his safety and even his life asking questions once he was beaten and was lucky to escape with no more than severe bruising and a cracked rib every lead fizzled out and they were left with no more than fears and guesses as to who had the photographs or even if they were real rathbone decided to try one more time to plead with arthur ballinger for the sake of his family if nothing else to tell them where the photographs were and allow them to be destroyed he would go in the morning at midnight he stood in the drawing room of his silent house and stared out through the french windows into the autumn garden the smell of rain and damp earth was sweet but he was barely aware of it the wind had parted the clouds and the soft moonlight bathed the air making the sky milky pale the black branches of trees elaborate lace against it the room was not cold but he was chilled inside there was nothing else left but to go back to ballinger and he must do it in the morning he finally closed the curtains and went upstairs creeping soundlessly as if he were in a strange house and did not wish to disturb the owners he changed into his nightclothes in the dressing room and walked barefoot to the bedroom the lights were out he could not hear margaret move or even breathe it was a curiously sharp feeling of isolation because he knew she was there he woke at six and rose immediately washing shaving and dressing silently and going downstairs in a house still chilly from the night the maid had lit the fires but they had not burned up sufficiently to warm the air the maid boiled the kettle for him and made a cup of tea and two slices of toast he had to force himself to eat it standing at the kitchen table making the girl uncomfortable the master had no business alone and miserable in her territory it was not the way houses were supposed to be run he thanked her and left catching a hansom a block away from the house and finding himself all too quickly outside the cold gray walls of the prison it was only twenty minutes before eight and the sky was so overcast it seemed still shadowed by the retreating night as the lawyer of a condemned man he was admitted immediately mornin sir the jailer said cheerfully he was a large squareshouldered man with a ready smile and a gap between his front teeth dont often get folks ere this time o the day mr ballinger is it not long for im now best its over i say longest three weeks in the world rathbone did not argue the man could not know ballinger was rathbones fatherinlaw or anything of the bitter and complicated relationship between them rathbone followed obediently along the stone corridors he could hear no voices no footfalls because he walked carefully yet the silence seemed restless as if there were always something just beyond his hearing it was cold and the air smelled stale no one had let wind or light inside to disturb the centuries of despair that had settled here this was no place for a man to end his days remembering mickey parfitt did not help rathbone forced himself to think of the children like scuff small thin humiliated and forever afraid then he found he could straighten his shoulders and accept the necessity of the situation nothing on earth could make him like it the jailer stopped at the cell door and the sudden jangle of his keys was the first loud noise he poked one into the lock turned it and pushed the door it swung open inward with a slight squeak of hinges there yare sir he invited rathbone took a deep breath this was loathsome he would not have wished to walk into ballingers bedroom and find him in his nightshirt halfasleep expecting privacy even at the best of times this was a loss of dignity that was degrading to both of them he stepped in the light was faint from the single small barred window high in the opposite wall it was a moment before he realized that what looked like a heap of bedclothes on the floor was arthur ballingers body without even knowing he did it he let out a cry and stumbled forward onto his knees grabbing for the flungout hand his fingers closed over the flesh feeling the bones it was cold sweet jesus the jailer said from behind him his voice shaking he held the lantern up whether it was for rathbone to see or himself was unclear the light showed ballinger in his prison nightshirt sprawled awkwardly one leg bent the back of his head was matted with blood but from his staring eyes and protruding tongue it was hideously clear that he had been strangled to death the bruise marks from hands were darkening on his throat ere the jailer said yerd better get up sir int nothing we can do fer im best get out of ere an tell the chief warden e int gonna like this rathbone was frozen his legs would not obey him ere the jailer repeated suddenly his voice gentle up yer get sir come on sir this way rathbone felt the man haul at him taking his weight and he rose to his feet trembling how could this happen he asked still staring at ballinger i dunno sir therell ave ter be an inquiry int fer us ter say wed better get out of ere an tell someone yer didnt touch nothin did yer his his hand its cold rathbone stammered yeah must a bin done last night come on sir we gotta get out of ere rathbone allowed himself to be led away stumbling a little hardly aware of passing through the corridors crossing a hallway and being ushered into a warm office the chair he was put in was soft and someone brought him a cup of tea it was hot and too strong but he was glad of it he heard footsteps outside hurrying anxious voices but he could catch no words and for a moment he hardly cared how had this happened ballinger was due to be hanged in less than a week why would anyone kill him and how a jailer had to have helped colluded someone had paid perhaps a great deal surely that was proof that the photographs were real and all that ballinger had said of them was true what fearful irony that all his care to keep his power had actually ended in his own death were his secrets dead with him or simply waiting to be laid bare one by one most likely they would only be guessed at when a trust was betrayed an inexplicable judgment made a suicide a law passed against all expectations how was he going to tell margaret how much he winced as he thought how she would blame him for this too if he had gained an acquittal ballinger would have been at home with his family safe and with all the power still in his hands or perhaps he would have been murdered anyway just not here and if there had been no danger of an appeal would he have been left to hang no if hed been hanged then someone had had the instructions to make it all public he must have been killed by someone who intended either to destroy all the pictures or to use them himself god what an unimaginable horror it was worse even than rathbone had expected when he told her she stood in the center of the morning room her face sheetwhite swaying a little on her feet afraid she was going to faint he took a step toward her she backed away sharply almost as if she feared he was going to strike her margaret he said hoarsely no she shook her head and put her hands up to ward him off no youre lying im sorry he began sorry youre not sorry you made this happen she accused if you hadnt put your career before your family i couldnt defend him he was burning with a sense of the injustice of her charge he was guilty margaret he killed mickey parfitt parfitt was vermin she retorted he should have been killed and hattie benson she was a prostitute a whore who was going to lie to protect rupert cardew protect him from what he didnt kill parfitt and youve just said parfitt needed killing you cant have it both ways the tears were running down her cheeks and she was gasping for breath my fathers been murdered and youre standing there justifying yourself youre disgusting i used to love you so much because i thought you were brave and loyal and you fought for the truth now i see youre just ambitious you dont even know what love is he felt as if he had been slapped so hard that his flesh was bruised he stood without moving as she turned away and walked to the door when she was in the hall she looked back at him im going home to look after my mother she will need me i will send for my belongings with a rustle of silk and the sound of her footsteps on the floor she was gone rathbone could not measure how grieved he was or how deep the wound or how and if ever it would heal the overcast was so heavy that it was dusk before five in the afternoon monk came home to find a fire bright and warm in the parlor and hester and scuff sitting beside it there was a pot of tea on the table between them and they were eating hot crumpets with butter scuff had crumbs on his chest he was sitting in monks chair and looked a little guilty when monk opened the door but he did not move he was waiting to see what would happen maybe how much he belonged here hester stood up and walked over to monk she kissed him on the cheek gently then on the mouth he slid his arms around her and held her until she pulled back i know she said softly crow came and told us someone murdered ballinger in his cell monk looked past her at scuff the boy was watching him waiting the crumpet held in his hand dripping butter onto his clothes his eyes were wide it isnt the way i would have chosen monk replied but maybe thats an end of it its hideous for rathbone and for margaret but there was never anything we could have done to change that scuff was still watching monk monk smiled at him no more river trade on those boats he said what about them pictures yer was lookin fer scuff asked i dont know maybe theyre destroyed maybe not but theyre only pictures if the people in them get blackmailed well worry about that if we ever get to know finish your crumpet before its cold scuff grinned and took a big bite of it scattering crumbs onto the floor and onto monks chair next time the chairs mine monk said with a nod scuff hitched himself a little farther back against the cushions and continued smiling epilogue codicil to the last will and testament of arthur hall ballinger to my soninlaw oliver rathbone i leave all my photographic equipment cameras tripods lighting and such photographic plates and negatives as have already been exposed they are to be found in my bank in my private safety deposit i trust there is some heaven or hell from which i may observe what he does with them arthur hall ballinger
