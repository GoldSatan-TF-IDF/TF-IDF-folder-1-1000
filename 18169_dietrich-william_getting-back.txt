william dietrich getting back prologue everything he knew was useless now there was a cold clarity to that realization a crystallization of hopelessness that in its own odd way was bracing it was the first coherent thought to penetrate ethan flints panic in some time he acknowledged with an acceptance that was calming that he was probably doomed the cries of pursuit were growing closer the heave of ethans chest and pounding of his heart had quieted enough to hear the sound drifting across the desert its harsh rasping reminding him of the caw of crows hed grown up with the urban birds watching them multiply on songbird eggs until they flew across the endless rooftops like plumes of smoke and they spoke in a language hard and aggrieved it was a relative of that sound the fugitive heard now human calls that were shrill excited and without remorse it was a yipping designed to induce fear and at first flints brain had screamed the need to think so urgently that it drowned out every other thought now his peril was being more rationally more grimly absorbed he was being hunted but why by whom the day had climaxed into an oven of punishing heat the air so dry that ethan seemed hardly to sweat he understood this was an illusion he was parched and rapidly dehydrating despite his knowledge of how dangerous such a condition could be there was so much hed memorized before coming to the desert the proper salt balance his necessary caloric intake the dimensions of a solar still or how to splint a bone or identify an edible plant or make fire with a lens hed sought to be an aboriginal engineer a wilderness technician a lot of good it was doing him now the plane crashed his friends dead his carefully chosen gear a growing deadweight and now this unexpected pursuit when running for your life you dont have much time to indexsearch the precepts of wilderness comfort on disk he observed wryly his peril would be funny if it wasnt so frightening perhaps it was a bad dream certainly australia seemed unreal the sand was too red the sky too blue the desert brush a vivid improbable green like a childrens coloring book the landscape shimmered and danced its insubstantiality matching his sense of being trapped in a nightmare but the pain was real his head ached and every attempt to rest gave the flies a chance to find him again their buzz was as tireless as the sun the impossibility of his situation seemed so enormous that he had difficulty processing its logic he was a sheeter slang for a computer engineer who matrixed corporate spreadsheets into fourdimensional game theory and his whole life was built on mathematics he was an artist of the rational his boss had praised him a wizard a master a lord of the logarithms ethan had swaggered through code like danielfuckingboone it was all worth squat right now a fact that seemed cruelly unfair shouldnt all his work all his education and all his technological expertise give him some kind of edge no of course not cops credentials resumes diplomas thousands of miles away and hed asked for this paid a small fortune to do it enormously funny really a tremendous joke on him clearly something had gone monstrously wrong so nonsensically and outrageously wrong that he thirsted for not just water but retribution oh what rank incompetence this confirmed among the bastards whod sent him here what lies theyd told by not telling him enough if he got home hed what somebody would listen wouldnt they if he got home ethan glanced back his glimpse of his pursuers produced an instinctive shock of fear there was an animal wildness about them a shedding of restraint that was as unbound and tangled as their hair he was so disoriented drugged for the flight awakened in wreckage the harried pilot who unstrapped him displaying none of the cool aplomb hed come to expect the aviator had punched out parachuted down and moved in anxious jerks desperate to get away from the wreckage that smoked like a beacon the plane had broken into two parts the forward section with his dead friends skidding to the far side of a low rise ethan had wanted to go there but the pilot refused you dont want to see your friends instead the rattled aviator had unscrewed a tail panel and unbolted an orangecolored electronic box cursing as he struggled with the tools then he brusquely jammed the added weight into ethans alreadystuffed pack this is whats going to keep us from having to walk to the beach the man had explained gruffly if i can get the rest wait here ethan waited as the pilot trotted toward the nose and when hed become bored sitting in the heat and sand and finally trudged up the rise thinking he was hallucinating a curious murmur of voices hed seen a swarm of scavengers who looked like urban groundlings theyd pinned the pilot against the blackened fuselage like a trapped rabbit their movements quick their tone mocking and their skin brown and hard as bark get back theyd howled at the pilot so flint had run before hed fully realized he was running confused by the impression of faded synthetics and wooden spears wire decorations and ragged hair a melding of stone age and information age twentyfirstcentury huns now he could hear their crowing getting closer drawing near ethan was so tired his feet felt made of concrete and he glanced down to check if the sensation was literally true no made of clay the designer swirls of his orion supra boots had disappeared beneath a sheath of red dust the laces ragged already my theyd been striking shoes the urban boutique had been designed to look like one of the lost canyons of the colorado its walls sprayed with gunite and its light mimicking the desert sky painting the rock with a days rotation every hour the boots had rested in a cleft beneath reproduced indian petroglyphs their sinuous curves caressed by a red beam of laser light emanating from the eye of a robotic eagle the effect was as artful as a museum display and despite their ludicrous price hed bought them instantly the damn things still hurt however and they left gridded prints that mimicked the manhattan street system a conceit hed thought cleverly ironic at the time now his tracks seemed as obvious as a sidewalk he had to get out of the dirt and onto bare sandstone in the approaching hills the thought of shedding the boots did not occur to him he did sling off his pack in a regretful acknowledgment that he was carrying too much grunting in relief as it thumped down into the dust its colors had gone red as well time to lighten the task was painful hed spent months assembling this gear webscanning outdoor advice downloading lists and even shopping in person instead of electronically to signal his seriousness this wasnt a wuss weekend of a guided trek in patagonia or nepal dammit this was real the last wilderness the toughest test left on the face of a fastshrinking earth the weeks of preparation had given his life an edge hed never experienced before wilderness hed demanded the bottomline best because it was his friggin life that was on the line out here by god and he paid top dollar for it beautiful stuff virtual jewelry of the outdoors scratchresistant waterproof shining now he had to leave it oh the outrage hed express if he got home he threw the computerized global positioning system out first a weeks wages and so far it had delivered nothing but static baffling the laser range finder worked well enough but it only depressed him to learn how far away the distant hills really were he abandoned that too both were left in open view maybe such expensive toys would slow his pursuers down after two hundred yards he stopped and considered again the palmtop solar computer went next its dietary calculations confirming what he already knew that he was hungry and its library of congress memory cache still entirely untapped with greater regret he threw out the symphonypod and headphones the cellular receiver for satellite news the foil solar oven and the coffee grinder with windout antenna and stampsized tv pricey precious stuff designed to give his challenging trek a fringe of fun now it was metallic junk hed trade for a liter of water he sipped the last he had a half swallow and heaved on the pack again noticeably lighter he thought bitterly and none too soon the faint whoops were drawing closer he set out again at a half trot climbing toward the cracked polished rocks of ancient hills they shone like cooked meat despite his anxiety ethan was slowing the heat leaching his healthplus conditioning water was the problem his throat thick head light a burst of effort a long drink after that maybe he could hide figures flickered through the scrub below his discarded gear eliciting caws of triumph ethan didnt know if his hunters wanted the gadgets or regarded his droppings as a kind of bleeding they loped like wolves burdened with nothing and he conceded he was still carrying too much but what more could he afford to lose at a rock overhang he heaved off his pack again there was little choice but to jettison necessary items and circle back for them later the tent the spiderfiber hammock the sleeping bag the duraflex cookware the fuel cannisters the battery packs he yanked them out with furious jerks of his arm angry at the waste a change of underwear his camp shoes his digital recorder all abandoned just to get away how he wished for a gun but that was against the rules wasnt it everything was against the rules he pulled out the orangepainted metal box the pilot had insisted he carry heavy as a shot put dense as stone this would get them back he was a gadget freak but the instrument was unrecognizable a switch a button a few socket ports he flicked the switch back and forth punching the button nothing well the pilot said it wouldnt work by itself ethan hesitated only a moment and then heaved watching the box kick up a spurt of dust before it tumbled into a ravine good riddance then he started upward again studying the surrounding hills all he had to do was outrun them hide and come back he was smarter than they were right hed always been smarter than almost anyone he knew so what insanity had brought him here in the first place what was he trying to prove that he could survive he reminded himself that he could go into the wilderness by himself face life at its most fundamental and formidable and prevail it would validate his existence as something more than a cog in a global machine had he been seduced drawn into this place by a commercial comeon full of bland reassurances peppy encouragement and appeals to his own vanity or had he deliberately surrendered his head to his heart in order to break free of the logical prison his career had become essentially making the decision to come here long before hed heard of this place hed run to a continent that promised respite from contemporary anxieties and monotonous routine a refuge from the tangled demons of his id maybe fear had brought him here or some pathetic dream of freedom another joke he wasnt sure himself ethan realized dimly that he was bleeding the scrub was thorny and the grass pricked as he pushed through it like a stuttering stab of electricity everything seemed hard and angular here the rocks the bushes the light as roughedged as the city but in an entirely different way even the dirt was unwelcoming alive with ants hed give anything for a drink of water he sensed more than saw the flicker of movement at the periphery of his vision it was on the ridge above and disappeared as soon as he registered its presence ethan glanced wildly about the calls had stopped he realized was it because his pursuers had fallen back or because their net was drawing tighter he began to trot faster his breath a saw against his throat there it was again a silhouette on the crest of the ridge above running easily checking his location and then disappearing christ the pursuers were even with his own position they hadnt slowed to pick over his things at all he had to throw away the last of his old world he staggered as he let the pack slip off his shoulders a final time it represented everything that was to have kept him alive now he swung it in an arc like an olympic hammer thrower grunting the pack lofted out over a canyon and fell thudding onto a steep dirt slope and skidding into scrub he took a deep breath while the loss of his pack left him floating with release it also made him feel feeble his armor had been stripped he set off at a dead run ethan cut downhill picking up some speed running to water his pores were so dry that his skin stung puffs of dust shot up with each heavy thud of his boots ankles twisting as he fought for balance on loose rocks another darting blur at the edge of his vision this time downslope he frantically cranked his neck to either side more shapes pacing him and he heard the pound of footfalls behind what did they want now that hed shed everything he brought he cut to the left following a broad ledge the cliff shielded him from the view of any pursuers above and the drop to his right prevented those below from easily following if he could just lose the ones behind the urbanite accelerated his heart pounding his vision dim a shrill cry went up high and warbling and adrenaline jolted him like an electric prod they were close too close faster faster ethan was in the air before he realized the ledge had ended his legs chugged at nothing his arms flailed like a silly cartoon character he thought morosely as his panic gave way to a black fundamental regret then he fell he hit a slope and tumbled wondering dimly which bones would snap first the calm clarity of it the sober acknowledgment of miscalculation surprised him his fear had been replaced with stupid sorrow what an ass hed been for coming here then he hit something hard spun and blacked out part one chapter one the city filled its vast central basin like a reservoir fills its impoundment chains of linked town houses lapping at a litterencrusted shoreline of brown scabby hills the hills had been set aside as park a hundred years ago and had slowly strangled into wasteland neglected junkfilled eroded dangerous eruptive urban growth had long since spilled past them and flooded the valleys beyond to bury farmland swallow rural communities and engulf remnant woods this overflow of the urban grid had no final boundary its horizons were lost in haze its edges smeared by cancerous growth the sky was stagnant white the city gray and the occasional splashes of architectural color only emphasized the monotony they were painted on in this dense human colony land was like gold space currency and square footage the source of rivalry and aspiration houses were bonded like siamese twins or stacked like the comb of a hive each looked like its neighbor cramped claycolored straining for a scrap of view their yards were patios scabby greenery enclosed in pots on the worst days when the light was flat and the wafer of sun melted at its edges like a seltzer tablet the city was a hard ugly place yet the beast retained the seductive throb of human life at night its arterials were ribbons of light and its tiled plain of asphalt and plastic roofs was broken by archipelagos of soaring skyscrapers and corporate pyramids malls were emporiums of bright commerce and cafes spilled onto sidewalks winking hovercraft darted like fireflies and infolasers stabbed skyward toward satellites corporate names crested buildings like proud coxcombs crowing with a glow of marketed pride the beacons intended warmth like the remembered reassurance of the lamp or tavern sign but bloated to football field dimensions they instead drenched their neighborhoods with commercial glare the sign war extended to the sky where searchlights cast logos on nighttime haze lasers flickered to announce openings or bankruptcies and blimps drifted with holographic tidings the citys signs were a galaxy of rival artificial suns and the pictures they cast were of an idealized desired halfremembered and romanticized world glistening beaches convivial families green meadows detached houses in the world of united corporations read one everyone can win all the time in quadrant between the st francis and reagan expressways a twentyfirstcentury pyramid rose from its walled enclosure of plastimarble plazas boxed gardens and black reflecting pools a glass and metal pointed office building one hundred stories high its colored panels and opaque windows shimmered as they chemically changed mood with the time of day the smoky blue of morning giving way to noons perky silver mellowing to a burnished copper as the day waned and finally darkening to a swallowing black the windows looked out but no one could see in utility tubes popped from the ground and fed the pyramids base like placental cords inside microcores headquarters had its own shops its own restaurants its own banks its own hydrogen pumps and its own kiosks it was a world within a world the chairman sat in her office at the pyramids summit like an insect queen level and location on each of the one hundred floors below were allocated on the basis of rank at each floor supervisors occupied offices on the outer rim in a cordon within was a maze of cubicles that penned their subordinates the partitions low enough to ensure that heads could be observed bowed in work this laboring center was a ghostly group even dark complexions looked pale from the flush of light that crept out from the edges of the optiglasses that had replaced computer screens the workers typed murmured commands clicked the results created flickers of light that played across their temples like an echo of thought there was little noise above the hum of muzak the beep of terminal signals and the drone of ventilation it was unseemly to yell startling to laugh and easier to communicate electronically people had become extensions of the wires they were hooked to the chairman rode up and down the inner face of the pyramid in an elevator of smoked glass hung from an angled track the privacy enabled her to see the employees of each floor without being seen the box whispering like a gray ghost everyone wondered of course what the chairman did when she rode up and down past her thousands of minions did she calculate profits note empty cubicles play a headvid point out a suggested promotion no one knew few below the upper floors had ever seen her everyone strove for graduation to those upper floors at each level an electronic ribbon of scenic vistas and encouraging slogans circled the central cubicles giving a border of color microcore read one where winwin is a way of life on level cubicle daniel dyson ignored the encouragement of the videograms and set his optiglasses aside he was preoccupied with a more personal goal the quest for female attention specifically daniel had calculated that the walls of what he called the rodent corral beige cubicle dividers to match the beige carpet and beige desks and beige terminals and beige walls of level were high enough to allow him to secretly prepare and yet low enough to launch his latest experiment in physics and flirtation mona pietri cubicle was the latest woman of his dreams darkhaired doeeyed and curvaceous as a sine wave daniel suspected genetic and surgical supplementation had enhanced what nature had initially bestowed but was willing to embrace this commitment to selfimprovement as a sign of inner beauty god she was stacked she in turn was utterly oblivious to his existence which made her of course all the more desirable unable to concoct a corporate excuse to work with her daniel had decided to send an invitation to share the latest beverage craze a mongolian fermented mares milk cappuccino the latest morale booster of the corporate cafeteria the oldfashioned way launching it by catapult fate and physics would determine the arc of romance daniel had constructed the miniature war machine out of office supplies that had outlasted every promise of office automation in ad pencils for beams thumbtacks and paper clips to drill and fasten rubber bands for bracing and to provide torque for the catapults lever arm he attached the helmet of a startrooper action doll to the arm with a combination of chewing gum and bondit adhesive within the helmet nestled his missile a raspberry chocolate wrapped in a ribbon of paper on the paper he had printed mona im gonna getta mongo will you gongo with me cubicle daniel poetry was not one of the skills listed on his corporate performance appraisal still he calculated its attempt was potentially more rewarding or at least more interesting than working on the software meeting minder which was what he was supposed to be doing a military history major in college and what are you going to do with that in a world of no armies his father had protested in futility daniel had an academics understanding of how a catapult was supposed to work calculating its trajectory was a matter of trial and error however and daniel figured he had only one chance at launching his bid for amour before supervisors put an end to his experiment hed done a few test firings across the width of his desk now he wound the torsion rubber band tighter to achieve the calculated distance and sighted toward ms pietris pretty head as remote and alabaster as the moon one small step toward sexual chemistry he whispered hoping she liked chocolate fire a few neighboring heads snapped up no one thought for a moment that a cubicle was in flames it was just dyson who had a reputation for keeping things interesting the chocolate shot ceilingward the ribbon of its message unexpectedly unreeling that tail was enough to spoil his calculations the projectile went awry and dropped like a meteor into the lair of harriet lundeen the level floor manager its whap was a note of doom the poem bore his return address uhoh if youre declaring war dyson youll lose his colleague sanford predicted from the cubicle next door the gorgon has never been beaten meanwhile desirable mona hadnt even looked up daniel waited a full minute for a reaction time enough to hope his missile had fallen undetected or that ms lundeen had elected to ignore his misfire for the price of a chocolate maybe she was hoping she could meet him for a mongo the old bat he covered his catapult with waste paper in the desk basket but no here she came with the countenance and body of a wagnerian valkyrie lacking only breastplate and horned helmet the ribbon poem was held out like a piece of decaying meat is this yours mr dyson you looked hungry he tried my name is not mona thats true actually i was routing that to ms pietri i see she sighted toward the goddess of cubicle and gongo what does that mean is it lewd or are you merely witless dyson smiled with as little sincerity as he could muster im trying to be creative ms lundeen its asking if shell go with me i think it makes sense in the context of the poem like jabberwocky sanford snickered jabber what its another poem lundeen considered whether he was putting her on your literary taste is as bad as your aim she finally decided then she glanced sourly around his cubicle and your discipline every other employee on level had adhered to the request to maintain an orderly and respectful desktop decor in line with corporate atmospheric guidelines dysons however was a pocket of cluttered individuality pictures of climbers on everest and camels in the sahara bearded revolutionaries of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries two tattered pinups discreetly draped with microcore calendars a meditatively chewed plastic stegosaurus several holomovie figurines parts from a magic kit food wrappers stained cups and a cuddle doll with a noose around its neck i was just straightening up her stare was not amused cultivate conformity mr dyson he tried to look solemn we all aspire to be like you ms lundeen she held up the chocolate you could do worse she put it into her mouth and repeated a habitual warning as she chewed if you cant adapt to microcore you may end up in a place even less to your liking it was an empty threat he knew employees were like barnacles you could hardly pry them loose with a stick of dynamite thats hard to imagine he said so is your promotion daniels poem fluttered into the wastebasket sanford came around the cubicle wall to fish it out will you gongo he read daniel shrugged i needed a rhyme his colleague shook his head youre never going to bongo mona pietri with lame stuff like gongo che the nickname was taken from one of daniels revolutionary pictures why dont you try being normal instead because im not daniel replied he went for a mongo by himself lights brightened and then dimmed in what was marketed as an architectural warmth cocoon as he walked down the pyramids corridors the bubble of light making him feel on stage instead of cozy a soft female voice activated in the walls as he strode reminding him of corporate philosophy you are your group she murmured seductively as he passed the copier room profit makes possibility she reminded near the telecom pod daniel took the stairs instead of the elevator work for a good retirement she whispered as he trotted down the steps her voice followed him to the hallway the rest room the cafeteria line share the enthusiasm change is risky believe in belonging the voice was as unheard and omnipresent as the shadowmuzak it interrupted it cajoled nagged promised the cafeteria chatter was of web celebrities game scores designer drugs faddish restaurants and cloneorgan operations an accountants bray of laughter was so obnoxious that daniel thought the donkey should clone himself a new head then he sat alone sipping his sour drink and imagining improvements to his catapult i hear youre seducing harridan lundeen someone called from across the room daniel ignored the comment stacking sugar tablets into a castle wall someday he wanted to defend a real castle sanford came through the line and slid into a seat opposite the gorgon won again he judged i dont care what that old biddy thinks dyson sipped his mongo wincing at its taste they said it was an acquired habit it aint what she thinks its what she can do she called maintenance to do some midday cleaning so your wastebasket is empty now the catapult shit i thought she hadnt noticed it when are you going to learn dyson go along to get along i try to get along its not my fault everyone but me is crazy he sipped again it was possible he was the only real human being on earth hed theorized and everyone else was a participant in an elaborate hoax to fool him for unknown but no doubt evil and nefarious reasons this could explain why everyone else seemed to tolerate a bureaucracy that drove him crazy the catapult actually worked rather well i thought the problem was the payload sanford resisted any temptation to congratulate his engineering sanity is the most democratic of definitions my friend his workmate counseled the majority gets to decide whats normal odd man out is the one who gets labeled insane dyson pointed to his brain maybe im just ahead of my time the mark of genius sanford laughed ill put that on your urn registry he was right after all im sure it will be a great comfort when youre dead or behind maybe i was born two hundred years too late judging from your office political skills id say you were born yesterday daniels smile was rueful mona im gonna he promised softly you still have a chance i just saw her in telecom no doubt word has gotten around and given you an excuse to talk to her i built an engine of destruction and crossed the horrible harriet lundeen just for you what woman could resist daniel sighed just about every female ive met since third grade he stood still ours is not to wonder why right old chap aye ours is but to mate and die remember the alamo dont fire until she rolls her eyes into the breach my friends hey dont talk dirty mona pietri was struggling with the telecom console new features had been added that theoretically doubled its speed and realistically multiplied the ways in which it could possibly malfunction by a factor of five the snarl of error messages gave dyson a chance to introduce himself and demonstrate male prowess though in truth he didnt know much more about the console than mona did still he bluffed his way through to a ready promise on the view screen by hammering on the machines buttons she granted him a look of approval giving no hint she knew shed been the target of romantic bombardment less than an hour before i dont know why it has to be so complicated she pouted instantly he was in love microcores purchasing agents make three times as much money as we do buying this junk and then depend on us to document the need to upgrade it he explained if we ever mastered our equipment their usefulness would be over its designed to torment she looked uncertain i dont think the corporation really intends that oh but they do microcore is a pyramid built on a program of everincreasing complication we make things hard so you can take it easy but of course it never gets easier at all microcore snarls so it can cut its own gordian knot its what maybe he could impress her with trivia gordium was an ancient city the chariot of its founder was tied to a post by a knot so complex that legend promised it could only be untied by the future conqueror of asia alexander the great came to the place considered a moment and then cut the knot with his sword she nodded hesitantly he fulfilled the prophecy you see just like microcore fulfills the promise on its box that this software will cut the knot created by its last box of course our sword ties a new knot to replace the old to ensure a market for next years release its the way of the modern world its your job our job microcore where reinventing the need for our existence is a way of life he grinned its vapid but it feeds us mona looked uncomfortable i dont think you should be so negative she decided i dont think it helps the group miscalculation im not negative just honest candid i dont think you believe in what were doing look he considered what to say im just trying to analyze our market role clearly and find some humor from poking fun i dont really object i just look for opportunities to show initiative she brightened at that initiate consensus she recited approvingly remembering the corporate slogan plan time for spontaneity discipline toward freedom he looked at her with disappointment youve been listening to the walls i see she nodded ive memorized them all maybe you should too daniel i think youd be happier if you better understood why were all here chapter two alone again that evening daniel lay back in the viewing chair of his cramped studio apartment and cruised his video wall hed been putting off an upgrade and the chips that drove it were a little cheesy he hated the planned obsolescence that forced him to keep up but it still managed to generate convincing threedimensional imagery in colors brighter than real life sound rippled around the corners of his small room like a brook around a boulder splashing him welcome daniel a female voice greeted in a whisper have you invested in your future today he began to netsurf skimming across a downloaded rush of tropical beaches mistshrouded mountain peaks and adrenalinejolting thrill rides a dinosaur roared an elephant trumpeted and napoleonic cavalry thundered into a smoky valley his chair rocking slightly with the drum of the hooves women more impossibly beautiful than any hed ever actually seen beckoned alluringly at turnermurdochdisney an avatarguide purred we promise the best in fantasy entertainment experience utter danger without the risk of real injury exquisite sex without commitment or disease any time any place for any reason as always your securilock keeps your fantasies as private as your own mind so come dream with us with the aid of the finest actors and writers and technicians in the world yet nothing caught his fancy he clicked restlessly the usual vividness seeming flat and artificial click companion a program tempted because friendship can be bought that one mocked him mona im gonna call pretty pathetic dyson he lectured himself my life spent in video halflives more interesting than my own click click click flick flick flick reality then the news was of rare remote disaster that confirmed his own safety the market twitched to tremors too faint to feel commentators excitedly recorded the linkages and breakups of celebrities he could never hope to meet economic indicators were upeveryone can win all the time but then they were always up under united corporations or about to go up or taking a breather after a sprint of upness he skimmed like a skipping rock over the bloated bandwidth numb from the predictability of it newer better faster the more insistent the promise the more his own world seemed to remain unchanged there were fads of course quick insistent and forgotten until economically recycled by nostalgia and irony his closets were filled with the detritus of fads all closets were all fads were global now he clicked and tapped following the links his hacker pal fitzroy had taught him the web had grown so vast it was fundamentally unexplorable unpoliced its sites outnumbered the population of the planet it had become a gargantuan network of electronic rooms corridors passageways and barriers endless tangled secretive and dreamlike as deep and unknowable now as the human mind a haunt of inner fantasy and murky rebellion a descent to its cyber underground was like falling down a rabbit hole had he found them or had they found him theyd come to him first he remembered but probably only after being alerted to his discontent by his email whinings or his grousing to some coworker who already belonged it was hip to not take united corporations seriously so popping up on his wall out of nowhere one evening had come a single word that intrigued him disbelieve then an internet address into a laborious maze with just enough irreverence to be tantalizing there was a shadow net under the official net he knew a hades of the skeptical and the unhappy its coding was breakable to be sure but it took the authorities time to find and break the illicit nature of it was thrilling but finally hed come to some electronic doors that barred further descent keep out he cracked some code made some end runs guessed some riddles and received a few halfbaked conspiracy theories for his trouble he was still too straight bogged in the cyber undergrounds tar the corporate drone the hacker who couldnt quite hack it frustrated he called fitzroy what the hell do you want that garbage for the excop had growled from his video wall fitzroy hacked code for a living now making three times the money hed earned policing it hed found daniel floundering on the web once offered some free advice and then regularly milked him of money for one insistent need or another its just a bunch of loonies rumors as news losers theyre different so is a rehab ward for the morally impaired you want to spend a month there come on fitzroy can you get me in or not i can get you started then you have to play along with their paranoia while they suck on your bank account its a scam dyson im bored ive heard rumors about these guys they question things ask em how many answers theyve got but he sold daniel enough passwords and puzzle solutions to get him in daniel found himself in a gothic mansion of paranoia an odd networld of conspiracy theories webporn unproven sex scandals dark fantasy irreverent satire pseudoscience alien abductions and rambling political discourse garbage fitzroy had predicted people who preferred to believe the bizarre over the mundane no matter how improbable links were constantly disrupted by authorities trying to police the net of trash and new cells opened up as fast as old ones evaporated postings were made by characters calling themselves swamp fox and robin hood it was a game so daniel surfed after his failure with mona pietri because he was more thrilled at being there at being in than with any information he was finding if everyone wins how do we feel what it means to lose pleaded a posting this evening if this is heaven where is hell level daniel offered lightly typing a microcore help menu who is satan harriet lundeen maybe someone would pick up the name and shed flicker through a hundred conspiracy theories the gorgon unmasked he laughed to himself what if you could really fight evil daniel he stopped at that who was this cowled figure looming on his screen who knew his name you never used your real name in the cyber underground he explored under the sobriquet gordo taken from an action toy he kept on his desk gordo firecracker nemesis of evil how do you know my name i am a wouldbe friend daniel paused he was suspicious of wouldbe friends he knew there were informants spies and censors who cruised the web occasionally making an embarrassing arrest still he was curious who are you i am spartacus i am robespierre i am thomas paine and vladimir lenin and vercingetorix and crazy horse we exist daniel we oppose the cyber underground is more than a toy the world has gone into a coma and we want to wake it up he hesitated at that there was an unspoken line between satire and treason and this kind of stuff was subversive illegal but kind of cool too thats what he wanted to do wake up how secure was the encryption on this site are you brave enough to help yeah you chicken dyson are you intelligent enough to care care about what that was the problem wasnt it that no one cared about anything anymore help with what he typed do you know what a truth cookie is ah software vandalism ive heard of them a prank virus or a sophomoric trojan horse saboteurs slipped them into web products sometimes like microcores you ran the application and some illicit message popped up dumb stuff mostly jokes digs at the rich and famous or kooky theories of oppression and malfeasance water cooler talk but they worked like a kind of underground newspaper the oppositions version of reality the whole practice was more annoying than threatening to united corporations there were electronic screens to weed the junk out and employees suspected of inserting a truth cookie or reading too many of them sometimes wound up being given an opportunities transfer to a lower level dangerous as hell really to play with this stuff and fun to sneak looks at it we need your help daniel the world needs a truth cookie in your product the world needs to wake up we can make it safe very safe all of this is encrypted your electronic tracks erased its riskfree if you trust us trust who daniel felt a flush of tension i dont have the expertise how could he slip a cookie into something like the meeting minder it had to be impossible well teach you i dont have the truth well show you the truth look at this it needs to be known some code flashed on his screen it was a series of encryption keys a path into some companys database an address within it they wanted him to look at some file i dont know you he protested typing i dont trust you he thought a faceless cowl a challenge out of nowhere who was this guy but spartacus was already gone the code hung on his screen like the grin of the cheshire cat taunting him you chicken dyson he got up from his chair a moment and moved restlessly around his dim apartment a cat prowling its cage this was real wasnt it not a vid fantasy but real people doing real resistance provoking the establishment questioning challenging freethinking but for what what difference would it make there were power struggles on the united corporations board yes but the world was too comfortable to tolerate real change people rose and fell but the consortium of corporations that ran the world prevailed no one wanted truth cookies not really except that everyone read them repeated them in whispers added them to the nagging doubts and list of jokes and now he was being asked to be a part of it how had they found him but then hed found them hadnt he daniel sat back down and began going through the gift of code as hed suspected it was for a company something called genechem another bioengineering firm it seemed one of thousands the numbers took him past its electronic doors into its vaults and then into its cabinet drawers stealthily slyly like a thief in the night it was slick easy unbelievable a true insider had delivered this code like grease through a goose he snatched downloaded and as fast as he was able he was out and off the net damn he let out a breath hed been sweating the file was a memo he saw scientific gobbledygook most of it he skimmed it once and then went back to read carefully once twice three times before he really understood it more genesplicing playing with dna nothing new there this time it was for cereal grains he gathered and the variation would spread disease to insects wiping out some pest species entirely so but after australia wasnt that illegal truth cookie could he do it did he want to do it and if he did do it would it make him some kind of outlaw in the sherwood forest of the cyber underground cultivate conformity harriet lundeen had advised but she didnt have a secret did she hed sleep on it chapter three in the mornings he ran to run free his favorite time was the stillness of predawn when the city lights were fading and the sky was luminescent pearl before being bleached by full morning the air was still stale from urban inversion but had always cooled by nights end and the rhythmic pounding of his feet down the urban canyons put him in a trancelike state that lifted him out of his surroundings and into a different imagined world empty clean uncomplicated it was the same fantasy world he chased in his hasty vacations and urgent weekends he ran because he was calmed by the thump of his own pulse he ran because exhaustion replenished him he ran because sweat made him clean he dreamed of running so far that someday he would reach an edge an ending and a new beginning but he never did the city just went on and on and at the end of the longest runs when he was bent heaving his droplets of perspiration striking to make stars on the pavement he was always where he had begun in the grid the community the perfect inescapable world of united corporations breathless wrung out trapped alone then three mornings after his challenge from the cyber underground she ran by him she wore her dark hair under a cap that day so that in the dimness he thought she was a man at first given her easy lope and tall confidence women usually stuck to the security of the clubs to avoid unfiltered air and urban grit and the sullen stares of the drugdazed groundlings who lay listless in the shadows this woman did not at first daniel used her passing simply as an incentive to quicken his own pace keeping up but hanging back fifty feet only slowly did the details of the runners gait and figure make him realize he was following a female he was intrigued but concerned she was not just outside but alone and thus courting risk that couldnt be calculated danger that couldnt be calibrated in a world of everimproving safety longer lives and cradletograve security what rare dangers remained created in ordinary people an everrising anxiety life had become a series of guarantees and to abandon actuarial certainty for the sake of an outside run seemed brazen because of that he was intrigued who would take such a risk he followed her the beat of their footsteps making a synchronous echo against the enclosing steel and glass studying the nape of her neck and willing her to turn around she ignored him the woman took a bridge across the concrete chute of a dry river and on past the rust of decaying freight yards daniel had never come this way weeds had rooted in the cinders of the tracks and he noticed white and yellow blossoms on their stalks a sign of lifes tenacity she darted across a spray of broken glass ducked through a gap in the fence and jogged by the rustreddened wall of a warehouse she trespassed where whim took her as if boundaries were something to be ignored she ran across an overpass through a wilted square of park and down an avenue of gray and chipped apartment blocks then she abruptly stopped why are you following me daniel pulled up panting she hardly seemed winded her face was slightly flushed and the exercise had put a sheen to it he saw her skin caramel her eyes large luminous and dark her figure was formless beneath loose clothing but her face was quite arresting not just pretty but intelligent with a stamp of character or at least selfassurance high cheekbones a sensuous mouth a knockout really she looked at him curiously wary watchful he swallowed using his forearm to wipe his brow of sweat i was worried he tried to explain not really certain what the explanation was himself worried about you do i know you no no of course not i just rarely see other runners and a woman so just that you might meet someone the only other person out here is you he raised his hands to show they were empty i just are you some kind of pervert no no but you should be careful do you think i cant take care of myself he smiled at that i get the feeling you can she seemed slightly mollified you shouldnt follow people not women its frightening her look flickered away a moment distracted by a thought and then came back boldly she didnt seem very frightened they were silent eyeing each other look i apologize if i made you uncomfortable my name is daniel i saw you and i was intrigued women dont run alone at this time it might be dangerous to be outside its mentally dangerous to stay inside he paused daniel felt the same way but he hadnt met a woman who shared the sense of being caged the ones he knew seemed to enjoy their security the streets can be a maze i run a lot i thought maybe i could help you find your way im trying to lose my way he stopped again uncertain how to respond tiny beads of sweat had appeared on her forehead and she took off her cap shaking her hair it was thick and jet black lustrous who was this woman whats your name he asked she considered is that important he thought a moment she was expecting an intelligent reply some cultures named people for what they were like smith or baker he said some thought you became your name some were named for things observed at birth she shrugged its raven raven her caution was understandable thats all you need to know okay named for your hair she smiled if i was named for what i looked like at birth my name would be prune raven was a creature of legend smart elusive like you maybe you said we become our names he nodded and what do you do i think a better question is why do you do why think about it she turned to begin running again wait she glanced over her shoulder yes i want to see you again so run maybe well meet no see you where we can talk she turned to face him are you asking me on a date the question was so challenging he thought she was about to say no theres a good new restaurant date restaurants are overpriced and pretentious jesus this was a hard one well i know a club i dont like clubs its too loud to hear and when the music stops theres nothing worth hearing he took a breath what do you like she looked at him judging in a way he didnt entirely like and for a moment something in her eyes passed like a shadow i like cyberspace she finally said people have time to think before they communicate and they have the anonymity to be themselves i have to talk to you by email she laughed i like exploring i do too the cyber underground the what free thinkers on the net they question things lead you to new places his offer was implicit i can show you ah she nodded but seemed unimpressed ive heard of that i think unhappy people independent people she studied him again his clothes stained with sweat his manner betraying an underlying frustration and came to a decision how about a different underground what do you mean do you know the pitney tube stop yes meet me there tonight at nine tonight yes she smiled encouragingly come hungry bring a light a light for what but she was already sprinting for a corner before he had a chance to consider or change his mind bring a sense of adventure a sense of adventure daniel slipped off his optiglasses rocked back in his cubicle chair and stared up at the acoustical cones which jutted like stubby beige stalactites from the ceiling of level when had he lost his when he realized the planet was so thoroughly mapped that a palmtop and satellite could pinpoint your location to within a few feet of every rock and tree when he was cut from enough teams that he went from playing sports to watching them when he was bruised in enough relationships that he went from looking for commitment to avoiding it adventure happened to other people hed realized by age fourteen that he was never going to be an astronaut or mineral aquanaut those anointed were special their talent and selection by means mysterious and exclusive how had their lives taken such turns he was repeatedly urged to be ordinary to fit in to join groups so hed earned grades that were good but not special made friends who were fun but not close bought toys that were expensive but not meaningful taught that the universe was trillions of miles across and billions of years old he came to the private conclusion that it probably really didnt matter then whether he daniel dyson dust mote of creation turned left or right he went to school because you were supposed to and got a job because you were supposed to do that it was not that he wouldnt consider an alternative but simply that he had trouble conceiving of one everyone did what he did and took more pleasure than he could in dressing to the latest fashion embracing the latest fad and being hip to the latest stars food experiments and electronic gadgets in a mammoth world of migratory careers and anonymous neighborhoods conformity was the route to community it was how one belonged all this left him feeling detached instead of included the crowd would cheer when he would have preferred to observe in contemplative silence daniel had learned he could frighten himself with a thrill ride excite himself with erotica dare himself with adventure vacations and exhaust himself in a gymnasium workout but life that it seemed eluded him he was living his life waiting for life to show up his parents didnt sympathize with this dissatisfaction life his father had responded scornfully to his complaints of aimlessness life real life is getting kicked in the goddamned teeth life for most of that goddamned history you study without seeming to learn a goddamned thing was beating your brains out without reward coming home so damned tired you can hardly sleep because of the way your body ached and then getting up the next day to do it all over again life was getting sore and sick and old and passed over or dying young that was what real life was about life was losing so now we have a system where you dont have to lose where people are comfortable where things dont blow up or break down or go off in unpredictable directions and youre complaining youre missing something what youre missing is sorrow what youre missing is despair when his father proclaimed this repeating something scripted his habitual quiet desperation would give way to the kind of choleric excitement that eventually killed him life who needs it and then his father had dropped dead daniel stood up from his desk stretching his back the room was dim the flickering of his colleagues optiglasses illuminating it like the cold firelight of an old television there was the ambient hum of the hive the head of a supervisor round and featureless behind the smoked glass of one of the periphery offices rose briefly in curiosity at his movement and then went down again as placid as a grazing cow balloons floated above one cubicle marking a birthday for cynthia eaton lifes passages on a table by the water cooler was a halfeaten cake what was missing daniel should have answered was purpose hed succeeded in every task scheduled for him school a job a home except deciding for himself what success was his father claimed to have suffered no such misgiving accepting his corporations goals hed lived anxious died young and seemingly been proud of the whole sorry progression of it at least hed defended typical existence with exasperated doggedness believing it the path to the least pain in actuality daniel envied his fathers sense of belonging but he didnt share that sense hed been excited by his first days at microcore like any new employee relieved that the trauma of job interviewing was over and anxious to get on with the business of finding an apartment acquiring possessions and maybe even hunting for a wife yet it seemed to him that the more the company spoke about opportunity the less it offered and the more it preached unity and profit goals the more he felt alienated by its desire to absorb him and all his energies to suck his life whatever it should be into the greater life of its pyramid maybe he was too selfish maybe the others saw something he couldnt perceive perhaps that explained their enthusiasm he didnt know like many people daniel was a voyeur of lives that seemed more interesting than his own he enjoyed cyber videos movies books and music hed been bored by any practical course of study at university and so indulged himself with a pursuit of history what his father called the irrelevant weight of the past there he could go back to a time when the world was still unmapped and wit and skill were requirements for advancement it seemed to him that choices were simpler then to bend sail onto spars blaze a trail fight a battle life was more romantic with a clearer trajectory of youthful ambition and mature accomplishment at microcore things were backward the young were promoted over the old enthusiasm was valued more than experience provided loyalty was sufficiently demonstrated the key to success was unity toward corporate goals and social cultivation daniel resented these requirements because he wasnt any good at them he mocked the system because of his own lack of confidence at ever being able to succeed in it he constantly betrayed himself for a break from the monotony of code debugging he walked to the supply room he didnt need any supplies but he liked the smells of paper and glue in the room a musty contrast to the antiseptic plastics of microcores corridors he felt comforted by the accumulation of bulk products like sheaves of arrows kept in a castle armory against attack by an enemy reams of colored paper were aligned like the ranks of napoleonic soldiers a bright and proud symmetry made glorious by the certainty it would be shattered not by battle he conceded but rather by the more mundane sacrifice of memo and brochure glory thats what life lacks daniel thought the chance of sacrifice for a doomed ideal or to run to a new world to create ideals for yourself there was no room for glory in the modern world he thought no room for catapults raven had said to bring a light and he liked that how often in the city did you have to provide your own illumination or heat it was so bright you could never see the stars he liked the serendipity of their encounter a chance meeting that was now to lead to a rendezvous in a subway station bring a sense of adventure hed thought it wasnt needed maybe tonight with this intriguing new woman it would be chapter four she was prompt which daniel had learned not to expect from women she was waiting for him where are we going in the subway he asked not where youd expect daniel didnt really care her habit of answering obliquely amused him for the moment and he frankly evaluated her at the entrance to the tube station as shed evaluated him raven had not dressed in anything really feminine but her coversuit of synthetics stretched enough to show her to good advantage slim but with some shape to her enough to make him curious to see her in something else her hair cascaded down her shoulders and subtle jewelry sparkled her choice was the understatement of a woman who understood her effect on men daniel had dressed casually but with thought as well the walking shoes and durable denim shirt trying to suggest a kind of vigorous energy he calculated she might look for in a man if so she gave no sign she noticed you look nice he offered she smiled politely and dipped a shoulder to slip off a small backpack i carried this from home so now its your turn for a while its dinner when i suggested eating out i didnt mean to be so literal were going to be far out did you bring a light i didnt know what you meant ive got a flashlight an antique cigarette lighter and a matchbook i would have brought a table lamp but it was awkward under my arm she laughed at that good its best to be prepared then she skipped ahead of him and down the stairs into the tube station he followed commuters were still streaming upward to go home trudging in a sluggish gray river of the rumpled and tired none smiled whispersigns tried to cheer them in the world of united corporations murmured one security assures happiness daniel got out his fare card and prepared to breast the current but raven tugged his arm this way she ducked into a shadowy side corridor past posted signs that limited entry to authorized transit employees only did she work for the tube they came to a locked door a tapping of her fingers at the keycard panel and they were in the heavy metal clicking behind them they were in a maintenance storeroom daniel saw filled with janitorial supplies youre a sanitation engineer i got the combination from a friend he works here parttime ah was she looking for a mop and cleanser tryst come here often he asked lightly glancing around at the shelves of chemicals we couldve just gone to my place she was at the back of the room working at something on the wall and didnt even bother to glance back at him dont kid yourself there was a clank and she lifted a vent grate to one side come on there was a sign above the vent opening entry forbidden cant you read he joked she was already backing into a concrete chute her legs dropping down out of sight cant you think for yourself he followed her to the back of the room and ducked his head through the opening a concrete tube with rungs led into darkness below raven had already swung onto the ladder and was rapidly climbing downward a light at her belt illuminating the next rungs daniel followed mystified his feet fumbling in the gloom when he reached the bottom thirty feet below he switched on his own light three tunnels branched out bulbs glimmering distantly down two of them there was the wet dusty smell of concrete are we supposed to be down here he asked who are you asking daniel me them she pointed toward the surface or yourself she waited a moment for his answer watching his face he looked around then grinned at her lead on she took the central tunnel and they emerged in a wider underground corridor this one brightly lit by lamps every thirty feet it stretched to a vanishing point in each direction branching tunnels marked by ovals of shadow there was a low hum of ventilation fans and a current of air the concrete tube walls were lined with pipes two of them a meter wide and others stepping down in size to an electrical conduit the width of a garden hose signs dangled with numbers and arrows dyson felt as if he was in a labyrinth where are you taking me to the minotaur she glanced at him appreciatively a classical reference are you a scholar a history major damned useless my father called it did he what does your father do he died in marketing a profession so futuristic in its outlook that he had a heart attack trying to stay trendy he didnt regard history as merely irrelevant he saw it as a threat to all he worked for which guaranteed id gravitate to it he sounds like a man of strong opinions loud opinions anyway he believed in the kind of progressive change that keeps things exactly the way they are i think he liked what the world became organized and you dont its dull do you really think so she looked at him with interest i feel squeezed sometimes yes she nodded as if hed given a correct answer and what about your mother she learned not to have opinions which i guess made her minor in feminist literature useless as well all theory no practice she used to say i inherited some of her waffle genes and did you agree i didnt agree with much of anything after age twelve but like most kids i didnt prevail i merely escaped a history degree was my best revenge you sound about as close to your parents as i am to mine too strict too absent i was adopted she didnt seem inclined to elaborate when she was widowed my mother announced she was turning over a newly independent leaf daniel said three months later she married a clone of my father and retired with him to costa rica on the insurance i havent seen her for two years and you feel guilty relieved she watched for some sign of how this estrangement affected him but his mask was indifferent well my theory is that no one knows whats needed or useless until theyre dead maybe not even then so how do you choose you follow your heart even into the pit of the minotaur the mythical monsters have been sponged from our world daniel were not in a labyrinth were in the utiligrid the utility network that feeds the city these tunnels go for miles miles and miles they lead to reservoirs power rooms sewers waste masticators its amazing really and were not supposed to be here im supposed to be here why because it makes me feel alive she lifted her head and shouted alive the call echoed down the corridor jesus youll get us caught she laughed maybe are you frightened of that no he glanced over his shoulder just nervous okay theres nothing down here but utility robots with brain chips about as smart as the potato variety and were not hurting a thing by exploring come on i can take the pack for a while well go to our picnic spot no ive got it she teased him gallant as well a man of the past sometimes i think im in the wrong century do you again she seemed to be appraising him it reminded him of the joke about a first date being a job interview that goes on all evening she didnt offer agreement walking the utiligrid was indeed like exploring a labyrinth but raven seemed to know where she was going ive learned to read the signs she explained occasionally the ground would tremble from the passage of a tube train overhead or they would hear the rumble of pumps from behind steel doors but mostly there was a humming stillness their steps echoing on concrete its eerie down here daniel said empty like a catacomb dont you like it empty everywhere else is full i like to get away down here is an away that gets to the heart of things suddenly a dot of red danced across them and there was a warning beep a detection laser they turned and saw the lights of a maintenancebot growing in intensity as it sped down the tunnel toward them its orange crown flashing uhoh daniel said the machine could summon the police run he yanked her arm and they sprinted down a side tunnel raven actually laughing as they fled there was a bang as the janitorial vehicle took the corner too hard and bounced off the concrete then it was wheeling their way beeping madly its dim circuitry probably assuming they were some kind of giant rat in need of fumigation he turned into one tunnel and another utterly lost and then raven sprinted ahead of him to lead twisting this way and that in the maze like a deer as the alarm shrilled behind them daniel followed her as he had on the run noticing the swell of her hips and rhythm of her bottom as she ran you sexually hopeless lunatic he scolded himself then she pointed above at a dark hole in the ceiling and sprang grasping a pipe she looped her feet to catch the overhead piping with her heels and then boosted herself up into blackness daniel jumped pulled and kicked his legs to follow they were in a tube that led upward but his climb ended when he banged into a steel cover there was just enough room under its lid to squeeze together above the pipes she was breathing hard grinning at him as the robot cart went honking by underneath in what seemed to be a machine imitation of frustration what if it calls for help i dont think the cops like to come down here he realized that they were pressed against each other to wedge in place and he could feel the softness of her hair her smell had the sweetness of slight perfume and the tang of sweat he was considering whether to try to kiss her when she turned and kissed him quickly and hard that was fun she whispered youre going to get us detained no the robots are stupid he leaned forward to kiss her again but she pushed him back we cant stay here though in case they search this quadrant she dropped down through the pipes to land lightly on the floor i thought you said the cops dont come he called down to her ive never seen them but come on before it comes back great he dropped to follow her jogging form through the corridors she turned this way and that with determined purpose glancing upward at the dangling signs periodically for reference the frantic beeping of the robot quickly receded and they began to relax slowing to a brisk walk as daniel got his breath back he noticed a background murmur that rose in volume until it became the roar of falling water she led him into a side passageway and down a flight of wet steps his curiosity growing as the noise grew then out onto a balcony grating the water comes from the mountains raven said someday i want to see its source they were overlooking an underground reservoir lit by only a few lights a vaulted ceiling receded back into darkness water was pouring in from an unseen pipe creating a pattern of ripples that sparkled in the artificial light the water glowed blue emphasizing the cisterns clarity this is my private spot she said they sat howd you find this place ive been coming down here for two years and you never got lost or caught no one ever challenged me i started drawing maps deciphering signs and slowly figured it out its been like exploring an underground world when i found this reservoir it was like id discovered my own private lake less pretentious than a restaurant quieter than a club she smiled exactly you should like me daniel im a cheap date she opened the pack and took out their dinner ordinary stuff farmedsalmon sandwiches wedges of genetically enhanced vegetables vacupacked brownies what did you bring us to drink she asked mischievously he opened his mouth in surprise hed supposed they would buy something no matter she pulled out a small pail that was tied to a string and lowered it over the railing to the pool below when it filled she lifted it up and sipped then she held it out to him with two hands like an offering is it safe she laughed again that delicious laugh its the same water in your apartment except it hasnt flowed through the grub of city pipes yet this way i dont have to carry a canteen waters heavy he took the pail and drank watching her over the rim it seemed sweeter and colder than the water at home ill bet this is against the rules everything is against the rules isnt it everything thats good they ate quietly a moment daniel unsure whether he liked her or was merely intrigued by someone so eccentric it would be interesting to get her in the same room with harridan lundeen yet despite the kiss and her trespassing boldness she also seemed somewhat shy he judged or at least reserved guarded her enigmatic replies deflected as much as they revealed and she volunteered little why had she brought him here this isnt exactly the great outdoors he finally ventured trying to feel her out dont you like it its weird interesting not a typical choice im betting youre not a typical man and youre not a typical woman no he made a guess a loner im not alone with you daniel took a bite of brownie watching her pretty smart a bit full of herself maybe selfabsorbed certainly but interesting too he leaned forward slightly and watched her unconsciously lean away standoffish she liked to control relationships her assertion of leadership kept her safe why did you bring me here he asked she smiled mischievously again youre cute handsome even he rolled his eyes no thats not it she corrected thanks raven its more that youre curious that you think that you question that you explore like you maybe like me she sipped from the pail setting it down so have you decided why you do he sat back i dont understand what you mean by that well what do you do i work on software at microcore dumb stuff i hate it why because its pointless right now theyve got me on a project called a meeting minder it tracks your schedule and analyzes its patterns prescheduling based on your past activity the goal is to make the next year as close to the last one as possible for maximum efficiency theyre expecting a bestseller i know its dumb i meant why do you work on it he looked at her in surprise because its my job everyone has a job why united corporations has the right job in the right place for everyone he quoted no why she looked impatient as if he were slow he felt irritated what do you do im an investigator investigating what she waved her hand here this now me and you not exactly the wilderness something thats been explored by others can still be a wilderness to you if its your first time he looked around well youve got me lost do you like being lost i dont know was this a conversation or an interrogation its not a question that occurred to me sorry i ask a lot of things dont i im curious too im not mindless like that janitor robot raven i didnt say you were you imply it by acting superior with your whys i think i read i have hobbies i just built a catapult im on a career track but im also my own man and i have adventures in my own way right now im trying to hack into microcores expense database i want to put my bosses obscene work charges on the corporate intraweb she looked interested at that why why why he mimicked youre like a twoyearold why to elevate the gossip to show i can whats the point the point is that there is no point she began to nod then shook her head i understand your point about pointlessness but hacking into expense accounts is kind of juvenile dont you think its just a different kind of investigation no different than this tunnel im also in touch with the cyber underground you mentioned that before a bunch of people pretending right rebels without a cause its people who think for themselves i think youd be intrigued if you tried it perhaps she conceded but whats there to see really you learn whats truly going on without the united corporations spin he wanted to impress her you can use it to wake up but do you really believe that stuff i mean i heard it was crackpot they put me inside another company raven they let me download its secret now she looked intrigued she sat up straighter tucking her legs beneath her what secret as conspiratorial as a schoolgirl well i dont know she leaned back disappointed rumors right no this was real could he trust her here was a soul mate he hoped someone who felt like he did a file genetic plans by this company to modify cereal grains to transmit disease to insects she took another sip of water watching him bugs whats wrong with that what was wrong with it it seemed less sinister when he tried to describe it was this really worthy of a truth cookie suddenly he was less certain it might wipe out whole species it messes with the environment oh she thought theres been a reform law hasnt there its probably okay if all these scientists are working on it dont you think what company he was discouraged at her reaction but didnt want to back down genechem never heard of them but to play devils advocate theyre not in business to screw up right theyre not in business to break the law we modify crops all the time have to in a world with twelve billion people so we unleash disease on insects sure what about australia raven we learned from it i hope she glanced away a moment and then back as if trying to decide whether to tell him something look im not endorsing this genechem im just asking how are we you and me to know were not scientists were not management theres a difference between poking fun and challenging expert opinion she was watching him again and he didnt know if this was what she really felt or if she was testing him somehow dammit he couldnt figure her out what if this mutates he asked what if grasshoppers eat all the wheat and the world starves daniel civilization has been modifying crops for ten thousand years now this underground of yours gives you one file and suddenly you have a monopoly on truth maybe theres more to the story you sound like united corporations trust us you dont see the big picture their patronizing attitude drives me crazy im not patronizing you then kiss me again she looked suddenly uncertain and turned away no she wanted to he was sure of it you kissed me before i i was in the moment what about this moment she turned back taking a breath i dont have to kiss you just because we came down here or just because i did it once or just because youre hacking corporate secrets or just because im playing devils advocate he slumped back okay all right already i want to kiss you except she paused uncertain looking at him curiously as if he baffled her as much as she baffled him there was something she wasnt saying this electronic snooping is in the establishments arena you know their game i brought you down here because it seems outside that world i thought you might feel the water the magic of this place i dont think you did how do you know what i feel i know i dont think you even know how you feel miss why or why you do one minute youre breaking into utility tunnels and the next defending their witch doctory she looked down at that she was thinskinned he thought and there was a moments satisfaction at pricking her but the arguing was silly raven i think we need to reboot it was slang that had come from the early days of computers yes i dont want to quarrel i was just debating a point about corrupting the ecosystem about feeding the world so i should ignore this kind of genechem stuff ignore the truth you cant know the truth none of us can i know the sloganeering of united corporations isnt the truth but dont you accept it conform compromise im tired of compromising im tired of being the odd man out at work again she looked interested why he groaned why am i tired why are you always the odd man out my colleagues say i dont believe in anything that i have no faith in what were doing he stopped as if to consider the truth of that opinion for the first time i dont know i just look at everything sideways and it comes out funny what if the sideways view is the right one daniel what if youre right what if theyre right he shook his head now youve got me talking like you going in circles waffle genes he looked at her in discouragement i dont even know what side youre on no you dont know which side youre on thats all ive been getting at he stood suddenly tired of this look im sorry i disappointed you she stood too you didnt its for the best i think am i going to see you again she shook her head i dont think so okay fine its not for the reason you think sure he glanced around maybe you could show me the way out of here listen raven said reaching out to grip his arm he started at her touch if we live in their world we make a thousand compromises right we take their pay eat their bioengineered food its inescapable correct he looked at her gloomily unless we truly escape she went on but we cant except to cyberspace he said with exasperation thats my whole point thats why the cyber underground is important the worlds one big company now or at least a consortium of them one country one culture one bottom line what if it wasnt daniel what if there was an alternative escape where down here he glanced up at the concrete ceiling no thanks no someplace else do something that takes courage to do what do you mean she took a breath i might go away thats what i meant about not seeing you not kissing you he was puzzled at this away theres an adventure company oh adventure travel was commonplace daniel had climbed rafted paraglided ive done that it makes a good vacation no this one is different he frowned they werent different they shepherded their clients showed them some dirt and flowers with a downhome twang and at the end held them upside down until all the credit cards fell out of their pockets it was an industry like any other its thrills and corny jokes and wellworn trails and easy lectures as ritualized as japanese theater how is it different sometimes you dont come back the trek is dangerous there were always release forms because some of the climbs and treks and dives were genuinely risky it was danger that gave it the thrill its in australia what its a new company called outback adventure immersion in a total wilderness its up to you to find your own way out raven thats crazy its the ultimate challenge daniel the toughest thing left but australia is quarantined the plague is over according to this new company but thats why this whole thing about genechem could be important the fiasco in australia has been learned from you cant be serious about going there i want to experience true wilderness in the rockies not there its got to be a scam she shook her head i dont think so united corporations has kept it quiet for a reason for the few who seek them out its seen as an outlet a test an opportunity its kind of exciting actually to be chosen i mean they dont take just anyone daniel he looked at her in disbelief australia the place was a planetary nightmare a scientific embarrassment even if the travel ban had been lifted it was like proposing to honeymoon in hiroshima or take the waters in chernobyl it didnt make sense raven the place was a hell hole during the dying now its pristine she looked away thats what they say he swallowed and youre going maybe alone slowly she nodded im better alone i think he managed a pained grin thank you for sharing that she cast her eyes downward i didnt mean that quite the way it sounded i might go with the right person if i could find them but so far i havent it has to be somebody ready to change their life somebody who cant stand their life here somebody outback adventure would take she waited so that was it this had been some kind of audition had all her friends already turned her down why havent i heard about this outback adventure he stalled its a secret a secret you have to keep they have to control public knowledge to make it work a secret like your genechem and you think i should go too im not sure youre ready daniel you dont know that its you who doesnt know chapter five still smarting from ravens doubt daniel was called into the office of section supervisor luther cox four days later harriet lundeen issued the invitation to enter what the office serfs called the glass cages an employee of dysons rank was hired in the supervisory offices fired or given an opportunities transfer in the supervisory offices and otherwise had little reason to be there except to receive bad news if microcore had glad tidings to extend they would be announced out in the cubicles where other employees could either take heart at group reward or redouble their competitive efforts to match the good fortune of a colleague public display of reprimands and demotions in contrast was considered to be bad form and unnecessary since news of what went on behind the closed door usually swept through level like wildfire anyway sit down mr dyson daniel sat in a couch that faced his supervisor the sofa was so soft that he sank almost to his haunches an awkward position that left him unable to see the top of the mans desk cox loomed above him his balding head like an egg against milky sky visible through the tinted glass of his window daniel assumed the choice of furniture was deliberate you wished to discuss the meeting minder sir he preempted hoping to steer the conversation in a neutral direction cox looked surprised and slightly confused no it was apparent he had little idea what his employee was working on this concerns your extracurricular activities mr dyson extracurricular cox picked up a folder and pretended to read ive received a report of employee intrusion into corporatesecure computer files specifically microcore expense report recordings by its senior employees though the target hardly matters given the serious breach of the companys ethical guidelines he started who said this about me sir it hardly matters does it weve had our experts look into the matter and your electronic fingerprints are all over the system daniel shifted uneasily he was better than that wasnt he this isnt the first report ive had of a problem with your attitude we have logs of cyber chats with a lot of unproductive people postings from the nets underground search engines for the unsavory you seem to spend more time whining than working my electronic communications are supposed to be private he objected youre sarcastic in company meetings his boss was now reading from the folder you mock or ignore group dynamic interaction exercises your absences for alleged illness are excessive your pace of promotion lags behind target timetables you display little concern for your future your saving retirement and insurance allowances are nowhere close to suggested goals you procrastinate on assignments you dont like finish those you do in half the time and then play games with the remainder your desk is a pigsty decorated with objects calculated to offend the political sensitivities of just about every demographic group your cultural attunement is appalling attunement now ms lundeen has had to begin confiscating your toys cox bent to a box and put something on the edge of his desk it was the catapult of course model making isnt in your job description mr dyson what if youd put someones eye out with this thing it was designed to lob more than throw and the payload was only a piece of enough cox brought his fist down on the catapult and its pencilarms blew apart with a crack fragments went flying across the room there was dead silence for a moment what if that had put my eye out his bosss look was thunderous then we could believe in poetic justice daniel was silent cox could make his existence an unhappy one his supervisor sat back and sighed theatrically having given this lecture before this company and section is run on the principle of hierarchy and harmony mr dyson on group cooperation on a common belief in our goals processes and schedules increasingly you dont seem to share that the quiet was so intense that the ventilators seemed to roar as daniel fought to maintain the composure that had been drilled into him all his life of course he didnt share it he never had you went to school so you could work so you could retire so you could die it was absurd no one had ever wanted to pay him for exploration of subjects he found interesting and yet his employers seemed equally bored with what they did assign life was numbing dammit friendship had given way to relationships marriage was fragile entertainment was isolating a retreat into private fantasy art had become a slavish recycling of what had sold before scientific discovery had become so technical that it spoke only to specialists he felt like a cog in an accelerating machine that had forgotten its own purpose process had become the goal the schedule had become the measure of success he didnt share this of course not and yet there was no alternative you endured or were reassigned to a worse endurance the world had become homogenized you compromised and conformed and measured any rebellion into tiny permissible packets of individuality until you were brought up short like now none of this could be voiced of course there was no graver sin than pointing out the obvious look mr cox he said carefully im not trying to be disrespectful or cause trouble i just get a little bored sometimes my group calls our project the mindless minder maybe if i could get a promotion out of your section to a higher more challenging level deserved no doubt for your sterling leadership skills maybe if i had a chance to demonstrate them demonstrate to who mr dyson who would follow you before you can lead you must learn to follow before anyone believes in your direction you must believe in yourself everything ive just recited predicts the classic pattern of workplace failure a person who chooses not to fit in who is unfit for group cooperation and thus individual advancement a malcontent im trying to stay content by having fun by snooping gossiping building toys by trying to bring some life to this place come on mr cox you know what its like here no wonder they built the damn headquarters like a pyramid everyone inside it acts like theyre dead speak for yourself we call it the velvet coffin its so comfortable its confining weve got the health plan the vacation plan the christmas plan the retirement plan the job development plan the mortgage plan the partnership plan next well have the sex plan my life is set before ive even lived it employees here joke were like vampires we only come alive at night the world is organized that way for a purpose mr dyson from purpose comes reward thats what is lacking my reward i dont find your flippancy funny you mock our system here but its built on the first economic model to enjoy true global success if you dont believe that read your history books i know what you studied in college and compare the past to the present unemployment its gone the united corporations of which we and every other multinational are a part has the right job in the right place for everyone war gone from a world in which the multinationals have merged with government to eliminate such gross inefficiency crime largely gone with guaranteed rehabilitation the morally impaired are given new lives poverty its gone except for the voluntary poor in the united corporations world success is the product of group achievement while failure can only be the result of individual inadequacy in todays society everyone becomes a winnerif they belong daniel sat without expression hed heard this a thousand times and why this success because united corporations has allowed market forces to achieve their potential yes there are a lot of rules but in a planet still gaining a hundred million new inhabitants every year those rules allow all of us to live in enlightened harmony under the singapore model you cant argue with that kind of contentment its so perfect its boring thats what you dont understand mr dyson thats why you feel unchallenged its not perfect perfection is an everreceding goal our lives can never be boring because were always in pursuit of unobtainable perfection sustained challenge under united corporations things are always getting better all the time but always can get better still do you really believe that sir believe in belief dyson thats the key his look softened im not deaf to your pleas for a challenge you know i want to channel your ambition i want my employees to be where they belong so i want you to think seriously about your future i want you to be alert to new opportunities there may be a way to tap your energies who knows but first you have to prove you can meet the expectations of our work environment here and if i cant united corporations has the right job in the right place for everyone the threat was clear its time to grow up the reprimand gnawed at daniel the rest of the day it confirmed what he already knew that his career was going nowhere grow up he felt sometimes that he was the only grownup in a pyramid of obedient children yet hed trapped himself in a pointless strategy of mild rebellion that accomplished nothing except to keep him from rising above level there was a very real chance cox could choose to send him down for insubordination and poor performance at which time hed become a pariah to whatever level had to take him in the mona pietris of this world would regard him as toxic waste worse than this gloomy review of his prospects was his suspicion of betrayal by raven had she tattled on his hacking boast if not the timing of his section leaders lecture was remarkably coincidental if so why because he hadnt jumped at the chance to vacation in a continent once ravaged by plague ridiculous yet doubt built on doubt was it mere coincidence that hed met a lone pretty woman out running in the dimness of predawn so incongruous and enigmatic everything about her seemed so different from other women he had known challenging independent mysterious like a rebel a priestess a spy to spy on what daniel dyson lowlevel key clicker in one of a million ant nests of capitalism the man on a path to nowhere it was absurd spies are supposed to seduce their victims not dismiss them in an underground tunnel computer files had been erased to the electronic waste bin with more ceremony than hed been dumped by raven shed probably already forgotten his existence hed not forgotten her however she was a misfit and argumentative but then so was he accordingly he was intrigued by her no other woman hed met questioned so much hed believed for a moment that they felt the same things shared the same longings the fact shed seemed to conclude otherwise had left him all the more determined to prove it to her hed once thought he had all the time and all the women in the world not that he was particularly successful at romantic conquest but rather that romantic possibility seemed theoretically inexhaustible there were six billion women he looked for flaws because he was naive enough to expect perfection and so when he fell in love with a woman named katrina whod subsequently proven challenging in her eccentricities hed let her go hed been too proud to risk failure by trying to win her over too arrogant to accept her faults shed haunted him for the next three years now he had that same sense of puzzled excitement again as if he knew raven one sojourn in a glorified sewer pipe and shed brought back that same rush of unstable desire an echo of pained longing and now the reprimand had linked them again right you idiot he kept repeating to himself leave her alone the admonition did no good he walked after work to clear his head of her and yet the city seemed vacuous the incessant pop songs of the cafes and arcades seemed annoyingly repetitious the iridescent avenues ablaze from shows and pleasure palaces seemed like a deliberate distraction from whatever he was truly straining to see he couldnt decide what to eat from the food court choices where ever more inventive spicing had so exhausted his palate that he could taste nothing at all he finally retreated to his apartment and scanned eight minutes of entertainment listings finding nothing that engaged either his mind or his emotions he had nowhere to go nothing to do no one he wanted to see except her had she betrayed him he sat on his terrace and watched the artificial suns of advertisers rise into the dark sky once more as he chewed on a readymeal life was easy if you simply went along he conceded work was usually an undemanding set of rote motions his pay was adequate for all but the silliest luxuries and entertainment could be as allconsuming as one wished other people lived for baseball or theater or console games and seemed content why couldnt he why did he do damn her it was necessary to find her for his own peace of mind hed put it to her plainly did you rat on me shed deny it hed ask for a meeting to clear the air if she showed it would be excuse enough to he didnt even know her last name yeah you know what you were thinking with he went to his terminal and sat for a moment drumming his fingers in frustration what was the name of her vacation company outback adventure he ran computer searches for it and found nothing which was strange had it all been a lie he ran searches under her name raven he turned up ornithology texts and native american legends but no address or link good grief and he was contemplating mucking about with truth cookies he was a humbled hacker his electronic trail at microcore embarrassingly plain an amateur in an age when privacy consultants made millions so it was decision time how serious was he did he really care of course he did it was a challenge now it wasnt boring like microcore he called fitzroy the onetime cop had the pals the codes and an evault full of passwords but it would cost daniel a thousand dollars a days wages to get a lead on a woman who had rejected him foolish he knew dammit though he wanted to confront her he wanted to know yeah fitzroys grizzled head swollen to giant dimension on daniels vidwall popped into view christ the man was ugly at that resolution bagged rheumy eyes sallow skin veined nose nobody had to be homely anymore why didnt the guy get a laserlift because he lived in his machine not the world a cyber hermit it was the one place he had power his own personal heaven i need something hold on the screen fuzzed came back fitzroy had switched on his scrambler yeah a woman what a surprise geez ive never heard that one before ive got a first name and some tourist outfit she says she might sign on with but thats all i need their numbers can you get it the private detective snorted thats it if its easy maybe you can give me a discount fuck that give me what you got her names raven raven what the hell kind of astral handle is that she a fucking indian or something no maybe i dont know what does it matter you couldnt get her last name it didnt come up gotcha well whats her company where does she live i dont know i first ran into her in calabria and met her later at pitney tube geez either the shortest relationship in history or you move quicker with less talk than anybody ive heard of you dont know anything about her if i knew anything i wouldnt need you look i may be getting jacked around here im suspicious of her sos theres a company i want you to check out called genechem heard of it spell it theres only about fifty million fucking genesoftmicrotech bullshit companies out there by now all of them farting vaporware and dna that doesnt work i wish theyd go back to vanity names you can remember like chrysler or kellogg what was wrong with that mine is fitzroy investigations simple honest none of this netwebsplicetel crap you know right daniel spelled it now this raven says shes going on a trip with a company whose name youll like simple honest outback adventure outdoor adventure this is what swing sets pickle ball outback not outdoor adventure travel oh yeah right bugs and dirt jesus people are stupid thats another five hundred why cant i ever get a discount fitzroy because i have to eat he clicked off daniel paced straightening up he was as neat at home as he was untidy at the office the company shrink would have a field day with that one after an hour there was a chime and the detective was back on his screen i dont see the transfer in my account yet i wanted to make sure you could get the stuff that was a thousand fifteen hundred einstein whatever he clicked some commands it should be there he saw fitzroy glance away then back nobody wants to pay their fucking bills what you got the only thing in our favor is the unusual first name theres just a few of them so i could eliminate by age location occupation no possible interest in outdoor adventure that kind of thing and and this is some broad youre stalking if i got the right one fancy name fancy address she even looks good on her identscreen this the one raven even took a good license picture thats her the last name decarlo lahdedahdah decarrrrlo my my i dont think you can afford this one newbie shes actually a cheap date cost you fifteen hundred this night romeo listen i got her number and her address you want that of course fitzroy blanked out and the screen flickered with the information daniel printed it out and destroyed the file and transmission record he was in enough hot water for privacy violations already paper you could burn eat shred bytes were forever the detective came into view again and the adventure company daniel asked him that ones odd no opendoor web address no ad no listed number pretty tough to buy from so i get a refund you gotta be kidding i found em through an industrial link to export firms theyve got a keyworded web entry encryption a bunch of other bullshit export firm what does that mean a kink in your romance you cant kink what you dont have but maybe this woman is being conned she thinks its a vacation outfit you sure you got the right company fitzroy laughed if you got the right name maybe they put airholes in their shipping containers can i get in the detective shook his head the site is invitation only you need the password the encrypted entry code and its all proprietary maybe this broad knows it his grin was a leer for fifteen hundred bucks shed better know something chapter six you found me there was no surprise in ravens voice no delight no disapproval it was rather a flat statement over the vidphone her face on the monitor displaying a cool perusal of his own it was as if shed expected to hear from him again i need to see you are you sure thats wise we need to talk why he could accuse her of getting him into trouble at microcore but suspected shed simply hang up its about this company you said you might go with outback adventure theres something funny about it her look was wary what do you mean its not even a regular company i think youve talked to them no but i asked about it and its not listed in any regular theres a reason for that what reason you have to ask them i cant even figure out how to reach them you need a code he was puzzled but that doesnt make sense for a company trying to attract customers thats not what theyre trying to do they dont need customers their customers need them what the hell did that mean listen raven what do you really know about this outfit it changes lives daniel how she said nothing please see me he asked again i dont want you to get hurt by signing on with the wrong group i told you i could take care of myself please i need to talk with you about what about us he wanted to say about the outback she looked at him gravely evaluating again if youre sure i thought you didnt like the idea of australia you told me i didnt know what i liked i tried to make you think now youve found me its happening as its supposed to so ill talk to you again about it if you insist but its your idea not mine ive got your address i could no she shook her head decisively ill meet you ill meet you at cordoba mall a coffee place anthonys i want to explain the situation so you dont make a mistake okay it was something tomorrow at eight tomorrow at eight bring a sense of adventure he half expected her not to show up instead she came and was prettier than ever raven was wearing a dark dress with a floral print and gold jewelry set off against her black hair and the dress caressed her in a way to confirm his speculation about her figure the effect was a quiet elegance completely at odds with the jumpsuit shed worn for underground exploring she was like a woman whod gone from camping to cocktails she ordered black coffee declining his invitation for a light dinner or dessert and eyed him speculatively she was subdued as if undecided about something him he supposed her smile was completely false thanks for coming he said politely you must have made an effort to find me she observed as the waitress left i didnt leave you much to go on i didnt think youd want to see me again and i wanted to give you an excuse not to why didnt you think i would want to see you again i wasnt at my best in the tunnels i get moody sometimes i dont blame people if theyre put off by it its just the way i am a loner i wasnt put off i thought you were interesting i just wasnt sure you liked me she was saved from having to answer immediately by the arrival of their coffee she spooned some sugar into hers stirring it thoughtfully and then looked up at him i like you daniel she finally allowed but it makes me uncomfortable frankly that i like you i dont like everyone i meet oh he was uncertain how to respond to this but then i got in trouble at work he finally continued about some of the things i told you about she shrugged if shed betrayed his confidence she didnt want to admit it it got me thinking he went on watching her im not really happy at my job theyre not happy with me maybe i need a break so i got curious about this australian thing you mentioned this outback adventure ive never heard anything about treks like that i wonder if its even true so i tried to find them and couldnt theyre not easy to find i know she looked at him speculatively i mentioned it because i thought you might be interested but then as we talked i changed my mind i doubt its for you but it is for you not necessarily they probably wouldnt pick me either pick you she avoided his eyes again playing with her coffee spoon i told you its not like the usual adventure company its limited entry a privilege you have to find them and apply and then they dont take everyone its very exclusive but how do people find them she shrugged through an acquaintance she was careful not to say friend he noticed sometimes people just stumble across it the ones looking for something sometimes the company finds you it pops up on your screen thats weird isnt it she took a sip is it they seem to find the right people to go outback adventure is listed as an export company not a tourism outfit she shrugged how do you know theyre even legitimate ive talked with them and its exciting daniel lifechanging they just have to keep a lid on information about the situation in australia that secret part adds a thrill but not for me she sighed thats for you to decide isnt it im just trying to not waste your time raven glanced out at the mall for a moment then returned her gaze to him why wouldnt i fit because youre confused because you have to be absolutely certain you belong there its a very rugged experience maybe youre better at adjusting to the city than you think even if you dont realize it right now my advice is not to give up on microcore its a good company they know what theyre doing but im not adjusted its always the sideways view like we talked about she glanced out the cafe again did she have some boyfriend waiting out there her distraction irritated him then call them up if you want i cant its encrypted i know theres a password or words can i get them she shifted restlessly im only hesitating because i dont want to mislead you its dangerous difficult which you can take and i cant i didnt say that give me the password raven i warned you right youve done everything but let me judge all right she conceded the point you can log in with erehwon she spelled it what does that mean its just code and the passwords are getting back getting back to what nature it means whatever you want it to mean i suppose but why an export company to deter the casually curious i think to discourage mere tourists after you listen to them it will make more sense what if we looked into it together she took another sip i dont think so as friends we could even go together friends im not your friend daniel im just this strange woman you met whos revealed a potential opportunity and decided its better for us each to go our own way she stood abruptly look this discussion is hard for me but i cant really explain why maybe you should just forget it forget me get on with your life i dont have a life dont look for it from me im looking for something to shake up my life maybe this outback adventure is it maybe but you have to decide without me then she walked quickly away the code gave him access to a web site with an opening picture of a redsand desert dotted with bright green trees australia he assumed projected onto his apartment video wall the scene had a brilliant vividness daniel felt like he was standing on a dune heat on his back the immediacy was arresting welcome to outback adventure a female voice intoned to begin your adventure please enter the passwords dyson remained puzzled why would any company make it an obstacle to hear about its product surely that violated some profit commandment maybe it was a kind of reverse psychology he cleared his throat getting back there was a pause and then two tiny figures appeared at the edge of his screen confirmation that the site had been activated the two began angling up the dune toward daniel a teaser scrolled across the bottom of the screen for people who ask not what they do but why they do then the picture froze so raven decarlo was a parrot of slogans not that different from mona pietri perhaps show more he ordered the couple advanced again coming side by side near the top of the dune and closing to almost fill the screen wind blowing through their hair daniel almost laughed they were both striking and bizarre the woman had flamecolored hair and sapphireblue eyes daniel suspected imagery augmentation and was a model of barbarian chic her fur and leather garb was cut to show a flat midriff and a muscled thigh she wore armbands of bone and leather and was holding a staff the man dark and chiseled was in skintight ninja black from neck to boots a bandolier with silver throwing knives cinched taut across his chest the pair looked like they belonged in a bgrade fantasy he knew they were actors in front of a blue screen projected onto a distant australia what kept daniel from surfing on in dismissal was the look in their eyes as they gazed out over the desert whether acted or real they seemed to have found what they were looking for it was a look of triumph of fulfillment of satisfied destiny no one in the city looked that way welcome to the outback daniel dyson a voice boomed its amplification like a growl of thunder hello god he thought wryly in reply can you meet the challenge of outback adventure daniel was surprised at the speed with which his identity had been confirmed by the company corporate identification of those logging on to web sites and the greeting of electronic customers was routine but this time it happened so fast it was almost as if theyd been expecting him raven again or just good demographic sifting ive never heard of your company daniel challenged the redhead turned to look and smile her teeth were perfect her skin glowing her breathing fetching would you like to know more yes he replied his curiosity only one of the things aroused now mr bandolier turned to him virtual reality daniel odd term isnt it as if an imitation of life is worth spending your life on are you tired of pretend peril and artificial ecstasy i do things the desert dweller smiled and is what you do what you think life should be or does it feel like some distant imitation of it like touching skin through a mitten peering through fog daniel was quiet sometimes life did feel like that what if you had a chance to feel life raw a chance to explore a new world and in doing so explore yourself a chance to start fresh on a vacation trek daniel was dubious mr bandolier shook his head outback adventure is no vacation my friend no walk in the park its the toughest outdoor experience you could ever encounter its only for people willing to risk their life so they can finally truly live it thats the test thats the price his eyes were challenging and why would i do that do you ever long for a place with no rules except the discipline you establish for yourself a place without clocks commutes or committees a place of selfreliance where you gather your own food find your own way and learn the challenges and satisfaction of simple survival are you ready to face true wilderness thats outback adventure a truly onceinalifetime experience daniel was baffled there was no shortage of adventure travel companies in the world theyd take clients anywhere they dreamed pampering them in the amazon perching them on camels in mongolia or pitching tents on an arctic ice floe all supplied food however except this one apparently and the location outback is a word associated with australia he objected i thought entry to the continent was banned the man smiled and nodded sharing the secret for ordinary people it is daniel for the select few who find our company who identify themselves through their own initiative and who want a chance at something different united corporations has designated australia a clean slate an empty continent a diseasefree place for men and women to test themselves in a new beginning there hasnt been an opportunity like this for hundreds of years daniel was intrigued hed enjoyed vacation expeditions but also felt theyd been choreographed to wander on your own so what exactly is outback adventure the woman smiled and leaned toward him revealing more cleavage eyes dancing with flirtatious amusement what is it she repeated in mock surprise as if shed never heard of such a question then she threw out her arms to embrace the country she was in its life stripped of artifice daniel its nature that hasnt been smothered by man its clean air sweet rain rainbows and thunderstorms its more stars than you thought possible to fit into the sky its open country without a track or a trail most people find that scary do you he frowned i dont know they hadnt really answered his question the man nodded of course you dont none of us did until we met with our outback adventure counselor thats where everything becomes clear and not everyone who contacts us can be invited to make this journey they have to be special independent adventurous would you be willing to take our survey to see if you qualify for a personal interview daniel paused at that this exclusiveness again they wanted his money but required some kind of test before theyd take it while the premise was intriguing this was commercial confidence bordering on arrogance im not much for surveys i think you have what it takes daniel the woman encouraged dammit theyd made him curious what the hell the pair nodded approvingly the australia scene dissolved and he was looking at a walnutpaneled office with leatherbound books overstuffed furniture and lighting so soft and indirect it made him squint it was a d cliche of a psychiatric den authoritative dark and calming enough to persuade an entrant to have his head shrunk he almost laughed again and yet the predictability of it did put him somewhat at ease electronic surveys like this were ubiquitous he knew as companies probed both job applicants and customers a somewhat older handsome woman was sitting in a maroon chair wearing pearls pumps and a business suit of classic and modest cut stylish professional reassuring hello daniel she said in a low warm voice im dr cynthia chen outback adventures preliminary screening consultant experience has taught us that while some people are suited to life on their own in the wild most dont really belong there if you dont mind im going to ask you a few simple questions this is strictly confidential and is just to give us a better idea of who you are so we can help you decide if outback adventure is best for you her tone was kind i dont really like questionnaires it doesnt hurt she smiled as if they shared agreement about the absurdity of it all its kind of fun actually im not sure i want you to know who i am i want to know who you are these questions are your gateway to learning that believe me its for the good of both of us we dont want to waste your time or ours he remembered vocational tests in school one suggested that half his class become farmers when thered been almost no vocational opportunities in farming for fifty years the kids had hooted in derision now here daniel was again trying to fit some shrinks personality grid he sighed fire away there were no preliminary questions about his age weight health family hobbies or skills hed been a netentry since birth and a punch of buttons could deliver to anyone who cared an avalanche of files groaning with information about his buying habits subscriptions employment records and memberships privacy laws had broken down under the continual assault of hackers lawyers web solicitors journalists and snoops and targeting businesses often knew more about their consumers in a statistical sense than the consumer himself instead dr chens queries focused on daniels selfanalysis ranging from the trivial to the fundamental do you sometimes wake just to see a sunrise she asked i get up early to run he shrugged sunrise is one of the reasons its hard to see in the city do you like to try new things its hard to find new things thats the problem isnt it what kind of watch do you own jesus i dont know he looked at his wrist in puzzlement its just a watch ganymede i think does it matter what would you order for your last meal he pondered ive never been convinced id have much of an appetite she laughed approvingly it was a bullshit test daniel decided another part of an elaborate psychological comeon hed been enlisted in the effort to recruit himself accordingly some of his answers were serious but others were flippant she made no objection to the latter going down her list calmly the doctor is a holorecording he reminded himself you cant provoke a true reaction are you a leader he hesitated then admitted his supervisor was right no are you a follower that was easier no are you brave ive never had to find out are you smart taking this test im beginning to wonder do you like people what was the right answer on that one were they looking for hermits or class presidents depends on the person doesnt it what do you live for daniel myself i guess might as well be honest and is that enough sometimes he paused no but i dont have anything else anyone he certainly wasnt making much progress with raven or mona pietri for that matter are you happy he sighed sometimes not really i dont like the way things are would you eat grubs to keep yourself alive grubs what the hell is a grub a larval insect he laughed if i would does that mean im happy or simply crazy enough to go on your outdoor outing dr chen smiled congratulations daniel youve passed the first test of outback adventure thats it im insane enough to go youve been accepted as a candidate for the experience of a lifetime to pursue this possibility further you must make an appointment to meet your outback adventure counselor good grief you dont make taking my money easy do you at our corporate offices well explain the program and schedule you for excitement if you decide to participate schedule for excitement he rolled his eyes we choose our words carefully believe me he looked at her skeptically and how much will this onceinalifetime experience cost me one years salary she didnt even blink what the fee is to test the seriousness of your commitment it sure as hell does i cant afford that yes you can her look remained serene im sorry im not going to pay that yes you will her confidence was infuriating its a small price to come alive chapter seven the address in daniels city was in the tower of an anonymous skyscraper cluster forty minutes away by tube discreet lettering in the lobby announced the firms presence on the thirtythird floor the elevator opened to reveal a number of nondescript small offices a title company a financial newsletter a laserlift skin clinic the tour agency door was solid wood plain and locked outback adventure a tiny sign read in letters slipped into the kind of bracket that could accommodate a rapid turnover of tenants he glanced at the ceiling a vidsnake was watching him daniel hesitated then knocked silence he looked at his watch on time he tried the knob but it didnt budge he knocked again nothing dammit it wasnt lunch but there was no sound from the other side he eyed the keypad lock and punched some numbers at random without effect quickly becoming bored hello finally he retreated across the hallway and slid down the wall sitting expectantly on the floor hed wait for the bastards with that there was a buzz a click and the door swung quietly open he stood awkwardly and walked over poking his head through the inside revealed a small waiting area with ugly plastic molded chairs a desk and a pretty receptionist she smiled close the door behind you he stepped through and the door clicked shut your appointment to see mr coyle he said grumpily my name is daniel dyson please have a seat mr dyson she gestured at the plastic chairs ill inform mr coyle you didnt answer my knock yes we did eventually she regarded him with quiet amusement you dont want clients to come in eight percent of our applicants are turned away by that door and thats for their own good they wouldnt do well with outback adventure would they he sat while she announced his arrival the chairs were as uncomfortable as they looked the brochures on the table featured the same wilderness couple hed seen on his video wall there were pictures of empty desert redrocked gorges and bounding kangaroos the text was spare like primitive life itself this is a journey with no schedule no itinerary and no set destination except selfrealization a zen thing maybe there was a buzz and she looked up at him again smiling your counselor will see you now he went through another solid wooden door the man who met daniel reminded him a bit of the brochure ninja but without the knives elliott coyle was darkhaired tanned and dressed in a charcoal sport coat over a black silk crew shirt and dark pants he wore black duraflex slippers a silver pin on his lapel was the only bright point to catch the eye it showed a kangaroo that would be something daniel thought to see a wild kangaroo there are thousands of them hundreds of thousands where youre going coyle had followed daniels eye how do you know im going ive read your profile daniel you belong there you have a profile the screening questionnaire a background check we dont send just anyone on outback adventure its too expensive for both of us so we try to guess an educated guess but a guess nonetheless who truly belongs there the information we have on you is very promising ill bet it includes my annual salary if thats my fee coyle smiled touche secret passwords locked doors your company doesnt make sense he nodded you want to know more of course which is why im here he stuck out his hand elliott coyle the handshake was firm and brisk im your assigned counselor the man whose job it is to convince you the experience is worthwhile to help decide if we should give each other a try and then guide you through preparation if we come to agreement i feel its safe to say that what im offering what were offering will change your life who is we exactly outback adventure is a travel consultant that contracts with the umbrella governing arm of united corporations we have exclusive excursion rights to offer wilderness experiences in australia and australia is quarantined offlimits dangerous last i heard it was to keep management of the continent controllable we havent advertised its change in status instead we screen candidates to find the few who can realistically take advantage of what we have to offer youre in a select group daniel so how did you find me you found us remember thats the first requirement friends tend to tell likeminded friends we keep a low profile to discourage the casually curious we register as an export company if we didnt take such steps the screening would become unwieldy the idea would intrigue more people than you might think so how do i fit youre also the right age the right fitness the right temperament we think the only one who can really answer that is you daniel wanted to digest this for a moment if i go do i get cave girl he deflected he solemnly held up a brochure coyle laughed again i wouldnt mind time in the outback with her myself alas shes an actress daniel were offering wilderness not club pleasure youll have to find your own companionship if you want it he winked youve got to make a better pitch than that mr coyle especially for a years goddamned salary anyone who would pay that is crazy enough to go coyle nodded absolutely right so why dont you sit back and let me give you the spiel then you make up your own mind no pressure no sweat i think youll be intrigued at the very least the chairs were far more comfortable than the plastic ones of the waiting room daniel sank in one and donned headgear for the presentation adjusting the fit and sound a desert panorama opened up again gloriously empty the sky was a brilliant blue dried clear of haze the sand was a vibrant red coyle walked into view daniel knew he was simply giving his pitch in front of a blank screen and was being projected onto the headvid presentation but the combination was effective it was as if the two were together in australia every schoolchild knows the tragic story of the australian continent coyle began the scene changed to rangeland being eaten to stubble by hundreds of browsing rabbits a virus concocted to control the nations feral browsers unfortunately mutated and jumped to humans while australia was effectively quarantined before the infection could spread both the targeted animals and most of the continents human inhabitants except for a handful of refugees were wiped out this was a key factor in passage of the genetic engineering reform act of course meanwhile this catastrophe was considered so threatening to the world population at large that the continent was quarantined the refugees were interned on the seychelles islands australia was permanently blockaded to prevent salvage companies or treasure hunters from landing and running the risk of contracting and spreading the disease to further discourage such illegal access all detailed maps coordinates and geographic information detailing the continent were purged from world databases to the extent possible australia was put out of sight out of mind as an emergency measure of public safety until now because united corporations turns problems into solutions because united corporations believes that everyone can win all the time daniel saw a picture of smiling backpackers winding down a palmshaded desert canyon the water pool next to them was turquoise the solution australia represented was an answer to the problem of wilderness coyle went on now seeming to lean against a palm tree the publics desire for natural preserves had first been accommodated during the population explosion of the twentieth century scenic areas of valuable land were deliberately set aside in countries such as the united states and canada to satisfy the demands of individualists who wanted to experience the outdoors the headvid panned a group of dirty happy hikers eating lunch along a mountain trail then the view lifted to show an alpine meadow and cascading glaciers the scenery was breathtaking despite such political generosity on the part of the national forerunners to united corporations none of these land seizures truly replicated wilderness all were relatively small quickly became crowded and were crisscrossed with trails they were surveyed mapped and offered rescue if something went wrong there were scenes of horrid overcrowding at the rim of the grand canyon in a yosemite parking lot at a yellowstone geyser long chains of recreationists wound along trails that had been trampled into trenches or mud bogs scraps of litter blew across an eroded clearing a mountain lake was shown posted for pollution the environmental extremists of the late twentieth century there was old tape footage of demonstrating greens demanded more they proposed gigantic new wildernesses a map showed green stains growing like amoebae on western and northern north america so vast that people could literally get lost in them but there was no room for more humanity needed resources to achieve our quality of life daniel was transported to a shopping mall where happy families strolled with packages under their arms he grinned sardonically hed never seen a family that happy until that is virus struck australia unfortunate tragedy has presented the world with an island as big as the united states but emptier of people than antarctica how dangerous would australia remain united corporations board members there was a picture of familiar faces meeting at the uc board table the men and women looking handsome and wise turned to science for more answers daniel saw hazardsuited investigators fanning out across the landscape like cautious moonwalkers these experts concluded australia no longer has plague the scientists had gathered back by their aircraft and were pushing their hoods back to grin in relief the scene dissolved to one in a laboratory zeroing in on a whitecoated scientist perched on a stool and looking like a favorite grandfather virus died with its human carriers the scientist assured daniel with a smile its as extinct as smallpox and aids then coyle was back posed now in front of the new york headquarters of united corporations it was then that uc saw a winwin solution the scene changed once more to abandoned derelict cities empty mine pits and droughtstunted grazing land australia had always been underpopulated dry thin the first european explorers the dutch didnt even want it asian traders visited only to obtain dried sea slugs sold in china as an aphrodisiac even after the english came they found mostly desert and arid savanna meanwhile environmental extremists continued to raise objections to some of the worlds most promising and necessary development projects accordingly united corporations saw opportunity where everyone else saw disaster our leaders quietly proposed a compromise we will preserve in its wilderness state this entire continent they offered in return for environmental compromise on other key issues greens will get a natural preserve of unprecedented size so long as they abstain from unreasonable obstructionism elsewhere and to show our good faith the most vociferous vocal skeptical and committed environmentalists are invited to be the first to test themselves against the challenge of outback adventure daniel saw a group of young ruddylooking adventurers waving goodbye from an aircraft he thought he recognized a couple of the faces from news shows the agreement must have worked he realized because environmental protest had indeed become muted this achievement was deliberately unpublicized the news organizations of united corporations recognizing that controversy is worthwhile only when it is the servant of consensus publicity would only invite tragedy australia would continue to be reported as unsafe to discourage thrillseekers looters or relatives of the dead wanting to make reckless pilgrimages the naval and satellite patrol of australias coastal waters would be maintained the board deliberately decided to maintain the continent in permanent purposeful decay the panic and rioting that broke out during the plague had already damaged australias urban areas and since then rot and rust have done much more the continents cities are deteriorating ruins and its roads are crumbled and drifted over more importantly most of australias interior was empty of people even before the plague and today little sign can be found that humans ever ventured there the island has reverted to a wilderness of sand broken concrete and scrap metal a wilderness so absolute in its isolation that its like is found nowhere else on earth electronic databases books maps films tapes and television shows on australia have been systematically pruned this fosters the decay not just of the nations physical infrastructure but its informational infrastructure as well true wilderness is not just the absence of the human footprint it is the absence of human knowledge to the degree possible united corporations has achieved both coyle had a look of solemn satisfaction today then australia is a place of purposeful mystery a deliberate step back in time a mythic place an eden and now the licensed consulting firm of outback adventure has been hired to screen a chosen few to experience the challenge of true wilderness exploration and personal selfdiscovery background music began to swell as the couple of the brochures walked into the glory of a desert sunset hand in hand these are people who are not satisfied with the everyday people who have advanced beyond mere recreation people who feel compelled to challenge the unknown those who graduate from outback adventure form the most select fraternity in the world as the headvid reached its climax australia dissolved to show mr bandolier transformed into a ruggedly handsome captain of industry who walked like a lord across his factory floor his industrial robots bowing like nodding oil pumps his female companion was shown as the bride in a costly cathedral wedding and then as an executive moving into a highrise corner office with a stunning view of the city these are todays hardened heroes there was a final picture of green mountains climbing to snowy peaks and then a dissolve daniel removed his headgear somewhat dazzled from the images of australias vastness he was also visibly skeptical so what did you think a bit heavyhanded at the end there elliott his counselor who was now sitting across from him shrugged disarmingly you found the script a little corny so do i but theres truth in that corn daniel i dont understand why i havent heard more about this before i mean an entire continent for wilderness recreation and then you dont tell anyone about it to publicize it is to spoil it we dont want the refugee community lobbying to go back they have new lives now we dont want pilgrims or mourners or looters and united corporations didnt set this up to make big money or post big numbers we did it to satisfy the craving for adventure among a select few some of them frankly troubled with the idea that this might help both them and society winwin that this was the very best way to use the new australia daniel shifted uncomfortably how so be honest with yourself daniel are you fulfilling your full potential at microcore are you doing everything you could for united corporations our superiors look at people like yourself and they wonder hes bright he thinks for himself but he also has trouble fitting in so we can leave him at a level job and let him stop growing becoming deadwood or we might find something that pushes him to the limit that tests just what he is capable of and thus which grooms him for future leadership in uc society outback adventure is meant to be a transforming experience those allowed to go are an elite but keeping it a secret to publicize the opportunity is to cheapen it the next thing you know thered be cyber underground guidebooks secret maps and so much speculation that the journey would contain as much surprise as planet disney we live in a world of twelve billion people and a continents preservation as complete wilderness is both bold and somewhat artificial the boards choice would be economically controversial to say the least as a result continued concerns about plague serve our purposes so does quiet we cant really keep you from telling a few war stories to close friends of course but youll sign confidentiality agreements if you go and believe me they are enforced no books no speeches no fame key people will know what you accomplished but only them were not going to sacrifice the unique experience of future adventurers to satisfy the ego gratification of their predecessors youre being offered a chance to qualify for the fraternity that really runs things on this planet of ours theres a lot of competition to get in and admittance is tough you have to prove yourself this is one way it works daniel nodded slowly intrigued despite his doubts so who can go ah youre beginning to realize how rare this offer is the answer to your question of course is the fit the smart the committed the daring and the dissatisfied the ones to whom ordinary life is for some reason not enough the oddballs the misfits do you recognize yourself yet daniel said nothing you go only with what you can carry on your back maps are prohibited so is any weapon beyond a knife you can take electronic devices but only receivers take your solarcell tv if you must but leave your satellite phone at home our promise is that if you go you wont know exactly where on the continent you are or precisely where youre going or how long it will take youll be as blind as columbus as bold as magellan no other adventure company offers such realistic challenge we guarantee it a years salary for that listen to me everest is old routine you know that the sahara has become a holiday junket both poles have resort hotels every river has been rafted and every reef has been dived theres only one place of mystery left on earth outback adventures australia thats what the money is for daniel the ultimate challenge of the ultimate wilderness you bet it costs dearly you have to want it so bad you can taste it because thats the only kind of person who can make it there he took a breath he could taste it how does it work we have a meeting where youll meet your fellow adventurers many decide to go in groups something we recommend to both enhance your own survival chances and lower our transportation costs we give you training we have experts on the continent and books or tapes you can review on its ecology and geology youll go prepared well give you a list of suggested equipment but its up to you to prepare and equip yourself youll survive on your brain and your back you make your preparations train for six weeks wait and then we call without warning to inform you its time to come to the departure port ready or not here you go we feel that edge adds to the experience and weeds out the last few with secret doubts you quietly quit your job in advance dont worry come back and youll be wanted for something special and fly to departure all volunteers are drugged to sleep for shipping like export cargo exactly we transport you at night to a point somewhere in the continents interior and set you down to awaken at dawn your goal is to trek to australias east coast and find its exit port exodus then you return to united corporations world renewed and toughened an eighteenthcentury man of action in a twentyfirstcentury world survive this and you can kick corporate butt anywhere you go but you have to survive it theres no hospital no rescue no emergency food or water we dont come get you youre on your own jesus he drummed his fingers a nervous habit whats the risk coyle pushed a button of the chairfile under his cushion liability forms slid out of a desk chute and he plunked them in front of dyson with a thump some people dont make it a lot of people actually he nodded as daniels brows lifted the risk is higher than highaltitude climbing sky diving hang gliding free diving you name it this is the riskiest thing on earth and yet competition to participate is fierce only risking life after all makes you feel truly alive worse than climbing worse than many wars he took a breath all right elliott have you done this coyle looked at daniel a long time without expression yes once and survived coyle smiled thinly living proof and were you transformed the counselor had a faraway look in his eyes oh yes and now i became a believer daniel a convert an apostle so now im employed explaining all this to people like you thats what i wanted to do when i got back it was what i was put on earth to do im sure of it and you recommend it no never its so hard that i just give you a choice you have to choose yourself its the choice that determines whether youre ready to go how many choose not to dont they spill your secret he smiled frankly few who learn this much turn us down were careful what we reveal to who those who do say no recognize the need for discretion we explain it to them so i can walk out of here right now absolutely and id understand perfectly i wouldnt go now ive got a wife kids im too old now too soft too content i like this world thats what i learned in the outback so ill shake your hand and pat you on the back if you want to quit right now he waited quite the salesman arent you dyson picked up the liability forms and examined them leave his job give up his savings go wander in the desert and maybe die out there was he that crazy that unhappy that unfulfilled dont go unless youre absolutely sure daniel dont go unless you need to find something you cant find here he thought of raven like why do i do yes like that he took a breath got a pen coyle handed him one daniel looked at it rotating in his fingers are you brave dr chen had asked ive never had to find out he bent to sign his name i want to test myself chapter eight youve given notice sanford asked mystified quitting daniel confirmed to his workmate you have to keep quiet about it until after im gone theyre just letting you go indeed they were daniel thought luther cox had expressed neither surprise nor interest at the news i hope its for the best hed said remotely well fill in for you whenever they call didnt even feign regret im afraid but why why do you do daniel thought to himself because it committed himself because it cut his ties go go go im going away he replied an opportunities transfer im going to the wilderness sanford taking a break from the routine youre quitting your job to go on vacation its sort of openended unclear when ill get back its not really a vacation its a kind of lifestyle change i want to do something different sanford thought about this when do we fight over your scanner and disk repository he asked ever practical scanning daniels desk for other valuables im on staff until the expedition starts then its yours so whens that i dont know were not allowed to know what the surprise departure is part of the wilderness experience you prepare wait they call bang youre off thats weird off where to the desert really sanford had a fondness for nevada to a wilderness desert not a casino desert oh which one i cant say im not allowed to say i dont really know actually its all set up by an adventure company some new outfit youve never heard of neither had i jesus dyson this is pretty offbeat for what to explore explore what i dont know nobody does thats the whole point whats the whole point to have an adventure to go do something risky where the end isnt preordained to trade security for excitement comfort for experience entertainment for selfexploration you sound like a commercial or somebody whos been brainscrubbed let me get this straight youre leaving microcore to go on some expedition that starts who knows when going to who knows where for who knows how long for who knows what reason daniel shrugged its not for everyone its not for anyone with common sense have you totally lost your mind youre going to give up a good job oh please he looked amused to go to some desert you cant even identify and pay money to do it why because you dont like the looks of harriet lundeen because you cant make it with mona pietri because im being buried here sanford buried alive you are too better than being buried dead out in some desert you paid to go down the mekong that was different how was that different i didnt quit my job they set up camp set down camp chairs and set out the booze we had an itinerary not to mention sonicguard to keep out the insects women came along it was fun dammit thats what was different different or predictable heres a news flash for you dyson i like things predictable most people do such as this job sanford glanced around the monotony of level and nodded solemnly such as my pay predictable as clockwork theres got to be more there isnt any more thats what you dont get or wont admit youre a romantic and life isnt life is just life you want green go to the park you want animals go to the zoo you want sunstroke and snakes go to the desert no im going to find more im going to find it and bring it back and show you shove it in your face a rattlesnake freedom selfdiscovery his workmate rocked back in his seat youll discover things all right discover that hunger and fear dont make you free maybe thats the point suffering to overcome it sanford laughed and threw up his hands go wander in the desert have visions bring back a prophecy my last fortune cookie was a bore im just tired of being safe well i predict youll get tired of being unsafe in about fifteen minutes he shook his head looking at daniel speculatively theres some other reason isnt there something that pushed you into this what some kind of trouble a woman theres no woman some musclethighed rock spider with breasts the size of coconuts theres no woman its just me for me i mean dont you ever get tired of the routine here sanford of course i do everybody does he stood up and gazed across the top of the cubicles and ill tell you the one thing youll get for your money it will make level look pretty damn good that night he called her again not because this was about raven of course but because because he wanted her to know that hed signed up that theyd taken the man she thought they wouldnt take so there on the sixth ring the circuit transferred and a voice came on line but the video picture was grayed out hello a mans voice damn is raven there whos calling a friend your name he could hear clicks on the line im just a friend look could you put her on please i need your name more funny sounds were they recording my name is none of your damn business let me speak to raven there was a long pause then miss decarlo is no longer here what miss decarlo is not here this isnt her number shes left the city for an outdoor excursion he stopped at that had raven gone too do you know when shell be back no do you wish to leave a message well there wasnt much point in that if she was off on an outback adventure had he triggered her like she triggered him who is this do you wish to leave a message more clicks was this guy a boyfriend or something else a mechanical monitor i want to talk to her before she goes thats impossible to talk or was she already gone i want a forwarding number do you wish to leave a message theres no number do you wish to leave a message he drummed his fingers considering yeah i want to leave a message tell her i called well do that the connection went dead daniel stared at the phone a long time they hadnt asked his name room upon room level upon level link upon link a descent into an underworld in which the passwords and riddles and locks were always changing identities shifting allegiances unclear not just cyberspace but a cyber pit of mysteries he clicked and probed searching for himself could he find any reference to outback adventure his search engines revealed no matches information on australia had been wiped except for rumor and uncertain memory coyle was right it was ignorance that made wilderness disbelieve spartacus again like an electronic nag have you decided daniel im going away away where to the wilderness there is no more wilderness except here im going to a special place your place is here with us i cant do your truth cookie i dont know how and besides theyve made me im dangerous to you now they found out about my hacking and they watch me so im going there was no response im sorry i know this genechem stuff is theres nothing in the wilderness thats why its called wilderness i think i can find something there what what indeed raven my reason for being your reason for being is here goodbye i have to go now the truth is inside not outside chapter nine im crazy but not a fool the phrase became daniels mantra as he started his preparations you make your own luck he told himself he would research he would train he would purchase and because of that he would survive when he awakened in the australian desert he would be selfcontained and selfsufficient a twentyfirstcentury primitive ready to live as prehistoric man must have lived but with the added edge of modern technology the challenge was daunting but also energizing once equipped he would need no one and nothing except the fruits of the earth he would enjoy total freedom because of the peculiarities of its challenge the emphasis on selfsurvival unaided and undirected the training and guidance from outback adventure was alternately generous and guarded the mix put him offbalance from earliest memory daniels life had been crammed with advice recited by parents drilled by teachers whispered to him from office walls pounded at him in commercials nagged by machines due for a tuneup or scolded by corporate officials conducting performance appraisals everyone it seemed knew exactly what he should do next until now he could learn quite a bit about generic survival tactics and very little about the place he would use them survival could be taught australia must remain mysterious what daniel was presented with were catalogs there were endless lists of available equipment inventories of australian plants and animals data on the temperature hot rainfall erratic and elevation low survival manuals so general that they included advice on building igloos drying fish and distilling sea water the descriptions of the country he was to be deposited in however were spare that would defeat the whole purpose wouldnt it said elliott coyle its just odd and difficult preparing for a place thats been turned into a deliberate secret therere no maps and no journals by previous adventurers how did columbus prepare cabot boone coyle tapped his head and heart in here not out there they knew little of where they were going but an immense amount about seamanship or forest travel they succeeded on common sense if you succeed it will be because of you not because of us thats what he wanted thats what he feared the shopping was initially exhilarating suddenly money seemed to have no meaning departing on something as timeless and illdefined as outback adventure was liberating he felt like a kid in a candy store who could buy to fulfill a fantasy secondskin to don for cold desert nights a solar blanket squeezed into the size of a matchbox chemcandles to start fires torso webbing to hold clipons freezedried stroganoff couscous strawberry shortcake and szechwan chicken a water purifier a solar battery recharge wafer vitamin drops a solarlithium flashlight a hydrogen pellet stove spiderline supraboots and a bush hat with band pockets for fish hooks spare buttons a barometer and data wafers for his palmtop computer he spread it across the floor of his apartment and regarded its titanium glitter with initial glee the paraphernalia of survival yet as he toyed with his acquisitions weighing them individually while toting up his load he began to feel misgivings how much of this world did he really want to saddle onto his back every step would be a reminder of where hed come from would that be reassuring or oppressive he sat on his couch and looked at his purchases receipts curled like party streamers and box lids gaping like hungry mouths he put on the bush hat and regarded himself in the reflection of a computer screen gday mate he frowned you look bloody ridiculous suddenly the gear seemed a miniaturized replication of the united corporations world as cumbersome as a space suit out of curiosity he bundled the instruction booklets and weighed them a pound right there he sat down again and began to think how could he carry enough on his back to keep alive for the months it would likely take to hike to the australian coast and find exodus port even with the new food concentrates it suddenly seemed impossible to be put down in the middle of nowhere to find your own way to an unclear destination was he insane but then that was the nature of exploring wasnt it because of you not because of us coyle had said damn right it would be a way to explore himself raven carried no water underground because she knew where to get a drink waters heavy shed said he moved to his window and watched the pigeons fluttering across silicon square they carried nothing at all and neither had primitive man if you knew what to eat the wilderness was a garden he needed to carry less on his shoulders and more in his head he went to a hardware store and bought a dowel and block of wood then he came back sat down and began drawing up a new list of what he thought he truly needed next to it he wrote a goal pounds he scratched some items out and added others how light could he travel how fast could he move he considered then wrote again pounds he flipped through the books how good a garden was australia hed been taught all his life that information was the tool of success and now information was frustratingly vague he underlined a passage your environment is neither friendly nor hostile but rather the product of preparation and the discipline of your mind he took the wood block and with a pocketknife whittled a small depression in it then roughly sharpened one end of the dowel so it rested in the new hole the wood shavings he carefully hoarded then he began to experiment with ways to pivot the dowel in the hole four hours later the building superintendent was pounding on his door dyson hey open the door if youre in there daniel opened it a crack he looked tired christ the stink the super greeted the goddamned fire alarm sounded you okay you burn something his tenant held up a blackened piece of wood with a look of grim satisfaction i started a fire mr landau with this the superintendent looked at the charcoal in bewilderment with what friction i made fire from my hands landau paused thank goodness this loopy kid had already given notice youre a friggin nut case you know that daniel nodded listen dyson you cant start fires here you know that its against the rules everything is against the rules he set down his wood and put up his hand to close the door im done now dont worry my arm is sore he jerked his head in the direction of his carpet littered with packages as if at christmas i just have to take some things back to the store if information on australian geography was meager information on survival tactics was not daniel became a repository of trivia rommels troops drank two and a half gallons of water a day in the desert he read workers at hoover dam consumed an average of six and a half african natives had used pierced and blownout ostrich eggs as canteens rubbing oneself with chewed tobacco warded off insects too bad its a controlled substance he muttered physical training became an obsession now his miles were timed alternate days were spent with weight and tension machines he logged endless crunches sprints and even began a martial arts class daniel wasnt especially quick or coordinated but he decided the discipline and drills of asian combat couldnt hurt he also sought out advice on practical gutlevel street fighting more to give himself selfconfidence than because he expected to have to use the knowledge one of the trainers an excop looked at him doubtfully hit first and give it everything youve got coogan he said wryly using the name of a current action hero it will all be over in fifteen seconds one way or another he looked daniel up and down it wouldnt hurt to know how to run either daniel loaded his pack weighed it and then went over his list again he filled it with rocks equal to twice the weight and climbed the stairs of his building then again and again and again he spent a night on the roof in a bedroll with ground cover kept awake by the lights and the heat his back was stiff by morning he stalked and butchered a possum he spied prowling through garbage comparing its internal architecture with the manuals he was reading he practiced until he could hit crows with rocks he ran in a downpour drank water sluicing off an awning and measured how much he could catch in his hat people ignored his eccentricity everyone moved in a bubble of anonymity the exception to this was an orientation and final screening session for regional participants the first of several weekend seminars for the next class of outback adventurers we thought youd like to see who you might rub elbows with in the bush elliott coyle told a gathering of two dozen in a windowless rented conference room in the basement of outback adventures office tower just so you know youre not alone in your desire for wilderness challenge or our insanity someone quipped the group laughed nervously daniel glanced around most of the participants looked to be in their twenties and thirties a third of them women a few had the whippet leanness of endurance athletes but the majority looked reassuringly ordinary and uncertain about whether they were in the right place they glanced at each other shyly some of you will insist on traversing the outback on your own we know but most of our participants choose to form a small group coyle said i encourage you to consider it for ourselves it simplifies problems of delivery for you it enhances the chance of survival not to mention the possibility of forming friendships that will last the rest of your lives he paused to let them consider that they looked at each other uncertainly who would they get along with who could they trust were also going to subject you to a physical some inoculations and a final psychological screening to make sure youre really outback adventure material while some of this may seem intrusive its the kind of thing that could save your life in the end so please bear with us and accept our judgment the group looked surprised theyd already made their decision and paid a deposit now there were lastminute hurdles a hand went up did i miss something here the person whod made the earlier quip now caustically asked coyle looked at the short wiry thinfaced young man raising the question ah yes mr washington ico isnt it it is elliott he stood so glad you remember me now if i remember correctly were paying you and we have to go through more bullshit tests come on were ready to go or we wouldnt be here coyle looked at him calmly if youre ready ico you wont have any problem with our tests and if you dont like the outback adventure program then obviously you arent ready and can expect a full refund he let his stern gaze pass across the room this is your life at stake here were not going to put you out there if you dont belong washington sat down corporate nonsense he fumed a couple of candidates snickered and a few others looked uncomfortable coyle ignored the rustle and called a couple of names to begin the screening the man sitting next to daniel smiled that boy needs to get into the bush he whispered i just want to daniel studied his companion the man was big dark and powerful so long and solid that daniel thought he looked like a folded tree everyone in this room has been tested up the kazoo since birth daniel whispered back who wants any more you do what you have to do to get where you want to go the man replied he held out a hand like shaking a baseball mitt daniel thought tucker freidel i was an alaskan trapper in a previous life and a zulu warrior in the life before that his brown eyes smiled daniel dyson came the reply as his arm was pumped and in this life tucker the man grinned goodnaturedly a failed computer salesman my theory is i cant do worse in the wilderness at least youre honest and as fed up as that little guy there im willing for a last poke in the butt if it gets me out of here and into gods country were going to find god out there i sure as hell am going to look i figure i might need him but not a computer tucker laughed i sure as hell aint packing one you know what captain cook said about the aborigines captain who one of the discoverers of australia he said they may appear to be the most wretched people upon earth but in reality they are far happier than we europeans being wholly unacquainted not only with the superfluous but the necessary conveniences so much sought after in europe they are happy in not knowing the use of them daniel winked happy in not knowing the use of them like computers and how do you know shit like that you with captain cook in a previous life no just a history major in this one a walking repository of trivia though i guess you could call college a previous life or a hallucination tucker laughed again or a damn waste of time but then so was my marriage and most of my career so now youre here so now im trying to get there listen do you know why im really going why because its the one thing a computer would never do theres no logic to it im going because its there like that everest guy said because it feels right i like the pointlessness of it the one time in my life when im not doing what im supposed to do can you understand that daniel nodded he liked this guy he seemed unpretentious downtoearth selfaware howd you hear about it tipped by a correspondent on the web pen pal fellow failure id heard rumors floating in the cyber underground but never knew it was real so what did you think about coyle advising us to team up are you game for that maybe we could be partners tucker eyed him speculatively maybe what do you do when you arent quoting history i thought it was supposed to be why do you do the what is a software writer sheeit the why is i dont know why i havent thought it through as clearly as you perhaps thats what im looking for out there why thats what unites this bunch ill bet were all looking tucker glanced around at the other chatting adventurers listen i wouldnt mind teaming up but ive already got someone else who wanted to tag along he pointed that cute little girl over there the one with the short black hair names chiu he caught her eye and waved to her amaya help me check this guy out a young pleasantlooking woman with a ready smile came over she wasnt really little but shorter and slighter than either tucker or daniel her round face was open and cheerful and her dark eyes danced as she looked up at each in turn this is daniel he wants to come with us he can quote captain cook she cocked her head how useful and his field of expertise he says hes a software writer i think that means he can type tucker laughed and a military engineer daniel said it lightly i build catapults why tucker she exclaimed exactly what we need what do you do ms chiu partly stand in tuckers shadow she teased stepping slightly behind his powerful form hes the brawn and im the brains right freidel i aint doing all the lifting im also an executive suckup by profession and amateur naturalist and closet romantic by inclination executive suckup assistant associate deputy and lieutenant rising horizontally from one middlemanagement post to another a gofer who finally answered to one idiot too many and decided to really go i love adventure stories so ive decided to live one and im fascinated by nature like tucker without pretense we all seem to have a lot in common and two strong males you two can break trail ill point the way lewis and clark and sacajawea daniel said except a hundred eighty degrees in the opposite direction we want to go east gentlemen not west im already contributing you see by making that clear tucker scratched his head in mock befuddlement and doesnt the sun set backward down under amaya rolled her eyes i never did have a proper taste in men so do you really build catapults mr dyson daniel dyson a little one once it got me into trouble war machines usually do daniel liked her banter this could be fun i saw you talking to the handraiser tucker said to her whats he like smart as in mouth ass but quick too maybe we should enlist him daniel was doubtful that guy hes interesting hell talk your ear off come over and meet him ico washington wasted no time in presenting them with his worldview he had curly hair and olive skin and a restless manner his eyes flicking around the room as he talked he fizzed like a shaken bottle i dont take these outback guys seriously he explained i dont take anyone connected with united corporations seriously i havent heard an honest word since the delivery doctor slapped my butt and extended condolences just happytalk bullshit my whole life and an unending list of rules and comeons i mean a years salary to dump me in some desert its gotta be a scam and when an oily snake like elliott coyle says gee not all of you may get to go i know im being taken tucker frowned so why are you here ico laughed with selfdeprecation because this is my peek behind the curtain man this is my chance to look from outside the box i figure that out in the bush theres no wall whispers no headvid no committeemeetingsfromhell for once i get away from the ambient noise you know so i can think so i can consider so i can plan plan what permanent escape he nodded as if confiding a great secret i dont want a temporary furlough i want release from this bullshit corporate world i want to experience real freedom so i go along with their little mind games even while i let them know i see through them because this isnt a vacation for me this is a turning point once im down on that outback ground im not the same guy coming back im going to imagine a better life i think theyre betting a taste of dirt and bugs will teach me the benefits of the united corporations world but im going to be finding my own world were pandoras box man and theyve no clue what can happen when you open the lid daniel frowned recognizing a bit of himself so what is it that you do ico he looked at them smugly i see things clearly chapter ten by design there was no one to see them off there were thirteen pages of rules to replicate wilderness experience condition you will not write or speak about this experience condition you will have completed and filed with outback adventure a last will and testament condition you will have been screened and found free of communicable diseases condition specified an unpredictable departure time no goodbyes to family or loved ones no hugs no weeping no notice they came you went like a furtive kidnapping daniels call buzzed through at the trailing edge of night im in the lobby daniel coyles voice calmly announced its time for adventure he groaned jesus what time is it just before dawn the favored time for surprise attack all right he said groggily ive just got to pull my stuff together five minutes elliott five minutes we told you it would be like this cold plunge the time for second thoughts is over daniel knew the opposite was true he could still quit even now the urgent disorienting departure was a final test ill be down everythings here just a couple items ive been debating to take if in doubt leave it out he swung out of bed dressed without a shower and grabbed his gear his last pained decision had been to leave his sleeping bag behind in favor of a lighter slimmer tougher bedroll he needed to move to survive after another minutes indecision he pocketed the toy action trooper next to his computer gordo firecracker tough guy amulet then he glanced around a last time the apartment was already bare hed made arrangements for the last of his belongings to be packed and moved into storage the video wall was a dim gray his computer cabinet lightless now he threw his microcore identity badge into the trash mona im gonna he recited goodbye to the goddess goodbye to the gorgon goodbye to all that raven im cravin craving what sand in his cereal blisters on his heels cravin to find out why coyle saw him into a cab and gave him tickets for a shuttle a redeye flight to a coast city leaving in fortyfive minutes youll meet the others for final departure there the door slammed daniel keyed down the window arent you going to wish me good luck his counselor was silent a moment luck is just preparation plus opportunity he finally recited in the darkness of predawn coyles expression couldnt be seen there was a twohour flight to the final departure point the two dozen other adventurers scattered at random through the plane a few sleeping and most just quiet lost in their own thoughts at the airport an unmarked bus met them for transport to an industrial airfield more than a hundred people had assembled there for flights that would scatter them like shot across the continent of australia they checked into musty dormitories barracks ico corrected crap left over from the army or something unloaded on these guys or picked up for a song youd think for a years salary theyd give us a last night in a hotel room my guess is its a last reality check daniel said sitting on a bunk it creaked its wire web apparent under the thin mattress so were clear what were getting into and my guess is that theyre a bunch of cheap bastards who know if were already dumb enough to sign on for adventure that well tolerate any fleabag they check us into a small price to come alive amaya teased him yeah what difference does it make tucker said tomorrow we wake up on the sand it matters if someone snores you snore freidel i dunno if i do i sleep through it like a rock thats a question that wouldve been useful on the questionnaires ico said do you snore but oh no they gotta know what my favorite damn color is whatd you say green the light that says go told theyd leave before dawn again the next day the four companions decided on a final party in a nearby restaurant their evening celebration wired with the adrenaline of excitement a magnum of champagne and tabs of ecsotica drug they laughed so hard they finally cried about snarled commutes deadend jobs blankbrained bosses mortgages on units they hated and insurance on lives theyd felt were hardly worth keeping now it was all going to be gone poof and theyd wake up to find themselves in the outback life reduced to a hunt for food to eat and water to drink simple stark scary did you see that guy ico snorted excitedly spitting a bit of champagne across their table as they talked of hopes and fears came out of their phony lastminute screening positively mystified that he didnt get in gee i met all the criteria golly i dont know what the problem was but at least they turned me on to an executive opportunity at disneysoft im sure is just as exciting what crap they tried to get me to back out too with their song and dance about a good job elsewhere i didnt fall for the ploy its a test man a trap these guys are machiavellian how can they make any money if they keep turning people away tucker drunkenly wondered by making it hard to get in christ try to keep people out of a nightclub and theyll line up around the block this idiot will tell his friends he washed out and half of them will sign up to replace him theyre playing us man theyre reeling us in so arent you upset at being netted daniel asked nope ico poured another glass because im riding the fishing boat to a better place my man because all their bullshit is just a taxi for my mind they barely got two hours sleep before being awakened at three am and electrobused to the waiting transports the night was chilly and dark and a light fog drifted off the harbor daniel could see that their craft was marked by a nondescript oa on its fuselage this jet would take them to some transfer point and then smaller hovers would disperse individuals and small groups theyd been told sleepy and hungover they shivered gloomily the freight decks of the aging terminal were shut damn im tired tucker said well sleep on the plane daniel assured him they got a breakfast of stale donuts and instant coffee while they waited for the jet to be readied they spare no expense ico observed were getting to see a place few people have ever visited amaya replied as if to justify the unceremonious sendoff what australia or this dump daniel wondered if raven had come through here he found himself thinking about her with almost irritating frequency like a worry he couldnt put behind him had she gone to the outback was there a chance theyd meet there what would she think of him if they did okay form up bring your gear it was time the ramp personnel waving them through were in red jumpsuits is this where we return tucker asked one of them the man shook his head where then beats me buddy id lobby to come back through hawaii their gear was searched and a probe found data wafers in daniels bush hat they went into a computer for scanning and any mentioning australia were deleted its just history he protested background it might contain geographic detail you were told that was cheating dyson you didnt even read it didnt have to besides you dont need history where youre going ico lost a compass that had a commphone slyly built in its a compass dammit with a radio looks like youre going to tell direction by the sun sport i want a receipt for that the worker set the instrument on a metal counter picked up a hammer and swung there was an expensive crack dont need one you can have it back next fucking storm troopers next tucker and amaya were clean they shuffled out onto the dark tarmac bent under their gear a line formed as the leading adventurers shrugged off their packs and disappeared aboard as he waited for his turn daniel glanced idly around one more time and saw an electrobus with no lights hum up to another freight dock a line of men shuffled off it heads bowed shoulders stooped barely visible in the dark they wore the same jumpsuits as the ramp workers he saw but their scalps were shaved and there was the glint of something silver on their necks were the jumpsuits red or ico look i think those might be convicts his companion glanced that way bullshit no really look at their necks those might be stun collars i read about them its designed to jolt if they try to run away i thought that crude stuff had been rendered obsolete by treatment but there they are daniel had never seen a convicted criminal outside of video and holographic shows he was fascinated hmm ico considered if those are moralimpaireds why arent they in a clinic what are they doing here getting a ride to rehab id guess they must have just been convicted ico looked from the convicts to the men in jumpsuits who were processing the departure of the outback adventurers look at our own goons he nodded for all we know the guys frisking us are rehabs more nickel shaving by outback adventure no wonder the food is swill you might remember the cuisine more fondly after days surviving on ant balls amaya reminded whose balls balls of ants collected on a stick he laughed you can tell me about it chiu i brought solar chow looks like you got enough to feed us all she eyed the massive pack ico was bent under how are you going to carry all that on my back sweetheart how heavy is it seventyfive wellchosen pounds to keep me not just alive but comfortable dont worry ill still leave you in the dust really okay wise guy first one to camp i win you cook me your chow you win it aint a bet sweetheart this foods for me hey who are those guys daniel asked one of the red jumpsuits the man looked at the distant shuffling line of convicts he was pointing toward them just the morally impaired criminals what are they doing here our company has a lot of transport contracts he laughed be careful you dont get on the wrong one hell another joked i think these fools are already on the wrong one a few days in the wilderness and theyll want back on any transport a third added enough their supervisor snapped nervous laughter rippled through the passengers waiting on the tarmac boy they really know how to put us in the mood dont they said tucker the supervisor suddenly eyed him you can still back out tucker thrust out his chin no way the jumpsuit nodded on board the airplane ico pushed his way forward i want to be up front what does it matter daniel said were going to be put to sleep it matters they followed ico to the front and daniel lay down in his berth watching as a medop strapped him to his bunk the man tugged hard and the straps went tight preparing me for a lobotomy daniel tried to joke his heart was beating faster and he realized his nervousness was about to turn to fright was he doing the right thing the straps keep you safer in turbulent air there was a prick as a tube was inserted and this dope feels a hell of a lot better than getting a lobe cut out he felt a warm flush begin in his arm and flood his body this was it next stop the outback the medops face loomed over him blurry and indistinct you okay yeah i can feel it daniel felt himself begin to relax what are you hoping to find out in the wilderness sport he smiled at himself drifting down into warm fuzz im chasing a question i guess a question yeah why he felt himself start to float or a woman the attendant chuckled therere easier ways to get a date part two chapter eleven daniel swam up out of a well of drugs and into an instinctively familiar music the sound was uneven and yet strangely rhythmic sweet and welcoming it was birdsong he dimly realized a dawn chattering that hed never heard from his soundproofed apartment in the city this is what morning is supposed to sound like he blinked and propped himself up on his elbows looking fuzzily around the landscape was alive with birds flitting from tree to tree black ones green ones he recognized some from his reading thornbills honeyeaters fairy wrens crested pigeons green mulga parrots iridescent in their plumage were as startling in the tropic desert as ice even more improbable were the pink cockatoos with a crest of feathers that strutted across the grassy clearing like a troop of chefs on parade hed made it he was in australia the sun was just rising and the light was a wonder there were whitetrunked trees at the border of the clearing river or ghost gums he guessed and they glowed in this dawning perpendicular light like fluorescent tubes as if lit from within by a life that answered the solar rays their dark shadows made an arabesque along the ground beyond was a crumbled ridge of red rock its broken parapets studded with trees and bushes of a strange electric green the rock was on fire with light its red an echo of the new sun and the sky at the crest of the ridge was a deep wellwater blue that framed the dazzle below all the colors seemed exaggerated as in a dream and it occurred to him suddenly that he could still be dreaming drifting in a druginduced haze of anticipation only the others could confirm reality he sat up wincing at his stiffness and looked for them amaya and tucker still lay as if they were dead ico however was already sitting up with his back against his pack looking at daniel with amusement he put his fingers to his lips so as not to break the moment and then nodded the meaning was clear isnt this great the ground sloped away to some water shallow pools glimmering in a broad pan of sand reeds grew on the fringe of them like a brilliant slash of lime more birds flitted among the rushes calling out cries of joy hed done it hed found eden slowly daniel stood and rotated around in dazed confirmation there was not a house or a vehicle or a contrail in the sky there was nothing except the birds and the trees and the smell of sweet water it was the emptiest fullest place hed ever been in and the realization was both exhilarating and disquieting there was a peculiar clarity to the air and it took a while for him to analyze what it was not just the lack of haze no it was the absence of machine noise no hum no drone no grumble no tick no clockwork regularity sound instead was uneven the sharp staccato clicks and rustlings of insects and small reptiles and flitting birds seeming jazzlike in its evolved disharmony a riff an improvisation there was a welcome to such discordance but also a somewhat disturbing anarchy to it an irregularity he wasnt yet accustomed to he realized suddenly how the aboriginal drumming and chanting that hed always found dull must have seemed utterly revolutionary to early man chants and songs that were repetitive mathematical predictable reassuring an answer to the drumbeat of their own hearts order to combat the dissidence of unruly nature as the sun climbed and the light grew flatter and more intense the other two began to stir while he waited daniel took his bearings the clearing was a logical drop point he observed open and close to water he wondered if outback adventure had used it before the area seemed so untouched that it felt like they were the first humans to ever be here that australias long human history had never existed perhaps they were the first since the plague coyle had explained that adventurers were set down in widely dispersed places since the company had an entire continent to choose from the idea was exhilarating in the city every place he stepped had been trod a thousand times before here his footfall might be primary he was adam deliberately isolated so that each group achieved the independence and selfreliance it was seeking there could be no second thoughts about waiting here at the dropoff point for a ride back home the transport wouldnt return no matter what happened the time to back out was gone the finality of it was delicious but so daunting he momentarily felt he was looking over a precipice into a chasm too deep to see bottom amaya stirred small and pretty in her sleepiness and slowly sat up looking around with dawning delight its beautiful she cried rubbing her eyes i feel like my brains made of cotton from those sedatives but my god the light its like a painting better than i dreamed tucker groaned and began to move as well his eyelids fluttered for a moment a look of fear crossed his face and then he relaxed he remembered ico stretched stood and glanced around more appraisingly were out of the cage he pronounced i still feel hungover from those chemicals daniel told him how about you he looked sly im sleepy but not from any damn witches brew cooked up by outback adventure i stayed awake and listened to some of the cockpit chatter stayed awake i told you i dont trust the bastards ive got some friends in what you might call the medicinal trade there are things you can get that counter the normal sedative cocktail i took some before we boarded and it fought the drugs it was a little hairy my heart raced for a time while i was trying to play possum but it worked i kept listening for hours until i got so damned tired and bored i just fell asleep naturally tucker shook his head youre one paranoid dude you know that i just wanted to make sure i knew what i was getting into so i could scream bloody hell if i didnt end up liking it and do you like it ico looked around so far where are we master spy daniel asked he looked sheepish australia there was a long pause i didnt pick up any coordinates it was kind of hard to follow the airline bullshit they seemed to have code words great did you learn anything he winked the copilot is screwing an attendant they talked about that for a while the others laughed good job sherlock tucker said the eavesdropper grinned at least i tried we hairless apes need information to survive right which we dont have daniel said well ico added i know where we arent kansas asked tucker no where were supposed to be he enjoyed their mystification since i was awake anyway i had a little fun at the transfer point they tied tags to us like corpses to sort us out i had a minute to shift them while we waited on gurneys in the dark weve been put where one quartet was supposed to be and theyve been put in our place funny no you switched our destination amaya asked why we dont know where we are but now they dont either he bent back his head to shout to the sky you lost your luggage you arrogant bastards some of the birds flew up in alarm daniel shook his head youre crazy you know that damn right im crazy why else would i be here there was some befuddled silence as the others digested what ico had done it shouldnt matter should it so daniel said we dont know where we are or exactly where we have to go should we talk some strategy australia generally gets wetter the farther east you go amaya recited remembering the geography theyd been briefed on the desert looks pretty dry beyond the trees of this oasis judging from that id say we have a long ways to go thats good tucker said i came for a long ways lets be pessimistic daniel said say a thousand straightline miles to the coast and we average fifteen a day but only ten in a straight line amaya amended yeah okay so thats a hundred days a bit over three months we can do that right i dont know if we can move even that fast tucker cautioned eventually we have to look for food water finding our way we should allow for injuries and rest amaya said and some r ampr we should allow for the possibility they set us down ten miles from the west coast and we have to walk across the whole bloody continent which is as big as the united states said ico which is exactly the puzzle we asked for right added tucker we know the most important thing daniel said we have to walk toward that rising sun exodus port is on the east coast and maybe we do know more ico added tucker grinned uhoh here it comes he heard something after all no but i wasnt content with being spoonfed by outback adventure either as far as i was concerned they were the first challenge with their well tell you this but not that bullshit so i did a little research outside the envelope and amaya asked i bought a map what how you can get all kinds of stuff on the black market they didnt confiscate it not unless they unsewed my sleeping bag he bent to his pack i put it in my lining tucker was shaking his head youre something else you know that washington what you did is against the rules what you did does defeat the purpose ico was using a penknife to cut a small slit in his sleeping bag it defeats their purpose which is to have us wandering around the desert like morons my purpose is to prove i can beat the system and think for myself he brought out a folded paper were at war people with nature with outback adventure and with time i intend to win he unfolded the map tada it doesnt matter daniel dismissed here see ico held it up proudly its useless ico he looked irritated what do you mean show me on that map where we are were going to figure out where we are with landmarks show me where were going give me time dyson even if we had a clue where we are on your map we dont know if its fake or real it could lead us astray as easily as take us where we need to go its a complete waste of time and money he didnt like the fact that ico had brought a map without telling them or eavesdropped or switched their dropoff point it was an arrogant little stunt daniel amaya mediated maybe ico said or it just may save your ass he was defiant i checked my supplier out i believe this is real and im trying to play the game by my rules no youre not youre trying to cheat i want to beat them fairly by finding our own way you want to jump through their hoops good doggie i think you should have stayed home if you need a damn road atlas boys please amaya looked like an exasperated schoolteacher is this some kind of testosterone thing or what its a philosophical discussion daniel said about ends and means ico added well this boy thinks we ought to stop talking and start walking tucker said you two can argue along the way about a hundred paces behind amaya and me please ico sighed and shrugged okay ill tuck the map away for now youll be asking for it later in the meantime which way mister letsdoitthehardway daniel pointed toward the rising sun that way before they set out they filtered and drank water from the pools until they were satiated trying to flush the last of the sleep chemicals from their systems then they filled all the water containers they had with several weeks of food on their backs they agreed water posed their biggest challenge they had to find it every two to three days at most then that goal established they started east following the base of a rocky ridge that led roughly in that direction the walking was neither particularly difficult nor easy there was little soil the ground instead dominated by sand clay rocks and a dry clumpy grass that pricked at them when they brushed it forcing a meandering course between its tufts spinifex amaya identified it was necessary to watch constantly where one stepped but the route was fairly level and it was not hard to make progress in an easterly direction and keep oriented as delighted as they were to finally be in australia daniel thought it was satisfying to begin making progress across it ahead was their simple new goal behind a confirmation of how far theyd come progress a mile already he knew he shouldnt be counting steps but the habit of setting a schedule measuring miles and listing goals was impossible to break they were not accustomed to wander the air had the same astonishing clarity of the videos theyd seen with no atmospheric haze to soften what seemed a hard angular land the few clouds that had been present at dawn disappeared leaving a blank blue sky of steadily increasing heat as the sun rose and the shadows shrank every grain of sand and waxy leaf seemed picked out in detail in this light there was no mystery about the kind of place they had come to it was brittle thin challenging this is real inyourface kind of country tucker called it as if to make his description literal the flies came as the morning warmed swarming in numbers beyond the experience of any in the quartet the insects didnt bite but they orbited the adventurers heads with a persistence that soon grew annoying they buzzed into ears eyes nose and mouth seeking human fluids and were kept at bay only with a tiresome flapping of the arm lord almighty tucker complained i dont remember being told about these i read about them amaya said the joke is that your waving arm was the australian salute some claim the europeans brought them theyre a curse for despoiling the land i just got here they should go curse someone else a hot breeze kept the bugs at bay for a while but any stillness brought them back a thousand miles with these guys ico panted theres about thirty that have landed on that house youre carrying on your back tucker said not that youd feel the difference its your lunch freidel buzzing wilderness protein seriously man how can you expect to carry all that flies no half an outdoor store this pack is going to keep me not only alive my good tucker but comfortable its a hell of a long walk to the beach and im not going to be miserable the whole time you just need to keep up thats all i am keeping up big guy in fact if i dont run you into the ground ill give you my coffeemaker he nodded to carry the intensity of the southern sun soon became apparent much of australia was as close to the equator as mexico and the solar radiation was more powerful than what the four were accustomed to they stopped frequently to make adjustments with the coolness of dawn swiftly evaporating jackets came off and sunscreen came on they donned widebrimmed hats and sunglasses ico dug into his pack and brought out a fine mesh bag stuffed with food he emptied the containers into other pockets in his pack and slipped the bag over his hat and head pulling the drawstring around his throat voila he announced no flies but you cant see what we came for amaya objected i can see a hell of a lot better through this mesh than with flies in my eyes tucker grinned wait until he needs a drink of water sure enough when ico loosened the net to drink flies found their way inside the opening and began feasting on his sweat he swatted angrily but the insects couldnt find their way back out damn finally he furiously pulled the bag and hat off his head and shook them to rid himself of the bugs more insects whined around his head i dont believe this the others laughed he glared then looked thoughtfully at the invention balled in his hand dont worry ive got a tube in this hardware store on my back next time ill use it as a straw ill get it right he jerked the net back on isnt that hot amaya asked its shady by lunchtime the heat pressed down with the weight of an iron and the morning excitement had given way to a dull dizziness the flies were so persistent that the others began to envy icos head net finally daniel spotted a shadow on the ridge and suggested they take a break the shadow was made by a rock overhang its shade dropping the temperature a good ten degrees they collapsed in its gloom and noticed with relief that the flies didnt like to follow them into the cooler dark weary they slowly unfastened pack pockets to nibble lightly on their food and sip water then they lay back so are we having fun yet ico asked its a little bleak tucker admitted still it beats working for a living ive worked up a good sweat you know what i mean this is different were doing what we want to do i read that primitive tribes had to work as little as two hours a day to feed themselves amaya said the rest was leisure to do what swat flies you dont like it ico tucker asked no i do i do i think the big nothing its what i came for different perspective right but im not going to pretend its paradise either its hotter than i expected daniel admitted and this is the australian fall they dont really have an autumn amaya said i mean where leaves come off but it should keep getting cooler our summer is their winter this is fall what the devil is summer like tucker wondered we should reach the coast and get back long before we have to find out amaya said and if not asked ico well be acclimated i hope if were stuck eight months and see their summer solstice on december twentyfirst the sun should be directly above the tropic of capricorn at noon we can measure its angle above us and try to calculate our northsouth position from the tropic get a better sense of where we are oh good lets stay and fry our brains much easier than trying to read my map well also look at the stars tonight and find the southern cross you can tell position by the distance of constellations above the horizon the difficulty is determining our position east and west thats what gave navigators fits for centuries and that of course is what we need to know isnt the whole point not to know daniel interrupted im not here to argue against maps ico but didnt we come here to live in the moment without all these numbers fixing us in space and time i caught myself guessing distance but really who cares where we are for the first time in my life im just walking i dont know how far weve come i dont know how far we have to go i dont know what time it is my mind isnt three days ahead and two days behind and anticipating fifteen appointments and worrying about my retirement and my headstone suddenly my stomach is all i need to keep track of mealtimes and the sun is my alarm clock im here taking in the now they considered that i agree ico said its why i felt it didnt hurt to switch our dropoff point lets live in the moment but at some point we have to get back he glanced at his wrist its oneseventeen by the way if im in the right time zone its when you throw that watch away that youll be in the right zone touche but he kept the watch on they looked out at the desert from their rock shelter a slope of sandstone gave way to a plain as flat and featureless as the face of a calm ocean stunted trees and shrubs graygreen studded the pan of sand out to a horizon where the ground evaporated into a shimmering mirage of blue water bleeding into an equally blue sky nothing moved except a hawk wheeling on the thermals get back tucker said suddenly hell i just got here as the afternoon progressed the desert became more beautiful what had seemed to be crabbed trees cowering under the hammer of the sun at noon now lengthened with their afternoon shadows trunks of white and gray taking on sinuous grace colors grew richer as the sun dropped sand making snaking dunes of an eerie red they crossed two sandy watercourses with no visible water amaya pointed out that the tiny ants that marched everywhere on the riverbanks seemed absent on the dry streambeds we should camp on the sand she observed less bugs it was prettier on the empty rivers as well the white eucalyptus grew taller and more beautiful than the desert bush and seemed in its serene majesty as timeless and still as the rocks at a third riverbed they found a pool of standing water and stopped the sky on fire behind them a deepening blue ahead honey im home ico called heaving off his pack in relief they guessed theyd come ten miles daniel was the only one who hadnt brought a tent deciding to rely on a light tarp instead bright fabric mushrooms puffed up from the other three to form an instant village the thin nylon a comfortable shield against the emptiness of this great outside there was a bit of awkward unfamiliarity as they set up their stoves and prepared their first real meal sharing dishes but also good humor at the fact they were succeeding on their own with these simple tasks tucker dragged in some wood and lit a fire with a match its purpose was more psychological than to heat or cook man is here tucker shouted to the desert he will prevail the noise drifted away across the sand and woman amaya had erected her tent first theres only one of you ico noted shell prevail anyway daniel predicted smarter saner and more centered than any of us she grinned at him centered or selfcentered the center of our universe ico crooned as the light disappeared so did the flies stars began to pop out first like isolated beacons and then faster and faster like a growing storm of snow the night shone with starlight the silken ribbon of the milky way a familiar streak but the constellations strange amaya pointed to a cluster of stars to the south the southern cross she said well keep it on our right as we travel sparks climbed skyward and seemed to join the stars daniel got a laugh with his story of how hed started a tiny blaze in his apartment ill pay fifty bucks to see you do that again offered ico you brought money just what i had in case we got held up somewhere he shrugged ill probably keep it though for emergencies and pay you at home thats crazier than rubbing sticks you know that come on i want to see you do it no im too tired last time it took me hours besides youll get to see me do it for free once we run out of matches civilization starting to look better then he held up a match not good enough that id want to be carrying seventyfive pounds like youre doing ico grinned it gets lighter with every match the light and food and rest relaxed them erasing memories of the heat of the day they laughed at icos espresso maker with its solar battery chip but they each had a cup see what im looking for is balance he explained i know this shit is silly but why not take the best of both worlds and enjoy ourselves out here its society i dont like not technology bureaucracy not gadgets my goal is to find out whats really necessary whats really important and then plan permanent escape i take the essentials into a wild pocket of the world maybe even sneak back here and live my life not theirs even robinson crusoe had a lot of shipwreck gear to salvage id want that too you dont happen to have an ice cream maker stuffed away do you crusoe tucker asked im craving strawberry ripple nah but maybe theres still wild cows in australia if you catch one freidel ill make you a latte despite his weariness from the days walk daniel was too restless to immediately sleep he strolled up the riverbed the gray sand shimmering under the stars and the night strangely comforting in its glow this was not a scary place at all he decided he also liked the smell of australia there was none of the odor of moist soil and decay like some wet northern forests he had hiked in but rather a scent of dry wood and plant oils that strangely reminded him of dusty furniture the aridity seemed clean he could hear animals scuttling away in the night and he wondered who the groups neighbors were there were no large predators in australia he knew eventually they might run into wild domestics dogs camels cows pigs but for the moment nature seemed unfamiliar harmless and discreet he sat on a log looked up into the night sky and shivered the glorious immensity not just of the universe but this strange red desert it was intimidating to think of being so far from help but liberating too he could go anywhere do anything be anything all the restraints were off except the ones remaining in his head this could be heaven he thought roaming endlessly with his house on his back and exploring the uncharted terrain of his own spirit he could do it forever with the right person daniel wondered if raven was out there somewhere and if so whether she was walking with a man other than himself he wondered if hed ever see her again there was a rustle and he turned it was amaya can i join you he beckoned and she sat down on the log next to him its nicest at night she said no wonder thats when most of the desert creatures move about i think were going to have to change our habits move early and late hole up at midday were prisoners of that sun prisoners i thought we came here for freedom daniel oops we just need to get in rhythm thats what i meant but it was an interesting slip ive heard that when youre jailed long enough you never really get free you become a prisoner in your own mind everything looks like a wall and you learn to like your jailers youre worried thats you of course we do have to be realistic about what we can achieve out here she said animals arent really free they spend their lives bound by the weather the seasons and hunting or being hunted we shouldnt romanticize them or their existence or pretend we can find a life without limitations but i liked what you said today about getting away from numbers and schedules and maps i think were here to break bad habits or at least recognize and examine them he looked at her face pale in the starlight amaya was actually quite pretty he decided not beautiful in the conventional sense of a model but rather kind good with bright intelligent eyes a wide smile and a grounded sensibility he found reassuring her appeal snuck up on you it was interesting shed sought him out i think the voice of reason so far has been you he said us boys can get kind of silly sometimes we enjoy the arguing its like a game i know they sat for a while staring up at the sky i never knew there could be so many stars daniel said we never see them at home the light they cast is amazing maybe someday those stars will be our new wilderness do you think a wilderness to explore that goes on to infinity but not yet weve barely put our toe into space so for now this is as far out as people like you and i can get did you ever want to be an astronaut she shivered no space seemed too cold so now youre a bush ranger instead im just a woman who wants to fall in love with this world as it is or rather was i dont need the planets i want to feel at home here and do you after one day its too early to tell but im glad i came i was right about you being centered you seem the most balanced of any of us you recognize what were seeing you dont complain and your gear seems well organized youre so normal im wondering what youre doing here she laughed looking like everyone else looking for what a place no a person thats what women look for a boyfriend youve sort of cut down the number of possibilities havent you three losers daniel youre not fair to yourself but no not a boyfriend i want a companion in a place that gets rid of all the modern complications that get in the way of friendship and i may have found three such companions already but thats not the person i mean someone to love then someday but another first who me he waited for her to explain its true i havent found love yet she said but what i realized back home is that first i have to find myself chapter twelve they rose at dawn again as enchanted as ever by the ethereal light and ate and packed quickly despite the lack of schedule they couldnt break the habit of disciplined briskness readying quickly so they could put more miles behind them daniel who had brought no tent and no sleeping bag and no stove was ready first his pack was lightest because the others were carrying more food as well his supply was mostly power rations and staples like rice the others carried more elaborate freezedried meals ive got enough for a month if i stretch it daniel told them when ico asked what i really need to do and want to do is live off the land otherwise im just a tourist more power to you said ico carefully but i mean no offense when i say we should each eat what we carry im packing twice the rations but i didnt bring all this food to feed anyone else i just dont want any expectations down the line okay no one expects you to feed us if i lived off you ico i wouldnt have achieved a thing by coming here i dont want the fish i want to learn how to fish and if i catch one ill share it no dyson tucker said then you teach us how to fish ill be impressed if you just find enough water to fish in amaya said well find everything we need once we learn how to look daniel took the hunting knife he had brought and cut a staff of tolerable straightness from a grayleafed spiny bush sharpening one end voila he announced walking stick javelin water probe and ridgepole for my ground cover in case it rains free portable disposable and replaceable the perfect product patent number yeah but can you swat flies with it ico asked they set out their boots striking up little puffs of dust as they walked the pink powder settling on their ankles and shoes like fine talcum the heat rose again the insects came back and this time there was no convenient overhang for a midday refuge they rested in the shade of what amaya identified as a mulga tree their thirst enormous even though the air was too dry for them to visibly sweat their thickening throats were warning enough of how the desert baked out liquids they drank freely to replenish themselves the horizon was a shimmer of heat haze and the range of hills theyd been following was flattening out ahead was a flat plain of scrubby emptiness with no visible landmarks it looked as featureless as an ocean all they could do was follow compass sun and the stars to the east conversation lagged as the weight of their packs bit deeper and the insects became more annoying at one point ico got out his map studied it and then shrugged and put it back without comment the desert was so featureless that there was nothing to establish their position with even if the chart was real still the freedom to choose their way was liberating daniel thought they saw no kangaroos but did spy a dingo a dog first brought by the aborigines and now wild as the wind it loped into the brush ahead of them like a furtive coyote there were birds flies ants on a dare amaya tasted one of the green ants that the aborigines ate and said it tasted bitter but mostly like nothing at all she was the one who stopped most frequently to mentally catalog shrubs and grasses hawks and kites orbited in the sky daniel periodically threw his makeshift spear at a rock or twisted dead tree trunk his accuracy inconsistent but slowly improving until he began to tire ico working to keep up under his heavy pack as the hours went by shook his head in amusement look at that hes better than a dog he throws his own stick just aiming at the flies ico daniel replied i plan to spear them all tucker called a halt at midafternoon blisters he announced the others took the opportunity to examine their carefully padded feet readjusting protection and massaging red spots im so swollen it looks like im walking on melons amaya wailed i thought i was in shape but im finding muscles the gym didnt know i had daniel confessed im finding pain my muscles didnt know they had ico sighed leaning back against his massive pack the others raised their eyebrows i know i know its too big hey im eating my way through it their hope of camping in a riverbed was dashed when none appeared the second evening the initial exhilaration was gone and they felt not only tired but dirty ico sneaked a glance at his watch he was waiting for the sun to go down there was no fresh water and they realized they had to ration what was left how can we walk without water tucker asked worriedly as the nights eventual chill lured them tighter to their fire it looked like the land falls off a bit ahead amaya replied we look in the depression for a riverbed and search seriously for water we cant push farther until we find it but thats not very far ico objected we need to make our mileage no we dont we need to drink the stark truth of her statement sobered them for a minute tucker shivered and its cold tonight colder than it was last night roast during the day freeze at night thats the desert for you daniel said we should have caught that dingo to eat no to cuddle with aborigines used their dogs for warmth a cold evening was a three or fourdog night awooooo tucker called maybe i can lure one with that call theyll try to mate ico said thatll warm you up of course theres another alternative he smiled sweetly at amaya in your dreams washington im just inventorying our resources use your gadgets to keep yourself warm they found another sandy riverbed at noon the next day but even after following it upstream for several miles they found no water doesnt this country have any wet stuff in its rivers tucker asked rhetorically this is weird lunch was quiet the flies so persistent that the travelers had mostly given up trying to swat at them though ico still wore his head net they were down to a quart of water each if we dont find more water we might have to hike back daniel said gloomily we cant go on without it amaya looked thoughtfully at the sand ive got an idea she said lets go back to that bend we passed a mile or so ago i dont want to go backward ico groused in fact i dont want to do anything right now im exhausted lets nap i told you that you were carrying too much tucker lectured im keeping up i just dont want to go into reverse whats your idea daniel asked amaya theres probably water under the sand here deserts swallow it after a rain but it doesnt disappear we just have to dig in the right place so whats the right place ill show you come on ico its not far aw mom they trudged back it was strange to encounter their own footprints it was the first sign of humans theyd seen in this place at the bend of the dry river there was a sandy bluff the water had eaten into and a hollow in the sand beneath it the dynamics of the surface water digs out pools at places like this she explained im betting there might be another pool beneath us in the sand she dropped her pack got a stick and began to dig come on the men joined her each taking a turn it was blisteringly hot if youre wrong were going to melt right here tucker warned yes this is our first real test two feet down the sand darkened then grew moist widen the hole she directed the sand flew more furiously and then they stopped exhausted dirty water drained into it its just mud daniel objected amaya scooped out the muddy water and cast it aside on the sand thats just from our disturbance now we wait the trick in the wild is patience they retreated to the shade of some gum trees and sat weary the sun was dipping lower and they allowed themselves sips of their last water i thought it would be easier to drink out here daniel admitted if outback adventure drops people in at random like that i mean the company didnt emphasize waterfinding skills and the desert is pretty green i assumed wed find some water each day maybe that was our first test ico replied our assumptions the good news is its a test were passing tucker said optimistically we found water anyway right time crawled on daniel lay back to study the branches of the trees watching the flitting birds wanting something to do he began to try to identify them ico had taken out a book on disk tucker dozed and amaya sat as if meditating the group was nervous but no one wanted to articulate it they could die out here and no one was coming to their rescue as the shadows lengthened a bird fluttered down and hopped to the lip and then into the trench it gave a call and flew out amaya came out of her trance and crawled forward lying on the lip of the hole as if mesmerized then she turned to grin daniel bring a cup they camped in the riverbed that night first drinking their fill from the slowly filling hole and then carefully refilling their water bottles as amaya had predicted cleaner water had flowed into the hole filtered by the sand they drank and drank and then collected more water to wash a reminder of civility that helped revive their spirits the success of the well restored their confidence with patience they could prevail a new moon rose and daniel decided to go hunting taking his spear he climbed out of the riverbank and into the surrounding bush moving slowly and taking his bearings frequently so he wouldnt get lost twice he saw furtive movement and once he threw at it hitting nothing still his ability to negotiate the wilderness in the dark encouraged him it was another step toward being at home here they broke camp before dawn to set out east again having filled every possible container with water the sun was fixing their schedule a hard mornings hike a siesta another spurt toward likely water and camp as they moved out some large forms bounded away in front of them kangaroos daniel breathed even ico bent under his heavy pack brightened cool when are you going to hit one of those daniel tucker asked when they agree to stand still the sky was as shiny as blue porcelain the desert as red as mars they wound eastward through shrubby trees spaced like slalom poles amaya spotted some sap on another mulga tree collected some bits on a stick and ate it its sweet like candy she said dubious the men tried it well better than ant balls ico said how do you know she teased him i havent made one of those for you yet they found water again that night this time in a series of pools on the surface and amaya found some wild passion fruit in the creek bed splitting the orange rind and sucking out the seeds their sense of familiarity was growing they built a fire again and as its coals burned down daniel slipped off to hunt once more his confidence growing at his ability to navigate in the dark he began to move slowly walking a short distance and then stopping to stand perfectly still his eyes searching the monochromatic moonscape for movement after an hour his effort was rewarded a shape in the darkness moved then hopped toward him a kangaroo he sucked in his breath and waited it hopped closer he raised his makeshift javelin and as he did so his own movement alerted the animal and it bolted by the time daniel threw it was a shadow bounding into the dark he trotted to pick up his spear next time hed have to stalk with his arm already upraised still he felt satisfied hed found big game he spent a few minutes simply throwing rocks sticks his spear he was training unfamiliar muscles in a skill that dated back a million years as he slowly worked his way down the riverbed back to camp he heard some gentle splashing and stopped again alert something was in a pool of the riverbed slowly he crept ahead his spear upraised his head down he pushed his head through some bushes and then stopped sucking in his breath it was amaya bathing she was naked standing in water to her thighs her slim body luminous under the glow of the night sky she was scooping up water and letting it pour onto her face and then run down her small breasts and smooth belly the drops glittered as they bounced off her falling into a mirror of stars she washed with the same unconscious grace of a wild animal and daniel was jarred by the natural beauty of it entranced by her forms pearl luminescence under the night sky he didnt know whether it was best to try to retreat possibly startling and embarrassing her with his noise or to step into view as warning intruding on her respite finally he decided to do and say nothing she dipped to her shoulders in the cold water with a gasp and then sprang upward the water spraying as she shook herself her arms flung out it was erotic to watch the water stream down her but also innocent primeval there was an abstraction to the scene her features were indistinct and so there was only the sculpture of her limbs and torso bent this way and that daniel was transfixed finally she finished and waded to the shore to slip into her underwear and walk back to camp she paused a minute and looked across the pool as if staring directly at him then slipped away into the dark he waited ten more minutes and then followed shed retired into her tent he slipped into his own bedroll looking up into a night sky that seemed like a pool of dark water itself the next day was long and hot and the following evening they were on a scrub plain and couldnt find even a likely place to dig they nursed what water they had carefully sprawled on the red earth after a few minutes tucker sprang up again ants im on a damn nest he moved to a new spot searching the ground carefully some campground he grumbled all we can do is sleep as best we can and push on daniel said the dryness was beginning to be discouraging he felt sunburned insectbitten and grimy and had yet to get close enough to an animal to successfully kill it he knew he hadnt been patient enough but didnt want to hold up the group to take the time necessary to learn how to hunt at some point though they would need the food even ico daniel mused about making a bow and arrow but it sounded difficult and he knew the aborigines hadnt bothered even when shown them by visiting tribes their spears and throwing sticks and rocks had been adequate to bring down game all he was lacking was skill wed better walk tomorrow until we find water ico said walk and pray for rain they hiked on the next day through the midday sun conversation trailing off into numbed silence under the pounding heat red dust puffed up from their footfalls the mornings birds disappeared and the desert was as still and radiantly hot as an emptied parking lot nothing moved except the flies no breeze blew and there was no sound except the creak of their gear the trudge of feet and the relentless buzz of the insects they joked halfheartedly about missing beer or air conditioning or a winter blizzard but after a while the jokes seemed lame the liberation from noise and humanity was beginning to seem oppressive it seemed like theyd been walking forever and had encountered only a vast nothing that they were no closer to finding whatever it was they were looking for than they had been in the city it was becoming harder and harder to pretend their outing was a good time it was sunset when they finally came to another riverbed this one broad and shallow in a valley so imperceptibly sloped that they hadnt realized they were in one there were no standing pools no likely bends and a test dig yielded nothing but dry sand they slumped around the hole wearily were exhausted amaya said well have to ration what we have and search more carefully in the morning well find a place for a well like last time what if we dont tucker asked she brushed her hair back from a dirty cheek tired we will if it was going to be easy there would be no point in coming here daniel nodded at her hed found himself looking and thinking about her differently since seeing her at the pool and even though he hadnt said anything about it he thought she noticed she turned her head away shyly this is fucked you know that icos complaint was ignored what could they do he persisted i mean dying of thirst was not a part of the brochure that i remember ico stuff it okay daniel said with irritation turning to unstrap his bedroll he was tiring of the little mans attitude were all hot and tired and thirsty maybe were doing something wrong maybe were going in the wrong direction you want to walk away from exodus port i just want a drink man doesnt it ever rain it does up there tucker pointed to the north lightning flickered in the dusk they heard the distant growl of thunder maybe well get a storm down here ico stood and looked to the north hopefully hey rain come this way he waved his arms yoohoo he turned to the others we just need to think as well as walk thats all im saying so think dont complain ico watched the luminous horizon rumbling like an artillery barrage if rain comes we should put out some containers to catch it and a ground sheet now youre an optimist again he grinned in this godforsaken place im not stupid tucker just desperate he bent to his pack just in case we get lucky though im going to put out every dish i have chapter thirteen daniels exhausted dreams were so turbulent that at first tuckers warning cry seemed to come from the miasma of his nightmare in his sleep he was lost on a vast white plain it was as flat as a piece of paper and crisscrossed with his own tracks his footprints led off confusingly in all directions and he was uncertain if the whiteness at his feet was sand or snow there was an ominous rumbling in the distance daniel was overwhelmed by a feeling of sad uncertainty of having made a fatal wrong turn and the resulting dread was threatening to paralyze him before he could decide what to do however tuckers cries became more insistent finally they blew the vividness of his dream into the shards of dark reality and he opened his eyes it was night in australia black and confused get up tucker was roaring get up get up its flooding the big man was dragging something uphill it was amayas tent daniel realized and the woman was yelling inside it then the horizon flashed and in the lightnings lurid blast he saw trees shaking wildly and the glint of something wet pouring toward him like a chocolate slurry it was as if the land had risen and was being shaken toward him in undulating waves flash flood daniels bedroll had the grace of being zipperless and he was out of it and scrambling for higher ground in an instant instinctively dragging his bedding with him a breaking wave of muddy water was pouring down the dry river bottom to devour their camp as he surmounted the bank and grasped the trunk of a tree lightning flashed again and he saw the water strike something angular and carry it off there was a muffled shout icos tent in numbed fascination daniel watched one of the containers that had been put out to catch some raindrops being swept away in the current the wall of water had appeared out of nowhere and now it roared by with a furious gush of rolling stones pitching logs and jabbing branches devouring everything in its path with the noise and clumsy power of a medieval army the sound was overwhelming and the night had turned pitch black daniels blindness relieved only by strobes of lightning the flashes were dry there was not a drop of rain and yet even as he registered the weirdness of this the storm opened and a cloudburst sluiced down adding to the din daniel felt hed been clubbed so heavy was the water it pushed him to his knees ico daniel it was tucker shouting from the dark trees farther from the river daniel groped in that direction there was a flash of lightning and he saw the tall man leaning against a tree with rainwater streaming down his face a stunned wet amaya was crawling from her tangled muddied tent her eyes wide and she clutched a moment at tuckers leg as if to seek reassurance daniel stumbled up to them you all right they said it simultaneously ico daniel gasped i saw the river take him we have to go hunt downstream amaya stood unsteadily the rain lashing at them and then gripped them both with a look of grim determination we might need a rope she shouted ill get the clothesline we rigged you two start down and ill follow are you going to be all right daniel shouted back yes yes go on tucker pulled at him and the two men moved off clumsily in the dark following the edge of the flood but keeping a wary distance as sections of sandy bank collapsed the water bucked and pitched eating at the shore with greedy menace and both men feared their companion was already gone there was a flash and a following crack of thunder so close upon it that they staggered as if an artillery shell had gone off nearby sparks flew in the night and there was a crash of something falling in the trees daniel wanted desperately to crouch and hide and wait until the storm was over but forced himself to keep going he tripped sprawled and got up again as tucker hauled on his arm i heard a yell the big man shouted they felt their way to the rivers edge rain beating on them like hail lightning stabbed again and they saw a tree had toppled into the current something synthetic caught in its branches and fluttering in the current like a flag icos tent there was another yell and they saw a dark shape in the branches that could be someones head ico tucker roared we see you work yourself this way their companion was obviously trying but any loosening of his grip threatened to release him into the current im going after him tucker growled he leaped in dropping to his waist on the upstream end of his log and immediately his feet were jerked out from under him and he went under the tree saving himself only by grabbing the bark and hauling himself back upward on the downstream side with difficulty he heaved himself back onto shore spitting dirty water damn daniel studied the tree trunk shuddering in the flood its roots not yet fully pried out of the ground im lighter he shouted above the rain ill climb out to him and you follow when i get to him hold my ankles and dont let go the tree was slick and shook more violently the farther he inched out along it the flood sucking at the wood in perspective he felt like a bug swirling toward a drain his face just inches from the water ico he screamed into the storm work this way an arm flailed as their companion struggled to do so grasping a new branch and letting go of the old and then being jerked furiously by the current his body like a rag snapped by the wind icos strength had to be ebbing daniel felt tuckers huge hands grasp his ankles like a reassuring vise and the clamp was enough to give him the courage to stretch farther toward the third man as if on a rack lightning lit the river and they glimpsed each others terrified face ico reached touched blindly grabbed slipped and then snared daniels wrist with his other hand as he was being pulled away by the current the fumbling was enough to pull daniel from the tree as well and they pivoted daniels legs in tuckers grasp then with a frustrated grunt the third man was levered off the tree too and the trio was in the flood waters swirling downstream in a confused tangle they went under ico clawing in terror at the other two everything seemed stronger than daniel tucker the frantic ico the kick and butt of the river they struck something hard and it was enough to ricochet them to the surface sucking in breaths that were half water and half air they were in a mad pirouette totally disoriented tuckerrrr amaya was somewhere on the bank sprinting ahead of them and they thrashed in unison toward the sound of her voice a bolt of lightning illuminated the uncoiling arc of a hurled line tuckers arm went up and he caught the rope just as amaya was taking a desperate turn around a tree the line tightened and so did the muscles on the big mans arm as he gripped with all his might now the river worked in their favor pivoting them into the bank they banged against roots scrabbled and clung gasping for breath in the waterfilled air daniel got an arm around icos chest and hauled and finally they were up their knees on sand he felt amayas small hands trying to drag them and slowly they worked away from the floods grip ico was coughing and cursing the men lay as if dead for a moment the woman crouched over them like shelter from the storm only slowly did the group realize that the rain had stopped as suddenly as it had begun the cloudburst had moved south the electricity of its fury glinting there the river was still full but its roar had become less angry the crest of the flood had passed them you okay washington it was tucker his chest still heaving as he gasped in deep breaths hell no ico groaned i almost drowned he was soaked and coated with sand looking as thin and forlorn as a wet cat i had to get out of my bag and then out of my tent damn i was scared where did that water come from you prayed for it if i remember correctly amaya said flash flood daniel explained the desert doesnt absorb water so a storm upstream sends all the rain down i should have remembered that were lucky we all didnt drown we were stupid to camp in the riverbed when we saw that storm it came and went so fast amaya said the stars were popping out again illuminating the churning water with dim light now we know why the ants dont nest in the riverbed tucker said by morning the river was gone again leaving only periodic pools for breakfast they ate some peanuts amaya had brought into her tent the rest of their food had been carried downstream and theyd have to look for it at least we have water daniel tried to joke even that will be gone again in a few days ill bet amaya replied tucker shook his head when they said adventure they werent kidding they should have warned us about the possibility of floods ico was glum this isnt right theres something about this whole thing thats not right we could have died in our beds shouldnt they have warned us you said that before tucker chided notice how hard it is to file a complaint oh im going to complain all right im going to raise bloody hell come on daniel argued as much to himself as the others this is what we paid for were alive and were learning thats the whole point isnt it learning what damn fools we are ico said they fanned out downstream and began retrieving gear some of it half buried and much of it dented or torn it was hot dispiriting work because so much had been lost they brought what they salvaged to an assembly point under a red river gum tree on the sandy bank and went through it hanging food bags out of the reach of ants slowly a meager inventory began to emerge we have three of the four packs daniel summarized amayas had not been found one tent tuckers is lost and icos is in rags but his sleeping bag is salvageable we can cut it in two for the men to use as blankets and use icos tent fabric to repair amayas my bedroll was saved too the best news is our boots the others nodded theyd gotten in the habit of propping them upside down on branches to keep out snakes or insects and the bushes theyd used had been high enough on the bank to be out of reach of the river they could still walk but some of the clothes and utensils are gone daniel went on well have to share and the food half was either lost or spoiled amaya said gloomily we should have hung it up like the shoes it would keep it from animals as well next time were learning okay so what are we going to eat ico asked what we always intended to the food of the land we just have to learn how to do it a bit quicker thats all daniel lets face it were screwed it was tucker all that gear lightens our load look now we can move lighter and faster the aborigines didnt need that crap and neither do we ico was about to sink into the sand with all that gear no i wasnt weve still got one compass some matches a stove daniel felt in his pocket and pulled out a small figurine and this good luck charm what the devil is that ico asked gordo firecracker righter of wrongs nemesis of evil and the worstperforming charm ive ever seen havent you heard of st christopher were alive arent we and lightyears ahead of our primitive ancestors still and all we have to do is walk out walk to the coast and go home a thousand miles maybe we dont know that maybe less maybe even farther but we can do it were a bit bruised a bit wiser a bit tougher i hope this is what the adventure is all about the riskiest thing on earth ico was quoting elliott coyle no one needed to reply well we lost some canteens tucker said thats serious for sure its time to find some gourds some of the aborigines made water bags from kangaroo skin and maybe well travel by night instead of day to conserve how fast we use water and weve got to hunt tucker added you and i are going to do that right now seriously we need to learn in a hurry amaya and ico can check out the plants around here weve got to supplement the pack food we have left starting immediately who put you in charge dyson it was ico looking tired the weather they spent two days at the site of the flood relieved from having to cover distance they began to notice more details of the country they were in the desert seemed most alive at dusk and dawn when day and night shifts of animals converged and the coolness encouraged browsing the rain had brought an instant riot of new growth and the nearby grassy plain was blooming with wildflowers that shimmered like a rainbow sea amaya found gourds to hold water and urged the others to look for brightly colored fruits that would indicate ripeness they found wild orange wild fig bush tomato and plum the fruits were smaller and less sweet than what the adventurers were accustomed to but edible they ate them cautiously nonetheless so as not to cramp their stomachs hunting success was slow twice more daniel encountered kangaroos in the evening but was no more successful in getting close than before he had more luck with the outbacks huge lizards some three and four feet long which could be found dozing in the sun with a patient stalk a sprint and hard throw he managed to spear two clubbing the stunned animals before they could scuttle off he gutted them with his knife the blood staining the sand and then swaggered back to camp swinging his kill by their tails well ill be ico greeted dyson killed some dinosaurs its a start daniel said you wont mind if i observe they look about as appetizing as toad shit you wont mind that i dont give you a share ah ico looked at the reptiles more closely they do have a certain beauty i now see goddamned gorgeous if youre hungry enough conceded they built a fire and sampled the meat a years salary to eat lizard daniel joked secretly pleased at his success great white hunter aint bad tucker judged like chicken everything tastes like chicken ico reminded not this ill bet it was amaya slyly holding something up the men recoiled what in the hell is that she was holding up what looked like a white writhing worm or a huge naked caterpillar it was longer and thicker than a mans thumb its a witchetty grub i read about them you dig at the base of a witchetty bush where the ground is cracked a what those gray ugly shrubs the grubs live in the roots you crack the root to get at them i tried it its hard work ico laughed youve got to be kidding thats a big bug right its got segments spots its supposed to be rich in protein and vitamins and very filling filling enough that ill bet no one ever eats two daniel said ill bet she wont even eat one ico said he reached in his pocket and pulled something out here i had this on me when the flood hit he slapped down a wrinkled hundreddollar note this says theres no way anybody is going to eat that the aborigines did i want to see you do it she held up its writhing form ill share it with you ico id rather starve you havent even been hungry yet suddenly she tilted her head back closed her eyes and dropped the grub into her mouth swallowing with an audible gulp without biting oh my god tucker cried ico was awed more astonishing than ursula uvula on sexnet amaya looked straight ahead fighting to keep it down the trick she breathed tightly is to swallow it head first so it cant crawl back out she shivered then smiled its really not too bad i cant feel it moving she snatched up the hundred dollars i want more when i make an ant ball she said fiercely it was worth a hundred bucks to see you do that said ico my god amaya you are some woman ill have some fantasies about that one she threw some sand at him no really he persisted that was better than fishing us out of the drink the foraging had restored some confidence and they set out east again the loneliness of australia was its preeminent characteristic in the week since theyd arrived theyd seen no other human encountered no other track and discovered no road or evidence of past habitation it was as if they were the last or first people on earth the spangled night sky emphasized their feeling of smallness and daniel realized what a distorted sense of reality it had been to spend most of his life in enclosed rooms rooms were accomplishment enough to make their human builders feel important and small enough to make their occupants feel big a room represented not just interior space but boundaries enclosure fortification territory the desert felt just the opposite the flatness was so monotonous that there was little feeling of getting anywhere and the sky so huge that daniel felt like a microbe under the eye of the sun instead of being depressed by this perception however he decided to be encouraged by it if he was not dominating his environment then he was becoming a part of it woven into its web it didnt make him smaller it joined him to something bigger since he was made from chemicals first forged in exploding stars he reasoned he shouldnt be intimidated by the vastness of the sky but feel at home with it sister stars for the first time in his life he didnt have to get out of his apartment or workplace or city to get somewhere there was no there everything was here he was always no matter where he slept home so are you finding what you were looking for it was amaya dropping back to walk beside him in part i was just thinking i like the immensity of the place it makes you feel less significant and more so at the same time and somehow that feels right really im a little frightened by it its bigger than i imagined that flood the suddenness of it scared me you didnt seem very scared that was quick thinking to get the rope i wasnt thinking i was reacting what if you three had drowned he glanced at her it would have left the most resourceful of the four no i would have died very lonely and very afraid and very quickly i know that its beautiful here but i dont have that feeling of rightness yet i think women need something more people i think you said a person her look was both challenging and questioning daniel was quiet trying to decide how he wanted to respond he liked this woman you said youve found only part of what youre looking for she finally went on what part are you still seeking he took a breath a person oh she watched him his face tan his clothes red from dust there was a new hardness to him she realized less of the boy and more of the man now he was looking straight ahead avoiding her implied question we have that in common i guess he stopped then and turned to her she stopped too i joined outback adventure because i met a woman who told me about it he explained i think she might have come here before me im not really looking for her but i wonder if shes out here somewhere i wonder how shes doing it wouldnt be honest not to tell you that amaya nodded trying not to betray emotion i understand i like you amaya youre like her in a way her smile was pained daniel thats great i hope you find her i just didnt want to mislead you or anything he felt awkward and suddenly resentful that shed made him talk about it he hadnt been thinking about raven and now he had to i appreciate the honesty i mean she doesnt even like me as near as i can tell i just need to be sure thats fine i was just curious im sorry he squinted at her it must be hard for you being the only woman i hadnt thought much about that youre all behaving yourselves she looked away i wouldnt mind finding your friend though finding another woman i think it would be less frightening sometimes i think shes out here nearby like i can feel it that sounds nice no its distracting they were quiet for a while finally he reached out his fingertips touching her hand amaya youll find what youre looking for not just yourself but someone else i know it im sure i will she said lightly looking around at the desert to avoid his eyes sometimes the trick is discovering what youve already found chapter fourteen the landscape became increasingly monotonous as they walked eastward the terrain was flat watercourses had disappeared and the vegetation was shrublike and gray distance was beginning to take a toll pant legs were becoming frayed from the constant friction of stabbing grass and brush and the flood had stolen replacement clothing daniel gave up a pair of shorts to be shared as a source of patches theyd salvaged two handsewing kits that were proving invaluable but had already consumed most of their thread we can unravel more from a pant leg amaya suggested their feet were increasingly sore from the pounding and their collective weariness seemed to be cumulative each night did not provide enough rest to make up for the exertion of the previous day yet instead of slowing they pushed harder trying now to get to wetter better country discouragingly the terrain grew drier and hotter they were walking on an ancient seabed on what is geologically the worlds oldest continent its mountains worn to nubs and its valleys filled with sediment by unimaginable time it was so unchanging it seemed as if they were walking in place their anxious progress gave them little time to hunt or forage and their remaining food supply was falling rapidly the strategy was to replenish it in kinder country if they could find it but meanwhile they looked when they could daniel still made his dusk circuits from camp and managed to bring in two crested pigeons a rock wallaby a small agile relative of the kangaroo and a monitor lizard just for amusement he caught and carried back a thorny devil a small squat lizard defended by conelike spines it looked like a bizarre monster out of a lurid movie you finally found something that looks worse than the food in junior high ico assessed one evening daniel came back with a troubled look no luck amaya asked no i saw something he said slowly but didnt spear it tucker observed didnt even get close i was too startled it moved like a man what it was one of those things you see out of the corner of your eye i turned and it was gone i shouted but there was no answer i couldnt find any trace of him or her another adventurer amaya wondered another mirage said ico so far ive seen two ice cream stands an olympicsized pool a phantom beer truck and a tahitian topless troupe they laughed seriously said daniel could someone be following us if they are theyre more idiotic than we are ico said i think were completely lost he dug out his map again and studied it it may be stupid to simply strike due east if theres wetter terrain to the north or south maybe we can find a real river to follow or at least mountains that would catch and funnel more rain you want more rain tucker asked after that flood i want normal rain sensible rain useful rain tucker bent to look over his shoulder so where are we thats the damn problem i dont know he turned the map sideways this doesnt show rivers anyway ico you got taken you dumb paranoid no this is real im convinced of it if i can just get oriented well its stupid to go off north or south if we dont know whats in that direction daniel said they told us it gets greener to the east we just have to keep going what if they were lying ico asked why would they do that maybe thats the game to catch them in their lies its getting browner not greener ico thats paranoid thats the observable truth and we better start talking frankly about what were doing they said well live by our wits and whats on our backs well weve lost half what we had on our backs we need to think think not panic if we dont find water it doesnt matter amaya said tucker nodded two days back to the last water hole and none tonight either im almost dry so daniel reasoned the riverbeds weve encountered have run mostly north and south going east should be the best bet to cross one what if we dont amaya said this plain may be waterless maybe we should retreat and try following one of the dry beds weve already found they sat considering that finally tucker shook his head and get nowhere daniels right we cant start walking in aimless circles looking for water all we can do is put on the miles until we hit the next source and then decide what to do what if we dont agree ico asked we vote we split up said ico im not betting my life on majority stupidity no amaya cried were not splitting up daniel said wearily well agree as a group or well end up dying as individuals but first we have to walk to water so we can think straight east looks as promising as north or south lets stick to it there were no answers ico reluctantly put his map away they built a fire and slept uneasily daniel was restless waking sometimes with the feeling of being watched but there was no one out there he roused tucker in the chill of predawn come on we need to hunt the big man groaned cant we wait for a well im thinking an animal might lead us to one they crept out of camp under the fading stars the sky beginning to blush to the east they heard the call of a few waking birds but otherwise the desert seemed empty except for the scuttle trails of a few crawling insects there was no sign of game after half an hour they sat down this is more discouraging than selling computers you really couldnt sell any i really didnt want to sell any i didnt care all my life nothing ive done has quite jelled i just want to succeed at something but first i have to decide what i want to succeed at now it looks like i might succeed at dying of thirst we just have to hang in there do you know what happened to burke and wills who the first white men to cross australia south to north they left most of their party at a creek pushed on almost reached the sea and came back they were starving when they got back to the creek their help was gone their companions had given up the wait that morning they died geez theres some luck tucker looked out over the desert you were a history major right military history and why that all that killing i liked the courage courage i doubted i had like the spartans i heard of them kickass guys right a spartan who came home heroically dead from battle was a joy to his mother but one who died with a wound on his back was a humiliation they were awesome three hundred of them took on a persian army of tens of thousands and almost won they blocked a pass almost they were betrayed and the persians got around them but until then they were invincible they gave the rest of greece time to prepare so what happened to them they died it was a sacrifice and like their moms you think thats good no i think it admirable whats life for for them it was to train and die like heroes and save western civilization they found their why and for us we just have to prove we can stick it out tucker until we find our own why prove that people still belong to a place instead of the place belonging to them i hope i belong here its not as easy as i thought i wont disagree with that its not the dying i would mind i just want to count for something you know in todays world theres too many of us so nobody matters out here you matter they sat for a while the lack of a sign giving them little inducement to look farther then something big flicked out of sight kangaroo tucker breathed no said daniel suddenly uneasy and sitting straighter it didnt jump like that he peered hard at the shadowy brush but couldnt see any movement it was that guy again come on they trotted to where theyd seen the figure and separated looking for tracks uhoh tucker called oh boy you were right daniel came over as the eastern sky glowed a brighter pink he saw what his companion was hypnotized by it was a human boot print but not one of their own the waffle soles of a hiking boot he looked closer the tread design was peculiar the grid looked like a street map we got company tucker said is that good daniel glanced around it must be another outback adventurer whyd he run maybe hes a loner maybe he knows the way to water they followed the tracks winding circuitously through the brush the course seemed deliberately confusing hes trying to lose us daniel said or get us lost so where is camp well see the breakfast smoke when ico and amaya wake up he must have seen our fire last night so why doesnt he just say hello this is weird as the sun broke the horizon they saw another flicker of movement at a low ridge crest as soon as they saw it the stranger was gone goddamnit tucker bolted ahead moving agilely for such a big man he bounded up the lower sand slopes of the ridge and scrabbled toward the steeper rocks tucker wait up daniel trotted after him with his spear tucker was up on the ridge now hoisting himself through the boulders in hopes of getting a glimpse of the elusive fugitive he climbed heedless of caution half leaping from one hold to another daniel stopped to map a more prudent route then tucker screamed springing backward from the rocks as if he had been fired from a cannon he made a twisting loop roaring and flinging his right arm launching something long and rubbery into space then he crashed into the dirt at the base of the rocks and rolled downward daniel following through tuckers cloud of dust snake tucker shouted curling into a ball and holding his arm snake snake snake ohmygodithurts tucker stop wheres the snake daniel pulled at him wildly fearfully looking for the reptile before realizing that it must have been flung away the big man no doubt put his hand into a nest in his anxious scramble upward now daniel grabbed his bitten hand and saw fang marks plain in the flesh in back of the thumb the skin beginning to swell he paled australia had some of the most venomous snakes in the world it hurts so bad tucker moaned i hate snakes then you should have gone to the arctic it was a lame attempt at levity daniel yanked at the mans shirtsleeve ripping it from the shoulder he wound the material around the forearm and pulled tight to make a tourniquet a pocketknife made a quick bloody incision and he squeezed the flesh hoping he was squeezing some venom out his friend howled as he did it blood spraying to spatter gray leaves jesus what a mess how poisonous was it tucker was sweating despite the dawn cool his chest heaving frantically daniel was frightened he was going to die okay lay back im going to get some help he told his friend with more reassurance than he felt their antivenin kit had been lost in the flood youre going to be all right understand tucker nodded pale with fear wheres the snake im afraid of the snake the snake you must have put it in orbit dont worry about snakes your thrashing has just about scared the shit out of everything in australia with legs or without thats good he gave a grimaced smile man im hurt from the fall too what a screwup mess ill be right back okay just wait he groaned like im going to go anywhere daniel could hear the confused calls of the others and shouted back jogging off in that direction they were only a few hundred yards away he stumbled into camp wheres tucker snakebite he gasped the other two looked stricken and i was right someone else is sneaking around here they looked about wildly look i think the strangers gone but tuckers in bad shape well have to carry him into camp we cant carry tucker ico protested he weighs a ton i think we have to they hurried back to the weakening man he was delirious when they got to him curled again and shaking looking like a ghost from the coating of dust holy shit ico breathed he looks like hes dying what kind of snake amaya asked how do i know its not like it matters now how can we move him it was ico who had the idea to build a triangular travois like the plains indians and drag their big companion they cut branches and vines to fasten a crude frame rolled tucker onto it despite his roar of protest tied him down and gave a tentative heave the poles dragged along the ground with less friction than his full body okay this will work daniel said here we go one two three pull a jerk and they were off dust spurting from the ends of the two poles weaving this way and that they pulled him back between the mulga trees and got to camp at midmorning when they returned all their food except the sack amaya had hung from a bush was gone their campsite was spotted with the strange maplike grid of a wafflesoled boot a trail of boot prints led east and so they went that way too the four of them had one gallon of water left to share and the temperature was arcing with the sun tucker had slipped into uneasy sleep on his travois his bandaged arm grotesquely swollen flies crawled across his sweating face they managed half a mile per hour and collapsed by noon the sled was exhausting look we have to leave him ico croaked no way protested amaya just until we find water then we come back and get him ico he could die well all die if we dont get some water she shook her head you two go ahead then ill wait with him daniel vetoed that im not leaving you alone with this crazy guy wandering around and i dont want just one of us scouting for water either we have to stay together dyson come on this guy or guys must be heading to water too we follow them as a group its the safest way by midafternoon though the growing impossibility was obvious their water was gone the desert shimmered its heat climaxing near one hundred degrees the trio was exhausted from their turns pulling the travois tucker seemed to be slipping into permanent unconsciousness and the landscape was unchanged they dropped into the shade of a stunted tree a parade of ants marching up its twisted trunk a kite wheeled in the cloudless sky they felt absolutely demoralized and exhausted were done ico said dont say that amaya pleaded even if we find water weve lost too much gear we dont have much food we dont have tools what did we last a week and a half theyd laugh if they ever knew weve just had bad luck that guy robbed us thats like trying to murder us ten to one hes succeeded within twentyfour hours but why maybe he got hungry himself so he preys on the newcomers dog eat dog theres a survival lesson for you then why not just slit our throats he could have last night maybe hes fastidious daniel looked up at the desert sky not a cloud not a plane not a hope he hadnt known it was possible to feel so alone okay ico you go on ahead he conceded its our only chance take the water containers and well wait with tucker i dont want to leave amaya alone ico nodded the decision was inevitable ill need the last food no dyson i have to eat to hike ill push faster with it than without it no i want you to come back jesus the last food stays here youre the one who talked about splitting up ico sullenly gathered up the remaining canteens as tucker groaned restlessly amaya dug in her pack and gave him some of their last emergency ration bars daniel didnt really mean that she whispered yes he did ico left without looking back they watched the sun set with their hopes daniel had seldom been truly thirsty before but now his throat was closing his tongue swelling and the need for water was intruding on all other thoughts soon it would hurt to talk the flies left the stars came and a chill crept into the air he looked at amaya sitting small and forlorn next to tucker amaya he croaked come here she crawled to him and he put an arm around her help me stay warm im scared daniel she confessed i want to go back he hugged her kissing the top of her hair with his dry cracked lips me too but we cant not yet she cuddled relaxing in his embrace and they listened to the sounds of the night creatures the heat of her body felt good a spark of life im glad im not alone she said he nodded me too can i make a confession a deathbed one dont say that im sorry im just trying to joke go on confess he hesitated i saw you a few nights ago in the river in the river bathing oh she was quiet how did i look beautiful the stars the water you were just horny or thirsty no it was nice you were nice i just wanted to say that a compliment thats what i meant all right good now can i make a confession of course she looked at him mischievously i saw you too watching i mean oh i liked it good he lowered his face to brush against her cheek and she turned and kissed him then their lips dry but the touch a quiet comfort i wonder what would have happened if wed had more time he asked im glad we had this time he lay there holding her wondering what the morning would bring maybe thered be a miracle maybe it would rain again eventually they slept daniel was prodded awake at dawn silhouetted against the light of the rising sun was a stranger dark and dirty with hair down around his ears he was tanned a tobacco brown and wore faded synthetics patched with animal leathers with a bone necklace that rattled when he moved his boots daniel sleepily realized left the same gridded print theyd spotted at their camp like a street map he was holding a skin of water they could smell it want some the two untangled themselves and sat up they noticed ico a short distance behind like a trailing schoolboy uncertainly they nodded the man uncapped the water skin and drank himself rivulets running down into the stubble of his beard then he held it out to them i wasnt going to come back for you you know daniel stretched his arm out and took the water skin the warm dusty water was the sweetest hed ever tasted he swallowed a mouthful and gave it to amaya careful the man told her sip or youll throw up she complied then why did you daniel croaked he came up on me when i nodded off ico spoke up i didnt have time to run i think wed better throw in with them it wasnt him who brought me back the stranger said daniel looked up at him puzzled he jerked his head backward it was her now daniel noticed there was a third figure in the shadows slim and erect looking at them with surprise so it is you she said stepping forward he jerked in recognition himself it was raven chapter fifteen youre not supposed to be in this sector raven said to daniel her eyes flickering from him to the young woman at his side he stared back in amazement taking in the familiar features her dark hair had been pulled into a ponytail accentuating high cheekbones turned bronze by the sun her eyes revealed puzzlement unlike his huddled posture of defeat she carried herself with familiar athletic quickness and grace like a poised deer he was confused by her confusion he thought shed be surprised hed come to australia at all not that he was in any particular spot you told me you didnt think youd come here he countered his voice a croak then i called and you were gone yes she looked at the three newcomers as if trying to decide something my situation changed daniel sipped more water and sat up straighter the liquid tingling as it circulated relieving the ache in his brain your timing is good we were in bad shape youre very lucky amaya was looking at raven with a mixture of bewilderment and mistrust raven glanced at her considering this is a surprise for both of us as you can see she said to the other woman we knew each other before amaya absorbed this daniel pointed at the man accompanying raven he stole some of our food he accused no i didnt the man said i saved it from a dingo if i hadnt taken it it would be gone we ran to save tucker amaya explained meekly and left your means of survival to the dogs i went to find raven so we could decide what to do i wasnt sure you could or should survive youre in a hard world now and we werent planning to meet anyone out here then we found this little guy ethan enough raven interrupted after talking with ico there we decided you needed rescue it was clear the decision had been hers he told us about you why did you run from us daniel asked ethan because our business is private he looked at raven with the dubious expression of a follower still questioning the decision of his leader and this complicates everything raven added she looked out across the desert as she thought it was almost as if she was sorry shed found daniel was she involved with this other man we could just point them toward the compound ethan said and get the warden suspicious at the news of us i dont want him coming out here besides this group is in no condition to drag the big man that far she pointed at the groaning tucker what kind of snake did you see no idea well if it was a taipan hed probably be dead by now maybe just a death adder hes too big a mouthful for that kind despite the name so tucker will live amaya asked she shrugged hell die or get better there was a moment of silence at this appraisal she sounds like my doctor ico finally quipped raven for the first time allowed a half smile you start to appreciate their wisdom out here she looked at daniel and amaya can you walk they nodded uncertainly im feeling better daniel said it was not just the water it was this encounter with a raven who seemed to know what she was doing confidence was as infectious as panic their sled might work to drag him as far as car camp she said to the man called ethan they can rest there while we search and then what he asked in exasperation who is this guy anyway a friend it was the first time shed said it and then we decide what to do next daniel was filled with questions who was ethan search for what how did you first spot us your fires raven said we thought you might be someone else this warden amaya guessed yes we needed to know who you were amaya leaned close to daniel her eyes on raven is this the person you were talking about she asked softly he knew what she meant yes amaya looked dismayed raven was taller prettier stronger daniel saw through her eyes more assertive no he wanted to say its not like that but before he could think of what to say to the two women that would work raven spoke up we knew each other she said thats all daniel didnt like that either knew how ico asked impatiently shes the one who told me about outback adventure daniel explained stiffly she gave me the passwords but she didnt tell me she was going i didnt know then i came in part because of you ah ico said as if he understood everything and whos this guy ethan flint the man said another trekker that was the plan what happened my transport crashed oh dear amaya said but youre here on vacation like us he laughed sardonically its probably more accurate to say youre here in prison like me prison what the hell does that mean daniel asked that you cant get back unless ethan ravens voice was a warning i knew it ico groaned i knew this was somehow fucked outback adventure has screwed us right what we have to pay more now to get out is that the scam ethan shook his head i wish it were that easy dont pay any attention to him raven said he doesnt know what he thinks he knows i know enough to know ill explain what i can soon enough she went on quickly firmly first we need to get to more water before the sun gets too high clearly she wouldnt tolerate too many questions yet come on well take turns pulling your sled travois ico corrected but what the hell is your companion talking about raven said nothing ethan looked away ico bent to pull the travois with daniel theres something weird here dyson he whispered like a conspirator when this pair found me that woman of yours recognized my name with raven and ethan adding their energy to pulling the travois progress became steady they turned more north than east raven usually pointing the way but consulting occasionally with ethan when flint took a break from the travois walking silently as if lost in thought ico moved up beside him who the hell are you really he asked ethan glanced at the shorter man im you three months ago hapless clueless gee thanks my equipment lost my clothes still in tolerable shape my fat reserves still intact and my selfconfidence gone dropped into australia like a virgin of fraud and now youre an old pro who saved us not me the deal was to take your chances in the desert he nodded up toward raven shes your good samaritan why your buddy obviously i think its foolish letting you tag along who is she one of us she says outback adventurer you dont believe her i dont disbelieve her she just knows a little too much for example how does she know you she doesnt ico said unless dyson mentioned me somehow and if he did why would she even remember why indeed ethan looked ahead unless word of my charm gets around flint laughed at that listen what in hell is going on ico persisted theres something wrong with this whole deal right ethan smiled faintly lets just say you have more company out here than you expected by midmorning the six of them had consumed ethan and ravens remaining water supply and daniel was worried theyd soon be in the plight they were in before it was hot again the weight of the sick man oppressive they seemed to march in a cloud of flies the land was featureless intimidating in its monotony and raven seemed distant as if still trying to decide something glancing occasionally back at daniel then shortly before noon ethan led them into a crack in the earth that had been invisible until they came to its lip it widened to a curious ravine enclosing a kind of oasis a few gum and palm trees huddled in the geologic wrinkle hiding from the worst of the sun they dragged tucker down into its shade and collapsed with relief where did this hole come from daniel asked im guessing a collapsed cave raven said but i dont really know theres a spring at one end but its too mineralized to drink from icos nose wrinkled it stinks like rotten eggs sulfur amaya guessed raven looked at her with curiosity youre a geologist just an amateur naturalist i never liked the jobs i had so i studied for ones i hadnt i wish id been a scientist on one of those old sailing ships finding hundreds of new species at every landfall australia is so unfamiliar its almost like that shes found us plants and stuff ico said things to eat but not enough to drink and if we dont find water i dont know how much farther we can drag tucker hes just too big if we dont get some fluids into him hes going to get too small daniel worried hell dry up like a raisin he turned to raven i thought you were taking us to water she looked at him with smug amusement i have like the tunnels they looked around do we have to dig amaya asked ethan laughed in this heat outback adventure outback murder is more like it youve got water right under your nose raven said or above it where amaya said frustrated i dont see it didnt you notice the rain the other night raven asked notice it we almost drowned in it ico said but the waters long gone all i see are sand and bugs he was watching a line of ants march up a tree exactly the desert holds its floods in all kinds of places havent you ever wondered why those silly ants spend their time parading up and down a tree they all looked at the insects now foraging for food i suppose said daniel and water raven stood first lesson think like an animal like any animal no matter how small the brain because they need the same things we do birds need water so a zebra finch can lead you to it trees need water so you can cut into the roots of a bloodwood tree to drink ants need water so theyll climb halfway to heaven to find it she sprang up grasping the smooth trunk and shinnied grasping a branch to haul herself clear of the ants above was a dark opening in the wood some of these trees have hollows she called down and the cavities are a good place to look for a drink the rain funnels into them and takes a long time to evaporate out she snapped off a twig and cautiously probed then lifted it out to show the end moistened like a dipstick ethan throw up a cup and water skin they spent an hour resting and drinking in the shade amaya foraged and found some bush plum life began to seem bearable again they didnt ask how their guide had learned so much about the desert raven looked at the fruit with approval very impressive i hope you can find other things that are useful like an oasis that doesnt stink so much ico said actually sulfurs useful amaya said for a million things old medicines pigments dyes food preservation gunpowder gunpowder ethan exclaimed the old black powder sulfur is one of the basic ingredients the ancients used to call it brimstone i knew we were in hell ico said raven looked thoughtful maybe you should collect some of your sulfur what for were in a world of scarce resources something like that could be useful amaya shrugged i could we dont have much else left to carry except tucker she got up to gather some ill help raven said standing to brush herself off knowledge like yours is vital its the only edge we have yes its just when the facts get ahead of wisdom that we get into trouble raven nodded so are you finding it wisdom more than i bargained for i think her new companion smiled its nice to have another woman along amaya looked surprised at that is it you can talk to men only up to a certain point she winked then you think of other things to do with them jaunty now glowing from ravens appreciation of her abilities she led the way to scrape some sulfur daniel watched quietly going over his previous encounters with raven in his mind and wondering at her coincidental appearance what exactly had she said to him why wouldnt she say more now who was she really the women came back with the mineral the prospectors of hell ico greeted fruit of the land amaya replied as they gathered their things to move on she drifted to daniel your friend raven seems adept she murmured to him yes the only problem is im not sure shes really my friend before they set out again raven opened a packet of dried leaves and distributed a small pile on each of their cupped fingers chew this she instructed it will make the last few miles before camp go faster what is it ico asked dubiously rock pituri the aborigines used it as a stimulant it gives you energy and relieves thirst ico stuffed some between gum and cheek as instructed like cardboard he said thickly what happens if i swallow dont its a stimulant not a food you can also put the juice on cuts and stings to relieve the pain and promote healing she spat businesslike and rubbed a gob on tuckers bitten hand he jerked at the touch and then relaxed again it helps fight any poisons the drug worked as promised the travelers felt a flush of energy like a jolt of caffeine that helped get them through the afternoon heat tucker groaned in delirious dreams his face and body spotted with flies but some of his normal color seemed to be returning indeed it looked like he might live the country they were trudging through was parched however the plain beginning to break toward low hills the vegetation gray and deadlooking part of it had been burned black by fire to the exhausted daniel australia seemed an ugly place getting uglier a sand and rock waste that led nowhere a prison ethan had called it what did that mean he planned to confront raven that night meanwhile step followed step the puffs of dust rising the horizon shimmering in its heat haze the flies not as bad here but still present a solitary hawk orbiting like a sentinel of doom it was like his dream he thought he was lost on a blank plain suddenly something glinted in the sun ahead a familiar kind of flash that instantly caused him to become alert to the geography again it was a reflection in the lowering sun whats that he asked ethan the two of them bent forward as they dragged the travois trash civilization it was broken glass daniel realized the newcomers stopped strangely dazzled by this sudden apparition of a shard of old technology theyd come to a dirt track through the scrub desert he saw overgrown and decayed gullies cut across it and brush sprouted in its middle on its shoulders were pieces of glass from bottles thrown by bush motorists long dead amber green clear the party put down the travois and poked around at the fragments like bent birds as intent as archaeologists it was a reminder that another world still existed where does the road go daniel asked suddenly imagining it merging into pavement freeways ruined cities and abandoned ports leading toward home nowhere ethan said its an old station track that washes out the station long gone nothing goes anywhere anymore because theres nowhere in australia to go to he watched ico fingering the dirt with amusement your friend never see litter before not here its startling after so much nothing theres leftovers from the dying all around if you know where to look well camp by an old wreck tonight we call it car camp dont you want to follow the road i said roads dont go anywhere theyre just lines on the earth with no purpose the only place around here has no road in and no road out because theres no place to go to or come from and what place is that erehwon end of the line daniel squinted remembering that was one of the code words to outback adventure was it the warden just thinks its a joke you keep mentioning this warden theres one here youll meet him he runs the place the prison keeper its another joke except its not really you say theres no place to go to and yet youre out here going someplace thats different thats her idea he jerked his head toward raven she thinks she can find something and asked me to help her look for it the first hope ive had in a long time you two are allies nothing more and what does erehwon mean ive already figured that one out said ico who was listening its an old name from utopian literature nowhere spelled backward they followed the track for a quarter mile eastward before leaving it and striking north across the desert again the stops were brief but ravens sense of purpose had given daniels group new energy they marched without complaint except for icos periodic habitual wisecracks and even he seemed happy now that they had direction are we there yet he jokingly called once mimicking a tired child maybe here is there daniel replied each place is the right place oh please raven looked back at them with interest as they trudged along daniel realized that meeting raven and ethan had given rise to a new emotional confusion there were other people in australia hed known that of course known about other outback adventure clients at least but actually meeting some changed the virginity of the place so did the old track australia was still wilderness of course but suddenly a wilderness that at once seemed more familiar more menacing and more haunted a populated wilderness a wilderness with ghosts his journey had changed in a subtle way the feeling of disorientation increased when they came that evening to a rusting light truck that was half buried in the sand of another dry riverbed there was no road or track that he could see and so he assumed the old station vehicle had somehow been carried downstream by past floods its windows and upholstery were gone and its paint blasted away by sun and sand the remains were the same color as the rusty hills slowly melting back into the earth and yet it was a human artifact a reminder that people had long lived in this socalled wilderness for fifty thousand years or more anthropologists said he was trekking in their shadow there was a rock cairn marking a well and they drank again tucker had come drowsily awake and was alert enough to begin rehydrating his body as he drank he began to revive croaking some puzzled questions his dreams had confused him but now he watched their new companions curiously dusk fell and raven built a fire ethan disappeared for a while and then reappeared with a dead and gutted kangaroo slung over his shoulder clearly daniel could learn something from their aloof companions hunting skills ico was drowsing against the metal body of the old truck seeming to take comfort from the flaking metal daniel got up to watch ethan skin and butcher the animal the kangaroo was gamy stringy and good as solid a meal as daniels group had had in several days tucker ate some woozy but stabilizing just a little on this stomach of mine he said ethan allowed a grin at how much the other three consumed tomorrow ill spear an elephant the stars came out a familiar and comfortable ceiling now daniel felt an immense tiredness steal over him as if he could sleep for days but first he needed some questions answered where were they going what was this erehwon outback adventure lied to us didnt they he finally asked to begin things ravens face was like an abstract painting the fire flickering to illuminate first this plane then that one causing her to shift shape with each tongue of flame she didnt reply just looked at him with sadness they didnt tell you everything ethan said you dont know everything raven warned i know the most important thing which is ico asked youre not supposed to get back chapter sixteen it was suddenly cold despite the fire ethan had voiced a suspicion that had been nagging ever since ico washingtons paranoid theorizing the adventure is supposed to be permanent ethan said united corporations thinks well be happier down here they looked at him with a combination of fear and disbelief some get back raven said ethan glanced at her maybe there was quiet as the newcomers absorbed this revelation elliott coyle had said hed gotten back daniel remembered elliott coyle had promised an exodus port i thought the whole point was to find the way home he said to raven the point is to let you realize this is your home you knew this and you came down here you knew this and you didnt tell me she was silent we didnt know any more than you ethan said the convicts told us what convicts the morally impaired who cant be rehabilitated are exiled to australia theyre ruled by one of their own this warden is a criminal youre a criminal daniel a voluntary one this makes not a bit of sense ico said except that we saw some shaveheaded goons being herded onto a transport when we departed there you go its supposed to be for everyones good raven explained a new colony like the british made in australia to give people like yourselves ourselves an outlet for our energies in the old days there was a frontier or a war now theres this we didnt volunteer to be pioneers ico said but you did in a way no amaya said its just an adventure trek a vacation though an unusual one we hike to exodus there is no exodus is there daniel said heavily her voice was flat no not exactly there was something more she wasnt saying you knew this and you came here ico was incredulous the people who come here dont know it obviously she replied she hasnt told you half of it ethan added bitterly you thought you were going to a kind of wilderness heaven right in actuality they duped you into volunteering for hell you may end up in a place even less to your liking harriet lundeen had said to daniel once could the gorgon have known heard dark rumors or only wished what others had made true i still dont understand he said thickly even though he felt with a growing sense of dread that he did its so obvious its comic ethan said they maroon us by giving us what we want what we want is to get back home amaya said thats the joke you are home there is no getting back or rather youve already gotten back you wanted to come here tucker shook his head slowly look ethan said did you really think they were going to give a whole continent to a handful of urbanites to work out our angst come on dont you know the history of australia it began as a penal colony right it was settled by british convicts this continent was a safety valve to relieve the pressure of inequities in the motherland the hardcore murderers went to the gallows but the petty thieves the political rebels and the urban poor came here what could be more logical after the plague than to use an empty australia as a penal colony again but were not convicts amaya objected ethan laughed at her youre dissatisfied thats become a secret crime but we approached them daniel said i couldnt even find outback adventure without help how would they know right you approached them proof of guilt and things like your reprimand raven added your troubles at work but how would they know about that daniel dont be naive she sounded impatient as if she was having to explain something to someone particularly slow they know everything they listen to everything they talk to people like luther cox and luther talks to them once they got everyone onto the internet nothing was private anymore your life wasnt locked in your head and your desk drawer it was spewed in electronic bytes across a global network they told you it was encrypted but spying became childs play you spied to find me right they know us better than we know ourselves from our electronic droppings why was the government so enthusiastic about the information highway it was another way to watch and control he stared into the campfire not liking being played the fool amaya was looking from raven to daniel considering all this carefully yet the person who told daniel about outback adventure was you raven shrugged with dismissal that happens all the time i think people like us seek each other out inform each other of the possibility and even sign up together we betray each other they count on it who is this they ico asked united corporations they ensure stability by putting potential troublemakers down here troublemakers unhappy people misfits malcontents independent thinkers thats a crime not by statute but the system works on conformity you know that i think they try to get everyone on the same track the young adults they dont succeed with go here you all selected yourselves you all had a dozen chances to back out our punishment is getting the life we asked for ethan added the irony the humor of it is quite sublime yeah im really laughing tuckers look was grim so you two are what fleeing from these moralimpaireds not exactly raven said we think we may have a chance an outside chance to really get back she looked at ethan for confirmation raven says the transport that crashed when i arrived should have been equipped with some kind of transponder or transmitter something to signal for help we came out from the wardens little colony to look for it now i guess youre going to look too i didnt think we needed you but she wasnt willing to let you how did you know about this transmitter amaya asked slowly i worked in aviation for a while raven said its a guess a hope but its worth pursuing if i ever want to get home avionics yes electronics communications that kind of thing after stumbling onto erehwon i met ethan and he told me about his crash it got me thinking were near the wreck daniel asked pretty close well try to find it tomorrow so i think we should stop talking about this until then believe me i know how confusing this is lets deal with it when you have some hope he felt dazed hed found her and might even be marooned with her or not he stood and moved off toward his bedroll in the darkness to think amaya quietly approached raven as the group broke up you dont seem as bitter as ethan she observed i just admit that i chose to come here you dont seem to be as shocked as us raven looked at her evenly ive had more time to think about it think about our betrayal im just a person who takes life as it comes so should you then she moved away the next morning the group split in two amaya remote and lost in thought elected to stay at car camp to nurse tucker daniel and ico however decided to accompany raven and ethan to find the remains of the transport were nuts if we let that bitch move out of our sight ico muttered to daniel as they set off theres something more she isnt telling us youre so pussyblind you cant see it but i dont trust that siren to tell night from day i hardly even know her ico yeah right she seems to know you down to the color of your shorts they walked northwestward ethan leading the way and happy to be free of the burden of pulling tucker he was back on their primary mission but still treated the newcomers as if they were unwanted or as if there was some unspoken rivalry he kept an emotional distance the pair had fled eastward from erehwon raven explained as they walked and the community would assume they were trying to cross the desert to get to the coast on their own members of the wardens group deserted periodically despite warnings of the trips futility once out of sight of the compound however raven and ethan had circled back west toward flints crash site stumbling on daniels party in the process she seemed troubled by that coincidence so what exactly are we looking for out here ico tried to clarify an emergency beacon raven said something on the transport to call for help all aircraft have one why wasnt it triggered in the crash we dont know ethan said the warden took some kind of transmitter but it doesnt work nothing electronic seems to work here so were looking for something that does she said why would it work thats technical he looked at her with dissatisfaction then what we call for help it would still operate after all this time daniel asked if its standard the batteries should last for a year you never told me you worked in aviation i never told you a lot of things they walked on in silence finally daniel addressed ethan what exactly happened to you i was coming here for the typical wilderness experience he explained my transport crashed i woke up still strapped to the bunk half the plane gone and everyone but the pilot dead he unbuckled me told me to wait and went to the forward part of the wreckage i couldnt even see to get something then these strange people showed up it was the wardens convicts and i ran i fell blacked out came to the pilot was missing i think he told them they could get back if they caught me but they couldnt they let me live afterward because it was clear i didnt know a damn thing or that if i did i couldnt let it slip if i was dead so the warden took me back to erehwon theres a mix of convicts and refugee trekkers there all of us confused i thought i was stuck here forever until raven came along daniel glanced at the woman who had intrigued him she seemed to have discovered a way out of this exile when everyone else had failed interesting with ethan recognizing the country with increasing confidence they found the transport by noon it was in two pieces there was the intact tail where ethan had survived its metal frame glinting in the heat then a stretch of unmarked desert where the nose section had skipped ahead over a rise followed by a sand furrow still seeded with debris at its end was the burnedout hulk of the forward section of the aircraft the fuselage ripped open to the sky ethan hung back some of my friends might still be in there yuck ico whispered it wasnt the possibility of bodies that made daniel reluctant to approach the forward fuselage rather the derelict machine made clear just how completely cut off from civilization they now were somewhere in the sky above satellites orbited somewhere across the heatglazed horizon the sea broke and out there ships ran and jets flew toward populated shores but all that was across a gulf as impassable as the abyss between the stars and instead of reassuring him of the reality of civilization this burnt husk confirmed how far he was from it its not a sight to inspire confidence he said where one transport came another might follow raven countered come on this is the way home the group went cautiously forward despite ethans uneasiness whatever corpses the transport had contained were long gone disposed by scavengers and decay one cockpit seat had disappeared where the pilot had ejected the other remained the instrument panel stained dark with what might have been the copilots blood it was the panel itself that interested raven see the empty place that held an instrument she said that must be what the pilot came back for a transmitter which the warden took and which doesnt work daniel summarized yes so now we look at the tail it was a pillaged stub some of its metal panels stripped for salvage and its seats uprooted the absence of fire had saved ethans life and made that part of the wreckage valuable for salvage raven crawled into the rearmost recess and hunted then backed out the other instrument im looking for is gone too she reported theres a hole where its been removed great said ico no thats good it fits my guess i think the pilot gave it to ethan how do you know that the pilot gave me something for safekeeping before we separated ethan said i was pretty groggy but i knew he was anxious to get some other component and leave he told me that what he was stuffing in my pack would keep us from having to walk to the beach but i didnt understand what he meant so what happened he left and the convicts came drawn by the smoke i suppose ethan said and he was screaming and i was running for my life and trying to lighten my load you threw it away i didnt know what it was i resented having to carry it he threw the damn thing away ico repeated to daniel unbelievable youd better hope so ethan said with irritation or the warden would already have taken the only way out of here daniel looked out the oval opening of the shearedoff tail at the desert what if we cant find it thats not an option ethan said they came back out im looking for a box smaller than a shoe box raven told them oh good ico said glancing around that will stick out ethan pointed to some sandstone hills on the horizon i ran that way and threw things into a ravine well have to search there as they hiked toward the hills flints memory of the place began to come back to him here hed left a gps and range finder he pointed both long since pirated and scrapped by the erehwon group to make metal tools farther on yes hed come this way he thought the ravine looked familiar as did the crest of the ridge the convicts had found and looted his pack near here but the useless box which hed never mentioned to the warden it could have been dropped anywhere all right well spread out and search the ravine raven said meet by that pink rock by dusk ethan where did you fall from that way he pointed im going to look up there the rest of you try here the men slid down loose scree into the brushy gully it was stifling hot flies found daniel there was no water and he searched in a fog of depression so thick that it was difficult to even function this is what his life had come down to searching a hot desert for a metal box to get back to a place hed been desperate to flee from just two weeks before what would he do if he did get back he could no longer imagine a future hours went by with no sign of a human artifact he drifted down the ravine from the other two men looking as much for shade as for an electronic black box he suspected that ico skeptical of the whole story was already napping then while sitting despondently beneath a gum tree and studying a sandy bottom raked by intermittent water as artfully as a japanese garden he realized their mistake the floods in the months since ethans crash there must have been enough rain to carry things downhill or downstream it was the hunt for their supplies all over again the box was heavy no doubt more like a rock than a log still streams had the power to move entire boulders when running high think like an animal raven had told him now he had to think like a rock how far could a flood push it where in the stream course would it come to rest he quickly walked a mile down the ravine bottom seeing nothing and then turned to return upstream more slowly and carefully probing the center of the sandy basins where the heaviest debris would collect he found rocks all right and even at one point some dampness signaling water close to the surface but a transmitter he worried its weight would have carried it beneath a covering layer of sand what saved him in the end was that the box was orange its battered surface flecked with scratches revealing a black undercoating like a speckled egg the beacon was jammed under a larger boulder sand sucked away from it by the current could such a thing still work the metal was hot to the touch so he wrapped it in his shirt like a baby carrying it upstream ethan and ico were waiting at the pink rock looking hot sticky and depressed and so he shielded it behind his back until he came up to them then he held it out here it is he announced phone home ethan looked at it warily thats it im asking you he looked at it dubiously i can hardly remember he peered closer inspecting the switch and socket ports the memory of it was coming back to him now his familiar world of electronics seemed an eternity awaybut how much did he want his new companions to know i guess so good grief ico said well lets go find raven she must be upstream there was no stream of course just the sandy bed and a bottom of heat it ended in a culdesac of cliffs with a litter of boulders at their base raven was in the shade of one looking drained we found it ethan called maybe she didnt look up you dont seem very excited ico observed she looked up at him morosely clearly disturbed i found him ico walked past her into a cluster of boulders the others following the rocks formed a kind of nest with an openroofed room in their middle ouch ico breathed a cross hung on the rocks except a moments inspection revealed the cross was really a man or had been a man arms outstretched where hed been pinioned and now almost black and desiccated by the sun dried flesh pulled back from screaming teeth eyes gone stained strips of clothes and leathered flesh there was a glint on one finger daniel stepped forward academy ring so weve found your pilot ico said ethan was looking at the figure in dismay i didnt know the warden did this they told me the pilot was missing and i didnt ask my god the man could have helped us its insane this warden of yours must have really been pissed off raven had come in behind them looking upward the rocks radiated heat like an oven she looked not so much horrified as depressed i guess we want to steer clear of the morally impaired right ico said to her good thing were getting out of here she looked at him sadly theres something i havent told you chapter seventeen they buried the pilot in the sand raven taking care to first remove his ring and the molar filling of identification microdata that had replaced the dog tag for employees on remote and risky missions then the group filed back to car camp as the sun sank walking the last few miles under the stars they were exhausted but they were also impatient to learn what raven had to tell them she simply suggested she save it until amaya and the recovering tucker could hear too she walked ahead of them as if rehearsing what she would say upon returning they built up the fire what i havent told you is that we have to go back to erehwon raven began without preamble we have to go see the warden what ethan cried clearly she hadnt told him this she nodded acknowledging his surprise you already know ordinary communications dont work in australia you know the warden took a transmitter from the plane from the pilot and it didnt work so daniel said thats why we found this one yes because the continent must be jammed she glanced around gauging their reaction outback adventure united corporations doesnt want its clients calling out you need a special instrument the cone ico said hmm he looked excited i stayed awake when they shipped us out here and heard the pilot talking about some damned cone i thought it was a password slang for the continent but what if its this zone of jamming you stayed awake raven asked damn right i did my trust only goes so far and a good thing too so they fly us into this zone made from what a satellite she nodded watching him the question is whether they could do that over an entire continent strongly enough to confound weak consumer electronics ill bet maybe strongly enough to defeat ordinary rescue beacons they used narrowfocus satellite jamming beams in the taiwanese war that explains why my gps didnt work ethan remembered my stuff too ico said i thought it was just on the fritz raven nodded when i came here and recognized there was no normal exit point i began to think about alternative ways to signal for help she explained then i talked to ethan and he told me about his crash my theory is that no pilot would fly into this place unless they could expect rescue in the event of disaster but that united corporations would want to make sure it wasnt sending rescue craft in after the wrong people risking a hijack by the morally impaired the survivor who was signaling had to be someone knowledgeable enough to do something to activate the rescue beacon a bona fide pilot in other words when i heard that the transmitter the convicts had brought back from the crash didnt work i at first thought they simply must have taken the wrong one but that made no sense if theyd stumbled on the right one uc would be sending its rescue crew into the lions den there couldnt be a right one so then i reasoned the transmitter must require another component to penetrate this jamming an idea i remembered from my aviation work the beacon only works if a pilot puts two halves together the transmitter itself and the activator we just found i think the body we discovered confirms this idea how so ethan asked my guess is that the pilot tried to bargain for his life by promising he could signal for help if they could catch you because you were unwittingly carrying the crucial component the activator to penetrate this jamming but when they found you unconscious you didnt have it it wasnt even in your pack maybe the pilot remained evasive in hopes of finding the activator by himself later and the warden in an impatient rage killed him so now we have to go to this psycho and ask him for the other half ico asked this is the plan you didnt tell us about ask take bargain whatever it requires to get back great whoopee amaya was looking at raven skeptically glancing from her to daniel you figured this out all by yourself im not promising it will work its a chance thats all nobodys that smart raven its common sense amaya you said you knew avionics tell me what a neuralrod stabilizer is raven looked at her with irritation tell me what a wing pulsecircuit is that wasnt my area you dont know a thing about avionics do you i dont have to prove myself to you youre just jealous of my relationship with daniel he looked up at that curious what relationship you dont know a thing about aviation amaya persisted but you do know a lot about outback adventure youre lying to us arent you just like you lied to daniel im trying to help you why were you so surprised to find him here you were the one who told him about australia its a big continent why did you save us at all im beginning to wonder that too go back out into the damn desert if you dont like my help who are you raven she was angry the two women glared at each other who is luther cox it was daniel interrupting softly raven turned to him impatiently you know who he is your supervisor back home sure i know but how did you know last night i never mentioned him to you you must have her eyes flickered away no i didnt you just dont remember amayas right you know too much when we were dying of thirst and you found us you knew who ico was and his relationship to me even though we havent talked since i met him youve always known too much you recruited me didnt you raven she stared back at him her expression flat you recruited yourself what are you talking about it was tucker sitting up against his propped travois she works for them daniel said watching her she came on to me and talked wilderness but she was working for them all the time its the only thing that makes sense shes some kind of agent she found me and got me interested and gave me the passwords to get in even while pretending she didnt want to it was a seduction a seduction without sex she worked with my employer to do it and now shes still working for them but doing what picking up junk from the outback they were all watching her now burying their dead ico guessed why raven daniel asked softly she took a breath its for your own good being abandoned out here for societys good for your own damn good ill bet ico charged how much are they paying you my god shes from the kind who put us here if shes their agent she deserves to be hung up on the rocks like that pilot you put you here she retorted think werent you told the dangers didnt you have chance after chance to back out you were the ones who were convinced you could survive here until we found an exit not forever not with a bunch of damned convicts youll be here forever if you string me up yes i work for them and yes you may despise me but im your only ticket out of here this rendezvous wasnt planned but you help me and ill help you she glared at him ive already saved your miserable little life once i didnt have to do that i could have just left you in the sand ico scowled at her youve got the miserable part right why daniel repeated sorrow in his voice whys filling his mind like the whys she had challenged him with in the tunnels raven glanced around at all their faces their confusion and mistrust and looks of betrayal and sighed united corporations doesnt despise you people she explained wearily they admire you in a way but they cant afford you theyre afraid of you in the old days society might have had a use explorers soldiers entrepreneurs but the worlds full twelve billion people now you live in the wealthy part and you dont realize how fragile everything is how on the edge the planet is if the system fails if the economy and ecology collapse billions will die billions survival requires conformity and because of that the sideways view isnt an inspiration its a threat thats crazy tucker said what about new ideas they dont want new ideas modifications updates yes but nothing truly revolutionary dont you understand the population has aged the world has become conservative the twentieth century was a nightmare of new ideas and it led to war genocide terror and depression nobody wants to go back to that we cant afford to go back to that like ancient china daniel recalled fossilized it sent out the greatest fleet of discovery in history in the middle ages circumnavigated the indian ocean found nothing superior to the goods back home and disbanded the ships it didnt want new ideas either which meant it was ultimately exploited by europeans ico said except there are no more europeans raven explained no upstarts i mean everyone on the planet is the same same products same restaurants same songs same stories same ethics people still cling to the rituals of old traditions to promote tourism if nothing else but really its just one big country now or one big company there are no foreigners anymore no barbarians and china lasted longer than anybody thats the lesson united corporations takes from history china endured united corporations has to endure my god the entire system is built on stability over time the stocks the bonds the revenue streams the retirement plans the greatest good for the greatest number you believe this daniel asked her i know it i lived it im an ethnic balkan daniel a gypsy in part by heritage and in my early world things werent quite so tidy and constipated and boring as in yours in the early years of this century we had revolution every thirty minutes and a new ideology every hour we had to check each morning to see what our money was worth my family lost everything everything and my father lost his life dying in the riots so when uc finally began to buy things out to stabilize the currency to put an end to the irrational nationalism and ethnic strife that had caused so much destruction when united corporations put the poor back to work i had hope for the first time in my life hope from the stability you think is dull yes but this to protect the greater good they stand for sure i work for them i believe in them and now youd better believe in me but what are you doing here cleaning up after ethans crash united corporations doesnt like to leave antijamming devices loose and the pilot was the son of a prominent family they wanted to know his fate are you going to tell them ico asked she looked down no hell have died instantly heroically they sent you all the way down here to mop up for that and for reeducation for what a reminder to me of what were about what the alternative to a united corporations world to a civilized world is what kind of people are put down here they thought i might be having doubts about my job that i might be going soft why she looked at him because she stopped amaya watched her and daniel sadly from across the campfire she knew exactly why raven decarlo had struggled with doubts about her job she knew exactly why she had decided to save four people she would have been better off leaving for dead because of the restless questioning kind and in his own way strong young man she was speaking to because her betrayals had finally become personal i just cant believe they put you in the same sector raven finally exclaimed they told me i wouldnt see you that was a mistake amaya said quietly ico switched the destination tags they dont know were here they rested two days at car camp giving tucker more time to heal as the venom wore off the big man was gaining back his customary animation and habitual good cheer and he began hobbling stiffly around the place i died and came back children he told them i had such weird dreams that this place is starting to look downright normal i came back for a reason i know it i came back because theres something i have to do everyone else was wary the hope represented by the battered box of flaking orange paint had been doused by their distrust of raven who remained subdued but not contrite how did you know enough to quiz her on avionics tucker privately asked amaya i didnt i just made stuff up she could have bluffed me you outfoxed her amaya or she wanted to tell only ico seemed capable of thinking ahead he showed raven his stained and battered map asking her if it was accurate she said she knew no more about the geography of australia than he did and he speculated excitedly about what might happen if they got the beacon to work and a rescue craft came would the surprised pilots simply take them back or would they have to hijack the aircraft and fly to a refuge the one thing for sure is im not staying on the ground here he promised ravens smile was wan lets see if we can get it to work first somehow she reminded they had to get the transmitter from this warden daniel was simply angry hed had real feelings for this woman and shed led him on like an idiot amaya seemed embarrassed for him ico looked at him with a smirk only tuckers friendship seemed unchanged he seemed less panicked by their predicament than the others expressing no anxiety about getting back and raven she avoided him looking pained the damn thing was though that sometimes when he looked at her the tilt of her head the grace of her body she still just about took his breath away yet how did he know she wasnt lying to him still he brooded from hurt telling himself to get over it to get hold of his emotions when tucker could maintain an ambulatory hobble they set out grimly for erehwon a place ethan said was about three days distant at their slow pace he led them with assurance even though there was no obvious trail or landmarks that daniel could see how do you know where youre going amaya asked ethan whose brittleness had softened at ravens revelation now he was one of them against her were following a songline a what its an aboriginal term they believed the world was created when giant protocreatures roamed an empty plain singing into being all the rocks and plants and animals we see today its not such a strange idea to me the new physics contends that matter at its most fundamental is just vibrating strings of energy a kind of music that were made of music fundamentally these routes of creation are songlines and aborigines were assigned to them its religious and somewhat mysterious but the practical aspect of it is that these lines formed a map or a pattern of trails in a preliterate society you learned your way by singing the features you would encounter as you proceeded the warden picked up on this and had the inmates compose ditties to help them find their way when they make treks from erehwon turn east toward kangaroo rock the next good water is half a days walk that kind of thing she smiled is it hard to keep in your head no harder than the telephone numbers passwords entry codes and social security digits i held before my brains been emptying of one kind of memory to make room for another and if you get back youll have to switch again yes but ill have learned i can do both do you miss all the old numbers no but i miss what they represented when i came here i threw all my gear away and ive been regretting it ever since were tool apes its our only edge so until we get out of here im trying to use what i can salvage youve got an eye for that too like with the sulfur the purists would let the wilderness kill them but with balance you can survive he showed the group how an old hubcap could be used to collect a tiny pool of morning dew or how a pit could be lined with salvaged plastic tented by another piece and collect atmospheric moisture like a still as they hiked he demonstrated how a length of yellowed tubing cupped with cloth could be used to filter drinkable water from a muddy wallow by sucking it like a straw you could use a reed for that too daniel said but i dont have to thats the point daniel plucked a reed i dont have to have tubing and thats the point amaya continued to explore nature at ravens direction she found and unearthed buried frogs in a wash the hibernating animals cool to the touch and sluggish from their muddy encasement had exterior bladders swollen to the size of footballs i read about these amaya recalled they store rainwater in this mouth pouch until the next storm they havent digested it so its supposed to be no different than water in an animal skin youre going to drink frog vomit ico asked its not vomit its less ingested than milk from a cows udder she squeezed and the frog regurgitated the water into her mouth splashing her face feels good geez thats disgusting not if it saves your life ravens right about one thing the desert is full of water if we know where to look casually amaya tossed the torpid animal away the others tried it too raven laughed at her squirt the first time theyd heard her do that daniel jerked at the sound remembering before people really did survive here didnt they asked tucker outback adventure must have briefed you to survive here a long time not really raven said i was intrigued by this idea and did my own research just so i knew survival was possible outback didnt think id be here that long which makes me wonder why you bother amaya if were about to call a taxi ico said she was stooped over some plants adding to her inventory because the taxi isnt here yet chapter eighteen the cluster of natural stone monoliths that sheltered the convict colony called erehwon first poked above the deserts horizon like sails on an ocean ethan told the group that the immense rocks sheltered a network of wetter valleys between their creased crusts funneling water into shaded pools that description was enough to make the party quicken its pace despite apprehension about meeting the people who lived there they camped that evening still eight miles distant the setting sun making the geologic curiosity glow like coals the rocks look like big loaves of bread amaya said im hungry enough groaned tucker theyll have food raven promised theyve even started irrigation you can see how the formation is a natural place to draw people adrift in the desert a small group of convicts huddled there first and started to hammer out a society others were drawn in as if by gravity the place keeps growing despite its management the warden ico asked he didnt get his position by charm so what kind of society free anarchic it started like that i think but became just the opposite were talking about people who hate rules but need them more than anyone i think they fell back on the model of a prison the community theyre most familiar with that just sounds dandy its harsh but thats what seems to work they crossed the remaining distance the following morning the rocks sheer as fortresses and smooth as breasts there wasnt a cloud in the sky but tendrils of smoke announced human habitation with it came daniels realization that the challenge had shifted from coping with wilderness to coping with people in less than three weeks hed entered the wild been humbled by it and now was coming for succor to a society that sounded more restrictive than the one hed tried to escape hed tested himself he thought gloomily and failed welcome to erehwon ethan said as they reached the edge some people just call it the compound easier to spell ico quipped there was no fence or boundary that daniel could see the settlements outskirts were marked by refuse scraps of salvaged metal and glass glinting in the sun random shreds of hoarded plastic and fabric a pit of garbage picked at by birds and the acrid odor of a latrine two women were moving slowly through this litter bent and swaying as they picked through the debris their features hidden by the curtain of their long hair on a rock above a canyon entry a squatting sentry with a spear watched the approach of the newcomers laconically waved and then stood to blow on what looked like a cattle horn its blat echoed through the canyons ahead theyd been announced he doesnt seem very surprised to see us ico said no said ethan most who try to escape come crawling back a sandy track led into a grove of trees the shade a relief theyd entered the labyrinth of valleys and canyons between the red loaves of rock a hot desert breeze rustling the gum and acacia trees when they had passed out of view of the sentry raven told the group to wait for a minute and left the trail disappearing into a small side crevice when she came out a bulge in her pack was gone its important to keep quiet about the activator she explained just make sure you put it where we can find the damn thing again ico replied no more misplacements the party passed a wooden corral where two sleepylooking camels rested dusty and huge the british brought them from afghanistan and some escaped into the wild ethan explained at their questioning looks theyre still in the bush so the warden caught a few to try to break so far they eat more than theyre worth so we may just eat them weve also got a few wild cows a horse and some kangaroo in the stables were trying to learn how to ranch them ico wrinkled his nose it stinks he said thats a farm smell city boy amaya replied stables she looked thoughtfully at the crude barns farther along was a pit and scattered logs indicative of a sawing operation and beyond that racks where meat dried in the sun orbited by flies despite the primitive nature of the settlement it reminded daniel of a medieval village the adventurers began to unconsciously relax here was the familiarity of a community whatever might happen they werent alone anymore the canyon opened to a broader park between the sandstone monoliths an area several hundred yards across that was a mix of trees and trampled clearings water glinted at the base of one towering rock and a cordon of dry brush blocked casual access to it thatched huts sheds and simple roofs were scattered about in a seemingly haphazard plan on a slight rise with its back to a cliff was a more substantial cabin of freshly cut logs the wood still new and whiteyellow smoke wafted from its chimney tame dingoes snoozed in the shade of the clearing and cockatoos stalked across the dirt in the shade of a brushwood awning someone slept in a fiber hammock there was a pungent odor of unwashed humans fire cooked meat and manure im in a time machine daniel thought they stopped at a rockrimmed well and ethan brought up a skin of water tucker slumped in the dust it was quiet in the midday heat flint had told them more than two hundred people lived in this cluster of rocks but most seemed to have dispersed to one task or another well ethan ico assessed this warden character sure picked the right name for this dump erehwon were right in the middle of it no doubt you can walk away at any time calling yourself a warden implies you cant he doesnt think youd make it thats why i dont expect him to be surprised weve come back raven told them to wait and mounted the hill to the cabin speaking to someone in the doorway then she returned the warden is still asleep well get some food and then youll meet him im going to try to get access to the transmitter asleep at noon ico asked whats to stay up late for they moved to the shade of a thatched leanto and ate smoky meat some white root and a strange nutty bread kangaroo bush banana root and mulga seed bread ethan identified the bread was difficult appreciate it after some time in the bush bread does seem pretty marvelous amaya agreed but the roo is pretty plain dont you believe in seasonings we dont have any except salt or what newcomers bring with them so the last of our food is about to go into the community pot daniel asked yes marx would approve and who the devil is this warden were waiting on ico asked some goon sent by united corporations what makes him top dog hes just a convict said ethan a thief and assailant sent here to rot like the rest of them no one really liked chaos so he put himself in charge no vote two men challenged him both disappeared disappeared the ones he just wants to punish he makes more public like hanging them up on rocks in the sun a day of that and the fight goes out of them and two days of that and theyre like the pilot exactly dont anger him the door of the cabin opened and a young slim blond woman came down the dusty hill to find them she was dressed in a simple shift that looked cut from salvaged cloth a parachute daniel wondered that showed her figure to good effect her brown arms and calves were bare and she was shoeless her soles apparently hardened to the hot earth the warden will see you now she said smug as a prom queen her eyes passing appraisingly over raven and amaya to calibrate any competition bring your offering then she walked back provocatively swaying offering tucker asked thats you raven explained fresh labor great at least i know what he stayed up for ico said following the blonde with his eyes keep away from her ethan said drina is rugards rugard thats the wardens name rugard sloan but dont call him that he doesnt like it they climbed the hill the log cabin walls facing the compound were broken only by the stout wooden door and slitlike loophole windows side walls extended to the rock of the backing cliff making the structure look more like a blockhouse than a residence the door opening was dark and the newcomers expected the house to be stifling inside when they ducked through however they saw that a back wall was absent from the cabin and the roof extended only halfway there was a rear open terrace of hardpan dirt against the cliff half of it shaded by a flat roof of woven branches a low cave in the cliff face was closed off by a stake door and a spring at the rocks base fed a shallow pool the backing cliff rose two hundred feet daniel recognized the essential elements of a wellsituated fortress high ground thick walls a secure water supply and even an apparent storeroom the place was designed to withstand a siege no vote indeed he looked around a shadowy figure leaned in one of the dark corners the gleam of what looked to be some kind of long knife or sword at his side a bodyguard drina lounged on a crude wooden bed in a corner so you didnt like the desert after all a rough voice said from another shadow they turned to the sound graveled from liquor or barked commands i could have told you what youd find out there their host was sitting they saw as their eyes adjusted lazing arrogantly back in a surprisingly modern chair of metal and fabric it came from an airplane daniel realized probably the one that had crashed with ethan we found more than you think raven said yes four more boobs dropped from the sky well come on then lets have a look they shuffled forward the warden evaluating them as they studied him he was tanned a swarthy dark like his underlings his face cleanshaven and his dark hair cropped close as a helmet small scars wrote a history of combat on his face his jaw was strong his nose slightly hooked like a roman aristocrats and his eyes were a curious empty gray the color of lunar dust daniel thought the effect was cold not much of a find raven and me to care for them we werent looking for anybodys help daniel interrupted the wardens eyes narrowed at him then lucky for you that you found it he growled youd be bones otherwise he had an arrogant authority that dominated the room and the corded muscle of a man used to hard company there was a stink of menace about him a manner as instinctively vicious as a pit bull he also appeared unapologetic about it no proud im not as bad as all that he said as if reading daniels mind im not going to bite and then he gave a yellowed smile that suggested he just might my name is rugard sloan but youll call me warden only warden im the father of this community of nowhereville ico said he squinted at ico you appreciate my joke and you chose to come to nowhere because the alternative was death in the desert right so who are you what are your skills they gave their names and at the wardens urging their former occupations only ico hesitated a systems manager he finally said fired it was not a question an opportunities transfer ico said defensively and before that tax analyst and fired and before that fired and before that fired am i correct ico looked at him sourly only because i tell the truth dont be embarrassed your work history is typical of half the wanderers who come to me misfits rejects incompetents rebels in that world but not in mine i give them a home in return they work for me and work hard weve come a long ways in a short time i hope you give our little community a chance daniel spoke up we came here on a kind of wilderness sabbatical since our arrival weve been flooded baked and bitten we werent warned of any of this were a little hesitant to give anything a chance right now rugard nodded do you think i created our little purgatory that i pulled the strings that put you here he snorted they told me less than they told you but ive put it together by gleaning information from this soul and that that were marooned with a bunch of cons ico said i believe the phrase is morally impaired but rehabilitation amaya began is a fairy tale to lull dumplings like you into believing theyre safe from people like me rugard completed he grinned oh they tried of course but i was really quite wicked i like to be wicked because its payback for a lousy unfair world i never asked to be a part of they made me what i am so they dont cure us dear they get rid of us it used to be drugs and costly warehouse prisons now its a continent full of nowheres fit for nothings cheap guiltless we got a speech no guards no walls youre free to starve slit each others throats or live like brute savages if you try to get back by boat well sink you with the help of satellite surveillance but if by some miracle you make it through our net no one will believe you and even if they believe you even just as a paranoid legend on the cyber underground the story will never get into our corporatecontrolled media oh and have a nice day so theres a lot of you she asked thousands id guess most die before we ever see them or maybe theres other compounds like this one who knows who cares were all just heinous criminals sent down under to remake ourselves except we never get back even when we do a whole continent as a prison ico asked a whole continent to salve their conscience is my guess we all know capital punishment is abhorrent in todays politically correct world life imprisonment is expensive rehabilitation for the worst of us is a fraud and australia is already written off a killing ground of plague so my kind is dumped here while united corporations makes up stories about our scientific rehabilitation claiming they give us new identities to reenter society without moral stain cause any strife and you lose your old life weve all heard the jingle its just truer than we thought its not because were brainsponged that we dont get in touch with our families its because were down here it saves them a fortune but were not convicts tucker objected yes the puzzling mystery why drop urban dilettantes into devils island certainly you prove useful for my kind to feed off we started robbing you of your supplies from the beginning but if they wanted to deliver manna from heaven why include you useless knobs of flesh in the freightage it was only after talking to enough of you selfabsorbed bastards that i figured out the common linkage our challenge of authority ico said no your pathetic acceptance of it you didnt challenge society you whined about it its not just that youre useless god knows the world is carrying billions of chunks of human deadwood right now dispirited and zoned out but you were worse than useless you spread dissatisfaction like a virus without proposing any cure at least my kind had the balls to take what we wanted but you weaklings you wanted to run away so they put you down here with the likes of me the criminal and disaffected in one happy family the only difference is that you paid to go thats not fair tucker protested isnt it dont you recognize yourselves they make you think youre a select few selfselected the fact is they make you think hiking through a wasteland is somehow going to qualify you for the corporate elite what delusional vanity what are you going to bring to a board gathering marshmallowtoasting skills they dupe you with your own selfimportance they turn your desires against yourselves its diabolical really how well they know you how they let you betray yourselves challenging hell youre compliant as sheep the others glanced at raven she was expressionless are you offended by my honesty rugard went on youre simply not used to it i find it ironic kind of like advertising in the united corporations world which always emphasizes a products weakest point if its cramped they call it roomy if it hurts they call it painless and if its bad for you they pick an athlete to sell it and who gets to tell you the truth me a moralimpaired the first honest man youve met and youre the smart guy rugard retorted daniel lord of a log cabin sultan of a sty the answering movement was so swift it was like the blurred attack of a wild animal the warden sprang from his chair and with the same fluid movement of his leap let the back of his hand crack across daniels face with a sound as loud as a whip daniels head snapped sideways shocked and the entire group fell back stunned rugard leaned toward them breathing hard his eyes bright holding out a quivering finger in warning i told you not to call me by my name i told you and i only tell once to you i am the warden and if i even suspect insubordination ill gut you in an instant and unwind your entrails for the dingoes to feed on tuckers hands had bunched into fists but the shadowy guard with the sword had taken a warning step forward and ethan put a hand on the big mans arm to caution him daniel put his hand to his jaw his ears were ringing and he tasted the salt of blood the finger dropped the point made the warden let his features mask into a judicious amiability and he sat back down in his chair does that seem harsh believe me im the only thing that has kept all of you from being gutted already by the animals they send here i run erehwon like a prison because im the ruler of prisoners im the one keeping you safe ico looked at rugard thoughtfully life stripped of bullshit this cant be possible amaya said someone back home must know why should anyone know theres never a complaint because no one gets back to complain people compete to come here only a handful at the top know and yet they have no blood on their hands its the perfect murder profitable easy guiltfree i wish id thought of it youre lying tucker accused you want us to stay here with you and you want to go to exodus port go look for it if you wish just remember that no account of whats really happening in australia has ever surfaced in the outside world ask yourself why we are going back warden it was raven really he was scornful you didnt last in the desert for a week we werent trying to get across the continent we were trying to get a ticket home rugards face slowly revealed intrigue what ticket i worked in aviation electronics she lied again counting on her companions to back her up when i came here and realized we were trapped and met ethan i got curious about his crash the rescue transmitter didnt work then i realized how ignorant you are he scowled i realized how little you know about modern technology dont try me bitch what are you talking about she reached in her pack and pulled out a cloth bag shaking it she scattered some electronic chips and wire across rugards table any beacon needs to be activated to penetrate the cone of electronic jamming over australia they cant put normal rescue beacons in transport aircraft because convicts could signal to escape you have to know the trick pilots know it but you killed the one we had he couldnt perform the trick he was a doubletalking aristocratic flyboy who led us on a wild goose chase after that moron standing next to you and then promised money if id give him more time money i wanted escape his kind thinks they can buy anything theyve always thought that he found out they cant i can do the trick he looked at her suspiciously yet you came back to me yes because i need something else which is she glanced at the storeroom send the others out and ill tell you chapter nineteen i dont trust them ico said it was evening the four original outback adventurers were waiting in a cluster of boulders off the main clearing a private place ethan had picked out earlier where raven would meet them after her negotiations with rugard over the transmitter the quartet had spent the afternoon touring erehwon a community that struck daniel as a cross between a prison compound and a pirate outpost repression atop cultural anarchy theyd been told they would work for their keep the men digging a reservoir while amaya toiled in the kitchens they were to design and build their own huts using a stockpile of brushwood and would have to earn their way to jobs of greater interest and responsibility microcore all over again he thought while everyone in the community was a kind of refugee united by desperation there was also a pecking order in the wardens world in which the strong tended to exploit the weak bullying was epidemic and because men outnumbered women two to one sexual tension was palpable some of the women had paired off but most preferred to sleep in their own settlement in a separate canyon from the men some trading sexual favors and others trying to maintain a rigid celibacy it was a place of social disorder kept from boiling over by the rule of rugard what linked them was a longing for home raven wouldnt have brought us here unless she wanted to help us tucker now reasoned she wanted to help him ico pointed to daniel i just dont like being cut out of the loop while she brokers a deal with this rugard guy he is honest but only about his own lack of scruples and now hes closeted with this female hireling of united corporations who knows what theyre up to its not like we have a choice daniel pointed out right said tucker until she came along we had no hope at all and we still might not if we dont keep watch on what ravens doing ico warned i dont think shes a bad person amaya said just wrong and useful right now i dont know if this is going to work but if it does wed better start thinking about what were going to do once we get back that ones easy tucker said take a shower have a beer ico amended no what are we going to do to put an end to this place who do we tell the media is transfixed by entertainment not information daniel said rugard is right why hasnt anybody heard about this place somebody has to have escaped but no one tells or no one will listen weve peeked behind the curtain man ico said we gotta tell somebody were going to be sneaking back not welcomed back daniel pointed out our story is going to have to make an end run around authority i think we start with the gurus of the cyber underground this isnt mere conspiracy theory this is a verifiable monstrosity provable to any inspector sent down here we get this on the internet tell the world and suddenly the facade crumbles somebody in power will seize on this to embarrass their opponents once the truth gets out australia cant be sustained damn right ico agreed if we get back weve got the atomic bomb of scandals we fan out and scream bloody murder then this asylum gets closed down why would raven help us do that tucker asked she thinks this is good for us raven doesnt need to know all she has to do is get us back ico glanced out into the dusk heads up here she comes ethan came with her the two slipping into the cluster of rocks with a furtive dart ravens lips slightly pursed they sat in a circle to hear what she had to say its going to be trickier than i thought she began rugard still has the transmitter in his storeroom and hes going to let me work on it in return for my promise to take him along but he wont let it out of his cabin we cant just sneak out of here they looked at her gloomily she took a breath so im going to have to fake a repair with my electronic junk until we can steal it theres a compound meeting and autumn celebration tomorrow night lubricated with the compounds latest innovation moonshine everyone will be there we sneak into his cabin then wont he have guards daniel asked probably but ive got another idea about how to get inside has anyone done any climbing there was an uncomfortable silence a little daniel finally conceded on an adventure vacation but could you rappel down that cliff she pointed to the monolith by rugards cabin lots of drunks a moonless night and any guards facing outward you slip down the cliff onto his terrace steal the transmitter and get hoisted back up thats crazy thats our only chance break in ico exclaimed why dont we just take rugard with us cut a deal she winced because theres something else i havent told you ah geez i knew it the instrument will work but it will only call in a rescue craft not a transport a small hover my superiors knew the risk of sending me into this place with the knowledge i have and so they warned me up front that the beacon response plane would only take me i have to be recognized me and the missing pilot they all looked at her in disbelief stunned hope had been slammed shut again i was really sent to find him or at least learn his fate hes the nephew of a board member who was being groomed to start up the ladder of promotion and he was proving himself with this job his failure to return caused quite a shock apparently a crash like that had never happened before theres even some suspicion of sabotage because of his political connections in any event rugard killed him so that just leaves me and room for one other you want to go back with dyson ico accused she looked at daniel then away her face betraying just a moment of doubt no i promised the seat to ethan after he told me the pilot was missing and probably dead i promised so hed help me find the wreck ethans face was impassive its still his by rights it was his transport that crashed but you didnt tell us this ico said no so wed help you yes he looked at ethan no wonder you werent happy to see us we threatened your spot i just didnt want to use you but she did because she works for uc because were still being screwed ico shut up daniel said why should we believe you ico persisted to raven why should we believe a thing you say because i still need your help she said stubbornly for what a bon voyage party if you help me steal the transmitter youll still have a chance to get back heres my plan we retrieve the activator i hid flee into the desert call for help uncouple the activator from the transmitter again so it cant penetrate the jamming and you four go on toward the coast now theres a great plan you go we stay how could i have ever doubted you no this is your ticket to get back listen the authorities wont bring me back without the activator that was my assignment i have to take the activator with me but the transmitter alone the piece that rugard has been keepingwill work on the coast it will work if you get far enough east i think you hike there signal and by that time ill have explained your cooperation to my superiors theyll send in another hover and youll come back heroes after doing what you set out to do cross australia such a reward has happened before the quartet looked at each other if they made it back it wouldnt be to become chums with united corporations the transmitter alone will work tucker said sounding skeptical youre not supposed to know that but yes it will there not here all we have to do to make rugards transmitter work is go to the coast daniel clarified puzzled the cone amaya said slowly the circle thats what shes talking about ive been wondering about that myself if a satellite is projecting a blanket of electronic interference it should fall on australia with a regular geometry such as a circle or oval but the continent cant be that regular at its edges some pieces of land must leak out from under the cone theyd just make it bigger no said raven there are too many sea and air lanes and nearby islands to overlap out onto the ocean very far australia is wider east to west than north to south if you get to the east coast the transmitter should work should work ico asked thats what they told me she said defensively and that must have been what the pilot was talking about when he gave me the activator ethan said that if we didnt have it wed have to walk to the beach listen daniel this is insane ico pleaded we cant let these two run off with our help and then be stranded here taking our chances in the wild who cares if the transmitter will work by itself they know well never make it across the remaining desert one of us should go on that plane with raven to make sure shell bring somebody back for us somebody back here you want to wait with the morally impaired better than dying of thirst on her itinerary for us im sorry but shes lied to you from the minute you met her if she wants our help one of us gets to go who daniel asked not you you cant be objective about her frankly it should be me i understand the system now im a good talker and i wont be taken in by a bunch of united corporations bullshit you ive seen through them from the beginning and ill see through them at home no said amaya youre not the right person ico no offense but you rub people the wrong way we need a revolutionary not a gladhander we need someone who will be listened to youll sound too abrasive too extreme too nutty im the only sane person here im sorry i just dont trust you to do this he threw up his hands okay you then not just these two who somehow find us in the desert and have been using us ever since theyre going to leave us in the lurch i know it no im not said ethan i came here like you ico im as angry about it as you are i forced raven to agree to take me back if she wanted to be shown that plane ico ignored him how about it amaya women and children first no thats silly she looked hesitant i i want to finish trying to sort out my life here her look ended at daniel as she said that raven would be gone again ethans one of us hes been here longer than any of us hes the one who was in the crash with the transmitter united corporations cant object to taking him back after he helped raven and he can talk for all of us even the convicts he makes the most sense by far yes said daniel ethans the logical one tucker for gods sake the big man shrugged i dont know if any of this is going to work but i came to walk across australia i say ethan too this way the four of us stick together all for one one for all ico looked around the group in purgatory daniel shrugged they were set the decision made fine great ico sighed lets go break into the house of napoleon fruitcake up the hill there and then run out into the desert ico im sorry i cant take you all right now raven said its the only way thats what you say the four men were roused at dawn and marched to work on the reservoir the community needed more water and was excavating a basin at the base of a cliff daniel would have preferred to have stayed in camp to make final plans with the women but he knew such malingering would only arouse suspicion all he could hope was that ravens crazy plan to steal the transmitter could work and that in the confusion of preparing for the nights festival amaya could succeed in foraging supplies for their escape amaya told him at breakfast not to worry the women are friendly most of them were a minority here so they tell me where things are ive also got another idea whats that its a surprise something raven and i are cooking up there was a sullen mood to the group of men detailed to dig the sand pit the hardest and dirtiest of erehwons current projects welcome to the wardens shit detail one muttered the digging team equipped with crude tools of wood and hammered scrap metal was an amalgam of freshly arrived convicts and impressed adventurers as well as the stupid slow and those whod drawn rugards ire accordingly the pace of excavation was desultory im supposed to be excited about building my own prison one grizzled moralimpaired a chronic petty thief complained to daniel it feels like im digging my own grave i dont want a reservoir i want out of here so go daniel said and die in the desert so quit one man tried that the warden made the rest of us drink his blood from the bowl of his skull he said we needed to bond if morale was so poor the work on the westfacing impoundment was tolerable until midmorning when the sun cleared the cliffs and began beating into the pit then the temperature began to soar the men took a twohour break at midday but the enclosure was even hotter afterward everyone coated in sweat and dust and tormented by flies by midafternoon ico did little more than lean on his shovel depressed and exhausted staring blankly out at the pan of surrounding desert with his thoughts far away you okay washington tucker asked him at one point no tucker im not okay can i get you something man some water he waved him off leave me alone im trying to figure out a way to get okay they broke off work with the sun dipping toward the horizon the cliff face still throwing off waves of heat the sky remained cloudless the air parched it was difficult to imagine the pit and its surrounding dike collecting anything but heat back at the main compound they got a skin of water to drink and wash and then slumped tiredly waiting for the gathering at dark the community would party hard and sleep it off the next day as the stars popped out raven found them i worked on the transmitter to confirm its in his storehouse and pleaded the need to scrounge more parts she whispered a rope is hidden at the base of the monolith well all go to the party to allay suspicion and then you guys will have to slip away if you can steal it we meet at two am at the boulders if anything goes wrong you four pretend i tricked you into all this that wont take much pretending ico said she looked at him impatiently ico i didnt put you here im just skeptical about whos going to get me out let him be daniel said wearily hes cranky were exhausted concentrate your thinking on going they dozed and ate and after dinner daniel went in search of amaya he found her down by the stables carrying a bag of something up toward the canyon where the women had been assigned need any help no its not heavy besides its for the surprise he wrinkled his nose a pretty fragrant one i take it youll see didnt ico call me the devils prospector something like that his look became serious how about the supplies enough to get us started well be living off the land again can we do it we have to wasnt that the point from the beginning he nodded and then frowned gathering his thoughts for what he was about to say amaya before we make our move tonight i want you to think about your options i admire your courage for being willing to stay in australia but i want you to reconsider i think ethan would step aside if you wanted to leave on the rescue plane with raven australia is pretty tough and i dont know how this rugard is going to react when we steal his means of escape he might try to run us down in the desert i know its just going to be hard and dangerous she nodded i know but im really not all that anxious to get back daniel despite all the bad luck something is happening in my life i worry about you with all these men she laughed what a ratio i should be looking forward to all these men you know what i mean these guys are convicts most of them the shrinks couldnt straighten them out all im saying is this may be your last chance to escape you mean despite what raven promises yes she nodded more serious i know but ive thought about it ive been thinking about it ever since we woke up in australia not just since raven told us about the transmitter sometimes i feel i belong and sometimes it scares me to death but to go back now would be to give up on myself im feeling new things here seeing new things thinking new thoughts back home its just noise so thank you im staying all right i thought thats what youd say he looked at her with a tilt to his head youre what raven pretended to be i think i think raven pretended to be what she wants to be shes just not there yet he shook his head i dont understand her she doesnt understand herself he looked at her quizzically are we going to stay friends i hope so i mean after ravens gone youre a special woman amaya a good woman and youre a good man but ive seen how you look at her its not the way you look at me his expression was guilty she smiled not yet anyway and then his eyes followed her as she walked jauntily away chapter twenty if rugard sloan thought he was about to leave australia he gave no hint of it in his meandering harangue to the crowd of two hundred that gathered in the clearing that night he introduced the latest arrivals crowed about the communitys achievements and gave dire warnings about the consequences of insubordination or shirking the sons of bitches in the real world sent us here to rot he shouted in hoarse reminder to the assembly every day we survive here every day we prevail here were spitting in their faces they roared their approval at that and he grinned viciously we spit at them and someday well pay them back but meantime i love you people and what weve built here so its time to take a night off and party the crowd whooped a makeshift band of drummers and wooden flutists started a pounding hooting beat and some of the assembly began to awkwardly dance in the sand fermented plant juice was passed out forgivably awful because it was so fiery a bonfire roared in the night daniel studied the cliff face above rugards cabin it was dark a slab against the stars the warden worked the crowd and then came up to raven why isnt it working yet he growled quietly im almost there he grasped her hand that held a cup and tipped it forcefully toward the sand his grip was like a vise i dont want you drinking tonight i want you up at the cabin later with me getting that transmitter to work the compound will be hungover and halfconscious tomorrow we cant take all of them so it would be a good time to slip away without saying goodbye understand youre willing to leave these people you love im willing to leave my own mother to get out of this dung hole ill come to you later youd better im watching you bitch dont think about leaving without me relax warden she smiled tightly her wrist twisted were working together remember he looked at her intently his gray eyes like hollows dont fuck with me then he dropped her arm and moved away her group danced to be seen except for raven they pretended to drink to be seen and then daniel tucker and ethan slipped quietly away into the dark one by one even as the noise of the celebration grew sparks wafted up to dance amid the stars raven and amaya drifted through the crowd laughingly fending off advances and keeping an eye on the hill to rugards cabin sometime after midnight the women met in the shadows wary and tense i cant find ico raven reported i havent seen him for an hour i dont think hes one for parties amaya said he told me he was getting more supplies before going to watch rugards door you should have seen his pack when we started he brought everything i havent seen the warden either hes hanging on a new concubine drina looked furious raven looked out into the dark feeling her sore wrist ico wants to get back very badly doesnt he i think hes angry he wants revenge i hope hes not so angry he does something foolish did you move the supplies away from the boulder cluster like i told you yes but i dont understand why and try making what i suggested yes i dont know if it will work good hopefully none of it is necessary im going to get the activator well meet the men with the transmitter and slip away then why the precautions because it may be more difficult to get out of erehwon than i would like the monolith that formed the sheer cliff at the rear of rugards cabin was more a steep slope on its opposite side its rock the texture of sandpaper a watercourse that funneled periodic thundershowers down the face of the rock had made enough of a crease in the formation to give daniel ethan and tucker a desperate chance of scaling it they shouldered the ropes that raven had liberated from a compound warehouse and then started their climb at a dead run sprinting up the rocks lowest slope with a momentum that took them to a pool in a fold of rock thirty feet above the surrounding sand they clung to its rim you okay daniel asked the others tucker looked around at the bare stone no snakes so far i dont think a flea could cling to this dildo ethan said looking upward at the pale formation rising like a horn how the hell are we going to get up this daniel friction the watercourse gave them just enough of a dent to brace themselves as they wedged upward and the rough texture provided a tenuous grip none dared look down daniels sweat left a trail of dark droplets and ethan breathed in short gasps his muscles trembling from the tension tucker grunted with the effort to keep his bulk from sliding back downhill there was enough slope to give them purchase but it was like climbing a funnel gravity trying to pull them toward a dark drain the night was cool the stars cold and yet daniel was hot from the exertion at least the view was extraordinary he noticed when he glanced up other monoliths in the cluster of rocks gleamed gray in the dark like the domes of a religious sanctuary their canyons and valleys lakes of shadow the sky vaulted down and the desert horizon climbed up to tie into one vast sphere of ghostly luminescence the rock he clung to at the center of this spectral universe it was as if he was climbing the crest of a floating asteroid he thought his goal the summit ahead seemed to lead to space itself the effect was dizzying his floating reverie was interrupted by a scrape and a muffled curse tucker was sliding backward down the chute damn daniel tensed praying after several yards the big man managed to brake himself abrading his arms and legs to keep his precarious contact with the rock he skidded to a halt you okay daniel inquired quietly there was a long silence im okay i can tell by the pain they started up again it helped to keep eyes to the stone there was one short stretch where the pitch was nearly vertical and they climbed by pushing against almost imperceptible undulations in the surface straining from the exertion then the slope began to ease and finally to flatten daniel crawled shakily onto the roof of the monolith his muscles rubbery the surface of its crest was rough but basically level eroded into shallow depressions that held pools of water separated by ridges of tougher rock in the compound below figures still staggered drunkenly in the dying firelight he felt horribly exposed yet it was unlikely anyone could see him in the darkness dropping to his knees he made his way to the far edge here the rock tower dropped straight down to rugards cabin completely black in the night there was no light from the house and none from the brush nearby it was like dropping into the dragons den gawd tucker said as he came up next to daniel if my ass had puckered any more on that climb i wouldve collapsed on myself like a black hole this is the craziest damn thing ive ever done you know that a computer would never do it daniel agreed but its not as crazy as me going down there he peered into the darkness i cant see a thing but i have to hope the transmitter is really down there and everyone is gone drunk or passed out rugard hasnt shared our secret ill bet so nobody should be particularly alert youre going to have to lower me as i rappel and ethan will help feed the line then you can both hoist me up can you do that tucker considered i can brace my legs against these little ledges up here i wont be able to see anything though so ill just lower until ethan says youre down icos keeping an eye on the front door thats the plan tucker began flaking the ropes loose in businesslike fashion while ethan used knots to join them daniel tied an end around his waist and crotch vaguely similar to his memory of the rappeling harness hed used on vacation backing down a sheer cliff was not as difficult as it looked he reminded himself so long as you were sure the partner feeding the end from around his waist was absolutely dependable he hoped tuckers snake venom had thoroughly worn off daniel stood saluted his companion and walked backward as tucker fed out the rope he paused on the edge doublechecking his knots not exactly just another day at microcore then he leaned back into space his legs were braced against the cliff his body straight and the taut rope cutting into his waist was all that suspended him from eternity the helplessness of it the requirement for implicit trust in another human being was exhilarating as tucker slowly let out rope he began to descend walking backward down the cliff toward the pool of darkness below he waited for a shout of alarm but all he heard was the increasingly discordant drum of music the band was getting drunk in the end it was almost too easy far easier than the climb up had been he dropped to the cabins roofless terrace breathless but elated he was down daniel waited until slack rope pattered into a pile beside him and then moved cautiously forward listening the guard jago presumably still stood on the other side of the front door the interior of the cabin was dark its corners spooky and daniel tried not to think of the corpse of the crucified pilot or convicts drinking from a skull he glanced toward the table ravens electronic junk was still scattered across it she must have put on a good show thankfully the transmitter sat there too a beckoning machine or like cheese in a trap he thought wryly he took a step no sound but his own panting and the distant dying sounds of merriment another step and then another he felt like he was being watched but no the cabin was empty wasnt it then he was at the table groping across it to softly cradle the machine in his arms you might just pull this off he told himself you might just walk out into the desert with the means for raven to call home with the means for her to leave you shed be waiting in the starlight with the activator waiting to go back to a world hed wanted to escape from waiting to go back to a system he wanted to condemn would she really come back for them did he want her to or did he really wish she would stay as they hiked to the coast he froze there was something else on the table he saw dimly a metal box the size of a shoe box he reached out his fingertips brushing the familiar dented surface of flaking paint tough enough to withstand an airplane crash to weather a flood to what was the activator doing here a match flared brilliant in the inky darkness transfixing daniel like a deer see we dont need her anymore a voice said quietly now weve got both units and can signal whenever we want the illuminated hand lit a candle it was ico hed stolen ravens hidden activator and gone to rugard outside daniel could hear a rumble of feet up the hill as convicts began a charge for the front door theyd been waiting for the light he snatched the activator up to cradle with the transmitter backing toward the cliff dont do this it was the only way dyson ico stepped into the light holding the tip of a crude sword against the floor like a cane as if the idea of pointing it at someone had not yet occurred to him the only way to make sure one of us got back not that seductress from united corporations but the warden he has to have underground connections it would take us years to find theyll harbor us and hide us and well get the cyber word out no not with convicts there were men at the outside of the cabin door now jerking it open daniel stood at the cliff base still roped in his arms awkwardly full looking up pull he screamed dont be a fool ico hissed hell kill us all think and then he jumped forward the sword swung high to chop at the rope at the same moment the door burst open and rugard jago and half a dozen convicts burst into the room sneaking thieves the warden roared daniel had only a second to consider which machine was more expendable then he heaved the activator at ico washington as hard as he could the heavy box hit his attacker full in the face and ico went backward with a muffled cry falling into the surging convicts daniel wrapped himself around the rope and was suddenly jerked up into the night a spear skimmed past his swinging boot and clanged against the cliff wall get him the warden howled dancing like a puppet daniel was hauled by brute strength up along the dark cliff using his feet to fend himself off as he swung something whizzed by him and missed then his ascent stopped and he dangled helpless the shadowy figures below taking aim he was about to scream for his companions to pull some more when something heavy sizzled by as it fell the wind cuffing him it hit below with a crash splintering and the convicts howled ethan had dropped a rock then with a jerk daniel was being hauled upward again what if that had hit me he hollered upward we could stop pulling ethan called back from the confusion of shouts below he could hear the wardens roar come on well get them when they come off the monolith then daniel smelled smoke icos illumination of the slitlike windows in rugards cabin had signaled the waiting convicts warned by ico of ravens plan to rush the front door it had also alerted raven and amaya who had crept in behind rugards men once she found the activator missing from where she had hidden it and guessed what ico had done raven had realized that his betrayal might be another kind of chance now it was all playing out as she had expected with a little luck the tables would be turned lets go the women seized either end of a stout wooden log and ran up the dark hill toward the cabin door raven had noticed a curious detail the warden had built his stout door to open outward so that any attackers could not easily batter it inward against its log frame an excellent plan to keep assailants out or the warden in even as they heard the shouts and cries of the men inside the women slammed the log firmly against the door bracing it against the dirt then they lit two brands and ran along the cabin wall firing its thatched roof heavy shoulders crashed against the cabin door from the inside but it didnt budge in an instant smelling the smoke the warden understood its a trick a trap the table the table get up on the roof and out of here even as they dragged furniture over to boost themselves to the inner lip of the halfcovering roof a wall of flames breathed heat on the cabin eaves from somewhere in the dark a woman screamed one of the braver convicts hauled himself up on the roof and danced on its brushwood frame to try to dash through the curtain of flames he broke through near the wall and crashed back down into the cabin burned smoking and howling frantic the men hurled themselves again against the stout door it wouldnt give were going to fry one of them yelled no were not get back to the cliff rugard snapped the fire will just bring the others to unblock the door he started to cough then cursing as smoke billowed from the underside of the thatch his men began bailing spring water throwing it up toward the growing conflagration but it did little good and in any case wasnt really necessary there was no real danger the warden thought there was a sufficient gap between roof and cliff where the flames wouldnt reach if they had to they could retreat into the stone storeroom but dyson was getting away a jerking fly now against the stars high above that was humiliating angrily the warden clutched icos arm the smaller man seemed in shock hypnotized by the flames his nose bleeding from where hed been hit why didnt he cooperate like you promised ico shook his head the woman shes bewitched him where are they going rugard demanded where will they signal they wont he said and pointed shakily the warden followed his finger the activator to penetrate the jamming was sitting on the cabin floor he sprang forward and grabbed it suddenly exultant yes he dropped it he clobbered me with it i would have had him otherwise they cant signal without this right ico looked at the spreading flames smoke boiling out they could hear the confused shouts of the rest of the compound as it was roused by the fire not here not unless shes lied to us again why had dyson thrown away the means of escape desperation at his own clumsy attack or something more but now they have the transmitter so we cant signal without them either chapter twentyone the fugitives rendezvoused at a dry creek bed in a side canyon where amaya had cached their packs behind them was a confused yelling and the glow of fire the three men were scraped and bruised from hastily sliding down the rear of the rock tower tucker limping painfully from a sprain the women were panting when theyd slipped by the cluster of boulders where theyd originally planned to meet they saw more of rugards men waiting there and ran ico had obviously told the warden where their supplies were supposed to be stored it was good amaya had moved them little snitch raven now muttered are they going to burn amaya asked worriedly looking back at the flickering orange just held up a bit and angry as hornets we have to move fast if were going to get away and signal for rescue youve got it right she turned to daniel how did you know to pen them in like that he asked her instead when ico disappeared i got suspicious then i found the activator was gone amaya and i got a log to brace the door shut but you let them lower me into the cabin anyway yes because we needed the transmitter if id warned you off our position would be hopeless now we can still get back dont you mean you can get back ethan and i are your best hope youre ruthless you know that im practical besides it was your friend who betrayed you not mine daniel was quiet at that can we just go please tucker said impatiently they shouldered their gear and fled into the canyon of the womens camp brushing by a few confused occupants whod turned out groggily at the noise and confusion they paused at a cook hut to snatch a last few bites of food but even as they did they heard the call of a cattle horn one of the women was blowing an alarm to relay their direction so they hurried on as the fugitives reached the end of the canyon they saw the torchlight of a posse entering its head many of the convicts were drunk or unconscious but not all were in a race tucker panted im slowing you down amayas cooked up something to slow them down raven replied if it works the second woman said they entered a gorge at the upper end of the womens valley the defile wasnt much more than a slit in a huge rock that looked like it had been split asunder but it was a door leading to the desert east of erehwon narrow as a corridor in places the clefts floor was sand and its lower reaches stained dark where past floodwaters had swirled through only a wedge of sky with a scattering of stars hundreds of feet above shed any light ethan and raven had used the passageway to slip away before and now were using it again but this time pursuit was only a mile behind what will they do if they catch us tucker asked limping along ive been through this before ethan said we get away or we kill ourselves surrendering is not an option a fall of rock had almost plugged the slit at its midway point with a wall of boulders difficult to climb over floodwaters had carved a low sandy tunnel under the rocks that raven and ethan had earlier crawled through this is the place i told you about raven said to amaya the other woman nodded she stooped to dig in her pack as they paused to catch their breath they could hear the calls of pursuit behind them like the baying of hounds why are we stopping daniel asked we have to move raven and i think we might slow them down with this amaya said she took out a leather skin shaped roughly like a sphere and slightly smaller than a basketball cord and a coating of hardened fat helped seal the outside what the devil is that its a bomb she announced it as proudly as she would a baby the men looked at her in confusion i got the idea when we saw the stables if we set this off at the right moment it should block this gorge and scare hell out of them too it will buy us time youre serious arent you said tucker remember the sulfur spring that was one ingredient of gunpowder have you ever made it not in the last couple of days its simple really all you need is sulfur charcoal and potassium nitrate in the right proportions charcoal tucker asked from the fires nitrate from the urine deposits in the stables calcium nitrate actually which works in a pinch she regarded her invention maybe tomorrow she splits the atom daniel said how do we use it in the tunnel the explosion should collapse it and maybe jar more rock loose besides ill wait to light it no said tucker quickly ill do it its my idea tucker my risk he shook his head im the slowest with this bum ankle and the strongest theyll hesitate with me tucker looked up at the sky a slim silver band high above this is the pass to make a stand i think like daniels spartans what he sounded excited the greeks and the persians remember daniel tucker youre not a damned spartan how do i know if ive never tried you have no training he looked back down the defile its the perfect place the perfect time and the perfect person daniel looked at him worriedly ill back them up a bit light the explosive and run tucker reassured or at least hobble with any luck theyll decide were not worth chasing there wasnt time for argument all right light it and crawl like hell well be waiting on the other side no dont wait make all the distance you can ill catch up hes right ethan said dropping to the sand to wriggle through we cant risk any delay raven went next and amaya ducked to follow daniel put his hands on his friends shoulders you be sure to come promise ive got to see the rest of australia he grinned amaya was through and the others were calling daniel hesitated a moment more and then fell on his belly to crawl his head and back bumping against the overhanging rock ethan helped drag him out the other side okay hes buying us time daniel said lets run like hell theyre going to tear him to pieces if he doesnt get through that hole ethan said soberly he knows that daniel said if his courage is going to mean anything we have to get away the canyon widened slightly on the other side of the blockage and they trotted down it toward the eastern opening that showed a gray horizon there was already a barely detectable blush in the sky dawn was coming the bomb would have to work the canyon walls were so steep that it would be difficult to get around him tucker was betting it might take hours to circle the enclosing rocks precious minutes at least if he could hold rugards men here for a while the others would have a chance he studied amayas bomb a fuse extended from one end and tied to it wrapped in leaves were two of their remaining matches could it really choke off the canyon he couldnt rely on that alone rugards men were already in the defile pushing forward cautiously and clumsily by torchlight the reflections throwing shadows well ahead of the actual pursuit lets give you something to think about tucker growled he set down the explosive picked up the spear hed been using as a cane and crouched at a bend of the canyon waiting they came around the curve arrogant and angry and he charged them like a cornered bear surprise was complete his initial thrust only glanced off the first man who was twisting desperately out of the way but the wound was enough to raise a howl and throw the convicts into confusion their quarry had turned the front rank stumbled back some tripping in their haste to get away from tuckers whirling staff a braver criminal plunged ahead with his own spear and tucker knocked it aside the man came at him again tucker parried seized his opponents shaft and jerked forward with the glad ferocity of instinctive combat the convict stumbled dropped to his knees and lost his weapon as tucker wrenched his own ankle pain forgotten the man was trying to retreat on his hands and knees when tucker speared him the convict screamed pinioned through the leg and then was jerked to safety by his friends the shaft trailing out of his thigh rugards men fell back relaying the news of danger tucker got up breathing heavily his ankle even worse and looked at the retreating torchlight with satisfaction yeah back off you bastards he muttered then he studied the cliff wall and boosted himself gingerly a short distance up it bracing himself precariously you keep away from us rugard he yelled his voice echoing come up here and well kill you all no one answered him he dropped back down to the sand and waited considering the bomb again he could hear the pursuers arguing picking up the thread of rugards rasping impatient voice then the convicts fell ominously silent for a while finally someone was being pushed forward scuffling through the sand get your damn hand off me there was a pause and then a familiar voice called out down the canyon tucker is that you listen we have to talk it was ico i dont talk to the morally impaired tucker shouted back come on man listen to me we still need each other we can still work together daniel wouldnt listen tucker ill bet he didnt even tell you he cant get you back not without me he was lying wasnt he daniel said they got the transmitter listen to me we can still cut a deal you made your deal ico the little man fell silent for a minute then let me talk to daniel tucker didnt reply let me talk to raven again he was quiet they were trying to determine how many were ahead what did they do ditch you too you all alone tucker he didnt answer because he did feel suddenly alone terribly alone the quiet of the convicts bothered him what were they up to tucker listen i did it for your own good that corporate bimbo was bewitching dyson you know that she was going to fly off and leave us all here like a bunch of bumpkins it was insane to let her escape this way we get to go your warden pal promise that tucker think if we dont get the transmitter back our party is stuck here if you dont help us were all stuck here for the rest of our lives come on listen to reason you come up here where i can see you tucker called you come up here where we can talk there was more wrestling and ico was shoved lurching ahead he stopped straightened and then walked forward hesitantly all we want is the transmitter tucker he soothed his arms spread wide were not going to hurt you guys we need each other now i did it for you man when ico was close enough tucker hurled the spear the shorter man squeaked and dodged but not quite quickly enough the spear head sliced across one arm and he yelped scurrying back out of the way the convicts roared the sound angry and ominous and rocks and a couple of other spears fired back tucker ducked behind an outcrop as the missiles rattled harmlessly by him then he retrieved them and ran back around the corner of the canyon no one followed somewhere to the east the others were getting away yeah come on you bastards tucker thought come and get it several minutes passed tucker stayed pressed against the canyon wall looking for movement nothing he was alone in a dark hole it was funny to feel so confined after the big spaces of australia then there was a shattering rattle from above and tucker looked up something was falling in amongst the stars rock fall they were up on the rim and trying to get around him they were throwing things at him from above he lurched back to the tunnel entrance and fell on the bomb stones banged down he wiggled into the tunnel backward pulling amayas crude device after him the rocks bouncing harmlessly outside well that was that theyd outflanked him just like daniels spartans this damn bomb had better work he unwrapped the matches and put one carefully in a breast pocket there were already voices outside the hole theyd tried to rush him and were baffled at his disappearance until they spied the tunnel now someone was scrabbling in tucker struck the other match held it to the fuse and waited nothing a dud oh boy amaya and then there was a flash a fizz and the bomb began burning god be praised the crazy woman had done it he dropped the smoking sphere in front of him and began wriggling backward toward the eastern entrance light from the fuse helping illuminate the way he heard cries of alarm and a frantic crawling from the convicts then the light went out with a smothering hiss i got it someone had extinguished the thing damn tucker reversed course and hurriedly crawled back seeing the dim shape of someone backing up the tunnel he caught up with the bomb snatcher just as the other man was about to wriggle out and grabbed there was a grunt of pain and a curse jago rugards guard the man stank from the smoke of the burning cabin roof the convict and tucker grappled awkwardly in the tight space the others clustered outside the tunnel entrance hes got me jago shouted get me the hell out of here tucker was punching clawing butting trying to get the bomb back it was like a struggle for a football hands were reaching in clutching at them both and he felt the two of them being inexorably hauled out of the tunnel jago was cutting him he realized a knife he supposed and he chopped at the mans throat stopping the irritation the bomb came loose and tucker clutched it to his own breast men were starting to pummel his body as they pulled him out toward the open the match broken but he could feel the piece with the head in his pocket the mob was howling yanking them like a cork from a bottle whooping at the opportunity for revenge tucker felt jago being jerked away from him and then hands dragging punching tearing their screams of frustration filled his ears the anger hitting him harder than the pain he lit his match and pressed it to the fuse please let me succeed at something just once he prayed just once he felt a curious lightness as they beat him the future had disappeared and with it the weight of the past here in the eroded cluster of sculpted rock carved by unimaginable eons of time he was at the cumulative instant he was supposed to be at he recognized all his life had come down to this so when the fuse flared and screams erupted and hands clutched frantically at the bomb he felt a curious serenity tucker had found his why then the bomb went off the quartet of fleeing adventurers heard the boom of the explosion as they ran out into the broad desert the horizon flush with the coming sun the thudding roar echoed and reechoed among the labyrinth of canyons sending startled birds flying prematurely up and into the morning air they stopped and turned there was a groan of collapsing rock and a following rumble as if stones were sliding down to seal the defile more completely it worked amaya said quietly as if shed never really been convinced the ancient formula could be quite so simple it exploded did he make it it was ethan asking a question he knew couldnt be rationally answered yet a cloud of smoke and dust rolled out of the slit they had emerged from the noise finally grumbled away and there was dead silence no said daniel knowing the answer without knowing it he didnt amaya was silently weeping lets not make it be for nothing ethan finally said we have to be out of sight by sunrise and lay low until its safe to trigger the beacon maybe tomorrow night we cant daniel said cant what trigger the beacon we cant signal for rescue we cant penetrate the cone i thought you said you got it i got the transmitter but i threw the activator at ico he looked at raven you two are going to have to hike to the coast with us the other three looked stunned amaya was looking from daniel to raven crestfallen its better this way he said not some of us fly off some of us stay raven was looking at him in shock oh daniel she whispered it will give us time to ask why we do then he turned and led the way into the rising sun lord what a painting rugard sloan blackened and scorched turned a grim circle at the mouth of what had been the tunnel fresh rock had covered it and the walls nearby had been sprayed with gore one man had done this he thought one big man he hadnt had time to reach with reason one man this giant named tucker had killed five men wounded half a dozen more and turned the remaining pack of pursuers into a band of drunken sick whipped dogs rugard couldnt have driven them on at gunpoint not right now the snitch ico had lived by hanging back because of his little spear cut whimpering like a punished child rugard himself had been saved by the death of a man in front of him a fleshandblood shield that had knocked him flat he was spattered with offal and singed and grimy from the flames of his own roof theyd made a fool of him of that he was certain otherwise it was hard to think the wardens ears were ringing and his head ached there was a fuzziness to his vision he suspected would take hours to go away and in front of him was a wall of unstable rock sealing the fugitives exit route men could climb over it or dig through it he knew but none had the stomach for it at the moment least of all him the bastards were gone escaped into the desert and to follow them hed have to organize a party with proper food and water to hunt them down it was maddening despite this fiasco rugard knew the others would look to him for answers people were dung expendable and cheap and theyd follow a strong man as far as hed lead them the warden felt not a thing for the men who had just been blown to bits by the explosion they were fools to be in the front rank he limped back down the canyon past his groaning stunned men explosives how had that bitch raven brought them with her there was something odd about her some lack of ordinary fear and confusion he hadnt liked her arrogance from the start shed scorned his advances was condescending to his authority and was probably laughing at him right now clearly she knew too much and shed go on laughing until he hunted her down and had her in a different way and then turned her whole being into a bloody locus of pain we cant let them go rugard turned it was the weasel he held men like that in contempt but they were necessary this little pissant might know where the others were going weve got to get it back so we can get back ico mumbled as dazed by the explosion as the others the activator is useless until we get the transmitter to hook it to obviously rugard growled and youre going to help get it for me youre going to help me hunt them down in the desert by telling me which way theyll go they cant get back either not without us right ico winced not exactly he looked down in wonder at his bloody arm welcome to real life he thought drolly it ached like hell i know where theyre going i think where the coast raven thinks the transmitter alone will work there what if we dont catch them before they reach it shell be gone ico looked around morosely hed thought hed be leaving these cretins in hours or days now he might be stuck with them for weeks or months well catch them then theyd follow the thieves to wherever they might run rugard thought use them to assuage his own humiliation get the transmitter to unite with its activator and then take proper vengeance on the whole damnable world part three chapter twentytwo the fugitives strode toward the rising sun with a grim anxious pace always looking backward for a miraculous reappearance of tucker for pursuit for a last glimpse of human settlement and community they saw none of these just burnished domes of rock beginning to slip down the horizon as they hurried and ahead shrubshrouded desert and the undulating swell of red sand dunes there was no conversation their narrow escape continued peril and daniels loss of the activator had shocked them all into a tense silence ravens fury and fear at being trapped in australia had left her speechless ethan looked at the pair with an accusatory stare as if their tangled emotions had doomed him as well as themselves amaya was morose at the loss of tucker and ico and the continued presence of raven their little family had become dysfunctional we need to talk amaya ventured once there was no answer the fugitives would be easy enough to track if pursued immediately daniel knew their feet left a scuffed trail in the sand like the frozen wake of a passing boat the question was whether rugard would bother to follow and if he did how quickly he could organize a posse given time wind or rain would eventually erase their footsteps and then surely the fugitives could elude pursuit in the immensity of the continent they would pick their way slowly east to the sea signal for a rescue craft and after that the possibility was so impossibly distant that it wasnt worth thinking about it was more important daniel knew to think about the here and now to stop focusing on the world of united corporations and start focusing on australia it was this obsession about getting back that was causing so much trouble by weary agreement they didnt take a midday break but pushed on the sand giving way to hardpan and dry deadlooking vegetation the land was ugly but easier to walk across the day grew hot but not as oppressive as the punishing furnace of their first arrival the desert winter was slowly approaching daniel also noticed the groups steady endurance after a sleepless night his own body had acquired a wiry stamina far different from the calculated strengths of his health club regimen he could push on with a dogged tirelessness that allowed him to keep going even when reason called for collapse and sleep they were close enough to erehwon that raven and ethan knew of a dependable seep it was a risk making for it because any pursuers could guess at their decision but it was a greater risk to push into the unknown without as much water as possible they threw themselves down at the puddle at midafternoon to drink to satiation and then slowly impatient at the delay topped off every container they had i still dont see him amaya said quietly looking back the way they had come no daniel said we wont and then they pushed on the sun set behind their backs the monoliths black stubs in the distance now and they marched on into dusk there was no question of stopping they walked as the moon came up the desert lit like an old blackandwhite movie and held their direction by keeping the southern cross on their right hand it was so quiet they could hear the squeak of sand under their feet at midnight they came to the bank of a dry wash where ghost gums overhung the sandy channel like adults leaning over a cradle and there they collapsed and slept fallen carelessly to the ground like leaves the four of them slept in a cluster huddling instinctively for warmth and reassurance and were unconscious from exhaustion before anyone had a chance to comment on their geometry ethan roused them shortly before dawn they wordlessly wolfed down a few mouthfuls of cold food drank and pushed on they didnt dare light a fire yet a rhythm came into their flight they walked hard for about an hour rested five minutes and then pushed hard again they began to cross a series of flat pans of featureless clay dry lakes raven guessed they probably flood in the rains white salt glittered on the cracked mud at midday they crawled wordlessly into the shade of a cluster of ironwood trees to nap restlessly for two hours then they hiked on walking again until midnight their conversation mostly monosyllabic the rocks of erehwon had slipped permanently below the horizon they saw no one heard nothing they were alone again four adventurers in a desert wilderness with no idea where they were or precisely where they were going except east it didnt matter walking was a substitute for talk when they stopped that night their weariness was so complete that it kept them from immediately falling asleep they were brittle with tension ethan refused to sit after he dropped his pack and simply looked out over the dark desert his shoulders hunched his face gloomy his body shivering slightly from the long hours of exertion raven sat slumped forward and pressed into the pack on her lap her hair falling around her face like a cowl daniels muscles were so tired that he watched his thighs tremble tendons jumping under his skin like snakes it was amaya who again broke the traumatized silence i think we should talk about tucker she said no one answered again if we dont we arent going to make it ethan turned his arms around himself what about tucker our guilt what guilt that were alive and hes dead we dont know for sure that hes dead and it was his decision to be the rear guard not guilt raven interrupted fear she hadnt looked up and the voice seemed to come from deep inside her as if issuing from a cave that well all end up like him you mean dead ethan said she didnt reply we know we shouldnt have let him stay behind alone amaya persisted we shouldnt she stopped sighing hopelessly have built a bomb daniel guessed amaya looked away if you hadnt wed all be dead or worse he said you didnt take tuckers life you saved ours we were in a pretty desperate situation we still are because we threw away our means of escape raven amended hollowly still not looking up her voice exhausted used it like a rock to hit someone the rebuke irritated him your means of escape he said it bitterly after you let me be lowered into a trap you knew was about to be sprung thats not fair ethan told daniel sullenly she didnt know what this little irate friend of yours would do until it was too late wed met as a group and agreed as a group that she and i would go and its no secret why you might prefer to leave the activator behind you threw it all away because he stopped in frustration because weve never been a group and never truly agreed raven has been setting us up from the beginning and so have you never telling us our true situation until the last minute and using us like game pieces to get you back home you turned us against each other you turned ico tuckers almost certainly dead youve made a goddamned mess of the whole situation and now you can just sit in the middle of it like we have to we walk to the coast or stay in australia together thats unfair ethan shouted youd already be dead without us daniel i was trying to help you raven added with a groan help you get back where you could do some good why he challenged her why what her reply was weary why get back why are you trying to achieve what united corporations obviously doesnt encourage our return what if your bosses are right raven what if i really belong here what if you belong here dont be absurd rugard belongs here not me not us why are you even here raven i had a mission i wanted to see no you didnt its for the best daniel its always for the best i believe in them its all i have to believe in i was going soft and getting confused and so by checking the pilots fate and getting the electronics id prove myself and either be confirmed in my mission or abandon it im being tested just like you the problem is youve turned a test into torture were more than a thousand miles from where we need to be are we raven looked at him with exasperation yes its a long walk to the beach what if this is where we need to be what do you mean amaya asked what if we dont get back ever could we make a life here find meaning here in that lunatics prison raven scoffed no not there not even here exactly but in australia there have to be more habitable places than this on the continent if people truly lived here what if we could find one of them and start over havent you had enough privation and savagery yet there have to be ruins we could use for salvage new adventurers arriving with needed skills maybe we could turn the tables on united corporations and stay by choice creating a new colony as radical as america was or the old australia it could be the utopia they pretended they were sending us to wed start over but we wouldnt make the mistakes they made lives would have more meaning wed always be asking why instead of how much stay in this wilderness stay for what i came for to truly live life she looked at him in wonder youve gone insane havent you you didnt throw the activator away you thrust it away youve burned our ships so we cant turn back like cortes in mexico you havent learned a thing by coming here ive learned to keep asking why youre the one who taught me that raven looked hopelessly out across the desert i dont think i see what you seem to see out here now youll have time to she took that as a challenge no i wont and by the time we get to the coast youll be begging to come back with me great ethan muttered watching the two of them i said hell be begging ethan i didnt say id take him for the first time she allowed a slight smile hes unreliable unpredictable he looked at her wryly he was mad as hell but he still wanted her the talking had helped somehow codependent amaya corrected it was true as frustrated as they were with each other they were forcibly linked and shared a simple goal to get to the coast everything else could be set aside perhaps beg you to take me back now daniel grinned and give up this he gestured toward their bed of sand i dont think so they slept at the end of the third day they came to the road it was a ribbon of broken asphalt vegetation erupting from its cracked surface like green pimples its course was broken entirely in places by washouts or drifting dunes such disrepair meant the highway was impassable to any vehicle short of a tractor but it was still a startling piece of linear regularity running north and south as far as they could see the australians had come this way in roaring trailer trucks or whispering solar cars there would be towns on such a road empty and ghostly yes but still the ruins of communities and maybe water there might be faded signs rusted wrecks fallen ropes of copper wire and fiber optic cable sheathed in rubber a junkyard of delights it was funny how fabulous and yet foreign such detritus sounded after weeks in the wilderness the technological litter of a lost world the fugitives paused a minute dazed by the familiar paved firmness beneath their boots a goanna lizard lazily sunning itself on the radiant macadam a hundred yards away here was a path to somewhere wed better not use it raven said why not ethan asked after stone and sand the highway looked marvelously easy and the idea of looking for useful scraps of technology appealed to him because if they come after the transmitter this road would be the most obvious place to look wed make better time on the road theyd make better time too besides it goes the wrong way amaya said north and south if an edge to the cone exists it should be east the country is supposed to get better that way its gotten worse ethan said maybe thats because we havent really come that far she countered a few hundred miles at best it takes a while to see a difference on foot ethan looked morosely out at the desert i hope youre right at least we can use the road like a river to throw off pursuit said daniel water erases scents a bloodhound can follow and pavement erases footprints lets follow it a ways until we find a rocky area and then strike east that should discourage anyone from following they did as he suggested walking north two miles until they came to a stony ridge that led east they left the road there taking care not to make any mark after three miles on the ridge they dropped into an adjacent gully and dug successfully for water then pushed on within hours the road had faded in memory like a mirage the gully petered out so they kept walking east across undulating sand their pace was less anxious now reaching the road had become some kind of psychological milestone relaxing their fear of recapture by confirming they were getting someplace the highway seemed likely to confuse rugard if he ever bothered to come this far and it was clear theyd outpaced him it also promised that there were more remnants of civilized australia somewhere ahead still they walked into the night again to put as many miles behind them as possible before finally camping measurement again daniel thought because theyd met other humans their camp was dark and cheerless there were no tents and no stoves now they had no wood for a fire and dared not light one anyway instead they ate a few more mouthfuls of cold food and collapsed into sleep daniel woke to find himself cuddled tightly against raven instinctively theyd crept together in the chill of the night his chin was on her hair and his cock embarrassingly hard against the small of her back the instinct startled him gently he sidled his hips away from her and she shifted blinked and slowly came awake if shed noticed his unconscious state she gave no sign she glanced sleepily over her shoulder at him as if bemused and then got up quickly and moved away to prepare for the days journey amaya had cuddled into ethan they ate quickly chattering a bit more now their mood still tense but improved by their distance from erehwon at least they were alive and the transmitter that remained gave them purpose maybe the worst was behind them everyone was still tired but the exhaustion of the first day of their escape had slowly been pushed back in a few more days they would look for an oasis to stop for complete recuperation meanwhile they were still pushing hard due east as near as they could judge it their higher spirits didnt last long the walking became progressively tougher the domination of sand was mounting and they realized they were entering utter desert not just arid scrubland but the edge of a sea of sandy dunes red and sinuous each dune ran north and south as far as the eye could see and crest followed crest in a succession to the eastern horizon it was like looking across an ocher ocean walking became increasingly laborious because level ground had disappeared they trudged up the face of dunes that seemed twice as high as they really were because of the tendency to slip backward gained the crest and then slid awkwardly down the other side any breeze was absent in the hot hollows vegetation had disappeared and water seemed never to have fallen their boots clothes nostrils and mouths were all irritated by sand by early afternoon even amaya was ready to call a halt they stood on one of the tallest dunes yet a fiftyfoothigh drumlin and felt like shipwrecked sailors adrift on a sea of sand the desert looked endless we cant cross this amaya admitted we dont have enough water maybe ico was right daniel speculated it does seem to get drier not wetter the farther east we go maybe outback adventure lied to us about that too no it gets better near the coast raven said they told me why do you believe anything they say because theyve made a better world than this one come on raven were you really happy there happiness is a luxury i was useful well survival isnt a luxury ethan said the plain truth is that we really dont know anything nothing useful thats whats going to kill us the plain truth is that essentially were lost so what do we do daniel asked go back to the road to go where he thumped the transmitter theyd taken turns carrying it like a baby we need to go that way if you want to use this raven was looking back westward uneasily a growing wind from that direction blowing back the fan of her hair the horizon was hazy the place theyd come from losing all distinction maybe our decision has been made for us the others turned rugard amaya asked anxiously no raven pointed at the dark cloud swelling there where we need to go right now is off this crest to some kind of shelter shelter from what from that they looked to where she was pointing and realized it was difficult to tell where the land stopped and the sky began i think a sandstorm is coming the storm rose over them like a rustcolored cliff its edge a shadowing overhang the highest tendrils of dust sprinted ahead of the main wall of sand like outrunners pushed by hot winds up high the fugitives sprinted over the dunes back the way theyd come retracing their own footprints until they reached a rocky ledge a half kilometer away that erupted through the dunes like an exposed root the sandstone had no cave or hollow but did offer a rib of stability among the soughing sands something to anchor to they skidded down to its base shed their packs and crouched waiting the sky got darker and darker and we paid to come here ethan said i didnt raven replied the tempest curled over them like a breaking wave and then broke with dark fury its shriek ended all conversation filling their ears with a kind of rasping static the sand stung like needles and blotted out their sight they hugged the broken rock and each other wincing at the abrasion and struggling for breath their clothes snapped like flags while their hollow offered some shelter the fold of ground also confused the wind so that sand blasted at them from all directions swirling and pricking more sand sluiced off the crest of the outcrop raining down on them like a dry shower periodically they struggled upward pulling their packs with them to avoid being drifted in by the blowing grains the adventurers gagged for breath through rags hastily tied around their heads like makeshift bandannas it felt like they were suffocating in an eerie red twilight no inch of them was free of grit then the worst of the onslaught was over almost as suddenly as it had come the wind dropped abruptly as the front of the storm blew on the sand fell out but the air remained filled with lighter dust a swirling orange fog shakily they stood and untangled themselves heaving off accumulated sand with a twist of their backs the dark mass of the storm swept eastward the desert behind it seeming to smoke they were left looking like clay statues coated from hair to boot ethan spat trying to clear his mouth of grit i want my money back raven the others laughed i want every red cent with interest its a small price to come alive amaya replied for her shaking herself like a dog though i wish it would buy me a shower dont say that daniel warned youll bring the damn floods back id say were about due for a forest fire ethan corrected glancing about with mock trepidation not to mention locusts earthquakes tornadoes and a tsunami wave let me check the itinerary he pretended to thumb through a brochure i cant believe people really lived here raven said heat flies dust see this is what im talking about daniel this is the alternative united corporations is big and impersonal and bureaucratic and routine but it also saves us from squalor its understandable to be romantic about the outdoors sure but this is the reality no it isnt he spat trying to clear his mouth of dust this is no more representative of wilderness than a slum is of civilization this desert is the reality you sent people to but australians didnt live here they lived somewhere else so could we not comfortably spiritually contentedly earnestly were redheads raven amaya shouted to interrupt the arguing swirling her hair so a plume of dust shot off it outback chic hey the others put their arms up against the flying grit amaya twirled away from them dancing along the rock wall and narrowly dodging an unstable dribble of sand that drained downward it was a relief to get away from those two she came to a corner laughing giddily as she rounded it and then stopped as if shed hit a glass wall okay glamour girl daniel called which way now slowly amaya backed up and lifted her arm to point past the corner of the cliff her voice was quiet but it carried clearly in the dryness of the nowstill air lets ask him the newcomer was as shrouded in dust as they were he strode along the base of the outcrop in long skidding strides that sent his tattered range coat flapping the stranger had fled to the outcrop for shelter as they had daniel realized and was as surprised as they were at this meeting but not intimidated their huddled manner reassured him and he marched ahead his cracked lips widening in gritty welcome now look what the wind blew in he looked at them with bright dark eyes from beneath a greasy bush hat some of the good ones id venture gday to the mud people then do you recognize him daniel asked ethan quietly no i dont think hes with the warden the man squinted at ethan im not with anybody mate though im wondering where the likes of you are coming from that always wants to be with me for a long time nothing then people here people there i spies on more than ever spy on me christ bloody crowded its getting i come out here to get away from them all and still i meet you we drop out of the sky ethan said dryly well you brought a lot of dirt with you this time didnt you the man replied squinting up at an atmosphere still brown from dust who are you raven asked he considered why oliver i think who are you my name is raven oliver is what i remember though to a pretty lady like yourself just ollie i suppose im the proprietor the what the owner the inheritor this land is mine by right of first possession so dont get any ideas now i dont care how damn many of you there are daniel glanced at ethan this one had been in the sun too long amaya was looking thoughtful you didnt come with outback adventure did you ollie outback what and youre not a convict either not a moralimpaired he straightened himself up as straight as a ruler missy i believe in the law so where did you come from he looked impatient now thats what your kind never understands i didnt come from nowhere im just here on walkabout you see walkabout the aborigines did it raven said quietly sort of like a native american spirit quest go out alone into the wilderness to wander and survive and find a spirit magic like the old prophets said daniel like us said ethan no not like you oliver objected youre no abo i can tell me ive got some of the blood i can hear the old ones when the wind blows heard em just now how long have you been on walkabout oliver raven asked he shrugged all my life do you remember the time before the dying before the plague when there were cars buildings other people he looked troubled i dream it sometimes thats what i look for missy not that ive ever found it great god ethan whispered hes a damned survivor somehow hes immune raven nodded at oliver encouragingly and have you ever looked to the east ever looked where the sun comes up he turned to look in that direction his eyes bright in dark hollows under the dust like the mask of a raccoon his stubble beard gritty his body overclothed in the vagrant manner of someone who had no other way of carrying his belongings a bit no different than here their spirits sank unless you go to the wet part hard walking some of that too many trees raven brightened youve been there oh yes ive been everywhere have to when youre the only one could you take us there she pointed what across the sand are you crazy missy she looked confused this is the bloody desert right no water here wed die we go out there he looked at them as if they were daft where then she asked in despair up to the mountains the way i was going he said impatiently then east you can find water up there along the ranges their smiles cracked their dustcovered faces in an eruption of hope ollie were lost raven said carefully can you show us the way to the mountains show us how to get east east he considered a moment scratching his beard why east of course then again why not i could go that way i suppose whats east i wonder he squinted at them eh what in the devil makes it so important to go that way our home ollie were lost and we want to get home home ah well thats what im looking for too chapter twentythree they turned north following the sinuous line of the dunes the walking was easier now that they could march along the sandy crests and their guide however strange boosted their spirits oliver pointed out the occasional track of an insect or lizard across the sand that suggested the dunes were not quite as sterile as they seemed still when the sand gave way to a more familiar hard and arid plain rocky and thorny and spotted with stunted trees and shrubs the adventurers greeted the transition with relief here at least was something green a day later they began to cross stony ridges running east to west a change in topography that broke the outbacks monotonous flatness they could visually measure progress as oliver had promised springs were easier to find at the base of these outcrops finally they came to a more imposing ridge about a thousand feet high the range was the worn polished nub of oncegreat mountains the surviving sedimentary layers sculpted into battlements so shiny that they seemed to sweat touch confirmed the rock was as dry as old enamel however the adventurers began following the base of the range camping in gaps where intermittent floods had cut passageways as direct and level as a highway these canyons were shaded by gum and acacia trees without quite realizing it the group fell into a new rhythm during the first couple of weeks in australia daniels whole body had been sore from unfamiliar exertion the ground had been hard and lumpy his neck had bent at unfamiliar angles in sleep his feet constantly ached and his muscles had stiffened now the miles seemed routine to a body that had become leaner and harder the adventurers had far less gear than when theyd arrived in australia and were more comfortable despite that or perhaps because of it their load was lighter and their tasks simpler the ground had become a familiar bed and the open sky a familiar roof bird calls a fold of land the march of insects or a change in vegetation could all theyd learned direct them to water alert and more familiar in their surroundings they found the daily search for food to be easier as well fruitbearing plants had become recognizable and their skill as hunters was growing oliver proved an apt teacher sometimes he would disappear for a day or two and reappear with game but at other times he would take one of the party with him and patiently point out animal sign demonstrate a quiet stalking or bring down prey with a wellaimed throwing stick or rock he taught his new companions to follow the tracks of the sluggish bluetongued lizard an easy kill and to recognize wild onion bush cucumber and pigweed seed oliver carried nothing but what he wore picking up and discarding sticks rocks or scrap to use as tools when he needed he seemed not only to understand animals but to be half animal himself and his wild casual freedom struck the others as both enviable and disturbing is this what they could become with the absence of seasonings their mouths were becoming sensitive to a more subtle palate they found they could take more pleasure in the dribble of a fruits juice the smoky energy of cooked meat or the chewy nuttiness of roasted seeds they never had enough to feast theyd gotten used to in fact a daily rhythm of hunger pangs before the evening meal something almost entirely unfamiliar in their lives back home but they were finding enough food to live on and keep moving after a rain they hunted for yalka bulbs roasting them to release their nutty flavor they dreamed of richer foods of course sugarbut subsisted on what they had raven who had expected to escape this experience and who instead had been forced to share it remained stiff with the others she was both the potential means to escape and a representative of the system that had stuck them in australia and their feelings toward her were confused she was angry at daniel for making a hard situation more difficult by losing the activator worrying aloud that rugard could still hunt them down before they could get back yet she also seemed to adapt to the wild with relative ease suggesting her attitude in the tunnels had not been entirely an act she was not squeamish about killing and cleaning game displayed endurance and had an emotional resiliency that warded off despair daniel tried to joke about their plight one evening ive had to check into hell throw away the activator and walk a thousand miles to get another date with you raven you seem to be doing quite well he was watching her skin and cook a rabbit the smoke and roasting meat mingling with the scent of eucalyptus he felt strangely content the convicts had been left behind tomorrow was simply tomorrow and life was no longer a set of deadlines and meetings and pressures did she feel what he felt she looked at him skeptically when i told you i was a cheap date this isnt exactly what i had in mind it isnt so bad though is it isnt this the kind of freedom we talked about in the tunnels she sat back on her haunches using a forearm to brush her hair out of her eyes i never said it was bad thats why i wasnt very guilty about sending people here but this is a fantasy land daniel this is recess our little party has hundreds of square miles to live on because were the only people here but australia cant work for the rest of the planet the only thing that can work for so many billions of people is obedience the only thing that can work is united corporations she looked out across the dusky desert its best that most people never see this it would only confuse them but dont you feel the rightness of this for the first time i feel like im in a place where i belong humans were born in country like this the savanna exactly you do and i dont normal people dont i miss my machines i miss my security even if it deadens the spirit poverty and strife and fear are even more deadening i told you we came from different experiences the companies took me in as a child after my father died and my mother broke down they schooled me trained me and finally convinced me i had to help sustain what they stood for and i wanted to im not blind daniel im not immune to the beauty of this place im not unconscious of the fate of some of the exiles i just dont see this as a realistic option and i dont appreciate your sticking me here by throwing the activator at ico as we didnt appreciate being sent here without the full truth she shrugged okay were even so dont try to get me to endorse what you volunteered for and i didnt camping is fun only if you get to go home at the end she wouldnt look at him as they ate their rabbit he glanced at amaya and she looked away from him too well he couldnt blame her for that still his optimistic mood wouldnt leave him i like this daniel tried again with ethan the next day as they trudged along the other man glanced around wondering what he was talking about i like being here and just going daniel continued the simplicity of it mindless fulfilling im just doing what im supposed to do but not trying to do any more like an animal im content i mean youre going someplace animals dont do that migratory ones do humans must have started like this wandering out of africa until we wandered all over the earth nomads drifters its why this seems right i think except eventually humans settled down said ethan they got hungry and had kids and invented agriculture then came civilization with tyranny and war and medicine and art daniel smiled thats why men are torn i think between settling down and moving on theres this yin and yang in our brain that comes from all of human history the nomad versus the farmer but what if farming was a wrong turn what if thats the underlying story of genesis how people turned away from the garden of the natural world to the temptation of our artificial one the tree of knowledge if we hadnt bitten the apple thered be no genesis no bible and no gutenberg press to tell us about eden ethan countered this isnt us not really daniel civilization is ive changed my mind about being out here i was a gadget freak and quite frankly i miss my gadgets they were my toys i like logic regularity and predictability and all those things seem in short supply out here so to me the challenge isnt surviving without civilization its learning from the wild and bringing that experience back to make civilization better you sound like outback adventure first we believed everything they told us and then we believed nothing im just wondering if some of what they said is really true in a deeper sense than they intended so what are you going to do if we get back ethan sighed i dont know my worry is ill end up not feeling i fit in either place or will be on the run as an underground outlaw maybe i could make a life here but not like oliver not like an animal id want to build back some of what i had and strike a compromise he looked at amaya walking ahead find someone to build with the dusty ragged and unkempt members of rugard sloans expedition of recovery as hed grandly decided to call it although it was more like a lynch mob in mood and moral development almost tiptoed along the blacktop road in wonder pavement a small thing but as fervently appreciated in this trackless wilderness as an exercise yard in a prison compound here was evidence of past civilization of destination possibility somewhere over the horizon were ruined cities and salvageable luxuries somewhere over the horizon was ravens electronic key to getting out of this whole sorry mess and because of that the hardened bitter inmates of erehwon ran up and down the skin of asphalt like excited children clucking over the road as if it were an open gate in a coop of fenced chickens the reaction made rugard slightly uneasy his followers were angry yes for the slaughter in the canyon they were set on getting back what the bitch had stolen if it meant even the slightest chance of escape from this continental hell and hed told them that raven held the key to getting back but at erehwon his rule was the only possibility in leading them out into the desert rugard had made possible the danger that some of them might actually begin to think hed have to drive hard to discourage that what drove him was not just the desire to break out of this unwalled prison but to revenge himself on the urban smartasses who had run away rugard hated their type these wealthy urbanites who came here hated their manner their unconscious superiority their naivete their indignant outrage their privilege their whining and their clumsy helplessness how well he knew their kind it mattered little to him that they were stuck in australia as he was they were of the same class of arrogant bastards who had imprisoned him the same class that had held him down all his life quietly sneering at him ignoring him jailing him always trying to crush him he was better than they were smarter tougher now theyd done it again humiliating him in his own home and the possibility they might escape was so maddening he couldnt rest until he hunted them down yet raven and her accomplices had a long head start because of the time it had taken rugard to assemble supplies saddle the camels pressed into service to help carry them sharpen the weapons and muster resolve some of his inmates had balked at following the fugitives at all the warden had reacted swiftly making clear the necessity of fearing him more than they feared the desert you can stay with the ants then hed growled burying one of those who hesitated to his scrawny neck and squeezing fruit pulp over his screaming head rugard had waited until the insects had eaten out the mans eyes and hed begged for death and then ordered him dug up alive his head pitted and bleeding with bites a bandage had been wrapped around the victims empty sockets and hed been brought stumbling along a reminder of the consequences of disobedience or hesitation infection swelling the mans face like a balloon the lesson had been salutary the warden judged still the thieves were far ahead and the expedition of recovery needed help if it was to catch up they needed an advantage rugard looked with dislike at ico washington kneeling on the pavement with a battered map spread before him the weasel was oily and obsequious and slyly mocking no wonder his former superiors had encouraged the little toad to run off to this wasteland the warden couldnt wait to get rid of ico himself still the man was convinced his piece of paper might give them a chance even though to rugard it looked like the kind of fantasy chart that fools bought from liars well did they come this way ico squinted upward obviously we dont know if i were them id stay off the roads to avoid contact with groups like us but this highway could be the break we need if we follow it we might be able to get ahead of them the road goes north and south not east you said theyd go east ico nodded they must to use the transmitter but look here if this map is correct this road must join an eastrunning one a few hundred miles north of here we can make twice the time on graded pavement that they can crosscountry ill bet we follow these highways get ahead of them and throw out a net near the coast theyll be lulled into complacency by then we find them get the transmitter back and escape that will take months the alternative is to rot like savages and that could take years almost imperceptibly the country began to change as the quintet of adventurers hiked eastward it rained a couple times hard but not torrential and that eased both their minds and the search for water so did the ecology the vegetation was getting denser as they traveled changing from deadlooking desert scrub to savanna bush the trees were fuller and grew closer together the grass clumps were less separated it was still dry country with empty rivers and starched sky and conical red clay termite mounds that jutted from the soil like dented dunce caps but for the first time since theyd landed in australia the continent seemed to be getting greener there was no hint of the sea but their spirits improved with the health of the landscape oliver half led and half tagged along both guide and pet it was difficult to get any kind of clear history out of him he must have been a child when the sickness hit and probably lost a piece of his mind when he watched a whole nation dying around him yet hed survived from some inexplicable immunity and been wandering ever since he was skittish as if he might take it into his head to drift off at any minute but he wasnt difficult to travel with content to mostly walk by himself muttering at rocks and whistling at birds hed periodically demonstrate some bush skill or disappear to come back with fresh meat occasionally hed hang on them like a dog as if he took periodic comfort from human company the next day hed walk and sit and sleep apart he displayed little curiosity about the modern world theyd come from and ate by himself squatting on his haunches he smelled rank but efforts to get him to wash were rebuffed and perhaps he had a point even the insects kept their distance among the other four awkwardness persisted raven sulked daniel felt alternately fulfilled and at a loss and amaya seemed wounded she reacted to ethans attempts at quiet conversation with gratitude but seemed cautious about striking up a real relationship shed obviously had a crush on dyson and daniel still seemed smitten with raven whod led him on only the journey held them all together so they walked and talked of daytoday things but their feelings were temporarily corraled lest they threaten survival until one evening when ethan approached amaya as she took a turn gathering firewood whats with daniel and raven he groused she sighed what do you mean they sidle around each other like gunfighters i feel like im at a bad dinner party of a dissolving marriage theyre just in love she said it morosely he looked at the two cooking silently by the fire already started raven unhappily avoiding eye contact one of them maybe its both ethan theyre also mad at each other for a while they were sleeping like spoons until they werent so exhausted that they could start thinking about it now theyre like repelling magnets serves them right to shiver i like sleeping next to you she didnt reply she knew he wanted more but youre edgy around me in the daytime dont you like me amaya she straightened at that a forearm full of firewood and looked levelly at him she didnt answer i like you i like how youre smart i like talking about building things with you she frowned i like being with you here she handed him the firewood and marched back to the campfire ethan followed oliver looked up with interest sensing she intended to make an announcement indeed amaya now stopped and drew herself up i think that now we need to talk about ico raven and daniel looked at her curiously behind her ethan looked confused what he said in surprise i think there are a lot of things being unsaid here that we should talk out amaya went on to help the group what things daniel asked warily well amaya looked at them each in turn ico betrayed us but we have to decide whether were willing to forgive him if we dont theres going to be this poison there was a moments uneasy silence i dont forgive the little bastard ethan said dumping the firewood onto the ground if he hadnt run to rugard i wouldnt be fleeing here through the bush yeah daniel agreed screw ico whos ico oliver inquired a former friend amaya told the australian we didnt trust him she turned to the others so why should he have trusted us what are you talking about you didnt trust him to take the pack and come back for us when we were dying of thirst daniel remember we didnt trust him to represent us back home he was the one who most wanted to go and we all said no thats because hes this weird little blowhard ethan scoffed sitting down on a rock disgustedly amaya looked at him reprovingly but he just returned her stare and what difference does it make if we do forgive him daniel added hes not even here she looked at the men impatiently as if they were particularly dense because i think theres a lot of anger people are bottling up thats getting in the way of other things jesus christ feelings women wouldnt let them lie raven said nothing for example amaya persisted your anger toward raven he glanced at her its not me who is angry with her isnt it you blame her for putting you here daniel you dont really trust her but shes right we came here ourselves amaya ethan objected and ravens angry with you if you hadnt been so damned attractiveshe said it with exasperation shed never have gotten confused about what she was doing and never been assigned to australia and then you throw away her means of escape i think you were trying to punish her i was trying to get away from this ico you want me to forgive and who was coming at me with a sword his look was stubborn im just trying to let raven experience what she sends other people to no youre in love with her and couldnt stand to have her leave you you dont know that and she was so guilty about sending you here that she came herself amaya raven groaned were not going to get comfortable until everyone sorts their feelings out well youre certainly getting your feelings out daniel grumped he turned to raven is that true she looked embarrassed im here on a mission dont flatter yourself why didnt you tell me things from the beginning her look was sullen because you wouldnt understand you couldnt handle the truth of things you still cant what does that mean she looked away he knew what it meant youre just so damn difficult to talk to half the time raven was suddenly furious only because you wont listen she glared at the group did it ever occur to any of you that maybe i tried to save him when he wouldnt save himself that he didnt listen to me and that i never expected to have to deal with all of you when i came out here im just trying to get back daniel scoffed save me how about making a damn fool out of me she glared at him wounded and in pain then she sprang up and bolted into the bush the men were uncomfortably silent for a moment go after her you dolt amaya finally advised quietly sadly he looked up at her and for just a moment a look of longing flickered in her eyes forgive her forgive yourself and move on to what youre meant to do dusk was falling as daniel followed raven as hed once followed her running down an urban street it was easy to track her now a sandy footprint here a broken twig there she was climbing up the ridge theyd been following making for a rocky outcrop that would provide a view in every direction he half trotted to catch up with her breathing anxiously the oily perfume of australia beguiling as he sucked it into his lungs he saw her form ahead like a slim phantom disappearing in the shadow of an overhang and then rematerializing as a silhouette along the crest of the ridge rocks skittered out from the feet of both of them and she heard him once and turned but she didnt stop and didnt call just kept moving upward as elusive as hope the sky was a vast blue bowl its color deepening with approaching night australia lay around them in a shadowy panorama its reds having faded to cobalt there were no lights no roads no memory of civilization it was the dawn of time the crest of the ridge was a dragons back a series of short pinnacles like the plates of a dinosaur for a moment he thought hed missed her in the shadow of one or that to avoid him shed doubled back and slipped down to camp but then he saw her ahead at the uppermost peak alone under the first stars she was sitting hunched knees pulled up to her chest on a shelf of timesmoothed rock that was slick but dry and still radiating heat from the days sun a full moon was cresting the horizon it was orange and huge an autumn lantern and it threw enough warm light to illuminate the profile of her body and the architecture of her face her features had the same polished fineness of the rock immaculate and tan her eyes large and dark as she looked sorrowfully out across the grass and scrub plain her back was bent the pattern of her spine visible against the tightness of her tattered cotton shirt and her breasts swelled where they were pushed against her thighs her slim arms holding her knees her black hair was tied with the scrap of a leather shoelace to fall toward her waist a withered flower shed picked earlier in the day was still tucked into the knot she was the most beautiful creature daniel had ever seen a nemesis who was vulnerable lonely she heard his footsteps behind her go away he ignored that kneeling at her back please just leave me alone she said wearily its too hard he touched her shoulders she stiffened daniel just let it be he ignored her protests he held her by her shoulders and bent to kiss her rigid cheek wet with tears then her neck and then he let his lips drift up to her ear amayas right i think i do love you raven he whispered daniel she groaned im sorry i havent said it i was angry because its true i came to australia because of you but not because you tricked me thats what ive been thinking about and what ive had to admit to myself it was because you were the one thing in life i could decide i wanted after a lifetime of not knowing what to want so i came to the outback on a million to one shot that id find you and somehow break through to you that i could somehow convince you to love me like i love you he kissed her cheek and then her neck again and again descending to her shoulder she remained rigid you cant you cant convince me he stopped and took a breath determined now i came because there was something in you that hit me with instant recognition when i met you some part of you that i recognized in myself i knew you raven or im going to know you in some past life or some future one thats what i thought way back in the city i couldnt forget you the only reason i havent been able to forgive you is because i couldnt forgive myself i couldnt forgive wasting so much of my life going after the wrong things i blamed you for me but when i climb up these rocks and look out at the wilderness in all its timeless size and beauty i realize how conceited such unforgiveness is were both so microscopic we counted for nothing at united corporations and we count for nothing here were nothing except to each other to each other we count for everything he reached up to touch her face and turn her to him her eyes wet bending to kiss her fully on the lips and then she thrust him away no dont do this to me raven i count for something daniel i count in that world because i believe in it youre a dangerous man daniel dyson dangerous to them and dangerous to me so im going to leave you here abandon you in australia while i go back and let them decide what your fate should be they put you here they dont deserve your loyalty and i dont deserve yours please dont complicate things with this love of yours because i dont need it i dont need it from anyone you know you do she rolled away from him and kneeled looking at him intently look i need you to help get me out from under the cone do that first do that for me and then ill decide where to go or what to do or how to live my life then and only then when i have a true choice am i going to decide my why chapter twentyfour as the land grew more hospitable the fugitives began to encounter ruins that seemed both reassuring and disturbing the decaying structures proved that humans had lived here and presumably could again they also warned of the impermanence of existence people had not just lived here but lived in comfort with machines and full pantries and regular mail now they were gone their memories weeded over the dented and holed aluminum blades of a windmill came first peeping from the brush near the crumbling remains of its wooden tower the steel water tank it had once fed was ruptured and sinking into dirt that was the same red color as its corrosion when raven touched the metal it flaked like scorched paper five miles farther on they came across the shell of a cattle station the roof of the ranch house long since ripped off by clawing winds and its walls sagging inward with the graceful weariness of old wood the weathered gray of the wreck was spotted by scraps of plastic and metal and glass a disintegrating metal wash tub a faded plastic shampoo bottle a broken frame with no picture there was rusting metal machinery a garden long dead and brushsnarled lengths of old plastic pipe purchased for an irrigation project the plague had not allowed to be completed its funny how fast things go in a bit more than a quarter century daniel remarked people still lived here when i was born and now everything they did has sunk into the desert its interesting how much stuff remains countered ethan metal that doesnt have to be mined plastic that doesnt have to be refined its like a rummage sale there must be huge amounts of salvage in the old cities youre thinking of treasure hunting im thinking how fast a group of people could rebuild things given the kind of junk thats in a place like this i mean if we had to stay here here we are at one farm and weve got enough to make better hunting weapons containers even lumber to make a cabin if we wanted it yes lots to take oliver said old things everywhere but so are the spirits of the old ones the australians everywhere even here cant you hear them he cocked his head to listen to the wind this is their place not ours so its bad luck to take anything from a place like this mate bad bad luck we shouldnt camp here either theyd come to us in the night we have to walk farther on into the bush you believe in ghosts oliver daniel asked i dont have to believe i see them all the time the dead people killed by new things killed by this stuff here he kicked at the machinery i sleep away i sleep where they dont come see them theyre here if you know how to look i agree amaya said as she looked around this old station gives me the creeps i feel like its infectious its just a ranch raven said its a bunch of sad memories amaya said united corporations should document and memorialize this not hide it by sealing off the continent this was genetic tinkering gone too far ordinary people should see this ordinary people cant handle this raven said they wouldnt understand understand that their system is run by blunderers understand that sometimes mistakes are made or sacrifices ordered for societys greater good she was talking about them they knew and sometimes lives are wasted because of venal stupidity and greed daniel countered hed been sour since the previous night ethan was tired of the arguing lets take what we can use on the trek and leave no dont take oliver warned anxiously i think he must have seen people pick up the plague from sifting through stuff early on amaya speculated she put her arms on olivers shoulders and looked him in the eye its all right she said to the australian ive seen the ghosts too and they want to help the living they want the australians to come back his look was puzzled theyre coming back us oliver you daniel ethan me the new australians she did not include raven he looked doubtful but didnt interfere as they took some metal to try to fashion spearheads two glass bottles to carry water and a handful of rusty nails the fact was they couldnt travel with much more the weight wasnt worth the benefit no wonder nomadic warriors used to destroy more than they acquired daniel thought how much could they steal so they walked on heeding olivers advice to camp well away in the bush they joked about it but they were all secretly relieved in the morning that no ghosts had come at night dirt station tracks sometimes led east now when they were encountered the party followed them making good if monotonous time when the crude roads turned a different direction the five of them continued east by striking crosscountry the idea of finding their own way no longer foreign on and on by compass and by sun a ceaseless rhythm the days blurred into weeks and the land became thick with grass the trees taller they realized theyd left the worst desert behind australia was getting greener the first river with actual water in it was like a deliverance the water was brown and the current limpid but by god it flowed a real river they plunged in clothes and all even dragging a reluctant oliver in with them and then shed their clothes and splashed each other like savages the sand cool and yielding between their toes there was no selfconsciousness theyd been together too long besides ethan and amaya sometimes slept away from the others at night and were assumed to be making love raven however stayed on her own side of the fire aloof and unhappy daniel dourly watched her they camped by the river for two days to wash play and recuperate ethan didnt want to leave this is the first time ive really been happy since i crashed in this nightmare he confided to daniel maybe we should just stay here for a while and not get back just take a break whats our hurry im finally having a good time with amaya with the wilderness what i came here for the batteries on those boxes wont last forever raven says maybe a year we have to signal before then if were ever going to warn the world so i have to walk again tomorrow the complaint was a deliberate imitation of a childish whine afraid so mate id rather stay in bed too i hope were getting close to that beach weve found the sand its the ocean were lacking their first hamlet was a place called urandangie according to a weathered sign still hanging by a nail from the one standing corrugated steel wall of a collapsed building it was a desolate portal to civilization most of the tiny town had burned down either in a riot or subsequent brush fire and what remained looked like it had been pillaged broken glass crunched amid the weeds that filled abandoned gravel streets the loneliness was sad testimony to the chaos that must have descended on the continent when its inhabitants realized theyd been abandoned to plague oliver didnt want to pause best to walk on he said they initially agreed with him but at the far edge of the town there was an old garage that looked inhabited there were new boards on its sagging roof inside they saw heaps of collated junk old fabric rusting tools salvaged bottles outside a fire pit smoldered someone lived here but had fled they looked uneasily at the curtain of dusty trees around the building there was a clear sense of being watched do you think it could be the wardens men amaya asked they wouldnt be hiding from us daniel said maybe its others like oliver maybe we should help ourselves to their belongings ethan suggested practically theyll come out then no said raven maybe theyre like us and if we leave it alone theyll know were not stealing she raised her voice come on out were peaceful maybe we can help you there was no answer lets just go ethan said olivers right this place is gloomy no amaya said ravens right we need to help each other i think we should camp here away from their things and wait for them the men looked around the bleak little town and then at oliver theyre here the australian said i can feel them what about the transmitter daniel asked the others we dont say anything about it until weve sized them up raven replied but we might want to invite them along theres safety in numbers there was a small creek nearby and a stack of firewood they built a fire set up camp and settled down to wait the smell of their dinner drifted into the trees their neighbors emerged at dusk it was a man and a woman both holding wooden staffs sharpened like spears they approached cautiously as if daniels group might spring on them at any moment and they looked like the adventurers did dressed in the dusty and faded synthetics they must have been wearing when dropped in the outback their skin was clean and the mans beard neatly trimmed the womans hair was tied back they were making an attempt at normality but strain showed in their faces hungry raven asked there was no reply quiet ethan observed why dont you eat with us daniel offered the couple stood far enough away to bolt who are you the man finally asked warily outback adventurers like you they started at that were just passing through raven added youre the first women ive seen in a long time the female said thats why we came out because youre women but free im raven and this is amaya were going east to exodus port sort of we were told it doesnt exist the man warned and you are daniel inquired peter peter knowles and this is jessica polarski weve had a rough time and learned to be wary of strangers i understand he made introductions of his group and this is oliver he was born here the two newcomers looked in surprise at the tattered australian companion i was always here oliver said proudly this place is mine somehow he survived the plague daniel explained is he your guide sort of he knows a lot of bush craft and we persuaded him to tag along hes a little eccentric but i suppose we are too whats your story peter sighed there were four of us originally we got lost and then in trouble and fell in with a nomad group we thought they were hikers but then they said theres no way to get back and we had to join them except they were convicts thieves murderers it became this bizarre nightmare they said there were morally impaired people being dumped all over australia they killed my friend for his gear and started raping his girlfriend we ran away jessica confessed it was horrible we had to peter added guiltily we hid from everyone we saw raven looked down how long have you been here daniel asked i dont know a few months maybe we wandered for weeks and then this place had water and some shelter its not that we planned to be here we just stopped and havent been able to get started again we dont know where to go how many people are out there anyway we dont know maybe more than we thought were just so confused jessica said daniel nodded so are we come have some dinner the group ate trading brief life histories and then when peter and jessica returned to their garage daniels group talked late into the night in the morning the decision was obvious they asked the couple to join them were told theres no exodus port either daniel explained but we do have a transmitter salvaged from a crashed aircraft that might might be able to call for help if we can reach the ocean it will only work on the coast because of electronic jamming inland the only one theyll take back for sure is raven here why her she was sent by united corporations to bring the instrument back shes one of them daniel looked at her she was now shes one of us he waited to see if shed correct him but she didnt there might be room for ethan too i dont think united corporations will save us but if we can get word out maybe someone in power will want to exploit this scandal back home then somebody might shut australia down and rescue us thats your plan peter sounded skeptical do you have another one he sighed no im just not sure anyone will listen they certainly wont if we dont do our best to bring back word daniel said in the end the couples decision was simple to go with these newcomers offered hope to stay put offered none if helping get this machine to the coast could put a stop to all this its worth whatever it takes to get it there jessica said then well wait for whatever the possibility of getting back still seemed too remote to dare voice amaya smiled encouragingly i dont think we should have to wait for anything she replied when we get there i think we should start building the kind of lives we always wanted to lead by the time we really get back home well have learned what to live for australia continued to unfold ahead of them vast seemingly endless but also steadily changing and ever more intriguingly beautiful the season had pleasantly cooled and they felt more acclimated to living outside than in they came through a region of artfully interspersed rocky knolls and forested valleys and then encountered flatter grasslands and scrub savanna again the continent was becoming a mosaic of landscapes as they traveled their party began to swell adventurers were wandering or camped in this wetter country dazed and fearful and the appearance of a large safe increasingly well armed group with a purpose and destination proved irresistible within two months after fleeing erehwon they numbered eighteen in all seven women and eleven men including a second native australian named angus oliver seemed briefly stunned by this aboriginal competition for ownership and then embraced his countryman like a longlost brother the two continued to share their survival skills and the others pooled information it was beginning to feel like a pilgrimage or a migration the original quartet enjoyed the company of these newcomers but also privately talked nostalgically of the old days of a few weeks before when theyd been on their own angus claimed to recognize some of where they were were nearing the great range that runs north to south he told them and beyond that the sea his promise brought a murmur of excitement the east coast had been everyones goal since departure from civilization it would be something to actually get there the growing group had developed an intense camaraderie it came partly from their nightly sharing of tales of danger and trauma confusion and shame it also came because the group walked ate slept and bathed together and within days newcomers would seem more familiar in camp than had office mates whod occupied an adjacent desk for years in the corporations of home soldiers and pioneers must bond the same way daniel thought the sense of human community was novel strangely missing in the far bigger society of united corporations but while the new recruits were encouraging the logistics of the trek were becoming more complicated there were more people to feed and the noise of their approach drove game animals farther away hunters had to be sent ahead or on the flanks to help bring in food and spot edible plants people were beginning to instinctively specialize hunters to get meat and scout armorers to make weapons and tools and then gatherers cooks menders fire wardens an easygoing youth named rupert volunteered despite inevitable ribbing to each night mark out and dig a latrine lack of sanitation will kill us faster than a wild bull or poisonous snake will he said a flag was fixed to indicate whether the facility was occupied giving some measure of privacy with the added numbers their pace had slowed sometimes the group would camp two or three days to give time to hunt treat skins cook more ambitious meals sleep heal blisters repair clothes and socialize the delay worried raven who feared the warden might still be doggedly following but daniel believed theyd left the convicts far behind how could they be found again in this immensity the party did encounter a small gang of other wandering convicts one afternoon but the predators fled from the sight of their greater numbers the experience boosted their confidence surely they were safe and they needed the rest from the relentless walking it gave people time to bond the dire nature of their predicament seemed to push people instinctively to friendship flirtation commitment and experimentation as a result the group bubbled sparked and occasionally boiled over with sexual chemistry as partners tried each other and then split back apart its like a cross between a soap opera and the oregon trail daniel concluded one night to ethan this is so different than what i expected australia would be back when i planned to trek with just three friends if we find many more companions were going to have to start calling you the warden ethan replied there was no formal leader but the new recruits deferred to the direction of the initial group and its promise of having the magic to call for help unexpectedly daniel found himself making more and more of the decisions there was something about him people responded to even ethan as if he knew what to do even raven noticed it she said he was becoming more like her god i hope not daniel now said of the warden jibe but thats a problem with bigger numbers isnt it rules weve got enough people now to make a real community on the coast while we wait for whatever ethan let his finger wave vaguely at the sky but it does pose organizational problems i told you we were naturals for civilization cant we do better this time thats the test isnt it ethan stirred the coals of the fire his voice low what will we do different when we do settle down to wait how will we make decisions i dont know daniel said i just want to let people keep a sense of identity instead of only identifying with their company or agency or our new tribe maybe theres room here to do that at least we seem to have eluded the convicts i cant believe rugard would still be following maybe he never left erehwon or if he did were going to break clear of the cone so soon that his pursuit will become academic ethan glanced around i hope they hadnt told the newcomers about the warden and didnt want to they didnt want rugard to become a new bogeyman seeming to hide behind every tree weve been meandering for months i dont think we could find ourselves not unless he knows something we dont the convict had been nicknamed wrench for the things he did to peoples arms and legs when they didnt meet their obligations on time here in the outback his size had won him leadership of one of rugards scouting parties as such he was drowsing in the shade of a ridgecrest eucalyptus lazy but mentally restless hed thought it lunacy when the warden had ordered them to chase the outback marks across the desert and greater lunacy when that smartmouthed toad called ico had led the expedition of recovery off on highways that seemed to go in the wrong direction even assuming the fugitives werent already dead birds pecking out their eyes five hundred kilometers back what chance did they have of intercepting them on the other side of australia but ico the psycho a nickname hed inevitably been tagged with his shrill protests assuring it would stick had insisted that he could lead the wardens men to a point ahead of the fugitives ico had predicted that terrain and old roadways might push them in this direction toward a pass in what his dogeared oftridiculed map called the great dividing range of australia the convicts believed the little bastard not because they thought he was really right but because there was nothing else to believe actually the journey hadnt been too bad theyd found some wanderers to rob shortening their own necessary search for food and some women to forcibly enlist into what rugard had jokingly dubbed their cohort of joy theyd found wild cows and pigs and goats to hunt as they went east whole rivers of clean water and plagueemptied buildings to sleep in the truth was ico the psycho had brought them to a far nicer place than theyd come from and whether they found the transmitter or not wrench wasnt about to go back to rugards desert dungeon screw that life was better here but unless he wanted to run off on his own wrench still had to humor the warden by keeping watch for the fugitives it was an easy brainless job but so far it had also been a futile one the convict wished his boss would just give it up and enjoy this greener paradise but rugard had become steadily more obsessed with the transmitter not less turning ever more irritable and vicious so wrench had been posted here for a week waiting for the bitch and her boyfriends to show up he was bored beyond belief except that icos suggestion did have a core of sense there was a pass through the mountains that led down to a big lake with a river canyon below the lake the only easy way across the water was on the crest of the old dam that had created the reservoir anyone passing through came here to the dam and here wrench would wait and wait and wait until the warden tired of the game and called them in wrench somebody coming he groaned if theyre not carrying a damned communications satellite on their back let them pass the convicts had already robbed and killed two nitwits whod stumbled this way he was tired of it let the next ones go by no this is a big group a regular army rivals cursing he rolled upright to look squinting at a group switchbacking down a hillside toward the dam no army but quite a few traveling together why it was peculiar and didnt match the four they were looking for then he looked harder that one there he muttered pointing thats the woman isnt it a slim darkhaired woman strode steadily in the midst of the group raven her name was whered they get all those other people or where did they get her she doesnt look like a captive and i think i recognize some of the others wrench wondered if the scouts on the other side of the canyon wall had stayed awake didnt expect this many but damn signal the others it looks like ico the psycho was right after all he grinned wondering if hed get some kind of reward we got em chapter twentyfive the dam was the most substantive relic of australian civilization that daniels group had seen yet and it was intact the reservoir it had created was full water lapping near the lip of the dam and a small falls poured over the spillway gates at its middle the wedge of concrete was of moderate size its crest two hundred yards long and its downstream face thirty feet high at its middle was a notch thirty yards long where the dam elevation dropped half the height of a man to a set of rusted spillway gates it was here the reservoir water slid to the river below before the plague the spillway gates were routinely opened and closed to control reservoir depth electricity generation and the flow of the river downstream disuse and rust had frozen them shut corrosion eating into the steel to allow a spray of leakage around the gate edges the reservoir had risen enough to top the old gates the outlet water looking orange where it ran down the old steel bridging this sheet of water was an old wooden catwalk connecting one end of the dams concrete crest to the other the dam and its catwalk made a bridge across the waterway its top wide enough for daniels group to begin filing over two by two well this is convenient he remarked to himself leading the way almost too convenient there was a small concrete blockhouse on the western dam crest adjacent to the spillway gates its door had rotted to paper out of curiosity ethan kicked it down and went in wet concrete steps led down in the gloom to a cluster of gigantic gears and levers that had once controlled the spillway gates the electric motors to do so were powerless their electrical cables withered like dead vines amaya poked around the machinery curiously fingering the levers this must be a manual override she said pointing to a large wheel a short flight of wooden steps led up to the catwalk over the spillway daniel told the others to wait mounted the steps and stepped out onto the wooden bridge it creaked and rocked slightly because its posts were slowly rotting but it still looked capable of bearing human weight he looked down at the river below the dam flat and brown flowing north through a thickly forested valley at some point it must turn east through the mountains to the sea maybe they could follow the river to the coast but first to the other bank one at a time he called its pretty wobbly he went across gingerly so far so good one by one the others began to follow those having crossed the creaking catwalk waiting on the eastern half of the dam for the others to catch up the group was evenly split half on either side of the spillway when a rock suddenly sizzled out of the trees on the far bank and hit a recent recruit named ned putnam he grunted in surprise spun and almost went over the lip of the dam before the others caught him everyone crouched in stunned surprise the attack was so unexpected they had difficulty grasping what had happened the trees on the eastern shore hid their attackers ned was down on the concrete cursing it might be broken he hissed holding his shoulder daniel and some others quickly picked up a few random chunks of concrete that had eroded on the crest and others anxiously pointed their spears they felt exposed and vulnerable then three men stepped into sight one letting a sling dangle menacingly from his right hand it was the most ancient of weapons the simple killer that had allowed david to topple goliath a stone was fitted into a long loop of leather twirled around the head to gain momentum and then released with a snap of the wrist if it hit the head it could kill the other two convicts had steeltipped spears crude swords and the same kind of curved throwing sticks the aborigines had once hurled it was a war party the trio were tall bearded ragged streaked with menacing daubs of white mud and confidentlooking not to mention familiar who the hell is that their first recruit peter asked in bewilderment i recognize them from erehwon ethan muttered rugards clan who theres some convicts who know we have the transmitter daniel reluctantly explained we thought wed left them far behind but obviously we didnt peter looked at the trio with alarm weve got the morally impaired after us he asked in disbelief we have to fight for it if we want to get back daniel replied grimly you didnt tell us about this no i hoped we wouldnt have to now we have to decide what to do the three convicts stood shoulder to shoulder at the end of the dam like an impassable wall you left without saying goodbye one of the ominous trio called gallo daniel thought his name was extortionist if memory served bullying or sniveling depending on who he was with the man pointed toward the groaning ned with the tip of his spear so we dispensed with hello as well thats just a warning a warning of what daniel said trying to think as he stalled theres a toll for crossing this particular waterway one stolen transmitter daniel lets rush those bastards ethan growled we outnumber them no were not ready for that he glanced back we havent talked this over and there are a lot of women i dont want to get anyone killed maybe we can find another way around them his group quickly filed back across the catwalk in retreat yet even as they did so four more of rugards men appeared at the other end of the dam the tallest one was easily recognizable his scarred face memorable wrench daniel remembered a brutal enforcer before he came to australia the toll is the same this way too wrench called they were trapped and without cover or room to maneuver on the crest of the dam how the devil did they get ahead of us ethan wondered and behind us and wheres rugard we havent been moving that fast daniel said somehow they guessed where were going maybe ico helped them who knows i was foolish not to hurry but i thought theyd have given up by now why would they give up weve got the only way back ethans tone was gloomy what are we going to do a woman named iris asked plaintively she was looking from one end of the dam to the other daniel was silent thinking raven came up out of the gearhouse rugards goons are here he told her quietly its your transmitter your ticket home and these peoples lives do you want to fight for it or not she glanced around quickly taking in the situation better hurry before the warden gets here gallo shouted the toll goes up then if we give it up and rugard uses it hell simply disappear amaya warned the world will never know whats happening here or believe him even if he tells but we didnt tell these people about this danger daniel added the others had clustered around its a terrible place for a battle raven shook her head i cant ask you to fight so i can get back damn right the injured ned said it wasnt right not to tell us about this i didnt want to worry anyone daniel said youve had worries enough no one said anything well its a group choice he went on we can give up the transmitter they considered that finally ned sighed and spoke up again his voice strained from the pain in his shoulder daniel you werent right for not trusting us with the full story but im also tired of being picked on by men like these these are the kind of bastards who killed my best friend their force is divided and we outnumber both groups combined yes ethan said lets fight raven had been looking about theres a better way she said quickly lets just jump into the river the others looked down the face of the dam as high as a threestory building thats a good drop iris objected and the rivers sluggish daniel said we cant swim faster than they can run theyll just follow us down the valley and well lose all our supplies too he glanced around trying to summon some of the tactics hed once studied on dry dead pages they outnumbered their antagonists yes but the narrowness of the dam crest made it impossible to flank rugards watchdogs and bring their superiority to bear it was like the narrow defile at erehwon except here the situation was reversed it wasnt tucker holding rugard off it was rugards men holding them in place until the warden could arrive with reinforcements maybe a few of the men could swim downstream and circle back around he thought aloud take them from behind we dont have time for that raven said who knows when rugard might show up and we didnt come all this way to give away everything either amaya do you think we could get those spillway gears working maybe with that old wheel and the levers theyre rusted but with enough men pulling what good will that do ethan asked the catwalk supports are half rotted raven explained hurriedly we lash our supplies onto the decking use the tools weve picked up to hack at its base and send the platform over the dam with any luck it becomes a raft that people can cling to on their way downstream meanwhile amaya added excitedly grasping her idea we open these gates for an instant flood that pushes us downstream and leaves rugards men stranded on either side of the dam maybe it buys us enough time to get to the coast and try the transmitter daniel looked at his two female strategists with wonder let me get this straight you want to start our own torrent and jump into it with our supplies lashed to a rotting catwalk they nodded he shrugged makes sense to me ethan he looked down the gearhouse steps well have to hold them off while we work theres some deck gratings down there maybe we can pry them up for temporary shields daniel smiled okay two men behind each shield women to chop down the catwalk the rest of the men down here on those levers he began snapping out names the authority coming naturally to him now glancing at the blocking convicts at either end of the dam its time to leave again without saying goodbye the fugitives pried up two of the steel floor gratings on one side of the gearhouse and carried them up the stairs putting one on each side of the central catwalk two men took position behind each grating spears pointed out meanwhile the old tools salvaged from the ruins were rapidly distributed some of the women dropped down into the shallow water running over the spillway and cautiously felt their way under the catwalk holding on to its posts as they moved other women carried their packs to the decking of the catwalk overhead hastily lashing their belongings in place even as their sisters began hacking at the posts beneath them with each blow the wooden bridge trembled meanwhile the remaining men descended into the gearhouse to pry at the frozen workings of the dam spillway gates rugards men watched uncertainly belatedly wrench and gallo realized that the entire party they were hunting had disappeared as easy targets some men were crouched behind some kind of metal mesh others had hidden in the gearhouse and the last of the women were dropping down to muck about in the spillway underneath the catwalk almost entirely hidden as they bent over something was going on and it wasnt surrender the men glanced nervously at each other none had forgotten the shocking roar and concussion of the bewildering explosion back at erehwon did the transmitter thieves have more witchery up their sleeve while the convicts had the fugitives pinned their quarry outnumbered them gallo wished rugard were here but it would take a couple of days to find and bring him maybe they should just back off and trail these troublemakers send some rocks at them he instructed his slingman uncertainly the man whirled his weapon over his head and let fly the stone rocketed along the crest of the dam and banged off the metal grate harmlessly he flung again and again one rock ricocheted into the adjacent reservoir and a third bounced up in the air and fell down on the dam crest behind the bastards crouched with the grate one of them scampered back scooped it up and hurled it back forcing gallos men to duck out of the way you dropped something you clumsy cretins the pitcher yelled it looked like the bastard theyd already hit with a rock maybe we should just rush them one of the convicts ventured theres too many gallo snapped you want to get pushed off the face of this dam i say we keep them pinned here until help comes theyre trapped wrench had arrived at the same conclusion hed actually loped forward along the other end of the dam with the intention of jabbing tentatively at the metal grating with his spear but as soon as he started the fugitives hurled chunks of concrete the blows sending him scampering back out of the way if he tried to climb over the gratings theyd stick him like a pig well if he couldnt advance on the dams crest neither could they right it was a standoff he hoped still he was worried about doing nothing and getting the warden mad at him he stood watching the frenetic activity at the center of the dam with foul confusion what the hell were they trying to do suddenly there was a shrill wailing shriek so loud and unearthly that the convicts on either side of the structure instinctively jumped what the devil was that excited shouts were coming from the gearhouse then there was another shriek and encouraging yells from the women the flow of water down the face of the dam began to quicken the catwalk was beginning to lean out over the dropoff increasingly precarious are they trying to commit suicide wrench muttered his chest sore from a thrown missile if they lost the transmitter in the river rugard would hang them all damn he began to realize that things were going horribly wrong there was another metallic squeal the complaint of corroded metal and then a sudden bang one of the spillway gates snapped open and a plume of water shot out from the crest of the spillway carrying two women with it screaming they hit the river below the catwalk shuddered and with a creak of its own and a snapping of timbers it followed the two women off the top of the dam toppling into the river with a titanic splash the wood went under for a moment and then floated in a boil of foam rocking away downstream shrieking with a combination of triumph and fear more women jumped into the growing waterfall and slid down the face of the dam to follow their makeshift raft behind them there were more snaps of metal a chain reaction of failure and the spillway gates pried open wider pushed by the force of the reservoir behind them the roar of the unleashed flood was growing men boiled out of the gearhouse shouting and waving their arms at their comrades behind the shields abruptly the gratings clanged down and the two defenders behind each one ran to the lip of the spillway jump jump daniel cried one by one they obeyed him wrench and gallo started to lead their men across the top of the dam raven hesitated at the edge of the spillway eyes wide with excitement at the growing flood the transmitter strapped to her belly these are your people now daniel shouted to her above the growing roar of the water theyve decided to put their trust in you dont let them down she looked at the heads bobbing downstream thrashing after the makeshift raft i wont then she leaped ayyyyyy daniel glanced around wrench was charging at him with a wild cry sword swinging over his head it cut empty air where daniel had been hed jumped too there was the terrifying irruption of foam below the endless seconds of free fall and then the plunge into cold water and the buffeting of current until he could force his way back upward gasping for air all he could see was water he began swimming downstream gallo and wrench wavered to a stop at the two edges of the spillway separated from each other by ninety feet of roaring flood fire fire the two squad leaders screamed the convicts hurled spears and sticks but the fusillade was a pointless mistake they were simply throwing away their best weapons all they had to aim at was mist and white water and beyond it a series of heads swirling downstream like corks one by one the fugitives were reaching the floating catwalk accelerated by the growing flood jump in after them wrench roared in frustration but his companions hesitated the pounding of the unleashed water was getting more violent as the corroded gates were pried aside the reservoir swirling toward the dams open mouth with an ominous suck and how would they fight in the water rugards scouts began backing warily away from the spillway lip the fugitives were already out of sight wrench and gallo looked at each other across the gap as impassable as an ocean the lake behind was big and might take hours even days to drain itself back down to the level of the new opening they howled in frustration and then turned to try to follow as best they could along the steep brushy banks on either side of the river falling farther and farther behind the energy that swept daniels party downstream was frightening in its power and a narrower river canyon with more rocks might have resulted in serious injury to the members of his party the reservoir water was cold deep and turbulent but the valley below the dam was wide enough so that the pouring water had room to spread and run smoothly as it rushed downstream the fugitives were mostly young immensely fit after months in the wilderness and good swimmers none had come to australia without that skill so instead of being caught in a whitewater death trap daniels group was instead sped by a brownish current that was tidelike in its steady power the wreckage of the catwalk became a life raft that supported most of the fugitives though a few clung to random logs that had been picked up and carried downstream as well the water moved so fast that the frustrated cries of rugards men were soon left behind then the pulse of the current began to slow and by concerted effort the group clinging to the catwalk eventually managed to kick the structure to the eastern side of the stream so that it grounded on a sandbar by that time theyd been washed down several miles the shaken trekkers staggered ashore to collapse and steam in the sun panting and then roused themselves to unlash their belongings and sort themselves out surprisingly few of their supplies had been lost ravens plan had worked and besides cuts and bruises there were no serious injuries even ned had decided his shoulder was only hurt not broken by the slung rock well we crossed the river ethan spat not quite the way we intended the other fugitives were looking at daniel with a mixture of triumph and stunned uncertainty what now he stood stiffly took a deep breath and faced them everyone was a bit dazed by the sudden confrontation but also exhilarated to have escaped thrilled to have beaten this sudden foe thrilled to still be alive come alive outback adventure had promised they had this day now they had a choice to make and a hard one if they were going to help him he had to play to their desire for escape weve told you all that we think we have a way to get a couple of us back to where we came from he began quietly and if the transmitter works they might just be able to expose this scandal for what it is and get the rest of us back as well but to use the transmitter we were forced to flee with it from a convict community hundreds of miles to the west of here after so much distance and time we thought the convicts had given up any hope of pursuit but obviously we were wrong the others were watching him grimly his vague promises of journeying to a point to seek help had seemed like deliverance and now his admission that a rival group was still on their heels smacked of betrayal it was like the misleading halftruths of outback adventure all over again he knew by now they trusted no one we cant let this destroy us he continued one of my original friends betrayed us in his desperation to escape we cant let that happen again so what do we do peter asked weve escaped for now but they may find us again soon that leaves all of you with a choice you can stick with us in hopes we can elude our pursuers and try to call in some kind of rescue craft once we get out from under this electronic cloud of jamming thats always been a long shot but its our only shot but if you come with us we may end up in a bad fight a desperate fight trying to do it or you can bail out now if we split up you dont have any chance of getting back but the group that is chasing us will probably leave you alone maybe he stopped risk death with you or stay marooned by ourselves peter summed up thats it isnt it he nodded a bad choice but weve never had very good ones have we i wasnt trying to keep anything from you peter i just didnt want to worry you needlessly if we can just signal for rescue the convict pursuit becomes pointless i hope there was a gloomy silence and the only one guaranteed to have a ride out of here is her iris clarified pointing to raven why her he took a breath because shes the one who told us about this chance were going to send her and ethan to try to bring help that was our original plan and were not changing it now any fight over who gets to go would be fruitless his followers digested all this wish you were here and i wasnt ned tried to joke jessica stepped forward to stand next to peter well im not giving up my only chance of getting out of here to a bunch of damned convicts she announced im sticking with daniel me too peter sighed if im going to die in australia it might as well be for a reason at least with you guys theres a hope be realistic everybody daniel warned if it comes down to a fight it will be with people united corporations deemed beyond rehabilitation in that case wed better start thinking about some serious weapons ethan said amaya could you work on a flamethrower please the others laughed breaking the tension her ingenuity had become well known there was a new fierceness to them since the dam daniel realized a new confidence and resolve they had a goal and now they had the unity from sharing danger one by one they began to stand unity like united corporations no not like that which way mate oliver asked a little unsteady now ollie this really isnt your fight daniel said or anguss ill understand if you australians want to bug out and leave it to us immigrants really angus shook his head you said were all australians now daniel glanced away trying to hide the surge of emotion welling up in him they were following for desperate reasons perhaps but behind him of all people what would harridan lundeen think this river eventually leads to the sea of course but because of that its a little too obvious daniel judged theyll expect us to go that way he pointed east over a range of mountains so well climb do it the hard way sounds like a bloody outback adventure ned quipped shouldering a pack id pay a years salary for this experience any day ethan chirped for people who ask why they do jessica warbled and need their bleedin heads examined peter amended they headed east again chapter twentysix australia had changed the taut harshness of the outback had given way to the soft contours of rounded hills and thick forest cut by streams and interspersed by meadows and abandoned pasture old farmsteads had become frequent the rotting and rusting houses half swallowed by eruptions of brambles wild cows horses pigs and goats were frequently encountered sheep had disappeared destroyed perhaps by roving packs of wild dogs and now the first city was glinting on the horizon ethan sat next to daniel as they rested in the grass of an eastfacing slope studying the abandoned towers ragged remnants of the building windows still caught the light of the sun somewhere not too far beyond must be the sea daniel ive decided not to go back ethan announced quietly as they let their eyes skip across the overgrown cityscape searching for any sign of life in the distant ruins what ive decided it would be better if you returned with raven not me why i think you make a better fit its your seat ethan your crash your transmitter yours by length of exile we already decided this i dont want to go back he shook his head as if puzzled himself not yet anyway i miss things sure but not enough that i need to get back right now theres things id miss even more here amaya yes and another thing what this country im falling in love with it too they looked out across the rolling hills blue with haze even in the underpopulated areas of the united corporations world roads curved power lines strutted across the contours and the invisible matrix of property lines and survey markers reminded how the planet had been parceled out here everything was at the beginning again no one owned anything everything still seemed possible daniel sighed id rather have you go and want to come back amaya would be a pretty good guarantee you wouldnt forget us here no im beginning to think i could make a better life here once we get past the convicts not out in the desert no but here we have wood and water and livestock and the remnants of a lot of technology not to mention land and room and freedom its beautiful here in fact its the most beautiful place ive ever seen the new australians like raven said ive been thinking the same thing there you go then so now were going to argue about who has to go instead of who has to stay he laughed wed get plenty of volunteers still im just saying you make the most sense of any of us i cant go back ethan i cant lead this group in a race to the coast and then abandon them you wouldnt be abandoning them youd be saving them or at least giving them a choice of which world they want to live in and youd have far more influence over raven than i would you two together could get to people in power maybe shed listen to you no she wouldnt she doesnt want anything to do with me nonsense shes haunted by you you haunt each other now you sound like amaya amaya is smarter than any of us you know shed take you over me if she could thats crazy no it isnt and it doesnt worry me because this connection between you and raven is as obvious as gravity and as weird as love not simple attraction so much as entwined destiny i think everyone can see it and somebody has to go daniel somebody has to take the story back if raven has to be one of them the next most obvious choice is you start thinking about it please she keeps defending united corporations she keeps defending herself trying to live with herself shed love you for accepting her for what she is and helping her to become what she wants to be the city was called gleneden and it was one of the new towns that united corporations had erected around the globe to rationalize the distribution of its workforce and maximize the efficiency of resource extraction in this case minerals in the foothills of the great dividing range they approached the town on the raised deck of an expressway the pavement littered and cracked but the underlying structure sturdy enough to last for centuries a few abandoned vehicles sat on the roadway shoulder their shells rusting through and their glass imploded the fragments clustered on rotting seats like drifts of diamonds trees had grown up to embrace the causeway railings so the bridge deck seemed to float on the forest canopy and birds sounded an alarm and glided ahead of them in a startled weave announcing this unexpected reappearance of humans more flocks exploded off the derelict towers wheeling in consternation then the avian inhabitants settled down and gleneden was quiet again in the distance down an empty avenue a wild dog loped away what if we see bodies iris worried i dont want to see bodies i dont think therell be anything left by this time daniel reassured in truth he was unsure and uneasy at the thought himself he didnt want to find buildings of bones i dont think we should go in at all raven said they ignored her it was curiosity more than need they were in too much of a hurry to thoroughly explore or salvage anything in gleneden but the roads they were using to get ahead of rugard led them to the new town and theyd all quietly wondered how much remained or how much had been lost as they entered they saw that many stores had been looted and a few buildings had been torched yet taken as a whole very little had been destroyed in the panic that accompanied the plague and it was only the obvious hollowness of the towers and emptiness of the streets that proved disquieting everyone was subdued morbidly wondering what it must have been like to have a civilization in all its complexity and anxious energy and optimistic enthusiasm suddenly snuffed out careers romances dreams and regrets all suddenly gone rendered insignificant by the breath of bioengineered plague the planned and hastily erected community was a snapshot of early twentyfirstcentury architecture its retro style tempered by costconscious design and its warmth compromised by the demands of transportation humanscale pedestrian malls were backed by cardictated parking lots and tower villages were separated from each other by a moat of expressways and empty overgrown lawns faded and streaked billboards and powerless neon announced sales of products that no longer existed directional signs pointed with names that were now obsolete the architecture and layout were as precise as the geometrical design of a computer chip and just as inhuman without people it was just a collection of boxes instead of human skeletons they found automotive ones the metallic carcasses of cars scattered now like corroding bones the pavement had cracked and plants had rooted spreading across the detritus of leaf litter and dust that had accumulated atop the impervious layer there were vines and scrubby weeds and the buzz of insects all announcing that the inhabitants of gleneden were dead daniel realized the desolation was slowly making him angry these people were abandoned just like we were he said the group had stopped at an intersection instinctively huddling together left with no hope at all amaya added the quiet was gloomy raven looked irritated as if this journey through a dead city was designed as an affront they werent abandoned they were quarantined she corrected there was no cure so it was imperative the plague not jump to another land mass it wasnt ruthless it was necessary she looked around grimly at the empty office and condominium towers the trekkers regarded her with distaste and that pragmatism is what you worked to protect daniel said she bit her lip its cruel to individuals i dont deny that and now youre one of those individuals outcast like we are yes think of the souls that were lost here raven the individuals how long would it take you to write down their names this place is a sin a crime dont you think i see that but think of the souls that were saved elsewhere by this abandonment or are saved every day by an economic and political system you think is so heartless she wasnt going to back down think of the billions that have tolerable lives because of the united corporations order you call stultifying this tragedy is an embarrassment but it doesnt discredit that system daniel it underlines its necessity this shows how fragile all of human society is how thin the civilized and technological veneer is that keeps out the darkness thats what ive worked to protect this wasnt caused by a breakdown of civilization it was caused by its culmination how can you defend the scientific arrogance that led to all these deaths how can you not admit the worth of the scientific and political expertise that has allowed more humans to live today than ever before in history raven this is a mausoleum ethan objected i mean come on because of one accident she amended with exasperation before that it was a city with life and laughter created as part of a system i still feel an allegiance to of course this is wrong all of it all of australia if i get back ill be working to expose that but not the rest i cant not believe in the rest i cant give up on the rest i have to believe in something daniel looked at her sadly she wouldnt tolerate his pity what do you believe in besides your wilderness nihilism daniel what do you believe in besides running away i believe in what feels right he said quietly i believe in what we are instead of what we build he glanced around i believe that united corporations lost something along the way not their soul but our soul and that weve come to a place like this to get it back not this city but this continent even if that were true not everyone can come here maybe everyone doesnt have to maybe its enough to have the wild for the few who truly need it and who bring back its spirit to the rest none of this would be so wrong if they allowed us to get back its the keeping us here thats so wrong now youre going in circles contradicting yourself just like in the tunnels its your determination to get away from here that makes the lesson of outback adventure so right her dogged certainty irritated him im not enough ethan held up his hand this is the debate well get to have if any of us can get past rugard and back home for now we have to keep moving i think we should look around a bit said amaya raven and daniel both have a point and here in this city weve got both worlds the technological and the wild lets see if theres anything worth taking dont take oliver exclaimed its bad luck just for an hour or two amaya said it wont hurt some of the trekkers nodded they were looking speculatively at the stores wondering what might still be worn or acquired after more than three decades it would be fun to go shopping again iris said fun not to have to pay for anything ned added no oliver said this is a bad place a dangerous place we need to move on too many died here i can hear them were just looking around a bit amaya said the others nodded why dont you and angus go ahead and wait for us at the end of town the native australians reluctantly agreed all right we meet back here in two hours daniel told them be careful in these old buildings he looked at one of the towers im going to go up to one of these rooftops and try to see the ocean the office tower was fifteen stories high modest by the standards of the city theyd come from boxy and plain still it was imposing after months in the wilderness daniel recognized the name at its base from the corporate subsidiaries and institutional advertising elsewhere coraco industrial mining and development the security pod in the central lobby was deserted of course and its news kiosk was frozen in time many of the periodicals had been shredded by rodents for nests but a few pages of the gleneden paradise revealed a yellowed november illness spreads one headline stated massive relief effort promised had that been the day of panic the day of realization that no relief was actually coming that there was no escape and that the only alternative was blind flight that became as hopeless as staying what about the few whod survived like oliver and angus he remembered from his college days the dire prediction of what would occur if the bizarre arms races of the twentieth century had ever resulted in nuclear war the living would envy the dead he heard her bootsteps on the broken glass behind him and ignored her he was tired of trying the elevator wouldnt work of course so he took the stairs daniel climbed steadily she followed two or three flights behind their echoes a kind of lonely conversation the paint was flaking and water stains from the failing roof ran down the walls the structure itself was solid a web of concrete and steel how many centuries would it last before sharing the fate of australias eroded mountains or would someone come back implode it and start over on a whim he left the stairs on the fourteenth floor there was no thirteenth but superstition hadnt saved them there was a dark hallway and then a brighter windowed expanse of office cubicles lit by broken windows the carpet was rotting mold grew on the walls and bird droppings spotted the desks and yet nothing had really changed dark computer screens this was before the cheaper optiglasses were the central shrine on desktops that still bore yellowed or wadded memos cracked cups dried pens and posted corporate guidelines everything had been abandoned abruptly chesthigh beige dividers formed a succession of cubicles as familiar as microcore this was my life he thought he could hear the light breathing of raven resting after their climb of the stairs shed come in behind him look familiar too much so what were trying to get back to what i came here to escape from these people were happy daniel they had lives yes they did he walked past a supervisory desk to a window and looked out over the city its rational grid reminded him of the sole of ethans boots a street plan that dated back to the roman military camp what do the animals call us he wondered we of the right angle and straight line the rulers of course we rule with rules from streets and towers of ruled calibration until it all goes wrong until we bet everything on our own cleverness and disappear so fast we leave no explanation of the fatal mistake how many other lost civilizations had succumbed like this one so do you feel nostalgic at all she persisted do you feel the pull of society of course my society you mean the pull of your tribe the pull of the primitive he looked down some of his followers were coming out from stores chortling over improbable finds of small appliances and decaying clothing theyd try on something or punch the buttons of a powerless machine and then abandon them in the street in truth little that was useful remained the pull of my new friends raven of people who need people not some gigantic institution like this company not like united corporations daniel an institution is people thats all it is no when it gets too big something happens to it like getting too much money or eating too much food it can make you sick mentally and physically thats whats wrong with united corporations the more they envelop the less they become until finally they start decaying and destroying like this place it was an accident was it when it grew out of the total domination they try to achieve of both man and nature when does an accident become inevitable she closed her eyes when is a mistake just a mistake he looked out across the city you could defend a tower like this i suppose he mused absently from people like rugard i mean but a castle also becomes a trap when you lock the door you have to have a way back out youre speaking of us in australia yes like australia he turned then and smiled at her suddenly feeling lightened at this encounter with the ruins he hadnt been sure of his own reaction and now realized he missed none of this old world his past held no allure for him despite all the hardships in this one i said i dont blame you for putting me here raven and i forgive you for throwing away the activator the trip has been good for me i admit it so why is this so difficult why is what so difficult us because im in love with you without even being sure i like you because you wont love me she sighed saying nothing he watched her carefully ethan wants me to come back with you you know he does he wants to give up his place on the rescue plane hes falling in love with amaya and falling in love with australia its beautiful here far more beautiful than home he wants to stay and send me in his place send me to tell the world would you she said it cautiously i dont know he cocked his head as if this were the first time hed truly considered it i dont know if anyone would listen or care even if they knew the truth i dont know if theyd let me live to tell anyone i wouldnt let them hurt you daniel you already did remember she flushed and he instantly regretted the retort but thats not why im hesitating im unsure because ive come to believe the planet does need a place for misfits like me it always has you understand that he moved away from the window walking back into the cubicles not in the way you do come here i want to show you something she followed warily as if he were going to shock her with a pile of bones but there was nothing like that just a sheet of faded paper pinned to a cubicle wall he pulled it off and gave it to her your institution the paper was so aged it was hard to see at first she thought it was something abstract or a painted copy of the aboriginal designs theyd seen on rock walls then she realized it was a childs drawing she squinted looking closer there were faint pencil lines on the drawing forming two words for daddy its not about economic systems raven its about the human heart she blinked flustered at this offering from a little girl long dead the child would have been a woman now with children of her own looking ahead to grandchildren except she wouldnt its about letting people be themselves letting people be this child didnt deserve her fate thats not fair there was a tremble in her voice that she hated this city this girl might never have even existed without we have to go outside in order to get into our inside because if we dont then all that united corporations stands for doesnt mean anything its just stuff and disastrous mistakes and little girls that end up killed by our own plagues in our mania to control our environment we dont need an australia as a dumping ground we need wilderness to save us from ourselves to remind us whats basic and simple and true she squeezed her eyes shut again the drawing fluttering to the floor you have to look at the big picture thats why i dont know if i can go back with you raven because my heart doesnt know where it belongs she was quiet for a while and then she spoke her voice was small im sorry i cant say i love you i dont know what i am supposed to say to make you come back with me i just want you to why i challenge everything you stand for to save the others thats not why i do care for them you know i do like them thats not why she lowered her eyes so im not alone he stepped close reaching out to grasp her arms his grip was firm his eyes intense as he looked into hers then say youll stay here with me raven say youll give it all up for me say youll stay in australia say that and maybe it wont matter where i am so long as im with you and then he bent to kiss her she stiffened again but only for a moment then she was kissing him back this time her lips open her arms coming around him her body pressing and then moving against his he held her roughly hungrily his hands roaming to caress i do love you dammit she admitted fiercely when she broke briefly away you know i do i love all the mixedup craziness thats in you all the longing all the desire thats been the problem from the beginning then it shouldnt matter where we are should it no she sighed and kissed him again it shouldnt he took her hand and led her back to the musty stairs instead of descending they climbed upward it took two kicks to break open the door to the roof birds flew up crying but the couple found a corner away from their nests that was clean and warm bleached deck boards providing a platform above the vinyl roofing she knelt with him beside her looking east i wonder when well see the ocean he reached over her shoulders from behind and began undressing her watching the garments slide off her brown shoulders and mounding around the swell of her hips her nipples were hard her belly trembling and he caressed her torso as he kissed her pulling the luxuriant fall of her dark hair aside to bare her neck say youll live with me in australia he murmured say youll trade that world for this one and with a moan she pulled him down on top of her making a bed of their clothes on the wooden slats of the deck and promising nothing except that for this moment they were one chapter twentyseven ico washington believed he knew what exodus port really was he hadnt found a geographic exodus of course there was no bay on australias eastern coast that harbored an exit from this continental hell of that he was sure but there was a way to get back ico thought a way that depended on exercising the mind more than the legs you had to find a key to the lock the answer to the riddle that was the test of outback adventure a test of wits and in his case the answer was the transmitter whoever successfully signaled deserved to get back and whoever did not deserved permanent exile every man for himself survival of the fittest the orangespeckled cube that hed safeguarded across half of australia and the battered transmitter that raven had stolen were in combination exodus port with them he could not just escape but return to the world of united corporations a designated winner unless raven got out from under the cone and signaled first right now ico was in a world of losers a dustshrouded column of the crude stupid stinking and dull rugards expedition of recovery seemed to have developed some kind of perverse gravity drawing in the desperate and cruel to make a small army despite periodic desertions from its lessthanreliable ranks people liked to belong to a group ico supposed they liked being led plus the vaguely understood promise of possible escape fired the growing mob like a promise of treasure none knew of course that there was no room on a rescue craft for anyone but rugard and himself theyd realize that when the pair were gone icos conscience was not bothered by this planned abandonment because hed come to loathe his allies familiarity had given him time to despise their tasteless jokes and vile nicknames and adolescent gang mentality they deserved to be forgotten theyd called him psycho and yet he was the only one who had brought them this far he and the map that everyone had laughed at from the beginning well hed leave them soon ico would win he told himself because unlike the others who were marooned hed been thinking from the beginning that he was convinced was what united corporations was secretly looking for while the others had been drugged to sleep hed fought to stay awake while the others had sheepishly agreed to geographic ignorance hed been out buying a black market map admittedly the map was crude and somewhat inaccurate it showed highways that didnt exist and omitted some that did in main however it was a decent redraw maybe from memory of an australia that had been real ico was convinced of this now because the map had been right too many times now after the report of the confusion at the dam the main army should meet the transmitter thieves on the road maybe in this abandoned city ahead in the foothills the expedition could see its towers information was the edge always the edge ico had it he looked back along the line of trudging men swaying camels and captured horses the warden riding commandingly on one steed liberated from an owner whose foolish resistance had gotten him killed there were clusters of women too some as heavily armed and nasty as the males and others the terrified and subdued inductees to rugards cohort of joy a mob united by greed and fear but they were following him and if his guess was right theyd already outflanked the fugitives and now heading back west they would shortly intercept them it was possible he was wrong of course but ico trusted his own instincts dyson had been bullheaded about direction from the very beginning east east east dyson would think he could still outrun rugards big group but then dyson thought the map was useless that ico would tolerate being left behind and that the bitch he was smitten with could be trusted dyson was a smug immature naive nitwit who deserved to be left behind he belonged here ico couldnt wait from the door of an aircraft to wave goodbye it was a scream which jerked daniel awake a wail of fear that penetrated the afternoon slumber hed fallen into after satiation with raven he jerked up guiltily momentarily disoriented there were shouts of alarm in the plaza below he crawled to the edge of the parapet surrounding the flat roof there was a confused knot of people and two horsemen galloping wildly away one swaying unsteadily as if injured thered been some kind of brief fight iris weeping he watched the mounted scouts retreat toward a stream of people coming into the outskirts of the city just two miles away down the main avenue a swarm of convicts trotting toward them with excited purpose yipping and crowing like animals his heart sank theyd been found and not just found but likely trapped he woke raven and they hastily began to dress daniel where are you amayas voice just a minute they both were half covered when amaya stepped out onto the tower roof jerking to an abrupt halt when she saw them then she blinked and composed herself thank god i found you they surprised iris and the men just barely saved her everyones coming into the lobby rugard i think so with a small army a hundred people or more should we run too late for that especially if they have horses daniel thought about the tower better to fight them here perhaps than in the open he looked down to the plaza one hundred and fifty feet below keep everyone out of sight ill be right down she disappeared raven touched his sleeve daniel if it doesnt matter where we are you and me i mean maybe i should just give it up surrender the transmitter to rugard he smiled at that leaning to kiss her we cant make that decision by ourselves because its more than just us now he stood youd better go get the machine and see if it works yet this may be our last chance to get back she looked over the parapet at the approaching convicts and nodded gloomily down in the lobby daniel assessed his group their look was of defiance they were tired of being marooned tricked tracked and preyed upon tired of being pushed around that was good there was a hard core to these people now a determination to hang on to the hope theyd earned he could rely on that okay he began is everyone here even iris ned said his shoulder had almost healed but now his forehead had a new raw cut from the horse scouts daniel assumed our shopper shed calmed from her fright the best prices id ever seen and i dropped it all the others laughed it was bad luck to linger here angus reminded hed come back when he saw rugards army and now he was trapped with them that made them quiet wheres oliver staying away daniel took a breath okay whats done is done we tried to outrun them but that didnt work it doesnt look like we can run through them either theres too many what they want is the transmitter what they want is to take away our chance to get back so we give up or we fight so hard that they give up youve seen this warden peter said quietly what are our chances as bankable as a lottery ticket as unanswerable as a prayer theyre tough wild nasty people he grinned fiercely but so are we now damn straight ethan said the only ones who can decide if its time to fight however are you it depends on how badly you want to get back how badly you want the outside world to know what happened to you how willing you are to stay here we decided this at the river daniel jessica replied its not just getting back its whats right not just for us but everyone its about contacting the cyber underground and the opposition and exposing this place in order to shut it down its about not just our little group but every person they put in australia we ran away to come here weve all run away our whole lives were still running but outback adventure suggested wed find our why if we came here this is mine i think not to get back but to make a stand for something its not right for those convicts to steal our hope to steal everyones hope i say we fight for that for hope the others nodded there was a grim resolve in their eyes a quickening of pulse a tensing of muscle can we beat them asked peter daniel stuck his hands in his pockets and glanced upward at the lobby ceiling well weve got the high ground we can barricade the lobby and throw things down from above this building will work as a fort or a castle if we hurt them enough maybe theyll go away if we can talk to them we can tell them the truth that raven is the one allowed to get back but can we do that peter persisted he pulled out a figure from his pocket my good luck charm tells me we can what the devil is that gordo firecracker nemesis of evil amaya recalled dryly the worst charm youve ever seen hes been carrying that doll all the way across australia gordo is not a doll daniel said with mock tartness holding it up so others could see hes an action figure not to mention my field marshal and chief strategist they laughed again great peter said and what does gordo suggest we do fortify for attack prepare for negotiation and he looked thoughtful pray for a miracle peter suggested build a catapult so the fugitives had run to ground in the first city they came to after all the fancy talk of wilderness nirvana theyd taken instinctive refuge in a damn skyscraper ico snickered at the irony of it the expedition of recovery might have missed the fugitives entirely if theyd had the sense to hide in this civic labyrinth but instead theyd gone looting for all the goods they professed to disdain one of their fool women had been spotted scurrying down a side street her arms loaded with useless jewelry when the scouts had tried to ride her down the fugitives had boiled out of the coraco building like a disturbed hive rugards men barely galloping off with their lives but the incident had revealed the thieves location and number allowing the convicts to swiftly surround the base of the tower ico could see the baubles now scattered on the plaza as uselessly as coins in a fountain the fugitives visible through the broken windows were working desperately to prepare the lobby had been barricaded and it wouldnt be easy to get to them the convicts knew the warden circuited the office tower thoughtfully and then walked out into the plaza alone arrogant weaponless both sides watched him the fugitives crouched by the windows he took a breath i want raven he suddenly roared his voice echoed away among the old towers where is the bitch she has something of mine the demand seemed to float hanging in the air daniel stood up in full view she cant come to the door right now men on both sides laughed rugard jerked around and his side quieted he turned back your run is over dyson youre surrounded outnumbered and out of options you cant get back now without us and your men cant get back at all have you told your rabble theres no room on the rescue craft for anyone but you rugard have you told them that youve led them a thousand miles and are risking their lives to save only your own skin he wheeled around to face his troops thats a lie no it isnt daniel shouted its a lie like the lies united corporations has told us all our lives rugard roared look at him hes built a whole gang out of his promise to get people back and theyre laughing at us right now hes sucked in followers with the promise that they can have the seats that by rights go to you the convicts growled like the thunder from an approaching storm no thats not true hes a thief whos trying to keep you here like the others of his kind back home the convicts roared angry now and a drumming started they beat on pavement they beat on stone and they beat on rotting benches rusting siding and corrugated doors rugard strode back and forth in front of them jerking his arms up in rhythm boom boom boom as regular as a machine as ominous as an approaching footfall there was no complexity to it just a steady solemn ceaseless pounding to drive home their menace it was a music of warning a drumming to summon courage and infect a prey with fear theyd found it the key perhaps to getting back the sound rolled up to the windows where daniels followers worked more furiously stockpiling anything they could pry loose to hurl down on their besiegers it looked like a battle the one advantage we have is height daniel kept lecturing climbing from one floor to another i want them to think this tower is coming down on them if they try to rush us i want an avalanche of furniture a blizzard of debris i sound like a demented napoleon he thought wryly he stopped to see what amaya was doing you couldnt whip up another batch of gunpowder could you probably something worse if id time to thoroughly explore she replied there might even be modern explosives somewhere if we looked this was a mining town but we didnt get time for that so all we can do is strip this building she began to point the rubber bumpers on some of the table furniture are being stripped off and fashioned into slingshots for ammunition we can pull nails and screws out of the walls theres metal trim with enough flex to pull back for makeshift bows rods from shades already notched for scraps of glass to make arrows and sprinkler pipe to use as spears not to mention tons of stuff to simply heave out of the windows your talents are wasted amaya you belong in an arms race i want to get rid of these people so we dont have to have arms races she looked past him through the window to the green hills beyond the citys buildings its so beautiful here daniel why infest it with criminals it must have seemed like an easy solution if they ever came here if they ever got out of their boardrooms and visited this place theyve made theyd see their mistake she meant the executives of united corporations they wont and im not sure they didnt intend this everyone at each others throats as a lesson for us and a solution for them she looked at him softly its good then that you and raven yes he smiled sheepishly things might have been different between us you know if shed gone if youd let her go he nodded right you know i love her but i still dont know about her amaya i still dont know her heart i do shes changed the drumming went on for an hour the sound was enough to unnerve if you let it but they wouldnt christ theyre out of tune ethan complained covering his ears musically impaired amaya added the convicts drummed and shook and reached inside themselves for the savagery the modern world had tried to cram beneath their surface bringing it out again in snarls and wild howls so that theyd have the courage to charge for what they wanted the coordination of the drumming brought them together focused on the building and transmitter within then rugard lifted his arm and the convicts fell raggedly into silence listen to me he shouted to his followers you want to get back the way back is in that building you want to get out of prison its through those people up there the kind of people who put you into prison in the first place up there is the only way dont listen to him daniel tried again from the third story you cant get the way back is through him the convicts roared and as the warden swung his arm the ragged army surged forward in the afternoon sunshine a stone age charge of spear and club and sling and rock as timeless as humanity clan against tribe ego against ego pounding blood and drymouthed excitement instinct had come to eden chapter twentyeight rugard had a mob not an army he had a goal not a strategy his aim was simply the transmitter the men and women who surged toward the base of the office tower came in a ragged yelling line like a noose being tightened on a condemned neck but it was a garrote that was frayed some assailants lagged back hoping their comrades would do the hard fighting others faced mostly with blank concrete on three sides of the first two floors ran around to congregate at the lobby door the windows above erupted the defenders threw everything they had at their attackers desks came hurtling down like meteors lengths of pipe whistled down like spears light fixtures plummeted porcelain sinks that had been ripped loose from abandoned lavatories exploded on the pavement and bits of metal were fired from amayas makeshift slingshots and bows screams and panic erupted among the convicts some were struck down many fell back in confusion and a few of the boldest ran the gauntlet to hack their way through the initial barricade and into the lobby ethan met them with half a dozen adventurers in a wild counterattack swinging staves makeshift swords and hardened wooden spears cut off from reinforcement by the rain of debris from above the convicts recoiled beyond their opponents was the stairwell with yet another barricade who knew how many defenders were behind that wrench dodged a spear thrust clubbed one of the adventurers aside and then saw the convict on his right howl and go down with an arrow hellfire it was like the dam a space so narrow that numbers didnt count weve seen enough he shouted turning to retreat the others followed him out while dragging their wounded two staggering as they were hit by still more hurled pieces from the building fired bolts and nails whizzed around their ears bouncing off the pavement and then skittering away one retreating attacker slipped on the debris littering the plaza and sprawled giving those above enough time to hit him with a rain of junk he scrabbled away it was the same quick dumb rush theyd tried in the canyon at erehwon wrench thought four attackers were left behind either unconscious or dead a dozen were hurt back across the plaza the leaders clustered under a nearby overhang well that didnt work ico observed shut up rugard looked at the offending office tower with fury they could hear defiant derisive cheers from the transmitter thieves within to get at them weve got to go through a bottleneck wrench described well win eventually but not without a lot of blood how many are there rugard asked not that many i think judging from what we saw at the dam less than twenty but if we fight them in the stairwells going uphill they have all the advantage so if we could spread them out but how ive got an idea ico said there was a new hammering but not rhythmic this time rugards troops were building something and it didnt take long to figure out what it was daniel hastened to build his own weapon in defense the torsion catapult of the ancient world was a sophisticated device relying on twisted rope or sinew for the energy to repeatedly fling a projectile at an enemy while such a machine was quick to aim and fire daniels beleaguered fugitives didnt have the time to build artillery so complex simpler was a catapult that relied on a simple counterweight a trebuchet it actually had two buckets one on either end of a beam of wood that pivoted on an axle one bucket held the missile and the other a counterweight that was hoisted into the sky when fired the counterweight dropped the other end of the beam snapped up and the payload was launched skyward gravity provided the energy daniels trebuchet was mounted on the roof two tripods that had supported radio masts unbolted from their bases so they could be moved to allow the machine to pivot held the pipe used as the catapult axle four meters above the ground this axle threaded through an unbolted steel beam that became the trebuchet arm a hole was hacked in the roof to a central shaft where a dusty powerless elevator was tied to one end of the trebuchet arm with its rusting cables this box could be dropped as the counterweight amaya and ethan contributed ideas about some simple gearing rigged to ratchet the elevator up a floor for each firing upon release it would plummet the same distance before automatically braking hurtling the bucketed missile you could throw an electric car with this thing ethan promised black from grease he had collected from frozen machinery and redistributed on their new one with a throwing beam six meters long the trebuchet looked formidable or a years supply of microcore company directives daniel added but weve got to throw what we have are they bringing up some desks cursing your name in vain even as we speak metal desks from the floor below were being laboriously carried up to the roof and dumped there as ammunition gigantic catapult balls even if it doesnt hit anyone it should scare the hell out of them amayas shotgun payload might prove more effective daniel said shed heaped a small mountain of mugs and bottles dismounted pencil sharpeners dead modems frayed manuals and broken lamps to spray at any attackers well theyre going to try to spread us to bring their superior numbers to bear well have four on the roof here to fire this thing and the rest down below again to guard the entrance if they get a foothold in the building its over which they will if this doesnt work ethan said i built another one once daniel said it sort of worked centuries ago he thought when his only task was winning the attentions of mona pietri sort of the only thing wrong was that it missed the convicts came again at night their advance marked by torchlight and bonfires lit in the corners of the plaza the drumming now marked time to the stately advance of what ico had suggested and rugard had ordered his army to build a siege tower inspired by the towers used to assault castle walls this one used as its foundation the bottom frame of four automobiles two side by side in the front and two in the rear to create a square platform with sixteen rusting steel wheels stripped of their flattened rubber an aluminum electrical transmission tower shorn of its arms had been lashed to this foundation using some dead electrical cable producing a tower one hundred feet high car hoods and trunk lids had been bolted to it like scales giving it a protective covering of light armor on three sides at the top was the flatbed of a light truck mounted on rails that could be slid forward when the tower reached daniels office building if the tower worked as planned attacking convicts would swarm up ladders to its summit and charge across the flatbed smashing through the windows of the ninth floor at the same time another group stormed the lobby the creaking contraption would give the convicts attacking on the ground some cover by blocking fire from the plaza wall of windows weve advanced from the stone age to the medieval in half a day ethan marveled what happens in the next round a nuclear exchange lets get through this round first said daniel can you hold the lobby again if you can keep that moving junkyard away a skirmishing fire from the office tower windows and the surrounding streets began immediately the convicts trying to provide cover for their approaching siege engine with slinglaunched rocks the women under amaya replied with slingshots and bows it was impossible to be accurate in the darkness but the whiz and swap of stone and bolt and arrow created a weird pinging music some of the shots bouncing off the armor of the approaching siege tower with a punctuating clang those on both sides jerked in apprehension at the sound one of the convicts howled as an arrow struck home and a woman in the offices screamed as a rock broke her hand fire daniel shouted with no powder to ignite the word didnt really fit a catapult he found himself thinking randomly ancient artillery captains must have yelled something more appropriate to their technology such as shoot or throw no matter his trebuchet operators knew exactly what he meant a ratchet gear was released the old now powerless elevator made a brief plunge down its shaft and the steel beam sprang forward with ponderous grace a metal desk was launched into flight with a whoosh arcing toward the approaching siege tower it missed to the right by twenty feet plunging down to explode into shrapnel its panels clattering as they bounced in all directions the impact got the convicts to jerk to a startled halt but otherwise didnt hurt a thing what the hell was that one of them cried theyre trying to hit us rugards voice roared hurry hurry get against the building and they cant reach us the convicts leaned against the rear of the tower platform again and it began lumbering forward once more groaning and swaying some convicts darted forward to pull debris out of its way at the towers top a couple of the wardens men began trying to lob stones at daniels trebuchet squad on the roof of the office tower the trebuchet had been reloaded release daniel cried this time what his befuddled crew asked i mean fire fire fire oh another desk was hurled into the night again arcing down at the approaching tower this time it clipped the contraption with a loud bang jerking the top so violently that the convicts there were nearly thrown off one of the protective auto hoods was torn away and came down with the desk the tower stopped again no no rugard shouted go faster get in under their reach his men were hesitating the source of these meteoric desks was unknown and the escalating war was beginning to rattle them they wanted the transmitter but not at the cost of their lives move move if you want to live if you dont move by god ill kill you the tower had just started trundling forward again when it was hit broadside a desk hitting it like a gong and making the entire structure reverberate then the missile slid harmlessly down the steel scales crashing onto the pavement below two men ran forward and dragged it out of the way before the defenders could hit them with missiles they cant break it rugard roared its stronger than their fire now now move across and lets end this thing up on the roof of the office tower daniels men were desperate that was our best shot peter said grimly the thing hardly even rocked what are we going to do daniel looked wildly around we need something heavier he pointed that rustedout airconditioning unit maybe peter looked dubious that elephant i dont know if the elevator is heavy enough to counterweight it it might be if we climb onto the elevator are you crazy the cable might snap then well use the automatic brakes come on help me pry this sucker loose the air conditioner was not much bigger than a hurled desk but twice as heavy they rolled it on the trebuchet arm and balanced it between holding prongs it seemed too ponderous to throw daniel ran to the lip of the building the siege tower was rolling closer what other chance did they have okay weve got one shot at this thing he jumped onto the top of the elevator peter you aim and fire the others looked down the elevator well dubiously at where he was standing eight feet below them a loose steel cable led from the elevator to the trebuchet arm come on get down here with me we need your weight they jumped aboard peter had disappeared then they heard his voice launch with the jerk of a lever the elevator began to fall the cable went taut the counterweight arm came down and the ponderously heavy airconditioning unit soared up then there was a jerk a bang and the counterweight elevator cable snapped instead of stopping after a onefloor drop the box with three men on top started plunging toward the basement of the building brakes one of them screeched the emergency brakes had been pried open with a steel bar now daniel lunged at it i cant get the damn bar out he shouted the elevator was accelerating angus lurched over grabbed and jerked suddenly the bar was out whipping so violently that it slapped them against the concrete of the elevator shaft and scraping them as they tumbled falling with the box then the brakes designed to halt such falls snapped outward in a shower of sparks there was a long howl of metal then the elevator abruptly stopped rocking slightly the three men were in a stunned heap on the elevator roof i hear cheering angus grunted which side daniel gasped we stopped near a door the third man named royce pointed they used the brake bar to lever it open and crawled onto the sixth floor then ran to the window the siege tower was gone no not gone but toppled broken its transmission tower framework crumpled and the hurled airconditioning unit wedged where it had creased the tower in two the women three floors below were cheering the men ran down to them what happened you hit them dead center and it went over like a tree amaya reported excitedly they ran like cockroaches from light some are pretty badly hurt and i think the fight went out of them theyd started to rush the lobby but ran back out casualties henrys dead and three more are seriously wounded almost everyone is a little banged up and everyones shaken the convicts are hurting even worse peter came down the trebuchet arm broke when we fired he reported maybe we can repair it but weve lost our counterweight and we have to drag up more ammunition were also running low on things to throw or shoot amaya added quietly daniel nodded wheres raven here she came out of the shadows she was bruised and a hand was wrapped in a bloody bandage i keep trying the transmitter but its still jammed were awfully close to the ocean daniel maybe the cone doesnt have an edge at least not here maybe the coastline extends farther east elsewhere im sorry but im afraid the only way its going to work is to get back the activator you mean make a deal i mean we may be fighting to save something i cant promise will work he regarded them somberly do we give up then they heard rugards voice calling ftom the plaza dyson you in there you still alive you son of a bitch what a ballsup bloodspattered rubblestrewn humiliating nightmare of a mess damnation rugard sloan had felt like a goddamn genghis khan when he came up with his siege tower idea straight out of old movieswell it was the weasels idea but same thing and then that bitch and her thief companion had started spitting furniture at him like theyd packed an atomic cannon where the hell had that come from stuff flying off the roof like it was being put into orbit the hastily erected tower had toppled he had a dozen people dead or seriously wounded two dozen more crying about minor injuries and a whole army that was thoroughly spooked rugard wasnt certain a single convict would follow him if he led another charge across the plaza the warden was desperate as desperate as hed ever been in his life he just hoped the fugitives hed trapped were desperate too dyson you too hurt to answer he kept edging farther out into the plaza keeping a wary eye for a sudden rock or bolt if he couldnt get in rugard reasoned they still couldnt get out that was his key he could starve them or maybe smoke them start a fire at the base that might choke them where they stood but maybe there was an easier way a way he should have tried from the beginning dyson you come out where i can see you you come out and talk like a man you coming to surrender rugard looked up the voice had floated defiantly again from that thirdfloor window and he could see dysons head up there now a pale balloon in the firelight from the rim of the plaza hed love to put an arrow or a rock in the middle of it but that wouldnt do what he wanted to do im coming to gut you all like pigs the warden replied hoping his bluster masked his frustration im coming to put your heads on poles im coming to set a fire thatll roast you all like hamburger unless you listen to reason it was quiet for a moment as they digested this then were not giving you the transmitter rugard weve beaten the best you can do and well beat you again let us go someday maybe all of us will get back rugard hesitated the problem was dyson didnt sound scared enough not that he doubted he could beat him if they came to grips with each other but he wanted more fear thats when he knew he had his opponents when they mentally gave up there was a disquieting chance that this guy had a martyr complex and that gave rugard pause the truth was any man could be dangerous if he was unafraid to die yet what choice did the warden have the others wouldnt follow him much longer im not a man of violence dyson he now yelled im just a man of order of organization i didnt want it to come to this i just want whats rightfully mine so i say we end this before any others get hurt you and me one on one what dysons voice was quieter now you heard me you got the guts to back up your big mouth you willing to fight for all these people you led into a trap ill fight you for the transmitter alone at dawn i win i take it back you win we let you go the face disappeared from the window somebody had pulled at him raven it looked like she knew what a mean sonofabitch the warden could be and dyson was weak for her he was afraid shed talk him out of it you and me dyson to the death he called your choice of weapons then its over for everyone you man enough to face me alone you man enough to come away from that woman of yours nothing silence if nothing else his challenge was winning his own followers back he felt rugard wasnt asking them to do what he wouldnt do rugard was going to fight for it himself dyson he was getting impatient you willing to end this thing then the head came back no daniel shouted it echoed over the plaza you win you get the transmitter i win we get the activator and free passage that way somebody gets back and the bloodshed stops rugard was taken aback a bit give the fugitives the activator gamble everything he didnt like the strength of dysons voice you and me at dawn rugard daniel continued the challenge coming down defiantly almost mocking spears winner gets the others machine and free passage winner takes all damn him the warden was quiet absorbing his surprise at the acceptance they must be desperate because the transmitter still didnt work and yet that just drew them into his trap didnt it the fight was still his way out his key to escape because rugard sloan could take a pissant like dyson any day he could chew up little men like that with hardly a breath his domination complete and then leave all these cretins behind all right then he said it absently almost to himself then he raised his voice all right then you be ready boy dawn to the death he swaggered as he left the plaza a swagger for both dyson and his own men he knew he could take him take him easily but hed have to be careful rugard glanced back men without hope were dangerous ethan shook daniel awake light was filtering through the broken windows of the battered tower dawn was near surprising himself daniel hadnt brooded on his decision but slept slept well the battle had left him exhausted hed pushed aside ravens fear before it became his own now it was almost morning his last day in australia if he won the activator signaled for help and left with raven or his last morning ever its time mate ethan stood back to let him get up youre starting to sound like oliver you damn australian ethan smiled oliver came back last night you know after you were asleep through some tunnel under the city like a little mole pretty shaken when he got here i dont think hes used to what big groups of people do to each other im not used to it either do you want some breakfast it was amaya no im not hungry the statement made him chuckle at a memory what she asked looking at him strangely outback adventures screening lady she asked me what id want for my last meal she looked sad and what did you say that i wouldnt have an appetite he walked to the window it was light enough that he could see the tired convicts sleeping around the edges of the plaza keeping them penned he didnt see rugard it will all be over in fifteen seconds one way or another a trainer had said he turned back i need a good spear ill find one said ethan and id like to say goodbye to raven ill find her amaya said he sat by the window still waking up enjoying the growing pink splendor of the dawn in the direction of the sea such a lovely place australia he should be concentrating on tacticsit wouldnt hurt to know how to run the instructor had told him but his mind was so crowded with memories it was impossible to think about the fight microcore the tunnels the clearing where hed awakened in australia the wrecked transport the climb up the monolith it seemed like a dream that was the way to go he thought in a dream ethan came back with a spear and daniel hefted it for balance theyd fitted an old knife on the end and it was dark with blood which was good give rugard something to think about you okay ethan asked im okay there were steps on the concrete stairs and he turned to greet raven instead it was amaya looking worried ravens gone she said what i looked all through the tower and she isnt here neither is oliver shes gone with all her gear with her gear he looked at her dumbly not comprehending gone she nodded gone with the transmitter chapter twentynine ico washington felt vindicated as he clung awkwardly to a pony and rode hastily eastward away from gleneden with rugard and raven hed been right right about the enigmatic doubletalk of outback adventure right about his map and right about raven decarlo in the end shed deserted her friends and betrayed her lover in her desperation to get back to civilization shed cut a deal with the enemy ico didnt despise her for it he respected her it was the logical thing to do but it also confirmed his view of human nature people are what they are not what they pretend to be now they were trying to put as much distance between themselves and the derelict city as possible before signaling for rescue and escape raven had come to ico out of some sewer in the city accompanied by a strange smelly australian whod delivered her and then melted away in that deepest darkness before dawn the bad people need to stop the man shed called oliver had kept muttering raven had come whispering that she was going to take him ico washington home then she had him quietly summon rugard and they met in the empty showroom of an abandoned auto dealership there she professed that shed come to save the life of the suicidal dyson because of his lunatic agreement to a duel too vain still to admit she wanted to save her own skin like anyone else if you and i and ico run with the transmitter theres nothing and nobody for them to fight about any longer she explained rugard was suspicious whats to prevent me from slitting your throat and taking that transmitter right now the hover wont put down unless they see me they wont wait unless i walk to the door theyd shoot at you as soon as rescue you ask ico if you dont believe me rugard looked at ico thats the story shes been telling from the first ico conceded who knows if its the truth so lets cut a deal raven said fiercely i need your activator were almost to the coast and the transmitter still doesnt work we were wrong about the cone ico asked i dont know i dont think so if your pilot talked about walking here but maybe wed have to find a point where the coast extends farther eastward so right now i need the activator and you need me to call in the aircraft rugard scowled you promise to get me on board i promise wait a minute ico protested back at erehwon you said there was only room for two on a rescue craft i count three of us i can count she replied impatiently rugard can overpower the copilot we leave that aviator here take his place and have the two rear seats as well then the pilot flies us to wherever you two want to go but why take the runt along rugard asked dubiously because i got you here raven ignored him we both need him to help us watch each other she told rugard i dont trust you the warden spat i dont trust you either and neither of us trust him this keeps us all honest the warden smiled hey im the first honest man you ever met so now they rode awkwardly trotting on their unaccustomed transport taking three horses rugards army had gathered along the way the warden had distributed the few horses to reward whichever men held his favor at the moment like parceling out women or sharing the best food or intervening in a quarrel it maintained his hold over the convicts the man had a base political craftiness to him ico admitted when he vanished his mob would disintegrate like an unstable star raven was crafty as well or at least had a core of hard practicality ico looked over at her beauty cold and remote when directed at him he didnt like her never had but he admired her realism he saw now what shed been trying to protect order against anarchy shed always done what she had to do just as his own alliance with rugard had been necessary both had acted in order to get back they were no different morally speaking somebody had to get back if there was to be any hope for the others not everybody could get back so it came down to the most logical people her the united corporations minion he the only one who had really seen things clearly and rugard rugard to cow the pilot into taking them where they needed to go it should have been this way from the very beginning ico didnt feel pity for the ones being left behind after spending so much enforced time with them he wasnt at all sure united corporations didnt have the right idea about australia there was an advantage to stability after all to having a society safe from disruption from cretins like these an advantage to a pressurerelief valve when you had unruly children you sent them to a timeout corner was this continent any different even sending him here he realized had opened his eyes there was a method to their madness but it rankled ico that raven didnt trust him like dyson hadnt trusted him when they stopped at a stream to water their horses he approached her raven i didnt want to go to rugard he tried to justify i didnt want to leave you behind i just wanted to go too i needed to go as the one best able to understand the political situation back home if the rest of you hadnt run away from the compound we could have worked something out i know it i tried to reason with tucker but he wouldnt listen either none of this violence was necessary yes it was she replied he looked at her in frustration because i was going to leave you behind im not your friend ico youre just a means to an end to get away to save daniel rugard would have killed him easily and he would have died for nothing you did it to get away she didnt answer didnt want to because in the end her loyalty was stronger to united corporations than to the man whod fallen for her dyson was a fool she wasnt that beautiful the disappearance of raven and rugard hit the warring groups hard all that blood and then theyd been abandoned in australia after all daniel had been prepared to die to end the fighting but in the cool ruins of the mornings dawn he found hed been condemned to a worse fate abandonment by the woman he loved shes trying to save you amaya reasoned thats the only way she wouldve gone with rugard and ico you know that i dont know it his reply was hollow he didnt know anything anymore thats whats so hard to accept why would she steal off like that without a word i mean i felt id finally broken through to her to leave me with no way to know amaya looked at him sadly she didnt know why either to slip away without a word or a message seemed a betrayal worse than taking the transmitter didnt raven love at all in the tumult of the last few months amayas own life had changed profoundly shed found herself a confidence in herself as a resourceful valuable human being and once shed done that shed found a man named ethan she was beginning to love deeply would she leave him with no explanation it would kill her if he left that way as for the transmitter she was relieved it was finally gone and with it all the trouble it had caused she didnt need to get back not anymore daniels group came out of the office tower at midmorning their hands empty rugards demoralized army met them the same way with the transmitter gone there was nothing to fight about they gathered in the plaza were not getting back are we one of the convicts asked plaintively youve gotten back as far as youre going to go maybe we can catch them wrench said darkly together no daniel said they took horses right and i told you the truth only two can go on any rescue plane rugard misled you youd never have gotten out of australia anyway the convict studied the office tower gloomily weve been fighting over nothing it always seems like something at the time now listen were marooned here unless a miracle happens but this is good country my group is going to keep heading east until we reach the ocean thats what we trekkers set out to do and its a kind of closure for us it wont get us back anymore but well have gotten someplace they looked pained and confused or weve always been there said amaya from the very beginning he nodded so now you have to decide i dont care what your past was i dont care what we did to each other last night you can join us if you care to if you behave i expect well try to settle down somewhere and make a new community better than the ones we came from we dont want anything from you and we dont have anything for you but if youre done fighting so are we in the end about a dozen of rugards followers joined daniel as well as the frightened women of the cohort of joy the others drifted off many of them dazed by their sudden freedom possibility it was the most frightening thing about the wilderness wrench took him aside look he confessed i dont know much except fighting can i come with you anyway daniel looked him up and down to do what im strong i can work daniel sighed debating this man looked like an animal and he remembered him from the dam if you come with us wrench you have to be civilized you have to follow the rules can you do that what rules i dont know well have to make some he winced at his own words the trio stopped at a grassy ridge about thirty miles east of gleneden in the distance was the glimmer of the sea rugard pointed at raven can you make it work from here i hope then get to it im late for my appointment with a soaking tub two asian whores and a bottle of scotch youre quite the man of refinement warden ico remarked im quite the man of fucking appetites lord he was tired of having to be polite to these two just a few more hours if the bitch thought hed forgotten her treachery then she had quite the education coming shed be getting off the hover with him at a place of his choosing and then hed begin to teach her how to beg the weasel hed simply destroy it was late afternoon by now the light golden she took the two pieces of the transmitter and united them swiftly this time using the electronic supplies that ico had safeguarded across the breadth of australia then they sat regarding it for a moment all their hopes on two linked boxes of battered metal would the batteries still work would anyone even listen she switched it on it pulsed as before but this time its digital readout displayed their geographic coordinates it could read the global positioning system satellites overhead the electronic fog had lifted its penetrating the cone she reported it can send and receive if i had the right equipment i could phone my parents i could receive some news were back in a way rugard looked sourly out from the ridge to the hills along the coast in the distance were the ruins of another town glimmering and decayed not yet were still in a fucking graveyard what do we do now ico said we wait she said were a thousand miles from where they expected to get this signal i have no idea how theyll react to it or how long it will take what if it doesnt come rugard snorted then i cut out your little weasel heart before our exfriends catch up with us and cut out ours it took eleven hours the rescue craft came in at the end of a long night lightless and with a low whine dropping from the heavens like a spaceship or angel they were only certain it was there when a stabbing spotlight painted the ridge with illumination raven stood in the glare get ready ico and rugard began circling around outside the cone of light the craft slipped in closer the grass flattening down beneath its blowers and shuddering from the exhaust how many other hovers were also dropping down across australia this night depositing fresh groups of eager outback adventurers and sullen frightened convicts the rear cockpit door swung open and she ran for it what the hell are you doing here the pilot barked at her i had some problems its quite a story the beacon you have both parts a light was in her eyes as he scanned her identity picture she wondered how close to it she still looked more like a wild woman now she supposed a wilderness woman she nodded and pointed back there in the grass you know we cant leave that crap here go get it now now move he glanced around nervously they hated to touch down in this place she sprinted back trusting their eyes would hold on her form as she did so that gave enough time rugard and ico rushed the hover from the other side and before the pilots could react the convict was on top of them his knife at the copilots throat they held the gate for us rugard cooed arent you going to say welcome aboard ico crawled past him and began hunting for a seat belt to snap himself in raven came running back and threw the transmitter and activator on board who are these guys the pilot asked the ones youre taking back theres not room for three cant you see that indeed i can rugard agreed you friend here is getting off he pulled the knife tighter to the copilots throat and began to half haul him out of the aircraft the mans hand drifted and the knife cut into flesh you reach for that gun again rugard hissed to his victim and youll deplane dead let him go raven said hes in your spot bitch no he isnt im staying here the men turned to look at her you two go on ico do what you think best when you get back are you crazy ico protested this is the only ticket home i dont want to go back and i dont want the transmitter either its caused nothing but trouble im staying in australia but why she smiled then a secret smile to herself when i went outside i found my inside she explained softly im in love with a man with a place and maybe someday with myself there was a dead silence rugard stared at her in disbelief shed give up the world to stay with a loser like dyson he broke into a harsh laugh youre choosing squalor i sent people here and ive sent enough its time to see what it was i was trying to send them to to hell ico cried she just smiled at him goodbye ico the men looked at each other then shrugged rugard confiscated the copilots gun took his knife away from the mans throat and shoved him back into place then he settled into the seat behind him fine what do i care the bitch was getting away again but so what staying in the wilderness was a worse fate than anything he could devise for her shed suffer a lifetime youre welcome to it this man raven told the pilots pointing to ico is my designated successor and replacement he can tell my superiors everything i can about conditions here probably more hes earned the right to get back do you understand slowly they nodded be careful of the other one she said he has a temper damn right i do then before anyone could change their mind she ran from the rescue craft and vanished in the bush like an extinguished spark the hover lights switched off and the craft began rising into the sky stay off the com rugard told the pilots if you need to talk you can chat with me raven looked up at the hovers shadow wheeling away across the stars and gulped im trying to lose my way shed once told daniel it had seemed like a clever line at the time now it was simply true then she walked back down the ridge to find her way with the man she loved the hover swung out over a glittering sea and followed a road of moonlight the illumination was so bright they could see the dark pattern of huge reefs below the water sparkling with luminescence where are we going ico asked to a recovery ship offshore the pilot replied no were not said rugard he tapped the pilots shoulder with the gun set a course for jakarta theres a lot of islands in indonesia a man can get lost in theyll be suspicious if we turn off course the pilot warned then go down to wave level and get off their fucking radar you moron he grinned this is your captain speaking they descended to skim the sea surface as they flew north spray speckling the hover canopy rugard sat back more easily the knife in one hand and the gun in the other hed done it he was getting back hed slipped out of the toughest cage theyd devised for him yet and he had a lot of plans to make up for lost time see how easy life is when you just take what you want he told ico and after that little spell of purgatory ive got a lot of taking to do a lot of taking indeed youre a moralimpaired arent you the pilot accused i am the fucking face of pure evil my friend your worst nightmare sitting just one row behind you thats why i say and you do you got that right the pilots hand had drifted to an armrest console now a finger extended and before ico could open his mouth to ask why there was a bang a howling hiss and rugard was gone ico was stunned slammed aside so hard that the wind had been knocked out of him rugard sloan and his flight chair had been shot out of the aircraft with a small explosion moist tropic air now roaring into the emptiness where the convict had sat a moment before later much later ico would remember hed heard a trailing scream but maybe that was just his imagination certainly there was an impressive splash where the convict hit the ocean twenty miles from the australian coast the hover canopy snapped back down and the shriek of wind was shut out they banked some of the biggest sharks in the world down there the pilot commented of course he might never come conscious enough to notice since his chute didnt have time to deploy ico sat as if made of stone his arm bruised from where the adjacent chair had erupted upward the emptiness of the space it had occupied felt like an abyss these qs all have ejection seats the copilot added of course a smart boy like you probably knew that didnt you ico opened his mouth but could say nothing his bowels felt like water he was waiting to be fired out into space had raven known now the pilot continued in a drawl where was it you wanted to go where wherever you take me ico stammered thats what i thought and the craft set a steady course to the east chapter thirty what do you miss most daniel asked his wife raven was showing now swelling like a ripe melon but they still came for daily walks they followed a grassy ridge above the watered valley where the group had finally settled to the east the sea glittered to the west blue mountains loomed it was such soft land after the desert a place kissed by rain who says i miss anything she sat on a rock sighing contentedly and feeling her unfamiliar roundness she wasnt really tired but she stopped more frequently now for the baby making sure the new australian inside her had time to absorb the country as she was doing she could see the new wood of their cabin in the glade below and a wisp of smoke from the forge where wrench improbably content was developing a new skill refashioning salvaged metal she was alive and in love if a little breathless the climate was good and the potential of this place boundless i dont she replied simply come on you know you do we all do all right what do you miss he considered looking down at their new village domestic animals gone wild had been captured to start new herds and overgrown fields had been recleared for new crops theyd been unanimous in agreeing to not settle in the sad ruins of an abandoned city choosing this new site instead but they made frequent trips to town to salvage the fundamentals of survival windmills turned lazily and a waterwheel spun with tireless regularity they had a crude dynamo and lights now the pooling of skills had lifted them out of the stone age rather rapidly and they lived better than most people of just a couple centuries ago they were already planning a school and children to fill it i miss knowing he reflected in the months since ico and rugard had disappeared thered been no sign that anyone knew of their exile sometimes they spied flashes of light high in the sky and wondered if there were aircraft or surveillance drones far overhead if so they were as remote as heaven periodically another exhausted adventurer would stagger in from the west a refugee from outback adventure recounting a familiar struggle for survival nothing seemed to have changed their isolation continued i like the work i do now daniel went on build this grow that the payoff is tangible and it seems honest and i dont miss the entertainment of the old world its like a blinding noise has fallen away thats allowed me to see i like our new stories told around the fire and our walks and our long slow meals i like knowing people again knowing them deeply even their faults my friendships are deeper here i like belonging to this place me too daniel i miss the obvious things he admitted the lack of medical expertise for instance were young and healthy now but what if we really stay here all our lives i worry about the pregnancy she shrugged women had babies without doctors for a long time im not afraid i should miss the art and science i suppose but i dont it didnt mean anything to me in the life before i should miss the stores but i like making things for myself its more satisfying than buying i should miss ideas but were finding old books and now i have time to read them i feel healthier than i ever have since we walk everywhere it would be nice to flip a switch once in a while but since there are no switches no one else has them either i dont even really miss that all that ive lost has been filled up with other things the land the animals the friends you so why did you even ask the question he sat on the grass beside her i still feel guilty i suppose that you didnt go guilty you werent even there guilty that i was so irresistible that you couldnt bear to leave me she laughed oh please guilty that i couldnt give you a proper ring find us a proper church see you in a proper dress she shook her head i dont miss any of those things i miss she pondered for a minute chocolate he nodded okay theres one coffee she went on ouch i remember that perfume ice cream toilet paper aspirin magazines music symphonic music refrigeration a laundry immunizations new underwear a flush toilet she looked at him mischievously okay enough already were working on some of those things he added defensively i know and i dont really miss them daniel i mean if i had to choose between them and this place or maybe i should say that time and this time i thought id desperately miss them when i was back in that world and even when i first came to this one i did miss them but they were just things not happiness and somehow the need for them has subsided id miss my old sense of belonging to my company but instead i belong here people have been very kind after what ive done im astonished at what i dont miss sometimes i miss the trek he said when it was just the four of us its easier now and more secure but when you add all these people that meeting last night she laughed thered been an argument about sanitation more rules daniel had been trying to back away from his role as de facto mayor but ethan wanted a charter sometimes i miss you she said when the others demand so much of your time i dont want to be sucked in by that i want a balance and sometimes i miss not knowing like you i wonder how wed react if we did know if we still had a choice they sat there soaking up the sun and then a blackclothed figure emerged from the edge of a wood and walked slowly toward them his palms upraised and empty his eyes cautiously watching he stopped a few feet from them ive been listening said elliott coyle he was stylishly dressed as before his kangaroo pin a point of contrasting brightness there was a directional cone at his belt to eavesdrop on conversations but otherwise he carried nothing coyle regarded them with calm purpose a half smile on his lips like a creature from a dream or the end of one hello daniel raven its been a long time they stared at the outback adventure counselor in shock coyle stood without apology or surprise as if this reunion should after all have been expected he studied them curiously as if they were the oddity not him youre looking well i see they were speechless its true what they say about motherhood making you glow daniel felt irritated at that feeling the observation from this man whod helped put them here was presumptuous he opened his mouth to retort but raven put her hand on his arm what are you doing here she asked instead weve been watching you monitoring your progress even logging your daily walks i had a hover set down last night and ive been waiting for you im sorry about the spying but i wanted to approach at a proper time youre in a reflective mood today so my timing is impeccable timing for what she asked ive come to bring you back as if the answer was obvious what your adventure is over youve passed they looked at him as if he was crazy we didnt lie to you exodus port exists but just not in the way you expected when youre ready we come get you when we judge its time is this some kind of joke its no joke daniel we told you it would be the toughest test on the face of the earth very few pass it you two have its time to come back to united corporations with me he nodded reassuringly ico is waiting youre taking us all back raven tried to clarify not all of you not yet just you two for now a few more maybe when theyre ready when theyve developed the skills needed to contribute to the united corporations world they looked at him blankly awash in so many conflicting emotions that they didnt know how to respond how did you first find us daniel finally asked ico of course he told us where to look so he made it yes he made it he waited for the next question and rugard sloan raven asked did not and now were to trust you coyle glanced up at the sky surveillance data helped pin your position and progress its quite impressive frankly your little group is outside all theoretical parameters for this point in time you two have exceeded all projections youve become a leader daniel an organization man after all so its time to leave the land of the losers and come back to modern life time to abandon the past for the future like you daniel said coyle nodded yes like me come back to the companies that cooked up this monstrous hoax that marooned us here that let people die like flies come back with you come back like i came back coyle replied softly angry smart transformed dont you think i felt the same way as you do now i was building a boat to float off when they finally offered me exodus i was furious i wanted to expose everything but when i thought about it when i talked it over with them and let all my frustration pour out i realized i was really angry at myself for being blind so long about me this place and what was best for the wider world outback adventure didnt lie to you two not really we told you which way to go we told you it would be hard and dangerous we told you what you needed to survive and told you only enough to make you appreciate the value of civilized society the only trick was that you didnt escape to a refuge you left it eden is back there with me with united corporations where all your needs are taken care of by machines where life is the easiest its ever been thats the lesson of this nightmare that united corporations doesnt just work that its vital it needs to be protected australia protects it i protect it just like the centurions once protected rome no daniel said slowly what you do is murder what we do is give people what they want we make clear the danger in that the wilderness is a hard lesson so the few with a knack for survival and organization are taken back always what if they dont want to come thats not really an option if we left you here youd corrupt the wilderness australia is a home for social misfits not a breeding ground for wouldbe pioneers youve come through the plagues of disorder daniel its time for exodus and the price home theres a few confidentiality forms to sign ico did a discussion of how your new talents might best be used in return you win an important prestigious life more money than you dreamed and as much responsibility as you can handle were really quite a remarkable fraternity let me be the first to congratulate you he waited daniel glanced at raven the gentle swelling of her breasts and abdomen it would be easier to go back boring perhaps but safer and more comfortable their child nursed and schooled their child raised to be no raven said were not coming back with you elliott he shrugged thats a common early reaction were not coming back with you because youre not from some kind of technological heaven youre from an oppressive social hell she went on calmly it was a place i believed in with all my heart but it required my heart it devoured and froze it it left me wedded to stability instead of possibility and tore me in half youre a demon elliott on a devils mission youve got the blood of a thousand people on your hands ten thousand ive seen them ive seen the bones youre a corporate monster a robot with no soul and i want my baby as far away from you and your kind as he or she can be i despise united corporations coyle had taken a step back at this assault thats not fair he objected raising his hands do you think that campground of yours over the hill is in any way realistic do you think twelve billion people can live like we can live like this daniel interrupted quietly we earned the right by coming here and surviving here you gave us that right by sending us here we want to make a new society and already its more real more satisfying than anything your world has to offer no coyle shook his head no no no im sure your hamlet is quaint he conceded the condescension plain but cant you see the irony here youre not wandering youre not nomads youre not some kind of new human reborn into some kind of grace youre settling youre becoming us by building your new civilization by doing what comes naturally to our species youre setting out to destroy the very wilderness you came here for you cant escape human nature daniel you cant escape your own instincts by building your village youre just starting down the road to another united corporations world except with more dirt and disease along the way history will simply repeat itself its inevitable cut the pain short and come with me its not inevitable were going to strike a balance and make a better world weve learned from your mistakes thats not what history teaches its an endless wheel of mistakes until now until here the other thing our species does is learn their counselors look grew impatient if we have to we can destroy you he warned no you cant raven replied if you come well go back into the bush until you go away if you try to hunt us down your secret cant be kept from the thousands of soldiers it would take to prosecute such a war and even if you did destroy us it would only prove how phony and bankrupt all your pretensions about this place are come after us elliott and the truth about this place will pull your pyramids down around your ears its your society thats fragile that cant tolerate questions or challenge that has to fear its own best people and turn its back on its worst so if you try to harm us it will ultimately be we who destroy you leave us alone as a secret a rumor a myth we want nothing from your world you cant survive in the long run its impossible people survived here for fifty thousand years i dont want you wasted then stop sacrificing people here cultivate your socalled misfits before your civilization fossilizes because if you dont use them we will in our new society and because of that were your only hope she looked at him evenly coyles mouth was a line united corporations has no need for your hope goodbye elliott raven took daniels hand squeezed it and turning began walking away their counselor stood rigid looking after them are you okay daniel asked her glancing back at the man in black she nodded glancing up at the sunlight filtered by the trees very okay its the opportunity of a lifetime ico washington shook the candidates hand reassuringly smiled confidently and saw himself what he had once been in the outback adventure clients eyes unhappy suspicious anxious hopeful vain they were all like that the young men and women who came through his door walking time bombs of dissatisfaction they would go and learn and come back or not there was always doubt of course these were people filled with doubt so if you could never decide for them that was against the rules to push too hard it was necessary to reassure its the perfect experience for a dynamic independent individual like you he recited a winwin opportunity for everyone it changed my life im sure it will yours it was so easy just tell the truth the recruit left liberated as always by the drastic decision and the vacuuming of his savings ico stood from his desk and stretched looking out the tinted glass window the city ran to the horizon a chessboard of light as dusk fell the office towers the boards strategic pieces ten millennia of human thought had created this it was the apex of civilized achievement and he its unsung defender finally he had a job he succeeded in ico looked at the glow of corporate names the tracery of lasers the streams of homeward traffic the city throbbed with the reassurance of ten million human hearts he saw it differently since hed come back saw what it all was for so strange then that daniel and raven had stayed their decision troubled him hed thought of contacting the cyber underground of course but on reflection thought better of it it would become another rumor of losers and people wouldnt understand it would change nothing or ruin everything so hed done for daniel and raven what he could more than theyd ever done for him told of their progress urged their rescue coyle had gone himself and come back moody and irritable the pair had sent him away he thought hed known them better than that what had the whole trip been about if not getting back as he looked out he saw his own reflection in the glass his tan fading now his body a little softer but a different confidence surely hed done the right thing hadnt he for a moment he saw in the glow of the city lights the red dust of australia and he recalled the snowwhite trunks of the twisting ghost gums the unreal clarity of it a strange strange place his nightmares of it were of hot sand and relentless pursuit so sometimes after jerking awake in his vast soft bed the shadows of his condominium looming and the drumming of the city a mutter beyond his thick walls hed try to remember the sound of the birds so many birds but they wouldnt come to him just as well he wondered for the thousandth time if virus had really been an accident then ico sat at his console clicked up his schedule and glanced at his watch the one hed worn to the wilderness your next appointment is here mr washington more william dietrich please keep reading for a bonus excerpt from dark winter a new warner book available wherever books are sold sometimes you have to go into nothing to get what you want that was the jed lewis theory anyway west texas oil patch saudi the north slope hadnt worked for him yet but one kind of extreme had led to another one kind of quest to its polar opposite sometimes life patterns like that when you keep changing your mind about what it is you do want so now hed come to the very end of the world and was peering over its edge too late to turn back hoping that in the farthest place on earth hed finally fit in atone to himself for his own confusion of purpose belong maybe the pole jim sparco had seduced him feels closer to the stars than anyplace on earth its high desert a desert of ice and the airs so dry that it feels like you can eat the stars bites of candy the climatologist had gripped his arm the south pole lewis its there you realize how cold the universe really is the money had almost been secondary theyd understood each other sparco and he this longing for the desolate places a place uncomplicated pure except for their rock of course that raised questions it was their pebble their tumor their apple the world is round but it has an edge a cold crustal wrinkle called the transantarctic range runs for more than a thousand miles and divides antarctica in two on the north side of the mountains is a haunting but recognizable landscape of glacier and mountain and frozen ocean an ice age world yes but still a world our world to its south toward the pole is an ice cap so deep and vast and empty as to seem unformed and unimagined a vacuum a blank the white clay of god lewis crossed in the sinking light of antarctic autumn he was exhausted from thirty hours of flying constricted by thirtyfive pounds of polar clothing and weary of the noisy dimness of the lc military transport plane its webbed seats pinching circulation and its schizophrenic ventilation blowing hot and cold he was also entranced by beauty the sun was slowly dipping toward a sixmonth night and the aqua crevasses and sugared crags below were melodramatic with blaze and shadow golden photons bouncing off virginal snow created a hazed fire frozen seas looked like cracked porcelain unnamed peaks reared out of fogs thick as frosting and glaciers grinned with splintery teeth attached to blue gums it was all quite primeval untrodden and unspoiled a white board to redraw yourself the kind of place where he could be whatever he made himself whatever he announced himself to be the transantarctic range is like a dam however holding behind it a plateau of twomilethick polar ice like a police line braced against a pressing crowd a hundred thousand years of accumulated snowfall a few peaks at the edge of the ice plateau bravely poke their snouts up as if to tread water but then farther south relief disappears altogether the glaciers vanish so do ridges crevasses and theatrical light what follows is utter flatness a frozen mesa as big as the contiguous united states when the airplane crossed the mountains it entered something fundamentally different lewis realized it was then that his excitement began to turn to disquiet imagine an infinite sheet of paper no not infinite because the curve of the earth provides a kind of boundary except that the horizon itself is foggy and indistinct with floating ice crystals suspended like diamond dust so that the snow merges without definition into pale sky there was nothing to see from the tiny scratched windows of the national guard transport no relief no reference point no imperfection when he thought he saw undulations in the snow the load master informed him he was merely looking at the shadow of cirrus clouds far overhead when he thought he saw a track across the snow left by a tractor or snowmobile perhaps the load master pointed to a contrail being left by an outgoing transport his track was the shadow across the sky of that dissipating streak lewis moved among the pallets of cargo from window to window waiting for something to happen nothing did the plane lumbered on cold slithering along its fuselage he checked his watch as if it still meant anything in a place where the sun went haywire and looked out again nothing he looked out a different window no movie would start on the blank screen below no progress could be discerned he searched a sky and plateau that seemed blank mirrors of each other vainly searching for some rip some imperfection some reassurance that he was someplace nothing he sat on his web seat and chewed a cold lunch after a drag of time the guardsman cuffed his shoulder and lewis stood again looking where the sergeant pointed far away there was a pimple on the vastness a tiny bug a freckle a period with a white runway attached to make a kind of exclamation mark amundsenscott base named by americans for the norwegian who got there first in and the hardluck brit who froze to death weeks later after seconding at point zero lewis made out a bottle cap of a dome that sheltered the south poles central buildings and an orbit of smaller structures like specks of sand from the air the human settlement was remarkable only for its insignificance the buildings fit in a circle about a mile wide altogether the load master shouted to him over the roar of the engines doesnt look like much does it lewis didnt reply you staying the winter he shrugged glad its you and not me they buckled in the snow seeming to swell up to meet them his heart accelerating during that disquieting gap between air and ground and then with a thump and a bang they were down swerving slightly as the skis skidded on the ice the plane shuddered as it taxied continuing to vibrate when it stopped because the pilots didnt dare shut down the engines lewis stood stiff and apprehensive he was the only passenger the last arrival of the season an antimigrant swimming against the tide of humans fleeing north well his timing had never been the best the cargo ramp opened to a shriek of white and the cold hit him like a slap it was palpable like a force you waded into we had a fly stowaway from new zealand one time the load master shouted his military mustache almost brushing lewiss ear the propellers were still whirling so the hubs wouldnt freeze and the national guard sergeant needed this intimacy to be heard buzzed like a bastard for three thousand miles when we opened the doors it flew to the light and made it three feet three feet then the fucker dropped like a stone the man laughed dizzy lewis walked out he couldnt get a proper breath there was a crowd of orangeparka people at the edge of the runway waving but fidgety anxious to get away the last of the summer crew going home snow from the prop wash blew over them hazing them as if they were already being erased awkward from his duffel and enormous whiteplastic polar boots lewis staggered toward the group in seeming supplication a figure detached from the crowd to meet him the mans hood was up and all jed could see were goggles and frosted beard framed by a ruff of fur lewis had been supplied the same governmentissue parka hed been told it cost seven hundred dollars and a sacrificial fox jed lewis it was a shout above the noise a nod his own goggles giving the pole a pissyellow tint the man reached not to shake hands but to shoulder the duffel he turned to the others lets move people lets get this cargo off so you can all go home his goggles rotated across their rank taking mental roll wheres tyson there was a long moment of silence goggled heads turning a few smiles of unease and amusement in their coldweather gear everyone looked alike except for strips on their coats with blockletter name tags sulking someone finally called jeds greeter stiffened there was another silence beneath the drum of the engines someone shrugging his guide sucking in an unhappy breath well someone go the hell and find him and tell him to get the damn sled up here so we can get this plane off hes got eight long months to sulk the others shifted uncomfortably the man turned back to lewis not waiting to see if anyone followed his command this way they set off toward the central aluminum geodesic dome halfburied by drifting snow their pace briskly impatient lewis looked back parts of the orangeclad group now breaking off to troop to the plane then ahead to the dome an upended silver saucer dramatic and odd like surplused flotsam from a worlds fair hed read the dimensions fiftyfive feet high a hundred and sixtyfour feet in diameter an american flag snapped at the top its edge ragged its gunshot stutter audible now above the idle of the plane streaks of snow dust curved across the top of the dome in neatly drawn parabolas jeds nose hairs had already frozen the cold ached in his lungs his goggles were fogging up and his cheeks felt numb hed only been outside a few minutes it was worse than he expected they descended a snowy ramp to a dark garagesized entrance at the base of the dome lewis mincing in his frankensteinsized boots so he wouldnt fall and slide on his butt his guide paused to wait for him and let their eyes adjust to the dimness inside the door two cavelike corrugatedsteel arches extended into gloom to his left and right biomed and the fuel arch that way generators and garage over here jed had a shadowy impression of walls and doors of plywood and steel unpainted and utilitarian before he could peek into the arched tunnels he was led straight ahead the dome where were quartered is this way the overturned bowl shielded the core of the south pole base like a military helmet keeping warmthsucking wind and blowing snow off the metal boxes where people lived three of these boxcarshaped structures colored orange sat on short stilts under its shelter since the base was built on snow the powder didnt stop at the entrance but formed the dome floor drifting over wooden crates and mounding against the orange housing units dirt and grease had colored the snow tan like sand it never melts his guide said scuffing at it the ambient temperature in here is fiftyone below lewis tilted his head back there was a hole at the top of the dome that let in pale light from a remote sky the entire underside of the uninsulated structure was covered with steel gray icicles pointing downward like a roof of nails it was beautiful and forbidding at the same time you didnt finish the roof ventilation someone bumped lewis and he staggered to one side it was another winterover rushing a crate of fresh fruit to the galley before it could harden in the cold sorry freshies are like gold they followed the hurrying man to a freezerlike door and opened it for him to get inside you pulled a metal rod sideways and tugged at a slab like a wall jed realized that the freezer wasnt inside here it was the outside anything not carried into the orange housing modules would turn hard as a brick they followed the fruit bearer there was a vestibule hung with parkas and beyond it a galley of bright fluorescent light warmth and the excited chatter of more people saying goodbye their duffels were heaped like sandbags people were packed to go his guide let jeds gear drop with a thud and pushed back his goggles and hood rod cameron station manager hi lewis tried to fix the face but the men in their parkas looked alike he had an impression of beard chapped skin and red raccoon lines where the goggles cut lewis was wondering about the absentee at the plane someone not show up for work cameron frowned he had a look of rugged selfconfidence that came from coping with cold and administration and a hint of strain for the same reason the pole wore on you egos in kindergarten he shook his head my job is to herd cats and im having a bad day we had a little alarm last night alarm the heat went off oh we got it back on oh the station manager studied the newcomer jed still looked smooth sandyhaired and tanned with the easy tautness of the recreational athlete it would pass you got your file lewis dug in his duffel and fished out a worn manila envelope with employment forms medical records dental x rays and a list of the personal belongings hed shipped to the pole in advance of his own arrival his new boss glanced inside as if to confirm jeds presence with paper then put the folder under his arm ive got to go back outside to see this last plane off cameron said ill show you around later but right now its best to just sit and drink jed looked around the galley in confusion i mean drink water the altitude you feel lousy right its okay fingies are supposed to fingie fngi fucking new guy on the ice thats you lewis failed at a grin latecomer just new everybodys a fingie at first we know were lucky to get you last minute like this jim sparco emailed about you like the second coming i needed a job yeah he explained that i think its cool that you quit big oil cameron gave a nod of approval thats me man of principle lewis had a headache from the altitude course we need their shit to keep from freezing down here not from a wildlife refuge you dont and you just walked out they werent about to give me a helicopter ride that took some guts it had to be done cameron tried to assess the new man lewis looked tired disoriented chest rising and falling halfexcited and halfafraid they all started like that the station manager turned back to the door impatient to get away and considered whether to say anything else ive got to go get the plane off he finally said again you know what that means dont you what that you cant quit down here a stream of people followed cameron out some looking at lewis curiously and others ignoring him the winterovers going to offload the supplies and the last from summer flying home the pole had a brief fourmonth window when weather permitted incoming flights then in february the last plane left fleeing north like a migrating bird in winter it was too dark to see too windy to keep the ice runway clear and too cold to risk a landing struts could snap hydraulics fail doors fail to open or close the sun set on march the equinox and wouldnt rise again until september from february to october the base was as remote as the moon there were twentysix winterovers who retreated under the dome to maintain its functions and take astronomical and weather readings eight women and eighteen men this year it was like being on a submarine or space station you had to commit the galley had emptied and lewis took a place at a formica table the room was lowceilinged bright and warm a bulletin board was thick with paper a juice dispenser burbled and in the corner a television monitor displayed outside temperatures it was fiftyeight below zero near the runway the breeze lowering the windchill to minus eightyone the reading was an abstraction except for the freezer door hed come through that was old and cold leaked around its edges to rime its inner face with frost the frost reached all the way across it in stripes like fingers the pattern reminded lewis of a giant hand trying to yank the door away drink as much as you can best cure for the altitude lewis looked up it was the cook bald except for a topknot that hung from the back of his head his skull looked knobby as if knocked around more than once and he had a gray mustache and forearms tattooed with a bear and eagle here was somebody easy to remember it doesnt look high thats because its flat youre sitting on ice almost two miles thick our elevation is ninetythree hundred and the thinning of the atmosphere at the poles makes the effective altitude closer to eleven thousand walking out of that transport is like being dumped on the crest of the rockies your body will adjust in a few days i feel hammered the short walk from the plane had made him ill youll be racing around the world before you know it around the world around the stake that marks the pole he sat down wade pulaski chief cook and bottle washer best chef for nine hundred miles i cant claim any farther because cathy costello back at mcmurdo is pretty good too mcmurdo was the main american base in antarctica located on the coast jedediah lewis polar weatherman he shook jedediah your parents religious more like hippies i think when it was a fad but its biblical right youre a prophet oracle of climate change by temporary opportunity rock hound by training and its actually just another name for solomon beloved of the lord so youre wise his head was pounding i take my name as gods little joke what do you mean by rock hound geologist thats my real job so you come to the one place on earth where there arent any rocks doctor bob will have a field day with that one whos doctor bob our new shrink nasa sent him down to do a head job on us before they plant too many people on the space station hes wintering over to write us up while we fuck with each others minds he thinks were all escapists lewis smiled rod cameron just told me we cant quit thats what i told doctor bob its like being paid to go to prison and yet we volunteered im on my third season pulaski stretched out his arms in mock enthusiasm as if to claim ownership i cant stay away if the generators stop like they did last night weve got maybe a few hours but we always get them running again whyd they stop some moron turned the wrong valve rod went ballistic which meant nobody was in a mood to confess this morning but it was a stupid annoyance not a threat and youre going to learn that as long as you dont freeze to death things are really good down here especially now that the last of summer camp is leaving and the bureaucrats are ten thousand miles away i give you better food than youd get back home and theres no bullshit at the pole theres no clock to punch no bills no taxes no traffic no newspapers no nothing after today everything calms down and this becomes the sanest place on earth cozier than most families and after eight toasty months you come out with your head straight and your money saved its paradise man lewis reserved agreement you got any aspirin sure the cook got a bottle from the kitchen and brought it back you feel like shit right now but youll get better i know you even acclimate to the cold a little i know pulaski went to the counter where food was passed he bent under it to get a commissarysized soup can its label stripped and its inside cleaned to a bright copper here your arrival present whats this for lewis realized he felt stupid from the altitude youll drink all day and pee all night this first night its your body adjusting to the cold and altitude this can saves you about three hundred trips to the real can a chamber pot welcome to planet cueball fingie
