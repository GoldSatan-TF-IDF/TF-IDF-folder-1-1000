peachtree the guns of the south and the great war and world at war series a hugo winner and nebula finalist he lives in los angeles i off to the north and west an army loyal to king avram marched through crumbling northern defenses in peachtree province toward the western ocean due west in parthenia province another southron army loyal to avram laid siege to pierreville if the great fortress fell nonesuch the capital of the rebel grand duke geoffreyhe called himself king geoffrey a title no one but his fellow traitors acknowledgedwould also fall and in short order general hesmucet led the soldiers marching through peachtree marshal bart led the soldiers besieging pierreville doubting george doubting george sat in ramblerton twiddling his thumbs the war between brothers in the kingdom of detina was deep into its fourth year now when king avram ascended to the throne hed let the world know he intended to make citizens of the blond serfs who labored on the nobles great estates in the northern provinces and geoffrey his cousin had promptly led the noblesand the rest of the northinto rebellion declaring avram had no right to do any such thing a few southron men reckoning provincial prerogative more important than the true successionor sometimes just wed to northern womenhad thrown in with the uprising against avram and a few northerners reckoning a single kingdom of detina more important than holding the serfs in bondage had remained loyal to the proper king the rightful king lieutenant general george was one of those men geoffrey had promptly confiscated his estates in parthenia that was how the game was played these days duke edward of arlington who commanded geoffreys most important force the army of southern parthenia had had his estates close by king avrams black palace in georgetown avram had confiscated them as soon as his soldiers overran them in the early days of the war i got the same punishment for being loyal as duke edward did for being a traitor george thought is that fair is that just i doubt it george said aloud he used the phrase a lot often enough to have given him his nickname he was a burly man in his early forties with a typical dark detinan beard full and curly that gray was just beginning to streak he muttered to himself not words but a discontented rumble down deep in his throat the lion god might have made a noise like that when he contemplated chewing on the souls of sinners no good deed goes unpunished doubting george said when the mutters turned into words again hed done as much hard fighting as any southron officer in the war if it hadnt been for his stand there on merkles hill by the river of death the whole southron cause in the east might have unraveled under the hammer blows of count thraxton the braggarts sorcery and what was his reward how had a grateful kingdom shown him its appreciation for all hed done for all hed sacrificed more words emerged here i am in ramblerton twiddling my godsdamned thumbs ramblerton was the capital of franklin it lay by the bank of the cumbersome river in the southeastern part of the province doubting george might have been farther out of the fight down in new eborac city but not by much hed done the work and others had got the glory the war looked well on the way toward being won he was glad of that he would have been even gladder to have a bigger part in it a sentry stuck his head into lieutenant general georges office beg your pardon sir he said but major alva would like to see you if youve got the time oh yes ive got the time george replied by the thunderers beard to the seven hells with me if i can think of anything ive got more of the sentry withdrew a moment later major alva came in he looked preposterously young to be a major but for one thing a lot of officers in this war were preposterously young and for another he was a wizard and so an officer at least as much by courtesy as because he was expected to command soldiers in the field major alva in fact was short on just about everything that made soldiers what they were his gray wizards robe hung from his scrawny frame his beard hadnt been combed any time lately he plainly needed to remind himself to salute lieutenant general george but he was also far and away the best wizard in doubting georges armymaybe the best wizard in any southron army before the war southron mages had done most of their work in manufactories which didnt suit them for battle magic wizards in the north had worked hard to keep the serfs in line and overawed which did in the early years of the war northern prowess at wizardry had helped hold back southron numbers now now doubting george hoped it wouldnt any more nodding to alva he said what can i do for you major somethings going on alva said lieutenant general george folded his arms across his broad chest and waited alva was swarthy but not swarthy enough to keep his flush from showing uh somethings going on sir back in the days when alva was a mere lieutenant he wouldnt have had the faintest idea what george was waiting for now he knew though he still plainly thought the idea of military courtesy absurd george didnt care what alva thought he cared what alva did do you have any idea whats going on major or where its going on he inquired something to do with the traitors sir the wizard answered i had suspected that yes doubting georges voice was dry enough to make alva flush again i doubted youd have come to me with news of a barge wreck on the highlow riveralthough you never can tell er yes major alva said visibly offbalance like a lot of mages he conceived of generals as a stiff stodgy lot evidence to the contrary which doubting george gave now and again flustered him and how do you know what you think you know george asked with a lot of wizards that would have spawned an endless epistemological discussion there was one vice at least of which alva was free he said i feel it in my bones sir george would have thrown most wizards out of his office after an answer like that with some he wouldnt have bothered opening the door first he paid alva a high compliment he took him seriously what else can you tell me he asked not much sir not yet major alva said but the northerners are stirring or thinking about stirring and when they come theyll come hard best way doubting george agreed which flustered the young wizard all over again george went on do you think you could find out more if you did some serious sorcerous poking around i dont know for certain sir alva replied i could try to find out though why dont you do that then george said report back to me if you find anything interesting or important alva was one of those people you needed to remind of such things otherwise he was liable to forget he nodded now all right ill do that snooping is fun its not like general bell has any wizards who can stop me he certainly owned all the arrogance a good mage should have good enough george said youre dismissed major see you later alva said cheerfully and touched the brim of his gray hat as he might have back in civilian life doubting george coughed major alva turned red again little by little george kept on persuading him he was a soldier in even smaller increments the lessons took mumbling sorry alva gave him another salute he coughed again alvas stare held nothing but indignation now what sorry sir george said as if to a fouryearold sorry sir alva repeated obviously not sorry in the least what the hells difference does it make magic has rituals eh george said i should hope so the young wizard answered whats that got to do with anything though think of this as a ritual of the army george said you dont need to salute me because you like me or because you think im wonderful you need to salute me because youre a major and im a lieutenant general alva sniffed pretty feeble excuse for a ritualthats all ive got to say maybe maybe not too doubting george said but ill tell you thisevery army in the world has rituals like that every single one of em if there ever were armies without those rituals the ones that do have em squashed the others flat what does that tell you it told alva more than george had expected it to the mages foxy features shut down in a mask of concentration so intense he might have forgotten george was there at last after a couple of minutes of that ferocious thought he said well sir when you put it that way you just may be right it almost puts you in mind of the inward hypothesis of divine choice doesnt it doubting george gaped at him not that godsdamned daft heretical notion he exclaimed on the far side of the western ocean back in the mother kingdom the land from which the detinan colonizers left for their newer world a mage who called himself inward had proposed that the gods let beasts compete over time those better suited to whatever they did surviving and the others failing to leave offspring behind every priest in the civilized world immediately started screaming at the top of his lungs the most common shriek being with an idea like that who needs gods at all it makes a lot of sense if you ask me alva said george had long known his wizard lacked conventional piety he hadnt known alva followed the inward hypothesis as far as he was concerned the wizard whod proposed it had known what he was doing when he chose a false name now alva went on you said it yourself sir armies that develop these rituals survive those that dontdont he hadnt even been insubordinate this time hed left doubting george nothing to do but repeat dismissed major alva saluted a prosurvival ritual he said thoughtfully i wont forget and out he went doubting george drummed his fingers on his desk hed scorned the inward hypothesis from the moment he first heard about it but now though he hadnt even known he was doing it hed argued in favor of what hed thought he scorned what did that say nothing good he was sure if i hadnt tweaked alva about saluting he wouldnt have tossed a firepot at my thoughts george sighed alva hadnt even meant to be inflammatory as far as george was concerned that made the wizard more dangerous not less what am i going to do with him he wondered aloud asking was easy finding an answer wasnt and what am i going to do if the northerners really are up to something he wondered that was about as puzzling as what he would do with major alva the problem was he didnt have all the men he needed general hesmucet had gone traipsing across peachtree toward the western ocean with all the best loyal soldiers in the eastern part of the kingdom of detina he hadnt expected the northerners to be able to mount much of a challenge here in franklin if he was wrong if he was wrong gods damn it ive got my work cut out for me doubting george muttered he scowled that would do for an understatement till a bigger one came along among the men hesmucet had taken with him were a good many from the wing george had commanded on the campaign that ended up seizing marthasville the soldiers hesmucet hadnt taken made up the nucleusthe small nucleusof the force george had here in franklin along with those men he had garrison troops scattered through countless fortresses in cloviston and franklin they guarded not only towns but also the glideway line that kept men and supplies moving that meant they were scattered over the two provincesone of which had stayed in the kingdom of detina but still furnished soldiers to grand duke geoffreys army while the other had tried to leave but was after a fashion reconqueredand not in the best position to fight if they had to id better concentrate them doubting george thought gloomily then his scowl blackened as he shook his head if i do ned of the forests unicornriders will play merry hells with the glideways ned of the forest was no ordinary commander of unicornriders no ordinary raider when he hit a glideway line he didnt just damage it he wrecked it his troopers and mages knew their business altogether too well doubting george shrugged keeping the glideway lines intact mattered less than it had earlier in the year hesmucets men werent tied to them for food and firepots and crossbow bolts any more they were living off the country now living off the country and by all accounts doing well raids against the glideways would still be a nuisance they wouldnt be a disaster that decided lieutenant general george he hurried over to the scryers who had their headquarters next door to his own when the grayrobed mages looked up from their crystal balls he said send word to all garrisons of company size and above theyre to move at once to concentrate here at ramblerton yes sir the wizards chorused unlike major alva they knew how to obey orders also unlike him they were utterly ordinary when it came to sorcery doubting george usually thought alvas talents outweighed his shortcomings sometimes though he wondered lieutenant general bell looked down at himself the northern officer was a big strong man with a bushy beard and a face that for years had put men in mind of the lion god these days he looked like a suffering god his left arm hung limp and lifeless at his side hed been with duke edward of arlington and the army of southern parthenia down at essoville when hed taken the crippling wound and later that same summer here in the east at the river of death a stone flung from a catapult had smashed his right leg which now ended a few inches below the hip he was not a man much given to whimsy lieutenant general bell nevertheless surveying the ruins of what had been a redoubtable body he nodded to ned of the forest with something approaching geniality and said do you know what i am whats that sir the commander of unicornriders asked i am the abridged edition bell declared that brought a smilea cold fierce smileto lieutenant general neds face i reckon we ought to see what we can do about abridging us some o those stinking southrons he said a northeastern twang in his voice unlike most highranking northern officers he held not a drop of noble blood in his veins hed been a serfcatcher before the war and enlisted as a common soldier when fighting between the two halves of detina broke out hed risen to his present rank for one reason and one reason only he was overwhelmingly good at what he did bell knew perfectly well how much he needed such a man he said with your help and the help of the gods lieutenant general i look forward to doing just that good ned said a pleasure to have a man i can work with in charge of the army of franklin yes bell nodded i was wounded i think when you had your disagreement with thraxton the braggart disagreement hells i was going to kill the son of a bitch ned said matteroffactly he had it coming too but did you ever run across a miserable cur dog not worth wasting a crossbow bolt on by the thunderers beard thats thraxton so i let him live and i daresay the kingdoms been regretting it ever since eryes bell said count thraxtons patronage along with that of king geoffrey had got him the command of this army when geoffrey sacked joseph the gamecock outside of marthasville joseph hadnt fought the oncoming southrons hed stalled for time instead hoping to make king avram and his folk weary of the war bell had foughtand marthasville had fallen bell remained convinced that wasnt his fault coughing a couple of times he added you are very frank whats the point of talking if you dont say what you mean ned returned he leaned forward now thenwhat do you mean to do about the southrons down in franklin general hesmucet has marched westhes off the map bell said and ned of the forest nodded to show he followed bell went on not only has he marched west hes taken all his best soldiers with him that leaves nothing but odds and sods to hold franklin and cloviston all weve got to do is win once maybe twice and we can get all the way to the highlow river what could stop us neds eyes gleamed ferally as he thought about that youre right and wouldnt avram look pretty with egg all over his ugly mug thinks were licked does he thinks were flat well hed better think again thats right thats exactly right i think were going to get along just fine together ned bell said you tell me what to do if i can i will if i cant youll hear all about the reasons why i promise you ned said bell was his superior bell was also or had also been a ferocious fighting man in his own right hed never been one to encourage insubordination even so he didnt demand immediate unquestioning obedience of ned of the forest as he would have from anyone else he just nodded and said yes well get on fine good ned gave him a sloppy salute he found himself gladder to have than many neat ones from lesser officers the commander of unicornriders ducked his way out of general bells pavilion bell wasnt sorry to see him go the commander of the army of franklin looked like a suffering god because he sufferedon account of both the ruined arm he still had and the ruined leg he no longer owned the leg might be gone but its ghost of sensation lingered and that ghost was in constant unending torment working awkwardly with his one good hand bell opened the leather pouch he wore on the belt that held up his dark blue pantaloons one leg of course pinned up short he pulled out a little bottle of laudanum and yanked the cork with his teeth then tilting his head back he took a long pull from the bottle oddtasting fire ran down his throat laudanum was a mixture of brandy and poppy juice if it wouldnt kill pain nothing would only two things were wrong with that one was sometimes even laudanum wouldnt kill the pain bell knew the other was hed been taking the stuff ever since his arm was ruined at essoville after close to a year and a half he needed much bigger doses to quell his agony than he had at first by now the amount of laudanum he took every day would have been plenty to kill two or three men who hadnt become habituated to the drug or to leave six or eight such men woozy after he put the laudanum bottle away bell waited he remembered the strange almost floating sensation hed got from laudanum when he first started taking it as if he were drifting away from the body that still suffered no more now laudanum was as much a part of his life as ale was part of a farmers little by little the anguish receded in the dead arm and the missing leg the leg that didnt seem to know it was missing bell sighed with relief laudanum didnt fuzz his wits any more or make him sleepy he was sure of that he was just as sure he would have had trouble thinking without it the few times the healers had run short of the drugthe north didnt have enough of anything it needed except men who despised king avramhed suffered not only from his dreadful wounds but from the even more dreadful effects of giving up laudanum he shuddered he didnt like to think about that as long as he had the drug he was still at least the shadow of a fighting man so what if he couldnt bear a shield so what if his stump was too short to let him sit a unicorn unless he was tied to the saddle he was still a general and a general whod kept the surviving chunks of the army of franklin intact despite everything hesmucets superior force had done to destroy them he still had bold soldiers and he could still strike a savage blow he couldand he intended to that sentry stuck his head into the pavilion i beg your pardon sir but brigadier patrick would like a moment of your time if you have it to spare of course bell said expansively as the laudanum made him feel better about the world how could he refuse in strode patrick the cleaver top o the day to you general he said saluting the young brigadiers voice held the lilt of the sapphire isle where hed been born after a career as a soldier of fortune hed crossed the western ocean to fight for king geoffrey hed risen swiftly bell reckoned him among the finest wing commanders in northern service what can i do for you now brigadier bell asked returning the salute yes patrick the cleaver was one of the finest wing commanders in northern service bell doubted he would ever rise above the rank of brigadier though even by detinan standards patrick was devastatingly frank earlier in the year hed suggested that geoffrey arm blond serfs and use them against king avrams armies geoffrey had not been amused no one else had had the nerve to make that suggestion since what can your honor do for me patrick repeated why sir you can be after telling me when we set ourselves in motion against the godsdamned southrons soon bell said soothingly very soon and when exactly might soon be brigadier patrick inquired sure and we shouldnt be letting em set themselves to meet us now should we i dont intend to do anything of the sort lieutenant general bell said he also didnt intend to order the army of franklin into motion right this minute laudanum filled him with a pleasant lassitude almost as if hed just bedded a woman since the drug made it harder for him actually to bed a woman that was just as well well if you wont let those southron spalpeens set themselves when are we to move patrick the cleaver demanded for would it not be a fine thing to be having the army of franklin in the province of franklin once more better that nor hanging about down here in dothan im thinking yes and yes and yes bell said yes but how can we move till we gather supplies harvest time is long past we cant live off the country whatever we eat well have to take with us the mages wont be able to conjure it upthats certain and we need more than food too too many men in this army have no shoes on their feet theyre wearing pantaloons and tunics theyve taken off of dead southronseither that or theyre wearing rags we have to be ready before we march winter isnt far off and it can get cold down in franklin brigadier patrick mournfully clicked his tongue between his teeth mighty fine does this sound your generalship sir but are you sure theres sense to it for wont the southrons may they find themselves in the hells or ever the gods know theyre dead the scuts wont they be mustering and resupplying faster nor we could ever hope to if i was in charge of this army now id that was too much for lieutenant general bells always fragile patience you are not in command of this army brigadier he said in a voice like winter nor are you ever likely to be and you know why too i do that patrick matched him glare for glare im not in good odor in stinking nonesuch is why the reason being i was man enough to tell king geoffrey the plain truth the which he cared to hear not a bit put pikes and crossbows in the hands of our blond serfs bell shook his head we cant win the war with such socalled soldiers the godsdamned southrons use em and too many of our own brave lads dead in the dirt theyve stretched patrick said you tell me we cant win the war with such soldiers well i tell you this lieutenant general bell the which is the gods own truth we cant win the war without em and that said your excellency gods give you a good day he bowed stiffly and stomped out miserable bogtrotting hothead lieutenant general bell muttered no it was no wonder at all that patrick the cleaver would never enjoy a higher command bell reached for his crutches he got one under his good shoulder and used it to help lever himself upright then he put the other one under his bad arm that shoulder still hurt despite the laudanum making it bear some small part of his weight only made it hurt worse too if he hadnt been a man who could stand pain he would long since have cut his own throat or fallen on a sword moving like an inchworm one hitching step at a time he made his way out of his pavilion his sentries surprised to see him outside stiffened to attention he ignored them he wanted to look at the encampment it didnt look much different from others hed seen a place full of tents and soldiers and lines of tethered unicorns the woods of southern dothan blazed with autumn colors around the campground the day was bright and clear and crisp without a cloud in the sky but he could see the differences when he looked for them as hed told patrick the cleaver too many of his men wore gray pantaloons and sometimes even tunics captured from the southrons that didnt just mean they couldnt get enough uniforms of the proper color though they couldnt it also meant that in battle the rest of his soldiers might start shooting at the wrong men that was why hed issued an order that captured pantaloons and especially tunics had to be dyed king geoffreys indigo blue a couple of kettles boiled and bubbled in the camps with men taking out their newly dyed garments with sticks bell nodded in somber leonine approval here came some of ned of the forests unicornriders bell eyed them unicornriders in the army of southern parthenia were aristocrats one and all their mounts the finest they could provide they took pride in grooming the beasts not just to keep them clean and healthy but to make them look as smart as possible before going into battle by contrast neds men looked like so many teamsters their uniforms were even shabbier than those of bells crossbowmen and pikemen slouch hats held the sun and rain out of their eyes their unicorns were in good enough condition but nothing special they didnt look like men whod been able to keep all of eastern franklin and cloviston in an uproar behind southron lines or like men whod routed a southron army three times the size of their own in great river province but they had no matter what they looked like they could fight bell had to respect that overhead a hawk flew south bell took it for a good omen hoping it meant the army of franklin would succeed when it did move south he would have been more nearly certain had the beast been a dragon the dragon was detinas emblematic animal the kingdom flying on its banners a gold dragon on red to difference his men from those of avram geoffrey had chosen a red dragon on gold but dragons had been rare in western detina even when the colonists from across the western ocean used iron and unicorns and sorcery to seize the land from the blonds then inhabiting it a few of the great beasts were still said to survive west of the great river but bell had never seen one in the lands far to the east in the stony mountains beyond the steppes dragons not only survived but flourished that did bell no good with the omens though he shrugged a oneshouldered shrug even that hurt but then what didnt omens or no heand the army of franklinwould march south corporal rollant liked garrison duty hed spent a lot of time putting himself in positions where strangers could kill him at the battle by the river of death storming up proselytizers rise and all through the campaign from the southern border of peachtree province up to marthasville no he didnt mind being back here in ramblerton well away from the fighting at all most of all he enjoyed strollingor rather swaggeringalong the streets of ramblerton in his gray uniform with the two stripes on his sleeve showing off his rank northerners men and women who would gladly have left the kingdom of detina when grand duke geoffrey proclaimed himself king in the north had to get out of his way in a hurry for along with the uniform he wore a shortsword on his hip and sometimes a crossbow slung on his back they got out of his way as they would have for any ordinary detinan soldier if they hadnt he and his comrades would have made them sorry for it he was one of king avrams soldiers yes but not an ordinary detinan ordinary detinans were swarthy with dark eyes dark hair and on the men dark beards rollant was a blond an escaped serf from palmetto province whod fled south to new eborac and made a good living as a carpenter till taking service with others from his city from his province to help liberate all the serfs in the north from their bonds to the land and to their feudal overlords that would have been bad enough for the detinans of ramblerton serfs in arms had been their nightmare ever since their ancestors overthrew the blond kingdoms of the north because theyd easily won those wars they professed to believe blonds couldnt fight the gray uniform on rollants back argued against that but the stripes on his sleeve were what really made the locals shudder one of those locals called you therenot to rollant but to his friend smitty a common soldier walking at his side you talking to me smitty asked he was as ordinary a detinan as any ever born but for a silly streak well who else would i be talking to the ramblertonian demanded oh i dont know smitty donned an expression of exaggerated idiocy you might be talking to my corporal there hes got more rank than i do hes the company standardbearer and im not the man from ramblerton shuddered hes a blond smitty looked at rollant as if hed never seen him before why by the gods so he is by the gods is right its against nature thats what it is the local said what do you do when he gives you an order after grave consideration smitty answered well most of the time i say yes corporal and i go off and do it isnt that right your corporalship not often enough rollant said gravely but most of the time yes thats what you do thats what youd better do he tapped the stripes on his sleeve i know it smitty looked fearful in confidential tones he told the ramblertonian he beats me when i disobey hes terrible fierce he is you wouldnt want to mess with him believe you me you wouldnt animal rollant read the word on the locals lips but the fellow didnt have the nerve to say it out loud what he did say was its a disgrace to the detinan race thats what it is he walked off with his nose in the air how about that smitty said how do you like being a disgrace to the detinan race me i like it fine rollant answered but i thought he was talking about you was he why that son of a whore of all the nerve smitty said he and rollant both laughed rollant looked back over his shoulder the ramblertonians back had got stiffer than ever the blond laughed again but the laughter didnt last by proclaiming he intended to release the kingdom of detinas blond serfs from their feudal obligations and ties to the land king avram had also in effect proclaimed they were or could at least become detinans like any others the whole of the north set about forming its own kingdom and went to war sooner than admitting that possibility even in the south blonds had a hard time of it although legally on the same footing as real detinans rollant had seen that for himself as a carpenter hed had to be twice as good as his competitors to get half as far it was worse in the army detinans prided themselves on being a warrior race they also assumed blonds couldnt fight smitty had told the local he obeyed rollants orders and so he didmost of the time a lot of his comrades had been less willing after rollant won the promotion he would have had long since if his hair were properly black his skin properly swarthy of course if his hair were properly black his skin properly swarthy he never would have had to flee from baron ormerods estate because he wouldnt have been bound to the land in the first place detinans didnt think about such things why should they they didnt have to they werent bound as his people were how do you suppose that bastard would like working somebody elses land his whole life long rollant asked smitty how do you suppose hed like his baron flipping up his wifes skirt and nothing he could do about it if he wanted to keep his head on his neck oh he wouldnt have to worry about that smitty said ha rollant said just shows youve never been a serf smitty shook his head and repeated he wouldnt have to worry about that only when rollant started to get angry did he condescend to explain himself any woman he could get would be too ugly for a nobleman to want oh rollant felt foolish all right you got me there he laughed a little sheepishly the true detinan flag king avrams flag gold dragon on red flew above the keep at the heart of ramblerton and on important buildings throughout the town displaying false king geoffreys reversed banner was illegal as could be several ramblertonians languished in jail for letting their patriotism outrun their good sense as far as rollant was concerned they could stay there till they rotted when hed been back on baron ormerods estate he would have reckoned ramblerton the grandest town in the world no more after new eborac city it seemed small and only half finished not a single street was cobbled all of them were dirt dusty in the summertime muddy now that winter was on the way people flung their slops wherever they pleased which meant the place stank even worse than it would have otherwise and toward the north ramblerton just petered out clapboard houses gradually giving way to woods as one low ridge after another marked the lands rise from the banks of the cumbersome river no not so much of a much rollant muttered whats not so much of a much smitty asked him this place he answered smitty wasnt a city man he came from a farm outside new eborac city and hadnt liked going into town even when hed had the chance he shrugged now just one more place weve got to hold on to he said i should hope so rollant said id like to see the godsdamned traitors try to take it away from us theyd be sorry to the end of their days by the lion gods fangs he swore by the lion god the thunderer and the other gods of the detinan pantheon he believed in them he worshiped them his own blond ancestors had had gods of their own before the detinans crossed the western ocean and took this land away from them he still knew the names of some of them he even believed in them after a fashion worship them he shook his head theyd let his ancestors down when those ancestors needed them most if he was going to worship gods he wanted to worship gods who delivered we ought to head back to camp smitty said thats true rollant kept on walking smitty laughed i know why you dont want to leave you want to keep showing off in front of the traitors rollant thought that over solemnly he nodded youre right i do but when smitty turned back he followed doubting georges army held more people than ramblerton and sprawled over a wider area too if it werent for riverboats on the cumbersome and all the glideway lines that came into the area the army would have starved in short order as things were a swarm of blond laborersrunaway serfsunloaded boats and glideway carpets and heaved crates and barrels into assdrawn wagons that would take them exactly where they needed to go the laborers were working harder than they would have if theyd stayed on their liege lords estates plainly they didnt care they were doing this work because they wanted to not because they had to rollant understood that down to the ground he eyed the asses with a certain mournful sympathy his ancestors had tried to use bronze axes and assdrawn chariots against the thunderous unicorn cavalry of the detinan conquerors theyd tried theyd fought bravelyand theyd gone down to the subjection a whole great segment of detina had taken enough for granted to be willing to fight rather than see it abridged in any way as they neared the encampment rollant pointed ahead somethings going on sure is smitty agreed whole camps stirring like a beehive just before it swarms where the hells have you two been sergeant joram growled when rollant and smitty reached their company were marching inside of an hour marching smitty said how come where are we going rollant was content to let smitty ask the questions joram could have made his life as a corporal difficult if not impossible he hadnt done that but he wasnt any great lover of blonds either rollant stayed out of his way as much as he couldwhich was also on general principles a good thing to do with sergeants were going up toward the dothan border joram answered now doubting george has given john the lister a whole wings worth of men and were part of it seems like general bell may be getting frisky up there so they need us to make sure he doesnt kick up too much trouble whats he going to do smitty said scornfully invade franklin after all the lickings he took over in peachtree province he hasnt got the men for that i wouldnt think nobody much cares what you think smitty sergeant joram pointed out by the gods somebody ought to smitty said hotly im a free detinan and my ideas are just as good as anybody elsesbetter than some folks i could name hows bell going to invade franklin if he couldnt stop general hesmucet thunderer love him from marching across peachtree province he didnt even try had rollant been so insubordinate he was sure sergeant joram would have raked him over the coals on account of it he was only a blond after all but hed also seen that detinans were passionate about freedom about their own freedom anyhow that blonds werent free seemed to bother most of them very little they insisted on doing and saying what they wanted when they wanted to and didnt care what might spring from that it made them difficult soldiers with such patience as he could muster joram said i dont know how bells supposed to invade franklin with what hes got either thats our jobto go down toward the border and find out and if hes dumb enough to try it were supposed to give him a good boot in the ballocks to slow him down what do you think of that smitty mimed giving somebody a good kick maybe it was bell and the traitors he led by the way his foot was aimed maybe it was sergeant joram too come on rollant said lets get ready to move they didnt have a whole lot of getting ready to do they were veterans throwing what was essential into their rucksacks took only minutes everything that wasnt essential had long since been lost or left behind rollant had tea crossbow bolts and strings hard bread and smoked meat a skillet made from half a tin canteen nailed to a stick and a couple of pairs of socks his wife norina had knitted and sent from new eborac city he carried more bolts on his belt and a water bottle in place of the canteen that had long since split smittys gear was similarly minimal they both slung their crossbows on their backs and were ready to march rollant had one more piece of equipment to carry he went to take the company banner from its shrine offering a murmured prayerif hed had wine or spirits in the bottle hed have poured a libationhe plucked up the staff and proudly brought it to the front of the company standardbearers were always targets hed taken the job by seizing the banner and keeping it from falling when his predecessor was hit he made a special target being not just a standardbearer but also a blond he didnt care as far as he was concerned the honor outweighed the riskand the way hed taken up the banner and gone on afterwards had won him promotion to corporal no easy thing for a blond to win good day corporal said lieutenant griff the company commander griff was young and skinny and weedy with a voice that sometimes cracked but he was brave enough and he treated rollant fairly the company could have had a worse man in charge good day sir rollant saluted ready when you are griff returned the salute he was punctilious about military courtesy well be moving soon im sure not everyone is as swift as we are too bad for the others rollant declared i like your spirit corporal griff said you make you make a good soldier he sounded faintly surprised at saying such a thing ordinary detinans often sounded faintlyor more than faintlysurprised when they said anything good about a blond more often than not they left such things unsaid that lieutenant griff had spoken up pleased rollant very much he saluted again thank you sir youre welcome griff replied horns blared just then all through the ranks men stirred they recognized the call to move out griff smiled at rollant raise that banner high corporal weve got some marching to do yes sir rollant said and he did ned of the forest turned to one of his regimental commanders as he led the long column of unicornriders south feels good to be on the move doesnt it biff yes sir colonel biffle answered gray streaked his beard neds beard remained dark though his hair had some gray in it i just hope we can hit the southrons a godsdamned good lick thats all so do i ned said he was a big man and a quiet one till he got in a temper or found himself in battle then nothing and no one around him was safe he wore his saber on the right side where a lefthanded man could draw it in a hurry he also carried a short crossbow and a sheaf of bolts hed had the crossbow for years the hilt of the saber was wrapped in leather not with the gold or silver wire some officers a good deal less wealthy than ned affected unlike a lot of northern nobles he didnt fight because he loved war and glory he fought because hed chosen geoffrey over avram because he wanted to do everything he could to aid his choice and because hed turned out to be monstrous good at war but to him the tools of the trade were only tools nothing more we can lick the southrons cant we sir colonel biffle asked weve whipped em plenty of times after all of course we can ned said stoutly of course we have and of course we will he didnt like the doubt in biffles voice he didnt like the doubt in his own heart either the raids hed led had kept the southrons offbalance in cloviston and franklin and in great river province too hed sacked fortressesonce his men had turned on and slaughtered a couple of hundred blonds at fort cushion when they didnt yield fast enoughand wrecked glideways hed ridden into southronheld luxor on the banks of the great river and come within inches of capturing the enemy commander there hed heard that general hesmucet as grim a soldier as the south had produced had said there would be no peace in the east till he was dead by the gods im not dead yet he thought but he felt no great assurance when he looked back over his shoulder at the force general bell had scraped together even with his own unicornriders added in this was a sad and sorry remnant of the army that had smashed the southrons at the river of deathhad smashed them and then failed to gather up their men who were trapped at rising rock in northwestern franklin ned muttered under his breath calling curses down on the sour empty head of count thraxton the braggart comparing what he could have accomplished with what hed actually done ned muttered under his breath again he didnt want to think about that the more he did think about it the angrier he got i should have killed him hed had his chance but he hadnt done it biffle said something tell me again biff ned said i was woolgathering and i missed it colonel biffle grinned i hope you were dreaming up something especially nasty for the stinking southrons well not exactly ned said biffle had been along when he had his runin with count thraxton even so he didnt tell the regimental commander hed been contemplating the untimely demise of somebody on his own side let me know whats on your mind im listening now and thats a fact i said i dont like the look of those clouds there biffle pointed to the southwest his attention drawn to them ned of the forest decided he didnt like the look of those clouds either they were thick and black and spreading over the sky with startling speed no sooner had that thought crossed his mind than the first harbinger of the wind that carried them reached him it felt wet and cold a warning winter was on the way we ought to step up the pace he said best to get along as far as we can before the rain starts coming downbecause it will yes sir colonel biffle said but his voice was troubled a moment later he explained why well get a long ways in front of the pikemen and crossbowmen if we do wont we sir except in the heat of battle ned was a man who seldom cursed he felt like cursing now relentless motion was what he depended on to win his battles however much he depended on it though he couldnt use it now a sour laugh helped him make the best of things when youre right biff youre right weve got to stay with em sure as sure he hated that he felt tethered he wanted to range freely with his unicornriders to hit the southrons where they least expected it at the head of the riders he could do that when they were on their own when they were also the eyes and ears for the rest of the army he couldnt or not so easily the wind got stronger and colder and wetter before long the rain hed foreseen started falling it was a hard chilly rain a rain that would have been snow or sleet in another few weeks even as rain it was more than bad enough for a little while it laid the dust the unicornsand the asses drawing the supply wagons and the wagons wheelskicked up from the roadway but then when it kept falling it started turning the road to mud ned of the forest still didnt curse he felt like it more than ever though his unicorn began to struggle having to lift each hoof out of the thickening ooze with a separate special effort what his unicorn was doing he knew every other unicorn was doing as well they wouldnt be able to go fast now no matter how much they wanted to as ned yanked his hat down lower to help shield his eyes from the rain colonel biffle said other trouble with this is it plays merry hells with the crossbowmens bowstrings if we do bump into the southrons now itll be swords and pikes mostly yes ned said discontentedly that wasnt the sort of fight general bells men were likely to win in almost every battle the southrons could put more men into the field than could king geoffrey if both sides could only chop and thrust who had the edge the one with the most soldiers surely down came the rain come on thunderer ned thought in annoyance youre supposed to be on our side arent you we need good weather to get where we need to be before the southrons know what were up to the thunderer of course did what he wanted to do not what ned of the forest wanted him to do lightning flashed a few heartbeats later thunder rumbled in the distance another lightning bolt crashed down this time the thunder came quicker and sounded louder and closer they say you dont ever want to hear thunder the same time as you see lightning biffle remarked ned nodded hed heard that too but who are they he asked the ones who lived i suppose so colonel biffle said i never really thought about that till now his chuckle was a little uneasy youve always got to think about these things ned said gravely the more you believe just because they say its so the worse things will go wrong if they turn out to be a pack of foolsand a lot of the time they do the only things you ought to take on faith are the gods biffle nodded but then with another chuckle he asked why even take them on faith ned scratched his head hed believed himself a freethinker but doubting the power of the gods that had never occurred to him at last laughing uncomfortably himself he answered dont take em on faith if you dont want to the way they show themselves in the world you dont need to no i suppose not biffle agreed lightning flashed again through the boom that followed the regimental commander added pretty hard not to believe in the thunderer when you hear that isnt it i should say so ned replied it started raining harder the drops drummed and hissed off the ground off growing puddles off the unicorns and men ned had to lower his head to keep the rain from soaking his face he did some more muttering his riders and the footsoldiers who made up the rest of general bells army could keep going forward in such weather but the supply wagons wouldnt have an easy time neither would the catapults and the repeating crossbows that made charges across open country so expensive captain watson ned called pitching his voice to carry through the rain when he had to he could make his voice carry through almost anything come up here captain if you please i need to speak with you coming sir watson called back a moment later his unicorn rode beside ned of the forests colonel biffle drew off a little way so as not to eavesdrop he was polite as a cat saluting watson asked what can i do for you sir ned eyed him with more than a little affection which only showed how things could change when viscount watson first joined his unicornriders ned had thought himself the victim of somebodys bad joke the alleged commander of engines had been a beardless nobleman of twenty surely too young and too wellbred to know what he was doing or to be much use in the field a couple of years of hard fighting had proved otherwise watson still couldnt raise much more than fuzz on his cheeks and chin but ned no longer cared he could handle catapults and repeating crossbows and the men who served them past that nothing else mattered now ned could ask will your toys be able to keep up with us and know he would be able to rely on the answer he got captain watson nodded yes sir ill make em keep up by the gods if i have to ill unharness the asses hauling them and put unicorns in the traces instead if that doesnt do it soldiers hauling on ropes will keep the carriages moving good man ned said that was what i wanted you to tell me grinning watson said you dont ever want to hear no from anybody not from anybody in my command ned agreed not from anybody im relying on watson nodded again he already knew that nobody who served under ned of the forest could help knowing it ned would have been an impossible commander if he hadnt driven himself harder than he drove any of his men they knew how hard he worked at war and did their best to match him something up ahead half seen through the curtain of rain ned leaned forward peering hard it had been a white something which meant was that a southron scout on unicornback there sneaking off into the woods before we could get a good look at him i didnt see him sir captain watson answered colonel biffle shrugged to show he hadnt noticed anything out of the ordinary either wheep neds sword came free from its scabbard im going to have a look he said if that is a southron i dont aim to let him get back and tell his pals hes seen us he spurred his unicorn forward most commanders would have sent out scouts to hunt down an enemy ned didnt think like that and never had he was as good a fighting man as any he led hed been wounded several times and had close to a dozen unicorns killed under him as he rode toward the woods now he leaned forward and a little to one side using this mounts body as a shield in case that southron had a crossbow aimed at him ned laughed softly if the fellow did see him and tried shooting at him he might not have much luck in weather like this bowstrings soon turned soggy and useless when ned reached the woods he slid down off the unicorn and tethered it to the branch of an oak he could move more quietly and less conspicuously on foot that southronif there had been a southron if ned hadnt been imagining thingshad gone in a couple of hundred yards from where ned was now ned hurried forward flitting from tree trunk to tree trunk like one of the ghosts the blonds believed to haunt the wilderness ned didnt believe in those ghosts though he did want to send that southrons spirit down to the hells a flash of whitewas that the enemy soldiers unicorn ned of the forest drifted closer yes that was the unicorn and there sat the southron still mounted fool ned thought youll pay for that the grayclad soldier had sword in hand and no doubt felt very safe very secure what he felt and what was real were two different things as hed soon find out with a wordless bellow making do for a battle cry ned rushed him the southron cried out too in horror he had to twist his body awkwardly to meet neds attack for the northern commander of unicornriders approached on his left side and he like most men used his right hand swords clashed the southron managed to turn neds first stroke the second laid open his thigh the third tore into his belly he shrieked his blood poured down the unicorns white white flank ned of the forest pulled him out of the saddle and finished him with a thrust through the throat that done ned sprang onto the unicorns back it snorted fearfully and tried to rear he used his weight and the reins and the pressure of his knees to force it down again then he rode it back toward his own men pausing to reclaim the animal hed tethered before going hunting for the scout the troopers cheered when he emerged from the rain riding one unicorn and leading another they knew what that had to mean scratch one southron somebody called and the rest of the riders took up the cry ned waved pleased with them and pleased with himself looks like you were right sir colonel biffle said ned shrugged he got careless the gods wont help you if you dont give em a chance i expect youre right biffle agreed you bet i am but then ned started thinking about some of the things king geoffrey had done most notably leaving count thraxton in command much too long till far too much of the east was lost the gods wont help you if you dont give em a chance he wished he hadnt put it quite like that captain gremio squelched through mud that threatened to pull off his shoes with every step he took the road would have been bad any which way it was even worse because ned of the forests unicorns had chewed it into a quagmire before any of general bells footsoldiers marched down it come on keep it up we can do it gremio called to the soldiers of the company he commanded the men from palmetto province slogged along in no particular order but they did keep moving gremio didnt suppose he could ask for more than that one of the soldiers grinned a wet muddy grin at him you going to send us to jail if we dont he asked back in karlsburg gremio had been a barrister that made him unusual among northern officers most of whom came from the ranks of the nobility baron ormerod whom hed replaced had owned an estate outside karlsburg but ormerod was a year dead now killed in the disastrous battle of proselytizers rise gremio had led the company since he fell he knew he couldnt be too sensitive when soldiers teased him if he were theyd never give him any peace he managed a grin of his own as he answered not likely landels my job back there was keeping people out of jail not putting them in of course he stroked his bearded chin for you i might make an exception landels laughed he had to for the men around him were laughing too show you had a thin skin and you would pay and pay and pay colonel florizel the regimental commander rode up on a unicorn no one held that against him he had a wounded foot that had never healed the way it should have how are things captain he called as well as can be expected sir gremio answered florizel nodded apparently satisfied and rode on he hadnt asked the question that most needed asking at least to gremio how well can things be expected to be like most soldiers in general bells army florizel seemed to think everything was fine after all the army of franklin was moving forward again wasnt it soon it would reenter the province for which it was named wouldnt it how could anything be wrong when that was so some peoplea lot of people evidentlyhad no sense of proportion that was how things looked to gremio a lot of people had trouble seeing what lay in front of their faces the realm grand dukenow kinggeoffrey had fought so hard to form was in trouble king avrams men held the whole length of the great river cutting geoffreys kingdom in half general hesmucet against whom the army of franklin had fought so long and so hard was cutting a swath of destruction through peachtree province as he marched toward the western ocean with no one able to stop him or even to slow him down very much the army of southern parthenia was trapped in pierreville with no chance for duke edward of arlington to break free gremio sighed general bell loudly proclaimed that his move south would set all the new kingdoms troubles right gremio hoped he knew what he was talking about the barristerturnedsoldier didnt believe that he was trained to examine evidence and see where it led he didnt believe but he did hope come along straighten it up sergeant thisbe called look like men gods damn it not a shambling herd of goats thisbes light true tenor pierced the noise of the rain like a rapier piercing flesh unlike those of most detinan men thisbes cheeks were bare of beard the soldiers as soldiers often will paid more attention to their sergeant than they did to a captain trouble seeing what lay in front of their faces gremio laughed though it wasnt really funny how long had he had trouble seeing what lay in front of his face only the whole war up until a couple of months before if thisbe hadnt been wounded gremio knew he would still be a blind man he also knew thisbe wished he still were a blind man how are you feeling he asked the sergeant just fine now thanks thisbe answered you see i didnt need to go to the healers after all you were smart not to sergeant landels said those bastards will help somebody every now and again but they bury more than they cure i was smart not to sure enough thisbe said the sergeants eyes were on gremio he knew just what those words meant or thought he did landels and the other ordinary soldiers marching down the muddy road didnt all i have to do is open my mouth and thisbe is gone from this company gremio thought he and the sergeant both knew that he could see some excellent good reasons for speaking up too on the other hand the company would lose far and away its best underofficer if he did and thisbe would hate him forever too he didnt know which of those worried him more that he didnt know worried him all by itself that he didnt know was in fact one of his better arguments for talking things over with colonel florizel hed thought so for weeks no matter what hed thought though hed kept quiet up till now that hed kept quiet worried him too he stole a glance at thisbe thisbe as it happened was looking at him the sergeant kept trying to pretend the wound and everything that followed from it had never happened gremio had gone along with that up till now he knew it couldnt last forever though how would it break down what would happen when it did he had no idea sooner or later he would find out meanwhile meanwhile he kept marching through the mud as long as he concentrated on putting one foot in front of the other he didnt have to think about anything else sometimes even for a barrister not thinking came as a relief darkness fell earlier every day getting a fire started with wet wood wasnt easy wheres a mage when we really need one somebody grumbled it was gremio thought a good question the north had held on as long as it had in this war because its mages were generally better than the ones the southrons used being better for battle magic however didnt necessarily mean being better for small mundane tasks like starting fires gremio looked around he didnt see any bluerobed mages around anyhow he had no idea what they were doing his mouth twitched in what wasnt quite a smile a lot of the time they had no idea what they were doing either some of his men still carried halftents that they toggled together to give them shelter from the rain more though had long since abandoned such fripperies or had never had them to begin with gremios mouth twisted again tents werent the most important thing on his mind right now a lot of his men had no shoes that was a far more urgent worry eventually by dousing wood with oil that wouldnt be used on wagons now the soldiers got some smoky fires going they huddled around them trying to get warm some poked bare toes toward the flames gremio pretended not to see the only way those men would get shoes again would be by taking them off dead southrons along with his men he toasted hard biscuits over the fire toasting made the weevils flee or so people said gremio hadnt noticed that much difference himself every so often something would crunch nastily under his teeth when he bit down hed learned to pay little attention weevils didnt taste like much of anything smoked and salted beef accompanied the biscuits no bugs got into the beef gremio suspected that was because they couldnt stand it every time he choked down a bite he wondered who was smarter himself for eating the stuff or the bugs for having nothing to do with it he feared he knew one more thing better left unthought about but marching made a man hungry as a wolf if you didnt eat all you could how were you supposed to keep moving dawn to dusk youd fall over dead instead gremio had seen men do it thisbe said another day or two and well be back in franklin seems only right since were the godsdamned army of franklin a soldier replied thats what it says on the box anyways another soldier said but thisll be the first time in almost a year weve really been theresince the stinking southrons ran us out after proselytizers rise lowvoiced curses and some not so lowvoiced made their way around the campfire all the men whod been with the regiment then still felt the army of franklin had had no business losing that battle the southrons had swarmed straight up a steep cliff right at everything king geoffreys men could throw at them theyd swarmed upand the northerners had run away leaving the field to them a regiment of men could have held that line thisbe said exaggerating only a little but a whole army didnt thraxton the braggarts spell went wrong gremio spread his hands as if to say what can you do and what could they donow nothing and he knew it only too well the spell was supposed to fall on general barts men but it landed on us instead we didnt run because we were cowards we ran because we couldnt help it well to the hells with thraxton too landels said scrawny old sourpuss never did lead us to anything that looked like a victory heads bobbed up and down gremio and thisbe nodded along with the ordinary soldiers blaming thraxton the braggart meant they didnt have to blame themselves but they knew theyd fought as well as men could thisbe said the one time we had as many men as the southronswhen we fought em at the river of deathwe whipped em and then thraxton threw that away too more nods some angry others wistful if theyd laid proper siege to rising rock if theyd starved general guildensterns army into submission if theyd done that the whole war in eastern detina would look different now could they have done it one man in four at the fight by the river of death had been killed or wounded thraxton hadnt thought theyd had it in them maybe hed been right but if they couldnt follow up a victory what were they doing fighting this war no one seemed to have an answer for that a runner with his hat pulled low to keep rain out of his eyes came splashing up to the smoky stinking fire im looking for captain gremio he announced gremio got up off the oilcloth sheet hed been sitting on he wondered why he bothered with it since he was already good and wet youve found me colonel florizels compliments sir and hes meeting with all his company commanders in his pavilion the messenger replied now yes siras fast as all of you get there im on my way as gremio walked toward florizels tent he reflected that that was one way to tell geoffreys men from avrams when they spoke for most of the differences between their dialects werent great but while men in the northern provinces said all of you those in the south had a separate form for the plural of the secondperson pronoun with a separate set of verb endings to go with it sentries in front of florizels tent saluted as gremio came up the regimental commander was a stickler for the forms of military politeness returning the salutes gremio ducked inside he was glad to find only a couple of the regiments other nine company commanders there ahead of him good evening your excellencies he saidboth of them were barons not that either was liege lord to much of an estate good evening they answered together an odd mix of caution and condescension in their voices they were nobles and gremio wasnt which accounted for the condescension but he was not only a barrister but had more money than either one of them even if he didnt own land that accounted for the caution one by one the rest of the company commanders came in they were noblemen too gremio and they exchanged the same sort of greetings hed given their fellows when the last captain squeezed into the pavilion colonel florizel said gentlemen he nodded to gremio as if to make sure gremio knew he was included among that elect group i want you to convey to your men the certainty that we can yet win this war hells dont they already know that demanded captain tybalt one of the two whod been there ahead of gremio he had courage to spare and a temper hot as dragonfire but no one had accused him of owning a superfluity of brains he went on of course well lick the godsdamned southrons it hadnt seemed like of course to gremio for a very long time while he tried to find some way to say that without actually coming out and calling tybalt an idiot colonel florizel said were getting entirely too many desertions spirits are down some of the soldiers seem to think were bound to lose we have to fight that we have to fight it with everything thats in us do you understand some of the soldiers have the sense of ordinary human beings gremio thought but captain tybalt didnt seem the only company commander astonished at the idea that his men might need encouragement do you understand florizel repeated yes sir the captains chorused gremio made sure his voice was loud among theirs he knew he would have to carry out the order he also knew a lot of the men he led would laugh at him when he did they hadnt given up hoping they would win but more than a few had given up expecting it hed given up expecting it himself very well gentlemen dismissed florizel said and remember i want no more desertions from this regiment yes sir the company commanders said again again gremio made sure his voice rang out he also wanted no more desertions he knew better than to expect or even hope for that though ii john the lister looked over his shoulder from unicornback he knew more than a little pride in the grayclad army he led north from ramblerton the army that from this hilltop resembled nothing so much as a long muscular snake turning to his adjutant he said by the gods i hope lieutenant general bell is coming south ill be very happy to meet him well have a lot to talk about dont you think yes sir major strabo said and a sharp conversation it will be strabo was a walleyed man with a taste for bad puns but a good officer despite that eryes johns eyes pointed as they were supposed to he had however gone bald as a young man and wore a hat at any excuse or none he had a good excuse now the rain that dripped from a sky the color of a dirty sheeps belly can we flagellate them all by ourselves do you think strabo asked he never used a simple word if he could find a long obscure one that meant the same thing either after a brief pause to figure out what the other officer was talking about the southron commander nodded i expect we can manage that he said unless hes managed to scrape together more men than i think he has well be all right and even if he has well we can still hurt him heres hoping we get the chance major strabo said well my choiced be to have the traitors throw in the sponge and surrender but theyre as much a bunch of stubborn detinans as we are so i dont expect thatll happen tomorrow or even the day after john the lister replied were just going to have to lick em if we do have to lick em id sooner do it up in northern franklin than down around ramblerton thered be a great gnashing of teeth if they got so far his adjutant agreed the rain kept right on falling it soaked the roads it soaked the soldiers it soaked the woods that covered so much of franklin woods that had been gorgeous with the gold and crimson and maroon leaves of autumn only days before went brown and bare the leaves lay underfoot losing their color and smelling musty and turning dreadfully slimy and slippery in the rain when evening cameas it did earlier every daythe army made camp tents sprouted like toadstools in the rain considering the number of toadstools also sprouting john found himself in an excellent position to make the comparison more of his men carried tent halves than held true among the traitors more supply wagons accompanied his army too he might not be able to move quite so fast as lieutenant general bells lean hungry troopers but he thought his men could hit harder when they got where they were going and theres not a thing wrong with taking whatever comforts you can into the field he told himself the traitors boasted of how scrawny they were and did their best to turn their quartermasters weakness and sometimes incompetence into a virtue john preferred having his men go into a fight well fed and as well rested as they could be thanks to the manufactories and glideways of the south he got his wish hat still jammed down low on his head he prowled through the camp making sure everything ran to his satisfaction not everyone recognized him as the commanding general like marshal bart who led all of king avrams armies he wore a common soldiers blouse with stars of rank on the shoulders but here and there a man would call out hows it going ducky whenever that happened john would wave back hed had the nickname a long time when he was a younger man hed combed his hair so that it stuck up at the nape of his neck putting people in mind of the southern end of a northbound duck a lot of young men had worn their hair in that style twenty years before he wasnt the only one whod ended up getting called ducky or the duck on account of it either he took out a mess tin and stood in line with ordinary soldiers to see what their cooks were dishing out once a cook had been so surprised hed dumped a ladleful of stew on his own shoes john had got the helping after that and it had been pretty good what he got this time was hard bread and cheese and sausagenothing very exciting but decent enough of its kind he ate with real enjoyment halt who goes there sentries called as he approached his own pavilion they were alert but not alert enough to have noticed he wasnt in there to begin with im john the lister he said dryly the sentries muttered among themselves at last one of them said advance and be recognized sir advance john did recognize him the sentries did they came to attention so stiff they might almost have come to rigor mortis am i who i say i am the general asked yes sir the sentries chorused one of them held the tent flap wide for him you dont need to bother with such foolishness john said as he stooped and went into the pavilion just make sure you keep any traitors from sneaking in after me all right yes sir the sentries chorused once more they would do what he told themunless they did something else in which case the force he commanded would have a new leader shortly thereafter john suspected it would do about as well under a fair number of other officers he contrived to keep this suspicion well hidden as far as his superiors knew he was convinced he was indispensable his superiors john the lister let his broadshouldered bulk sag into a folding chair which creaked under his weight depending on how you looked at things he had either a mere handful of superiors or a whole great list of them in king avrams volunteers he was a brigadier as long as the war against false king geoffrey lasted he could command a wing or even a small independent army as he was doing now that was true as long as the war lasted the minute it ended he was a brigadier no more in king avrams regular army the army that persisted in peacetime john was only a captain with a captains pay and a captains prospects the best he could hope for as a captain would be to end up at a fortress on the eastern steppes commanding a company against the blond nomads who preyed on the great herds of aurochs thereand on detinan settlers doubting george was a lieutenant general of volunteers but doubting george was also a brigadier among the regulars if the war ended tomorrow he would still be a person to reckon with john knew only one thing could get him the permanent rank he so craved a smashing victory over the southrons knowing what he needed was all very well knowing how to get it was something else again john gave doubting george reluctant credit george could have commanded this move up from ramblerton himself he could have but he hadnt he already owned as much permanent rank as he needed john didnt he had the chance to earn more here if he could and if lieutenant general bell was really coming john the lister still found that hard to believe if hed commanded the force bell had he wouldnt have tried doing anything too risky with it he would have held back waited to see what the southrons opposing him had in mind and hoped theyd make a mistake waiting and seeing of course had never been one of bells strong points if the situation called for him to charge he would if the situation called for him to wait and see odds were he would charge anyway besides who could say if he was really so foolish the way things looked the north needed something not far from a miracle to beat king avrams armies hanging back and waiting wouldnt yield one striking for the enemys throat might john had a flask on his belt he liberated it yanked out the stopper and took a swig sweet fire ran down his throat brandy made from the most famous product of peachtree province after that one swig john corked the flask and put it back on his belt one nip was fine more more and he would have been like general guildenstern who reports said had been the worse for wear during the battle by the river of death maybe guildenstern would have lost sober too no one would ever know now after pulling off his boots john the lister lay down on his ironframed cot he had a brigadiers privileges a captain would have slept wrapped in a blanket or on bare ground like a common soldier the cot wasnt very comfortable either but it was better than bare ground as usual john woke before dawn he got out of bed and put his boots back on that done he scratched back in ramblerton hed been able to bathe as often as he wanted toeven a couple of times a week if he was so inclined he usually wasnt that fussy though some of the more fastidious officers were out in the field though and especially when the weather wasnt warm he shook his head some things were more trouble than they were worth when he came out of the pavilion a couple of blond servants carried its light furnishings to a wagon then took down the big tent itself and packed it on top of the cot and chair and folding table thanks boys john said they both nodded john had to remind himself they werent serfs they worked for wages just as a proper detinan might find himself doing they probably think they are proper detinans john the lister muttered under his breath he didnt necessarily share that opinion but he was sure grand duke geoffrey had no business tearing the kingdom to pieces that put him on king avrams side no matter what he thought about blonds and whether or not they were as good as detinans whose ancestors had crossed the western ocean john watched the encampment come to life around him here and there blonds cooked for soldiers and helped them knock down their tents most of those men and women were runaway serfs they got wages these days too that they had fled their liege lords said they wanted to be free even if they didnt always quite know how as john went over to get in line for breakfast he plucked thoughtfully at his long squarecut beard wanting to be free was what marked detinans maybe some of those blonds had what it took after all heres ducky again the nickname ran ahead of the general commanding john pretended he didnt hear he took his place in a line got a bowl of mush with bits of salt beef chopped into it and had a blond cooks assistant pour boiling water into the tin mug he held out like a lot of soldiers he doubted he was a human being till hed had his first mug of tea or sometimes his second when he came back from breakfast major strabo saluted saying greetings and salutations sir hello john politely returned the salute unlike his adjutantperhaps in reaction to his adjutanthe kept his own speech simple walleyed strabo looked past him to the left and right now we fare forth to find and flummox the fearsome foe you should have been born a bard major john said there are times when you sound like the singers who told the tale of our ancestors and how they conquered the blonds kingdoms they found in this new land you do me honor by the comparison sir again strabo looked around john rather than at him mounts gleaming whitely unicornriders went north ahead of johns main force general guildensterns disaster had taught southron officers one lesson anyhow to make sure they didnt get taken by surprise the way he had john the lister didnt expect trouble from lieutenant general bell he didnt expect it but he wanted to be ready for it if it happened better to take precautions without need than to need them without taking them these days general guildenstern fought blond savages out on the steppe his ignominious departure from the scene of the important action was no doubt intended as a warning to others who made mistakes in battle against the traitors john the listers shiver had nothing to do with the chilly weather he knew any man could make mistakeseven the gods made mistakes on the other hand things might have gone worse for guildenstern john considered the fate of brinton the bold whod led king avrams army in the west for most of the first two years of the war brinton was handsome and brave and had won a couple of small victories not long after the fighting started but he moved with the speed of a tortoise and his nickname soon seemed an ironic joke avram had asked not altogether in jest if he could borrow the army himself since brinton didnt seem to be using it these days brinton was a soldier no more he went around the south making speeches that fell just short of treasonous declaring that he would do a better job with a crown on his head than avram could if detina hadnt had a long tradition of letting any freeman say whatever he pleased as long as he didnt harm anybody brintons body probably would have hung from a cross near the black palace as a warning to others as things were the former general was merely an embarrassment to the army hed left and to most of the people who listened to him he had a hard core of supporters but john doubted theyd ever come to much in any case a soldier who remained a soldier had no business worrying about politics john listened to the tramp of thousands of booted feet that sound filled up the background of his days in the saddle it got mixed in with the sound of his own blood flowing through his veins so that it almost seemed a part of him when the men fell out for a rest break as they did every so often he missed it at sunset he chose a low swell of ground to make camp whats the name of this place he asked major strabo this sir is summer mountain his adjutant said after checking a map john the lister snorted mountain he said this isnt even a pimple next to the stonies out past the steppes to the east even here its hardly a hill its anything but insurmountable strabo agreed but summer mountain the map calls it and summer mountain it shall be forevermore miserable excuse for a mountain john grumbled its not summer any more either the unicornrider came galloping back toward ned of the forest lord ned he shouted lord ned ned was no lord but he didnt mind being called one no he didnt mind at all what did you see ben he asked you mustve seen something to be yelling like that sure did lord ned the rider named ben said the stinking southrons are camped on summer mountain only a couple of hours ride from where were at are they a sudden feral glow kindled in neds eyes how many of em doubting georges whole army no sir ben answered i dont even reckon theyve got as many men as we do is that a fact ned murmured the unicornrider nodded well well ned said in that case something ought to happen to em youre sure about what you saw now sure as im on my unicorns back ben said id take oath by the lion gods mane they arent trying to set up an ambush or anything like that no sir nothing like that at all ben said they were just making camp like theyd gone as far as they figured on going today and they were setting up for the night something really ought to happen to them then ned said you come along with me ben were going to have us a little talk with lieutenant general bell you reckon hell pay attention to the likes of me the unicornrider asked hell pay attention by the gods ned said softly if he doesnt pay attention to you hell have to pay attention to me he smiled a thoroughly grim smile hed met few men who cared to stand up under the full storm of his anger he and ben rode back toward bell who traveled with the pikemen and crossbowmen of the army of franklin when he saw bell on a unicorn he sighed the commanding general hadnt had an easy time of it ned had often wondered about bells common sense no one could doubt the leonine officers courage bells adjutant had had to tie him into the saddle the stump of his left leg was too short to give him a proper grip on the unicorns barrel ned looked down at himself hed been wounded several times and still had the tip of a crossbow quarrel lodged somewhere near his spine it had broken off the surgeon had dug out most of the bolt but not all men often died from a wound like his hed confounded the healershed got well instead he still had the use of all his parts even if some of them had been punctured nothing on earth would have made him trade places with lieutenant general bell what was it like to be a wreck of your former self what was it like to know you were the wreck of your former self bell knew those answers ned was glad he didnt respecting bells bravery he saluted the other officer the commanding general cautiously returned the salute with only one good hand he had to be cautious about taking it off the reins what can i do for you lieutenant general bell asked as it often did laudanum dulled his voice his sagging painracked features told the story of his suffering at neds prompting ben repeated his news for lieutenant general bell ned added sounds to me like if we move smart we can hit the southrons a devils of a lick i dont want to go straight at them bell said we just use up our army that way and we havent got enough men to be able to afford it but if we can flank the southrons out of their position if we can get around behind them and make them retreat past us if we can do that well really make them pay yes sir i like that ned of the forest liked hitting the enemyhe was one of the hardest hitters the north had hitting the enemy headon was a different story he saw that plainly and wondered why more of king geoffreys generals didnt nodding with pleasure he asked what do you want me to do hold the godsdamned southrons in place with your men bell answered dont let them come any farther north and dont let them get wind of how many men we have or what were doing with them ill try my best general ned said cant promise to hold off a whole army with just my unicornriders though yes i understand that bell said you can slow it down though and screen away the enemys riders eh i expect i can manage that much yes sir ned allowed wouldnt be much point to having unicornriders if we couldnt do that sort of thing would there i wouldnt think so the commanding general said well go on down and take care of it then the men on foot will follow and outflank the southrons while you keep them in play and when they realize weve got behind them and they have to retreat theyre ours i wish i could ride with you so do i sir ned said more or less truthfully bell was no unicornrider by trade but everyone said hed been a fierce fighter before he started leaving pieces of himself on the battlefield bell paused now to swig from the bottle of laudanum he always carried with him ahh he said and quivered with an ecstasy that almost matched a priests when he had a vision of his chosen god for a moment bells eyes lost their focus whatever he was looking at it wasnt the muddy road and the trees shedding the last of their leaves but then quite visibly he came back to himself you there trooper he nodded at ben yes sir the unicornrider asked youre a corporal now bell said you took chances to get your news and you deserve to be rewarded lieutenant general ned see that the promotion goes into your records so his pay at the new rank starts from today ill do that sir ned promised i was going to promote him myself matter of fact but better he gets it from the general commanding the whole army bennow corporal benlooked from ned to bell in delight thank you kindly both of you he exclaimed dont you worry about that youll earn those stripes on your shirt never fear ned said now come on weve got work to do he urged his unicorn forward with knees and reins and voice ben followed ned felt lieutenant general bells eyes boring into his back bell could ride well enough to stay in the saddle but hed never storm forward in a unicorn charge of course ned didnt plan on storming forward in a unicorn charge either more often than not he used his riders as mounted crossbowmen not as cavaliers slashing away with swords unicorns let them get where they needed to go far faster than they could have afoot getting there first with the most men was essential and if you got there first with a few most of the time you wouldnt need any more back in the west duke edwards commander of unicornriders jeb the steward had played at war as if it were a game his men had fought as much for sport and glory as to do the southrons harm theyd done quite a lot not even ned could deny it but jeb the steward had died the summer before hed died a hard nasty death with a southron crossbow bolt in his belly the war in the west had got grimmer since he fell here in the east the war had been grim from the start with the southrons holding down franklin and cloviston but a lot of men in the two provinces still loyal to the north brother sometimes faced brother sword in hand no fight could be more savage than one of that sort some of neds own unicornriders had kin on the other side ben pointed ahead theres our riders sir i see em ned answered he raised his voice to a great bellow blow advance the trumpeters obeyed the men cheered the martial music ned went right on roaring too weve got the godsdamned southrons ahead of us he told the unicornriders weve got em ahead of us and we need to hold their vanguard where its at reckon we can do that boys hells yes the troopers shouted if ned of the forest wanted them to do something they would do it or die trying but even reaching the southrons proved harder than ned had expected he booted his unicorn up to a trot so he could lead the riders from the front as he always did one reason they followed him so well was that they knew he wouldnt order them to go anywhere he wasnt going himself he knew where summer mountain lay and how to get there he knew the whole province of franklin id better he thought by now ive fought over just about every godsdamned inch of it he guided the troopers forward with confidence despite that confidence though after about an hour colonel biffle rode up to him and asked excuse me lord ned but should we be heading west west ned stared at him what the hells are you talking about biff im riding north and thats as plain as the horn on a unicorns face but even as he spoke he looked around as he did he started to swear he wasnt usually a blasphemous man only the prospect of battle brought foul language out in himbattle and being tricked before battle for when he did look around he saw that he had been riding west and hadnt known it face hot with fury he demanded where in the damnation is major marmaduke im here sir his chief mage came up on donkeyback few wizards could be trusted to ride unicorns without killing themselves marmaduke was a fussy little man who kept his blue sorcerers robe spotlessly clean no matter what what do you need i need a wizard whos really here not one who just thinks he is ned snarled why the demon didnt you notice weve been riding west not north major marmaduke looked astonished but were not riding he began and then broke off after a moment he looked even more astonished to say nothing of horrified by the gods weve been diddled he said we sure have i thought we were supposed to be the ones with the good wizards and the southrons were stuck with the odds and sods ned scornfully tossed his head seems like its the other way round lord ned i ammortified marmaduke stammered to think that i should be taken inthat i should let us all be taken inby a spell of misdirection i will say though that it was very cunningly laid i did not think the accursed southrons had such subtlety in them well they godsdamned well do ned growled and now were going to have to backtrack and hope by the thunderers prong that they havent gone and stolen a march on us if they have youll pay for it and youd best believe that marmaduke licked his lips yyyes sir with icy sarcasm ned went on you reckon you can see if they try any more magic on us while were heading back you up to that much anyways ii hope so sir the mage replied miserably so do i and youd better be scowling ned shouted to his men theyve tricked us when we catch em well make em pay meanwhile though weve got to ride like hells to get back to where we were at so we can catch em come on well do it right this time they rode hard anybody who wanted to fight under ned of the forest had to ride hard as his unicorn trotted back toward the place where theyd gone wrongned hoped it was back toward the place where theyd gone wronghe kept muttering morosely about major marmaduke the wizard still seemed bewildered at what had happened ned wasnt bewildered he was furious as far as he was concerned the southrons had no business outdoing northern men when it came to sorcery riding up ahead of his troopers he was one of the first to reach the crossroads from which his force had gone astray he couldnt imagine how it had happened he knew which fork he should have taken he thought he had taken it but the southrons magic had led him astray and had kept him from noticing anything was wrong he muttered again it had certainly kept major marmaduke from noticing if colonel biffle hadnt finally spotted the trouble ned didnt care to think about what might have happened then and riding up ahead of his troopers he was one of the first to spy the southrons riding toward the crossroads he threw back his head and laughed all right you sons of bitches he shouted you reckoned you could lead us astray and get here first now im going to show you you arent as smart as you figured he looked around as usual a trumpeter rode within easy range of his voice he waved to draw the mans attention then called blow charge as the martial notes rang out his sword leaped free from the scabbard the blade gleamed in the watery autumn sunshine he spurred his unicorn forward the welltrained beast lowered its head aimed its ironclad horn at the enemy and sprang toward the southrons king geoffrey ned shouted sometimes dragoon work wouldnt do sometimes you had to get right in there and fight unicorn to unicorn some of his men yelled geoffreys name too more though shouted lord ned they fought for him personally at least as much as for the north their swords also flashed free some of them fit arrows to the strings of the light crossbows they carried that would do for one volley anyhow reloading on unicornback wasnt for the faint of heart lets get em ned roared this is our road by the gods and theyve got no business trying to take it away from us as soon as the southrons spied his men and him they deployed from line to column their own grayclad officers briefly harangued them then they too were charging king avram they cried king avram and freedom to the hells with king avram the serfstealing bastard ned yelled his unicorn tore a bleeding line in the flank of the first enemy beast it met hed trained it always to gore to the right to protect him on that side a rider came up to him on the left the other fellow would have had most men at a disadvantage not lefthanded ned he chopped the southron out of the saddle how many men had he killed in the war a couple of dozen surely well hed killed before the war too a serfcatcher didnt have an easy life he had more men with him than the southron commander whod led a mere reconnaissance in force neds men were fiercer too at least that day they sent the southrons those who lived fleeing back in the direction from which theyd come as fast as they could gallop ned pushed them hard he always did they know were here now colonel biffle said as the pursuit at last wound down ned nodded and spoke one word good rollant had served in king avrams army for a couple of years now hed seen things go well and hed seen things go wrong he knew the signs for both unicornriders galloping back toward the crossbowmen and pikemen were not a good sign he knew that only too well turning to lieutenant griff he said somethings gone to the hells up ahead it does look that way doesnt it griffs voice broke as he answered he kicked at the muddy ground under his shoes he was very young and hated showing how young he was plenty of crossbowmen in the company drew the same conclusion as its standardbearer and commander who ever saw a dead unicornrider they jeered as the men on the beautiful beasts pounded past some of the riders pretended not to hear some cursed the footsoldiers who mocked them and one fellow yelled wait till you run up against ned of the forests troopers well see plenty of you bastards dead and youd better believe it after that corporal rollant gripped the staff of the company banner so tight his knuckles whitened he tramped on in silence grim determination on his face lieutenant griff needed a while to notice he wasnt the most perceptive man ever born but at last he asked is something wrong corporal ned of the forest rollant said tightly sir yes his riders really fight no doubt about it griff said i wish we had more men as good i truly do but fort cushion rollant broke in sir oh griff said for a wonder he had the sense not to say anything more fort cushion along the great river down in cloviston had been garrisoned by blonds loyal to king avram till neds men overran it stories of what happened next varied neds men claimed the blonds had started fighting again after surrendering theyd killed almost the whole garrison as a result yes sir rollants voice was bleak whatever happens i dont intend to let those bastards get their hands on me while im breathing i see griff said well corporal taking everything together i cant say that i blame you as the southron army tramped north rollant waited for the order to deploy from marching column into line of battle where neds riders were the bigger army of traitors couldnt be far behind not if rumor came anywhere close to telling the truth rollant wanted to fight part of that sprang from knowing that a blond had to do better than an ordinary detinan to be reckoned half as good and part of it sprang from his own desire to pay back neds men for what theyd down done in the southeast but the horn call he waited for never came instead after a little while the trumpeters blared out retreat what the hells are we retreating for rollant burst out i dont know lieutenant griff sounded almost as perplexed as rollant if not quite so furious but we have to obey the order we cant go on and attack the traitors all by ourselves rollant just then was ready to do exactly that regretfully he realized griff was right even more regretfully he turned back toward summer mountain it is a good defensive position was griff trying to convince rollant or himself rollant couldnt tell maybe the company commander couldnt tell either he went on if they have more men than we do how could our unicorn riders tell one way or the other if they only ran intoran fromneds riders rollant asked thats a good question corporal griff said i havent got a good answer for you i wish i did weve been fighting this war for a long time now rollant grumbled why dont we have generals who know what the hells theyre doing yet i think john the lister has a pretty good idea of what hes doing griff said if that is the traitors whole army north of us weve got to slow it down as much as we can we havent got the men to crush it all by ourselves by the lion gods claws id like to try rollant declared lieutenant griff started to answer then stopped and gave him a curious look it wasnt quite the ordinary curious look he would have given had he been arguing strategy with another ordinary detinan it also held a certain amountperhaps more than a certain amountof surprise rollant had no trouble reading griffs thoughts heres a blond whos more interested in fighting the traitors than the commanding general is arent his kind supposed to be cowards and weaklings wearily rollant hefted the company standard even more wearily he said sir you didnt let me keep this because i was afraid to fight the northerners you didnt promote me to corporal because i was afraid either the more of those bastards we kill the sooner this godsdamned warll be over my griff said after a long long silence you have got fire in your belly havent you who better to have fire in his belly than somebody who grew up bound to a liege lords lands and ran away rollant replied i really know what were trying to knock down sir that produced another silence even longer than the first rollant wondered if hed said too much if griff would take him for no more than an uppity blond from now on at last the company commander said if all blonds had your spirit corporal we detinans would have had a much harder time casting down the blond kingdoms in the north after we crossed the western ocean he means well hes trying to pay me a compliment rollant reminded himself he chose his words with care when we fight the traitors sir weve got crossbows and ironheaded pikes and unicorns and siege engines and all the rest and so do they what we fight with is even on both sides if the blonds back in those days had had all that stuff instead of bronze maces and asses hauling chariots and if theyd known more wizardry the detinans would have had a lot tougher time so you think it was the quality of the equipment and magic not the quality of the men griff said of course sir dont you again rollant wondered if hed said too much griff startled him by laughing that isnt the lesson detinans learn in school you know he remarked yes i know it isnt but dont you think its true anyhow lieutenant griff didnt answer right away rollant gave him credit for that a lot of detinans would have at last his voice troubled griff said there may be some truth in what you say corporal but wouldnt you agree that the first detinan conquerors were also heroes for overcoming so many with so few now it was rollants turn to think before he spoke hed never tried to put himself in the place of those first detinans to cross the western ocean his sympathies lay with the blonds only reluctantly did he take the conquerors side in his mind no more than a couple of hundred of them had come on that first expedition to what was now palmetto province theyd pushed inland till they found the blond kingdom closest to the western oceanand theyd shattered it they might have been villains they hadnt been weaklings his voice as troubled as griffs rollant answered there may be some truth in what you say lieutenant thank you griff said which surprised him the company commander explained ive heard blondseducated men men whod lived all their lives in the south and were never serfssay the first heroes were nothing but bandits and robbers and should have been crucified for what they did that goes too far i think maybe rollant said but then ive heard detinanseducated men whod lived all their lives in the south and were never liege lordssay blonds were nothing but cowards and dogs and should have got even worse than what the first conquerors gave them that also goes too far i think thats different griff said how rollant asked uh how sir why griff stopped undoubtedly hed been about to answer why because that has to do with blonds or some such thing unlike a lot of ordinary detinans he saw that wouldnt do here he gave rollant a lopsided grin have anyone ever told you you can be difficult corporal me sir rollant shook his head i dont know what youre talking about all i want to do is get to the bottom of things and if that doesnt prove my point i dont know what would the lieutenant waved to the low swell of ground ahead theres summer mountain not even to rollants eye trained by the low country of palmetto province did it look anything like a mountain griff went on as i said before its a good defensive position yes sir rollant agreed dolefully i thought the idea was to get out there and fight the enemy though i wonder why were not difficult griff repeated but he had a smile in his voice when they did return to summer mountain colonel nahath promptly set the whole regiment to digging trenches and heaping the earth up in front of them for breastworks rollant didnt mind digging on the contrarythe long campaign up in peachtree province the previous spring and summer had taught him along with the rest of general hesmucets army the value of trenches isnt this fun smitty said flinging up dirt its a lot more fun than getting shot rollant answered to the hells with me if i want to stand out there in the open for the traitors to shoot at well there is that smitty admitted but its a lot of work too i dont mind work rollant said this is the kind of work i chose for myself when i volunteered to be a soldier smitty gave him a quizzical look you sure youre one of those shiftless noaccount lazy blonds everybodys always talking about only a few men in the regiment could ask him a question like that without making him angry smitty fortunately was one of those few rollant paused in his own digging thought for a moment and then said youve got a farm outside of new eborac city so you work for yourself right for myself and ahead of that for my old man yes smitty answered you work hard then right id better smitty wiped his sweaty face on his sleeve wholl do the job if i dont now imagine your boss doesnt care about youhe just wants to get work out of you rollant said i didnt know youd met my father smitty said that threw rollant off his glideway path of thought he needed some effort to return to it suppose he doesnt care about you like i said suppose he can do anything he wants to you suppose you have to do what he says no matter what it is and suppose no matter what you do you dont get to keep a coppers worth of money from the crop you bring in doesnt sound very good smitty said got any more supposes no thats the lot of them rollant said suppose theyre all true how hard would you work then id do the least i could get away with i expect smitty paused taking the point so youre saying blonds arent lazy on account of the gods made em lazy youre saying theyre lazy on account of the liege lords give em the shitty end of the stick either that or they give em the whole stick right across the back rollant turned away so smitty wouldnt see his enormous grin hed actually made an ordinary detinan understand some small fraction of what serfdom was like here ive got a question for you smitty said go ahead rollant answered you know that book that lady wroteaunt clarissas serf hut how true to life is that ten years before the war between the provinces broke out aunt clarissas serf hut had scandalized the south and north though in different ways it had outraged the south while infuriating northern nobles they called it a pack of lies wrote denunciations and rebuttals by the scoreand banned it in their provinces to keep serfs from getting their hands on it well ive read it rollant said read it a while after it came out because i needed to learn my letters first after i ran away from baron ormerod i thought it was pretty good the liege lord in the book was a lot nastier than ormerod but there are some like him i never knew a blond who was made out of sugar and honey paste the way some of the ones in the story are but it tells about what a hard nasty life serfs have and thats all pretty much true what did you think of it made me want to grab the first northern nobleman i saw and give him a good kick in the teeth smitty said suppose you just get back to work instead sergeant joram rumbled from behind him yes sergeant smitty said meekly and dug in with the shovel but working didnt keep him from talking some of the people weve got set over us they might as well be liege lords themselves he had a point in a lot of ways underofficers had more power over common soldiers than nobles did over serfs rollant hadnt thought of it like that before but it was so does that make me like baron ormerod he wondered in spite of the warm work he shivered that was a chilling thought if ever there was one from unicornback colonel florizel called come on men keep moving if we get around behind the stinking southrons we can bag the whole rotten lot of them the colonels right captain gremio agreed if we move fast now it pays off later we can give king avrams men just what they deserve sergeant thisbe was blunter about the whole business as sergeants have a way of being keep moving you worthless slobs weve got somewhere to get to and were going to get there gods damn it and the men paid more attention to thisbe than they did to gremio and florizel put together that didnt particularly surprise gremio he could order them into fights where they might get killed but thisbe had the power to make their everyday life hells on earth on they tramped making the best time they could down muddy roads they never saw a southron unicornrider captain gremio assumed that was ned of the forests doing ned was no gentleman as far as he was concerned gentleman or not ned knew what he was doing with unicornriders at last with evening twilight fading from the sky they had to stop for the night thisbe sent the spriest men out to gather wood and fill water jugs other soldiers simply flopped down exhausted as fires began to burn the weary men gathered around them to toast hard bread and meat and simply to get warm all through the first part of the night more and more stragglers joined them men whod marched as hard as they could but hadnt been able to stand the pace gremio held a chunk of hard bread over the flames on a forked stick he didnt watch while he did it he was one of those who preferred not to think about the weevils that were abandoning his supper sometimes of course he had to eat bread without toasting it first he preferred not to think about everything that crunched between his teeth then too sergeant thisbe sat at the same fire looking as worn as gremio felt one by one soldiers lay down where they were and started to snore thisbe yawned but stayed awake so did gremio after a while with more and more snores rising around them gremio quietly asked can we talk i dont really think weve got a whole lot to say to each other sir thisbe answered not about that anyway i know what i know gremio said i have the evidence yes he was a barrister through and through youll do what you want to do sir thisbes voice was toneless but gremio couldnt shout he couldnt even swear not without he shook his head i dont want to tell anybody about im glad the sergeant said i just want to sergeant thisbe interrupted again to what sir normally a sergeant who kept interrupting an officer would find himself in trouble in short order things werent normal here as gremio knew too well thisbe went on theres nothing you can do sir theres nothing anybody can do till the wars over but then gremio said but then who knows thisbe broke in once more and once more gremio let the sergeant do it without a hint without so much as a thought of reprimand i think youre the best company commander the regiments ever had to the hells with me if i know whether that means anything else a shrug well find out then not now you know what i think of yousome of it anyhow gremio said you know i wanted to get you promoted to lieutenant i didnt want that you know i didnt want that the harsh flickering shadows from the fading fire exaggerated thisbes rueful expression now i suppose you think you know why i didnt want it too gods damn it maybe i do gremio said quite sure he did he took a deep breath then continued well heres something you may not know thisbe d sergeant once upon a time before i got wounded thisbe asked oh yes a long time before you got wounded gremio answered once upon a time a long time before you got wounded i told myself that if i ever met a girl who could do the things you can id marry her on the spot did you sergeant thisbes voice held no expression whatever when gremio tried to read the underofficers face he found he couldnt the brim of thisbes hat cast black shadow all across it for the sergeant stared down at the muddy ground gremio nodded that was what i said to myself and i meant it too you can take it for whatever you think its worth sergeant it would be worth a lot i figure to a girl like that thisbe said but im not so much of a much i expect you could find half a dozen girls who knew more than a dumb soldier like me ever dreamed of just by snapping your fingers the sergeants light true tenor was uncommonly earnest you dont give yourself enough credit gremio had to fight to keep anger out of his voice for as long as ive known you youve never given yourself enough credit and i cant figure out why thisbe still didnt look up the sergeants laugh seemed anything but mirthful you know me you know where i am cant you figure it out for yourself well maybe i can gremio said all right then and if you dont mind my saying so sir thats about enough of that for right now thats too much of that for right now if you want to know what i really think thisbes yawn was theatrical but probably no less real on account of that im going to wrap myself in my blanket and go to sleep you ought to do the same thing yes so i should seeing thisbe yawning made gremio want to yawn toonot that he wasnt already weary after a long days march good night sergeant good night sir thisbes blanket was worn almost threadbare gremio had a thicker finer one were things different he would gladly have given his to the underofficer or at least invited thisbe to crawl under it with him he remembered doing exactly that back in the days before thisbe was wounded he could no more imagine doing it now than he could imagine chasing all the southrons back to their own part of detina singlehanded his hat made a tolerable pillow hed long since stopped worrying about having anything fancier he fell asleep almost at once as he always did when the army of franklin was on the move tramping along all day would knock a man out even if he wanted to stay awake and gremio didnt horn calls pulled him out from under his blanket in the morning he creaked to his feet feeling elderly thisbe was already awake and sipping tea from a tin cup the northerners called it tea anyhow gremio didnt want to know from what all leaves and stems it was really made the southrons blockade kept much of the real stuff from getting into king geoffreys harried realm gremio fixed himself a cup of his own even with honey added the brew was bitter and nasty but it was warm and some of those leaves helped pry his eyelids apart the way real tea did he said thats better and drained the cup couldnt hardly get by without something hot in the morning thisbe agreed colonel florizel limped up well be getting on the road soon the regimental commander said so far it doesnt look like the godsdamned southrons are stirring away from summer mountain if we can get around behind em well bugger em right and proper he laughed loudly er yes sir gremio said florizel stumped off looking miffed that the barrister hadnt laughed with him gremio probably would have if thisbe hadnt been standing there beside him the sergeant sent him a reproachful look i thought it was pretty funny sir i hope we do bugger the southrons had the sergeant not been there gremio would have laughed he knew that he also knew he had to say something and did i didnt think it was all that much of a joke besides he shouldnt have said it when i was around thisbe asked when gremio nodded the sergeant looked even more reproachful than before whats that got to do with anything im just one of the boys and everybody knows it right gremio said tightly shall we get the men ready to move sergeant yes sir if anything bothered thisbe no sign of it appeared in the sergeants face or bearing and the men did move they might have moved faster if more of them had had shoes but northern men were too stubborn to give in on account of something that trivial as usual no one begrudged colonel florizel his place on a unicorn his wound wouldnt have let him keep up on foot ned of the forests men were on unicorns too and seemed to be doing their job again gremio spotted not a single grayclad southron rider his guess was that the enemy really didnt know where the army of franklin was he knew a certain amount of hope on account of that the last time the southrons had been so fooled was before the battle by the river of death more than a year ago now if they could be tricked again well who could say what might happen wed better not mess things up the way we did then gremio thought the army of franklin could have surrounded guildenstern at rising rock and forced him to surrender they could have but they hadnt and in due course theyd paid for the omission general bell was trying to make amends for that now maybe he would even a hardened cynic of a barrister like gremio couldnt help hoping form column of fours he yelled the men obeyed before joining king geoffreys army gremio hadnt dreamt how important marching drill was soldiers moved in column fought in line if they couldnt shift from one to the other in a hurry they were in trouble getting caught in column was every commanders blackest nightmare up at the head of the brigade horns ordered the advance a moment later colonel florizels trumpeters echoed the command for the regiment the company had a trumpeter too the only trouble was he wasnt much of a trumpeter his notes assailed gremios ears lets go sergeant thisbe shouted away the army of franklin went heading south general bell dreamt of reaching the highlow river if he could do it he would give king avram an enormous black eye he might remind the provinces of franklin and cloviston of their allegiance to king geoffreyand more to the point bring their men and supplies into the war on geoffreys side not avrams that would make the fight in the east a whole different struggle captain gremios dreams were smaller he would have been satisfiedno by the gods he would have been delightedif the northerners could get around behind summer mountain and cut off the retreat of the southrons there one bite at a time he told himself if we can do one thing right more will follow from that birds filled the sky overhead they were flying north for the winter flying north to escape the coming cold and snow and ice pointing to them thisbe said theyre smarter than we aretheyre going the right way for this time of year i was just thinking the same thing gremio said and beamed at the sergeant thisbe didnt beam back every so often a soldier would take a shot at the stream of birds every once in a while a crossbow bolt would strike home and a bird tumble out of the sky the lucky soldier would run over and grab it and put it on his belt to cook when the army stopped that nightif some other man didnt get it first after gremio broke up a couple of quarrels that were on the edge of turning into brawls he ordered the men of his company to stop shooting at the birds thats not fair captain a soldier said were hungry gods damn it anything we can get is all to the good its not all to the good if you start stealing from one another and brawling gremio replied well do better hungry than we will if we cant trust each other the captains right thisbe declared most of these birds arent any more than a couple of mouthfuls anyway theyre not worth the trouble theyre stirring up no one could say gremio or thisbe ate better than the common soldiers in the company they didnt the soldiers might have grumbled but they followed orders the only trouble was not all commanders gave those orders so quarrels over birds elsewhere slowed the companyand a crossbow quarrel shot at a bird came down point first at gremios feet had it come down on his head one more thing he preferred not to contemplate he stooped yanked it out of the ground and held it high heres another reason not to shoot things up in the air he said a voice rose from the ranks thats right by the gods if were gong to shoot our officers we should aim straight at em the marching men bayed laughter gremio managed a smile he hoped wasnt too sickly along came a mage in a blue robe riding on the back of an ass he was muttering to himself his fingers writhing in quick passes as he incanted an ass on an ass another uniformed wit called the wizard affected not to noticeor maybe preoccupied with the spell he was casting he really didnt whatever sort of magic it was gremio hoped it worked it must have for the company the regimentthe whole armyhalted earlier than hed expected colonel florizel rode up with a great big grin on his face weve got em he said weve got em good by the gods this is the only way they can retreat and they have to come right by us when they do well land on their flank and then he slashed a finger across his throat the soldiers raised a cheer gremios voice loud among theirs general john general john sir the mage shouting john the listers name sounded on or maybe just over the ragged edge of hysteria what is it john asked when people started shouting in that tone of voice it wasnt going to be anything good and it wasnt the mage burst into johns pavilion horror was etched on his face theyve used a masking spell on us sir he cried no need to ask who they were and what is this masking spell supposed to do john inquired whatever its supposed to do has it done it yes sir the mage sounded like a tragedian playing in an amphitheater in front of images of the gods at a high festival im afraid theyve got round behind the army sir we didnt notice till too late what john the lister felt like doing was kicking the mage in the teeth botched wizardry had cost king avrams armies dear again and again now it looked as if it was going to cost john instead of doing what he felt like he asked didnt notice what didnt notice general bells army on the move sir the mage answered miserably the wizards masked it from us till just now so did ned of the forests unicornriders john the listers voice was unhappy and enlightened at the same time hed wondered why neds men had been so active pushing back his own pickets and generally doing their best to impersonate bells whole army he hadnt worried much about it not till now ned was always busy and active he wouldnt have made such a pest of himself if he werent what will we do sir the grayrobed mage howled what can we do well it seems to me that getting out of this mess would be a pretty good idea john replied dont you agree yyes sir but how i dont know yet john the lister said i expect ill figure something out though once i know where the enemy is thatll tell me a lot about what i can do sir heshes behind us between us and poor richard between us and ramblerton white showed all around the irises of the wizards eyes as if he were a spooked unicorn thats not so good john said which would do for an understatement till a bigger one came along he tried for a bigger one in his very next sentence if theres one thing you dont want its the traitors sitting on your supply line especially when the harvest is done and the foragings bad how can we hope to escape despite johns calm the wizard was the next thing to frantic if we stay here well starve if we try to retreat past the enemy hell hit us in the flank hell probably block the road too so well have no hope of getting by this isnt the best position to try to defend john said too open too exposed bells men could make a clean sweep of us and they wouldnt have to work very hard to do it either if were on the move though if were on the move theyll strike us in the flanks the mage repeated maybe they will john the lister agreed politely but maybe they wont too funny things can happen when youre on the movelook at how they just diddled us for instance they fooled us so maybe we can fool them too hows your masking spell these days lieutenant not good enough sir or they wouldnt have been able to do this to us the wizard still seemed ready to cry john the lister slapped him on the back hard enough to send him staggering halfway across the pavilion well you and your friends should work on it because i think were going to need it soon youre dismissed muttering under his breath the mage left once he was gone john the lister spent a minute or two cursing his luck and the incompetence of the wizards with whom hed been saddled a lot of southron generals had sent those curses up toward mount panamgam the gods home beyond the sky the gods unfortunately showed no sign of heeding them if nothing else cursing made john feel better general guildenstern would have got drunk which would have made him feel better but wouldnt have done his army any good doubting george would have loosed a volley of sardonic remarks that made him feel better and left his targets in despair john tried to relieve his own feelings without carving chunks from anyone else he didnt always succeed but he did try once hed got the bile out of his system he ordered a runner to find his adjutant and bring him back to the pavilion major strabo came in a few minutes later whats the trouble sir he asked the commanding general explained his walleyed subordinate seemed to stare every which way at once well thats a cute kettle of cod strabo said when john finished and what in the name of the cods sort of coddity let the traitors hook us like that they outmagicked us john replied theyve done it before theyll probably do it again now we have to figure out how to keep this from ending up a net loss for one brief horrified moment both of strabos eyes pointed straight at him you should be ashamed of yourself the major said sir probably john the lister agreed but i have more important things to worry about right now so does this whole army your statement holds some veracity yes major strabos eyes went their separate ways again what do you propose to do sir that was about as straightforward a question as was likely to come from johns adjutant the commanding general answered i propose to get this army out in one piece if i can if bell forces a fight then we give him a fight thats all will you let him come to you or do you aim to go to him two straightforward questions in a rowjohn the lister wondered if strabo was feeling well he replied were going back toward poor richard if we can get there its a good defensive position and if we stay here bell can starve us out without fighting to the hells with me if i aim to let him do that draft orders for our withdrawal down the road to poor richard warning it may be a fighting retreat yes sir strabo said and then after some hesitation uh sir you do know it may be a great deal worse than that oh yes i know it john nodded heavily i know it and you know it but if the men dont know it theyre likely to fight better if they have to or do you think im wrong major no sir major strabo answered i am of the opinion that your accuracy is unchallengeable not only that but i think youre right im so glad john murmured well prepare those orders for my signature ill want to get moving this afternoon so dont waste any time i wouldnt dream of it said strabo who was as diligent as he was difficult will you want all your unicornriders in the van reluctantly john the lister shook his head no wed better leave half of them in the rear to keep ned of the forest off us hardriding jimmy looks like hes still wet behind the ears but he knows what hes doing for us and those quickshooting crossbows his riders have make a small force go a long way half the men at the van will do and we need the rest back at the rear we couldnt move very godsdamned fast if neds men kept chewing at the hind end of our column write em that way with ned back there bell wont have many unicornriders at the front of his army either that makes sense major strabo said it may not be right mind you but it does make sense im glad i have you to relieve my mind john told him strabo smiled and inclined his head as if he thought that a genuine compliment maybe he did he was more than a little hard to fathom john went on draft those orders now the sooner you do the sooner we see if we cant set this mess to rights yes sir you may rely on me as soon as i pluck a quill from a gooses wing strabo made as if to grab a goose from the sky john made as if to strangle his adjutant they both laughed each a little nervously however difficult strabo might have been the marching orders he prepared were a small masterpiece of concision along with a detachment of unicornriders he also posted most of the southron wizards in the van john nodded approval of that he wasnt sure how much good the wizards would do but he wanted them in position to do as much as they could the army hadnt even left summer mountain before john realized how much trouble it was in sure enough bells army was posted close to the road down which his own force had to withdraw all the northerners had to do was reach out their hands and his army was theirs that was how it looked at first glance anyhow he hoped it wouldnt seem so bad as he got closer to the foe it didnt instead it seemed worse the northern army was drawn up in battle array perhaps half a mile west of the road leading south to poor richard john felt like deploying into battle line facing them and sidling down the road crabfashion he couldnthe knew he couldntbut he felt like it skirmishers rushed forward and started shooting bolts at his men his repeating crossbows hosed them with death here and there men on both sides fell but it was only skirmishing no worse and didnt force him to halt his march and try to drive back the traitors a few northern catapults came forward too and flung stones and firepots at his long column most of the missiles missed every once in a while though one of them would take a bite out of the long file of men in gray tunics and pantaloons the dead lay where they fellno time to gather them up let alone to build pyres and burn them soldiers with crushed limbs or with burns from a bursting firepot would go into the wagons for healers and surgeons to do what they could major strabo said if their main force attacks we are dead meat think so do you john the lister said godsdamned right i do his adjutant answered dont you well now that you mention it yes john said weve already got farther than i thought we would whats wrong with them strabo seemed almost indignant at not being annihilated is our masking spell working that well he sounded as if he didnt believe it john the lister didnt believe it either he had good solid reasons not to believe it too cant be major he said if it were their skirmishers wouldnt know were here major strabos eyes slewed wildly as he watched the brisk little fightand it was only a little fightover on the armys right flank whats wrong with general bell is he cracked hes at liberty to attack us whenever he pleases and whats he doing nothing much john answered the rhetorical question then he asked one of his own are you sorry no sir or i dont think so sir the only trouble is if bell isnt attacking us here id like to know why he isnt whats he got waiting for us down the road that was a good question and anything but rhetorical i dont know john admitted he waved to the men in blue most of whom still watched his army tramp past their positions what i do know is he cant have too much because that over there has to be most of the army of franklin or will you tell me im wrong no sir cant do it sir strabo replied hells i didnt think bell had even that many men but wheres the plug on the road that has to be it as soon as they force us to stop then theyll all swarm forward again he almost sounded as if he looked forward to it i dont know where it is we havent bumped into it yet but even as john the lister spoke a unicornrider came galloping back toward the army ice raced up johns spine for a moment there hed almost known hope now the bad news would come all the crueler for being late well he barked as the rider drew near the roads clear sir all the way south the unicornrider said the traitors arent trying to block it not anywhere we can find youre joking john said it automatically for no better reason than that he couldnt believe his ears no sir the rider shook his head by the thunderers lightning bolt the way south is as empty of men as thraxton the braggarts head is of sense than which indeed nothing could be more emptyor should i say less full major strabo shook his head too and answered his own question no i think not for thraxton the braggart unquestionably is full of he certainly is john the lister said hastily but that doesnt really matter especially since thraxtons not in charge of the traitors any more what matters is they had us all boxed in he waved toward the men in blue still drawn up in plain sight the men in blue who still werent advancing against his own force they had us and they didnt finish the job i dont know how they didnt i dont know why they didnt but they didnt most of the time john was a serious man now he felt giddy almost drunk with relief now general bells let us get away and very soon i think hell rue the day strabo declaimed has anyone ever called you a poet major john asked why no sir major strabo looked as modest as a walleyed man could well i understand why john said his adjutant sent him an injured look the commanding general didnt care something had gone wrong for the traitors john didnt know what but he knew the only thing that mattered he would gladly take advantage of it iii lieutenant general bell had taken what the healers politely called a heroic dose of laudanum even by his own standards hed taken plenty to leave a unicorn flat on its back waving its hooves in the air a silly smile on its face for once bell felt no physical pain but bell was sure all the laudanum in the world wouldnt have sufficed to take the edge off his towering inferno of wrath had he had two working arms and two legs he would have done murder against his wing and brigade commanders as things were he could only scorch them with his leonine eyes wishing each and every one of them into the most agonizing firepit of the hottest hell you idiots he roared you bunglers you fools you knaves how could you let the godsdamned southrons escape you how how the word came out as an agonized howl are you cowards or are you traitors those are the only two choices i see his officers stirred he didnt think any of them would have the effrontery to answer him but patrick the cleaver did in that case sir youd better get new fletching for your sight so itll carry farther oh unicorn shit bell bellowed i watched you botching boobies there on the field i watched you and what did i see nothing nothing gods damn it you would not close with them none of you would you spineless squid the best move in my career as a soldier i was thus destined to behold come to naught to naught you disgrace the uniforms you infest a halfwitted dog could have led an attack that would have swept the southrons away would id had one in an officers uniform the subordinate commanders stirred again more angrily a brigadier whose parents had given him the uncompromising name of provincial prerogative hissed you have no business to use us so sir you had no business to use me so bell yelled still in a perfect transport of fury did i order you to attack the retreating southrons i did and did you attack them you did not they escaped and whose fault is that mine no by the gods yours a very redfaced young brigadier called hiram the cranberry said you have no business calling us cowards and dogs you have no business acting like cowards and dogs bell raged you were supposed to act like soldiers did you did you he was screaming again he half hoped he would have an apoplexy and die so he could escape this mortification sir we did the best we could said another brigadier a short squat fellow known as otho the troll then gods help king geoffrey and his kingdom bell said you go too far sir you truly do patrick the cleaver said indeed and its a sore trial to our honor have you any its news to me lieutenant general bell wished he could simply turn his back on the wing and brigade commanders being a cripple brought with it all sorts of humiliations some less obvious than others for gods sake sir another brigadier burst out that was his favorite expression because of it he was widely called for gods sake john twirling one end of his fiercely outswept mustache he went on you damage your own honor sir when you impugn ours thats right that is well said agreed a brigadier known as count john of barsoom after the peachtree province estate where hed grown goobers before the war he thought very well of himself i dont damage my honor youthe lot of youdamaged my honor bell insisted if youd only done what i told you to do we would be celebrating an enormous victory right now instead we havethis he gestured in disgust you are dismissed every single one of you i wish i never had to see any of you ever again the gods dont grant all wishesi know that were you after calling us together for no better purpose than to be railing at us like your excellency was a crazy man patrick the cleaver asked a bad business that is a very bad business indeed bell could at the moment think of no better purpose than the one patrick had named if the officer from the sapphire isle didnt agree with himwell too bad for patrick the cleaver you are dismissed bell said again get out of my sight before i murder you all he couldnt make good on the threat he knew that his subordinate commanders had to know it too but if his look could have stretched them all dead on their pyres it would have they had to know that too by the way they hurried off they feared his glare might strike them dead he took yet another swig of laudanum after they were gone he hoped it would make him fall over again no such luck it didnt even quell his fury all it did was make him a little woozy a little sleepy he heaved himself to his feet no easy job not with a missing leg and a useless arm laudanum or no laudanum sticking a crutch in his left armpit brought a stab of pain he welcomed it like an old friend being without pain these days felt unnatural he pushed his way out through the tent flap the sentries guarding the pavilion stiffened to attention they saluted general bell nodded in reply returning a salute while he was on his feeton his foot ratherwasnt easy the army of franklin was encamped not far from the road down which john the listers southrons had escaped healers still worked on some of the men whod been wounded in the skirmishes of the day before bell growled something under his breath and ground his teeth his army shouldnt have skirmished with the southrons it should have crushed them one of the sentries pointed north the motion swung bells eyes in that direction too the soldier said looks like ned of the forests unicornriders are coming in sir yes it does bell said i wish theyd been here yesterday say what you will about ned but he knows how to fight which is more than most of the useless worthless officers in this miserable godsforsaken army can do prudently the sentry didnt answer before long neds men were pitching their tents and building campfires next to those of the footsoldiers in the army of franklin ned of the forest himself rode toward lieutenant general bells pavilion he swung down from his unicorn with an easy grace bell remembered painfullyand that was indeed the way he remembered itwell by the gods bell ned cried striding up to him what went wrong i dont know bell answered his bitterness overflowing what i know is im surrounded by idiots i know that right down to the ground we had em ned declared we had em all we had to do was bite down on em and chew em up why didnt we i wish i could tell you bell said i gave the necessary commands i gave them repeatedly i gave them and i saw them ignored the attack i ordered did not take place i wish it had we wont get another chance like that ned warned lieutenant general bell nodded that lieutenant general i do know i wish i could cashier every brigade commander in my army but i cant gods damn it there was a squabble like this here one after the battle by the river of death ned of the forest said so ive heard bell said if i hadnt been wounded in that fight i daresay i would have been a part of it reckon youre right ned said thraxton the braggart wanted to get rid of all of his officers too and we all wanted to kill him by the way neds hands folded into fists he meant that literally bell remembered stories hed heard while recovering from his amputation and what ned had said not long ago after a moment the scowl fading from his face ned went on thraxton got his way on account of hes pals with king geoffreyyoull know about that i expect thraxton got his way all rightbut the army was never the same again meaning no disrespect sir but it may be just as well you cant get rid of em all i find that hard to believevery hard as a matter of fact bell said im telling you what i think ned of the forest answered if you dont care for what i think he didnt go on but something nasty sparked in his eyes if you dont care for what i think to the hells with you had to be what he meant even full of anger as bell was he hesitated before provoking ned he shrugged a oneshouldered shrug instead maybe he said grudgingly what are you going to do now ned asked adding sir as an afterthought we have to keep moving south general bell answered john the lister got away this time when i catch him though ill make him pay my bet is hes heading toward poor richard ned said i know that part of franklini know it right well he spoke with great assurance hed fought all across franklin and cloviston and dothan and great river province ever since the war began without a doubt he knew them more intimately than most officers could hope to he went on some places around there if the southrons dig in theyll be mighty hard to dig out will john know those places bell asked if he doesnt somebody in his force will ned said plenty of traitors wearing southron gray to a soldier who followed king geoffrey a northerner who stayed loyal to avram was a traitor a fair number of men from franklin and even more from cloviston had chosen avram over geoffrey they fought their own small bitter war with geoffreys backers in addition to and alongside of the larger struggle waged between the main armies of the two rival kings plenty of traitors to good king geoffrey still in blue bell muttered if my commanders had done what they were supposed to ned of the forest held up a hand plenty of peopleplenty of people with fancy uniforms onare naturalborn fools i dont reckon anybody could quarrel with that but you have to remember theres a sight of difference between a naturalborn fool and a traitor maybe bell said even more grudgingly than before by the lion gods claws though i wish youd been at my van and not harassing the southrons rear youd have blocked the road down to the trumpeteth river and poor richard the way it should have been blocked i hope i would ned said but it takes more than magic to let a man be two places at once if i hadnt been harrying the southrons they couldve moved quicker and they mightve got out of your trap before you could spring it he was right bell knew as much that didnt make his words any more palatable though bah bell said a reply that didnt require him to admit ned was right realizing he needed something more he continued i trust lieutenant general you will lead the pursuit of the southrons now oh yes sir ned answered ill send the boys after em ill do it right this minute if you want me to no let it wait till the morning bell said your unicorns are worn and so are my pikemen and crossbowmen no point to a strong pursuit unless were fit to fight my boys are always fit to fight ned of the forest declared if yours arent too bad for them having had the last word he got back onto his unicorn and rode away the beasts hooves kicking up dirt at each stride bell started to growl at him to order him to come back and explain himself and apologize he left the order unspoken he was as brave a soldier as any who served king geoffrey no one without great courage would or could have stayed in the field after the wounds hed taken but even he didnt care to antagonize ned of the forest well get them bell muttered if we dont catch up to them on the road well get them in poor richard john the lister might have slid by me once but he wont do it again where railing at his subordinate commanders hadnt done a thing that did help ease his wrath all i need is another try he thought all the north needs is another try we can still lick those southron sons of bitches we can and we have to and so of course we will he went back into his pavilion a folding chair waited for him with a weary sigh he sank into it and leaned his crutches against the ironframed cot nearby with his one good hand free he fumbled for the laudanum bottle he pulled it out yanked the stopper free with his teeth and took one more long swig little by little the latest dose of the drug washed through him he sighed at last he had enough laudanum coursing through his veins to stop worrying quite so much about what might have been he felt much more alive with the mixture of opium and brandy than he ever had without it there were times when he felt his mutilations were almost worthwhile without them he never would have made the acquaintance of the wonders of laudanum and he couldnt imagine living apart from it not any more he couldnt but not even laudanums soothing influence altogether stifled his rage against the men who had let him down how many times do i have to give the command to advance he wondered what can i do when they refuse to listen i cant charge the godsdamned southrons myself not on one leg he had charged them many times the catapult stone that had smashed his thigh by the river of death was the reason he went on one leg these days next time he muttered we will get them next time then the huge doses of the drug hed taken overwhelmed even his laudanumaccustomed frame a wriggle and a scramble shifted him from the chair to the cot he twisted into a position that put the least weight on his bad shoulder and his stump closed his eyes and slept dreaming of blood and victory here you are sir the grayrobed scryer said standing up from the stool in front of his crystal ball so lieutenant general george could take his place thats true here i am doubting george sat down john the listers image tiny and perfect stared out of the crystal ball at him george said so youre on your way to poor richard now are you yes sir john answered by the thunderers beard im glad to be past the traitors too i thought theyd cooked our goose at summer mountain never give up doubting george said till they kill you youre still in the fight and after that make em worry about your ghost havent seen any ghosts on the battlefield sir john the lister said its the live sons of bitches who worry me if bell pursues hard i could still wind up in trouble what can i do to help you doubting george asked another ten thousand men would be nice john replied george chuckled hed made many such wry remarks himself but this one unfortunately he couldnt answer with more than a chuckle he said id send them to you if i had them but i dont do you know how much trouble im having pulling garrisons out of towns and off of glideway lines here and down in cloviston i have some small idea john sounded even drier than before you wouldnt have sent me up here to take a beatingi mean to slow down lieutenant general bell of courseif you thought it would be easy still if you had them to spare i could really use them right now i havent got them to spare i havent got them at all as a matter of fact george said youre commanding more men than i am right now general hesmucet did me no favors when he put me in charge of these provinces after he went and stripped most of the good soldiers out of them superiors dont usually do favors for subordinates they give hard nasty jobs to john the lister said uh yes doubting george felt skewered by the sort of dart he usually aimed at other officers hed given john a hard nasty job and was uncomfortably aware of it i am doing the best i can he assured the man to whom hed given it im sure of that sir john didnt come right out and call him a liar but he didnt miss by much if you cant give me reinforcements can you send that hotshot mage of yours up to me major alva you mean i forget his name the one who actually knows what hes doing even if he looks like an unmade bed and has no idea how an officer is supposed to behave thats major alva all right george said i hate to lose him hes far and away the best wizard aroundgods only know why hesmucet didnt take him along for the march across peachtree john took a deep breath that was both visible and audible i wouldnt ask for him if he werent good sir im trying to keep from getting slaughtered you know anything you can do to help would be nice youre right of course doubting george said contritely ill send him straight to you shall he wait for you in poor richard or do you need him on the north bank of the trumpeteth if you can get him all the way up here ill be glad to have him john said the rivers running high right now what with all the rain weve had lately and bridging it wont be easy a good wizard would be a handy thing to have call major alva a thing to his face and hell make you sorry for it george warned its not just that he forgets hes supposed to be an officer hed be touchy even if he werent one too smart for his own good eh john the lister asked you might say so george answered yes by the gods you just might say so why i havent wrung his scrawny neck but i know why as a matter of fact i havent wrung his neck because he is good well fine i can use somebody whos good john said the mages ive got up here with me cant grab their backsides with both hands they cant spell cat if you spot them the c and the a they cant i get the idea doubting george said ill send alva to you as fast as i can and i hope he does you some good thanks very much sir john said i am grateful for it if we can get over the trumpeteth and into poor richard i think well give a good account of ourselves when lieutenant general bell comes to call thats good thats what i want to hear especially if its true george thought he asked anything else john the lister shook his head george gestured to the scryer in charge of the crystal ball the man in the gray robe broke the mystical connection between this ball and the one john was using johns image disappeared the crystal ball went back to being nothing but a round lump of glass that twisted light oddly when you looked through it do you need to speak with anyone else sir the scryer asked with marshal bart maybe or king avram no thanks george said the only time they want to talk to me is when they think ive done something wrong as long as theyre happy leaving me alone im happy being left the less i do to remind them im around the better off i am this way i get to run my own war belatedly he realized he might get in trouble if the scryer passed his sentiments on to marshal bart over in pierreville or to king avrams henchmen in the black palace at georgetown then he shrugged even if the marshal or the king did get wind of his sentiments hed probably escape without anything worse than teasing what detinan didnt think he could do almost anything what detinan didnt resent having superiors looking over his shoulder george had the job here he intended to take care of it he left the building where the scryers kept their crystals as soon as he walked out onto the streets of ramblerton he flipped up his collar and stuck his hands in his pockets to protect them and his neck from the chilly wind blowing up from the south he came from parthenia himself and had no use for the nasty weather that made winter so unpleasant through much of king avrams realm sentries came to attention and saluted when he returned to his headquarters fetch me major alva if youd be so kind he told one of them adding and dont let him dawdle on the way any more than you can help yes sir the sentry saluted again and hurried off crossbow slung on his shoulder quiver full of bolts hanging at his hip next to his shortsword alva arrived soon enough to keep doubting george from getting too annoyed at him he even remembered to salute which warmed the cockles of the commanding generals heart and when he said what can i do for you he tacked on sir with a hesitation even george who was looking for it had trouble noticing you can go to poor richard george told him at once go pack be on the next northbound glideway caravan major alva gaped i beg your pardon why did you fart doubting george asked major alvas jaw dropped george ignored the histrionics he went on i gave you an order please obey it without fuss and without wasting time uh yes sir alva said dazedly but why the expression on his face said what did i do to deserve this youre not in trouble its even a compliment if you like george said john the lister asked for you by name that wasnt quite true since john hadnt remembered alvas name but it came close enough hes having some difficulties with lieutenant general bell and his wizards and he wanted a good mage on his side to make sure things dont go any wronger than they have already oh alva said still a trifle stunned all right ill go how generous of you doubting george said alva needed a moment to notice the lurking sarcasm when he did his flush was unmistakable despite his swarthy skin i said id go he muttered voice petulant you dont need to make it sound as if you deserve a decoration for doing what i tell you to do george said i hope you do well enough to deserve a decoration he paused then shook his head no i take that back you hope i dont do well enough to deserve a decoration alva asked why i hope you dont need to do well enough to deserve a decoration george answered i hope everything is simple and easy and the traitors dont do a single thing to cause you any trouble wouldnt that be nice that would be lovely the mage said in hollow tones that would be splendid but i doubt its going to happen dont you me doubt what a ridiculous notion doubting george said why im as full of positive thoughts as the inside of a daffodil is full of crossbow quarrels er yes sir major alva looked like a man who wanted to leave rapidly after a moment of very obvious thought he found an excuse if i want to be on the next glideway carpet id better get ready may i be excused sir oh yes youre dismissed the commanding general said alva had to remember to salute he hurried out of the headquarters doubting george threw back his head and laughed hed put the fear of the gods into alva or at least done a good job of confusing him which would serve every bit as well now if i could only assemble an army that easily he thought getting men to come to ramblerton so they could actually do some fighting got harder by the day news that general bell had invaded franklin should have made men rush together to defend their kingdom instead it had made each little garrison want to stay exactly where it was so it could defend its own little town or fortress if bell wasnt altogether a foolnot the most obvious proposition george had ever thought ofhe wouldnt want to fight at every little town and fortress hed bypass whatever he could so he could move south into cloviston and head for the highlow river where he could do king geoffrey some good and embarrass and perhaps even hurt king avram that seemed obvious to george to his subordinates no but bell couldnt ignore a big army on his flankor at least he would be a fool if he did maybe he would try to ignore itbell was the sort who would try to ignore whatever he could if ignoring it meant he could go after something else george hoped bell would ignore southron soldiers on his flank that would make life easy for him personally and for king avram and the south in general meanwhile he still had an army to build up if he could if his own officers men who were supposed to obey his commands would let him they were convinced they knew what was best for them best for their own little forces they didnt think about or didnt care what was best for the kingdom if somebody tried to point out what was best for detina as a whole they didnt want to listen colonel andy came in and saluted what did you do to poor little alva georges adjutant asked poor little alva i doubt that doubting george said after the war ends he can get about as rich as he cares to what did i do i sent him up to poor richard to give john the lister a hand oh that explains the kickedpuppy look i saw on his face andy said he has to pack his carpetbag and go somewhere else and nobody will take care of him while hes traveling hes not all that helpless george said gods know ive seen mages who were a hells of a lot worse i know andy said but he thinks hes helpless when he has to deal with the ordinary world and so he acts that way which also gives him the chance to annoy everybody around him my youre sour today george remarked feel like insulting anyone else while youre here or can i have a turn go right ahead sir youre the commanding general after all andy replied rank hath its privileges doubting george snorted and held his nose rank is mostly just rank look at what dear general hesmucet left me if you dont believe that some people had to make bricks without straw i get to make bricks without clay theres good reason most of these odds and sods in franklin and cloviston were garrison soldiers the more i see it the plainer it is too they arent worth a counterfeit copper in a real fight and you blame hesmucet for that andy asked of course i do you dont expect me to blame myself do you not fornicating likely besides hesmucets marching through peachtree and hes up against nothing but the same kind of odds and sods except in blue uniforms hell whale the living stuffing out of them and hell be a big hero meanwhile im still fighting against a real army do you think ill let him get away without a few insults flying around his ears thats likely the worst opposition hell see you dont like him very well do you hes a brave soldier hes a good general i wish i were doing what he really is id get to be a famous hero too the way things are ive got a hard ugly job to do and nobody gets famous taking care of those doubting george sighed that doesnt mean they dont need doing though corporal rollant looked toward the trumpeteth river which lay between john the listers army and safety in poor richard hed crossed the river coming north on his way to summer mountain at the ford it hadnt come up past his waist hed taken off his pantaloons got the bottom of his shirt wet and gone on about his business things wouldnt be so easy heading south what with all the rain that had fallen the trumpeteth came up a lot higher than rollants waist now it would have been up over his head even at the ford it wasnt quite out of its banks but it wasnt far from flooding either any army falling back toward poor richard would have to bridge the stream before it could cross normally that would have been straightforward work for joseph the listers artificers and mages things werent normal now rollant wondered if things ever were really normal in wartime when he said that out loud smitty snickered of course theyre normal he said theyre always buggered up well yes rollant said but theres the usual kind of mess and then theres this kind of mess he scratched his head if theres a usual kind of mess i suppose things can be normal during the war but theyre not normal now sure as hells arent smitty agreed not with the godsdamned traitors trying to sabotage everything we do they always try to do that rollant said dolefully trouble is theyre having too much luck at it right now smitty shook his head that isnt luck theyre still better wizards than we are even after all this time i know rollant said even more dolefully than before they wouldnt have dropped our latest try at a bridge into the trumpeteth if they werent and the one before that and the one before that dont forget smitty said something tells me they dont want us crossing over the trumpeteth theyre sure trying like anything to keep us from doing it anyhow lieutenant general bells probably still mad at us for sliding past him at summer mountain rollant said i would be if i wore his shoeshis shoe i mean smitty said i bet the traitors make that joke every day rollant said i bet youve got a big mouth corporal smitty said for a moment hed forgotten rollant outranked him ordinary detinans often had a hells of a time remembering blonds could outrank them hastily smitty went on and i bet general bells probably about ready to spit nails like a repeating crossbow on account of we did get by his bastards only goes to show the traitors can screw up a perfectly good position too sort of reassuring if you know what i mean we already knew they could be as stupid as we are rollant said remember proselytizers rise there is that smitty admitted yes there is that by the lion gods fangs they should have slaughtered us rollant laughed you sound like youre sorry they didnt no theyre the ones whore sorry they didnt smitty said only thing im sorry for right now is that ive got to stand in this miserable muddy trench theyve got soldiers along with their wizards rollant said if they overrun us we dont get another chance to build the bridge besides he touched his crossbow which leaned against his leg ready to grab and pull and shoot anybody who tries overrunning mell have to kill me first that wasnt just bravado he meant every word of it detinans had forced blonds in the north into serfdom because the blonds hadnt been able to fight enough all those centuries ago to keep their kingdoms from being overwhelmed ever since then northern detinans had figured blonds couldnt fightand had taken elaborate precautions to make sure they never got the chance the detinans didnt notice the paradox blonds didbut who cared what blonds noticed if lieutenant general bells men captured smitty hed go into a prisoners camp till he was exchanged for some northerner if bells men captured rollant hed go in chains back to the estate from whose lands hed presumed to abscond with himself he knew his old liege lord was dead hed shot baron ormerod himself up at the top of proselytizers rise but whoever owned ormerods land these days still had a claim to the serfs tied to it whoever that was had a claim under the laws of palmetto province anyhow rollant was rude enough to think himself entitled to the fruits of his own labor and ready to fight to hold on to that freedom to work for himself out beyond the trenches were holes in the ground sheltering the pickets who would slow down any northern attack out beyond the pickets were the scouts and sentries who would spot the attack before it rolled over the southrons that was how things were supposed to work most of the time they did every once in a while rollant didnt want to think about all the things that could go so gruesomely wrong for now bells soldiers didnt care to close with john the listers men soldiers who followed both avram and geoffrey had in this fourth year of the war become very cautious about rushing earthworks that wasnt to say they wouldnt but it was to say they looked for the likelihood of reward before pressing an assault to the limit rollant had seen up in peachtree province how important entrenchments were bells men had fought there too they were traitors but they werent morons an assdrawn wagon driven by teamsters in king avrams gray rattled past the sentries past the pickets and through a gap in the entrenchments not far from the position of rollants company another followed and another and another they carried logs with one end sharpened to a point pilings for the southrons next effort at a bridge smitty watched them go by with worldweary cynicism wonder if theyll do any better than they did the last time he said and then before rollant could answer dont suppose they could do much worse we have to get over the trumpeteth rollant said we have to once were back in poor richard bell wont dare give us any trouble who knows what bell will dare smitty said well hed be an idiot if he did rollant said if he wants to be an idiot thats fine with me me too even the argumentative smitty didnt seem inclined to disagree with that now if i were bell id dress some of my boys up in gray and let em sneak through our lines they could have us trussed and tied before we even know whats going on thats a dreadful idea rollant exclaimed in horror smitty bowed as if at praise i like it too for a heartbeat rollant thought the farmers son had misheard him then he realized smitty was just being his perverse self acknowledging him only made him worse rollant said one of these days smitty i know smitty said but ill have fun till then at dawn the next morning heavy stones and firepots started landing in and around the entrenchments the traitors must have brought their engines up during the night rollant said smitty bowed again thank you so much for that brilliant deduction marshal rollant your grace sir oh to the hells with you rollant snapped cant anybody say anything without getting it twisted around and shot back at him at that moment a stone slammed into the parapet in front of them showering them both with dirt rollant rubbed at his face smitty spatspat brown in fact wouldnt you sooner have me shooting words at you than the traitors shooting big rocks he said and spat again my mouths full of grit so is mine rollant said but i got some in my eye too about fifty yards down the trench line another stone thudded home two men shrieked rollant and smitty exchanged dismayed glances rollant wondered whether the stone had hit any other soldiers and killed them outright before maiming the two who cried out it could have he knew that altogether too well lieutenant griff said we are going forward men to capture those engines or destroy them or make the northerners pull them back no one grumbled even though coming out of the trenches was risky this way they could hit back nothing was harder to bear than staying in place and taking a pounding without being able to repay the damage in kind even rollant who would carry the company standard and wouldnt do any actual fighting out in the open till he got close enough to the enemy to chop with his shortsword only nodded out of the trenches swarmed the men in gray avram they shouted avram and freedom king avram crossbow bolts hissed through the air at them bell had brought men forward to defend his engines too rollant sighed hed known bell would geoffrey the northerners shouted and provincial prerogative forever provincial prerogative as far as rollant was concerned meant nothing except the privilege of treating blonds like beasts of burden he waved his standard gold dragon on red high above his head false king geoffreys partisans flew the same flag with the colors reversed pok a crossbow bolt tore through the silk the standard had already taken a number of such wounds another bolt hissed past rollants ear this one not from in front of him but from behind one of his own comrades was shooting carelessly at the traitors rollant hoped the fellow was shooting at them anyhow bells men hadnt had time to entrench as well as rollant was sure they would have liked some of them crouched behind stumps and rail fences others stood or knelt on one knee or lay on their bellies in the open seeing the men in bluesome of them in southron gray ineptly dyed blueroused rollant to fury as it always did these were the men who wanted to tie him to a little plot of land for the rest of his days he whooped with glee when one of them crumpled to the ground clutching at himself and kicking come on he shouted to his own comrades waving the standard again lets get rid of all these bastards they didnt get the chance perhaps bell hadnt expected john the listers men to sally so aggressively against his men in this part of the field southrons outnumbered northerners though lieutenant general bells army was a lot bigger than johns the traitors hitched their catapults to asses and unicorns and hauled them away the crossbowmen and pikemen protecting them fought a rearguard action till the valuable engines had escaped then they too fell back rollant was all for charging after them his superiors werent the trumpeters blew withdraw reluctantly he returned to the southrons trench line litter bearers hauled back the wounded and the dead healers and surgeons would do what they could for the wounded soldiers and runaway serfs now laboring in avrams army would have to chop wood for the pyres of the dead rollant likely would have drawn that duty before he got promoted not now not as a corporal both forces had lost a few men seen a few men hurt the little fight wouldnt change how the war turned out not in the least he wondered why either side had bothered making it you could if you had the right sort of mind then wonder if even a big battle meant much in the grand scheme of things rollant didnt have that sort of mind he knew what those battles meantserfs escaping from bondage who would still labor for their liege lords if southron armies hadnt won and given them hope and protected them when they fled axes were still thudding into lumber when a messenger came up to the trenches from the direction of the trumpeteth lieutenant griff called men were to pull back from this line toward the river the bridges are said to be ready to cross by the way he spoke he had trouble believing it he was very young and hed been callow when he joined the company hed seen a lot since then as had the men he commanded rollant certainly had trouble believing it too turning to smitty he said what do you want to bet the traitors wizards will have sunk these socalled bridges by the time we get there youre a corporal you already make more money than i do smitty said if you think i want to give you any of mine youre mad if you think i want to give you any of mine youre mad corporal sergeant joram growled that rollant was an underofficer counted for more with him than that he was a blond not all detinans even in the south felt the same way when they got to the river smitty started to laugh i should have taken you up on that one your corporalship he said yes rollant tried to hide his astonishment the bridgeswhich by their faint glow seemed compounded more of magecraft than of mere material thingsdid indeed stand men were already tramping over them toward the south bank of the trumpeteth a scrawny young mage in a gray robe stood on the north bank of the river he looked weary unto death even as rollant watched the mage swayedhe supposed under yet another sorcerous assault from the northern wizards but though the mage swayed the bridges held they didnt suddenly vanish and pitch the burdened soldiers on them into the trumpeteth where those men would without a doubt have drowned seeing others safely cross the river rollant didnt hesitate when his turn came he held the company standard high as he set foot on the bridge it felt solid under his shoes even if it was mostly magical how it felt was all that mattered if he let out a sigh of relief when he got to the far bank of the riverwell if he did maybe nobody noticed and if anybody did he wasnt the only one ned of the forest rode his unicorn up to the southern bank of the trumpeteth river he actually rode the great white beast into the river muddy water swirled around its forelegs turning to colonel biffle he said well biff they slid through our fingers they might have been greased the way they slipped by us fraid youre right sir biffle agreed mournfully and look at whats left of this here bridge ned pointed only a few wooden pilings emerged from the trumpeteth look at it i tell you not much to look at his regimental commander said sure isnt ned said sure as hells isnt and it doesnt look like the stinking southrons burned their bridges once theyd used em either they couldnt have by the thunderers lightning boltwedve seen the flames no way on earth they couldve hidden those from us youre right again sir colonel biffle said and what does that mean theres hardly a thing left here but the southrons didnt burn what there was ned made a harsh chopping gesture with his left hand he couldnt have been more disgusted if hed heard thraxton the braggart was returning to command in the army of franklin he shook his head no on second thought he could biffle said it means they used magic to get over the river it cant mean anything else youre right youre just exactly right thats what it means ned of the forest repeated that chopping gesture and how did they get away with using magic to build their miserable bridge when were supposed to have the best wizards in detina how biff riddle me that either theyve got themselves some good ones from somewhere or else ours arent as good as theyve been telling folks they are biffle said maybe both both hadnt occurred to ned when colonel biffle suggested it though it made entirely too much sense to him wouldnt be a bit surprised he said but its purely a shame and a disgrace thats what it is the southrons have got more men than we do theyve got more of just about everything than we do except grit and wizards if they start licking us when it comes to magecraft well lion gods tail tuft biff why keep on fighting in that case were whipped grit or no grit yes sir biffle said but what can we do about it us unicornriders i mean not much ned said morosely still and all im going to hash it out with lieutenant general bell maybe he knows something i dont or maybe hell give me some laudanum then i wont care any more either lieutenant general bells doing the best he can biffle said if he didnt have something to hold back the pain hed be hard up oh i know that biff ned answered i really do hes not like thraxton the braggart that cowardly conniving shriveledup little unicorn turd of a man bell does try hard and hes a good fighter himselfor he was before he got ruined i dont reckon it was his fault this army didnt lay into the southrons at summer mountain by the way he carried on he gave the right orders but the fellows under him didnt do what he told em to by the way they carried on his orders werent as good as he said they were colonel biffle replied that was also true and worried ned of the forest it reminded him much too much of how things had been during the unhappy command of thraxton the braggart ned tugged on the reins jerking his unicorns head around he gave biffle a few orders then got the beast moving with the pressure of his knees and rode off toward the north toward the main encampment of the army of franklin lieutenant general bells pavilion was at least twice the size of any other officers tent there and dwarfed the miserable little shelters under which some of bells soldiers slept the rest of bells men had no shelter at all true bell was the commander of the army true his wound might have made him need more spaceor be happy with more spacethan a whole officer required even so trying to hold in his unease ned announced himself to the sentries in front of the commanding generals pavilion one of them ducked inside he returned a moment later saying lieutenant general bell will see you sir hed better ned rumbled the idea that bell might not see him filled him with fury he ducked through the tent flap and into the pavilion his eyes needed a moment to adjust to the gloom inside bell sat in a folding chair as ned came in the general commanding put a small bottle back into a leather pouch at his belt good day lieutenant general bell said licking his lips and what can i do for you ned peered at him before answering once upon a time people had spoken of bell as the reincarnation of the lion god on earth these days those leonine features might have been carved in cold butter that was then set in front of a fire his face sagged he had great dark bags under his eyes his cheeks drooped even through bells thick beard ned could see how jowly hed become the commander of unicornriders shivered pain and forced inactivity did dreadful things to a man bell had asked him a question he needed a moment to remember that and then to answer i want to know where were going sir and what were going to do about the southrons now that theyve holed up in poor richard no matter how bad bell looked he hadnt lost the urge to fight were going to hit them thats what he said were going to hit them and were going to rout them and then were going on to take ramblerton it must be done and so it will be done yes sir ned said bell was righttaking ramblerton was something the northern cause desperately needed ned went on ive ordered colonel biffle one of my regimental commanders to lead the unicornriders across the trumpeteth so well be ready to hit the southrons that good hard lick you want just as soon as we can have you bell raised an eyebrow in surprise like a lion thinking it might have scented prey without waiting for orders or permission from me yes sir ned of the forest said again his voice warned that he was another lion not a lumbering buffalo theyre my men i reckon i can tell em what to do without a byyourleave from anybody especially when it comes to putting them closer to the enemy he waited to see how lieutenant general bell would take that bell started to cloud up then checked himself and nodded all right i will not complain of any man who wants to close with the southrons that compares well with the miserable cowards commanding my crossbowmen and pikemen they had a golden chance a chance sent by the gods to strike john the lister a deadly blow and did they take it did they no they sat inert the spineless wretches and let this magnificent opportunity dribble through their palsied fingers carefully ned said sir theres a difference between things going wrong because somebodys a coward and things going wrong just on account of they go wrong if you know what i mean i know what you mean which doesnt mean i think youre right bell replied wouldnt you have attacked the godsdamned southrons if they were marching across your front of course you would haveyou make a proper man those fools poltroons brigadiers but i repeat myself when we get to poor richard sir it wont be that bad ned predicted by the thunderers holy foreskin it had better not be bell sounded very much like an angry lion youll see ned of the forest spoke with all the confidence he could muster he would in due course be proved right if not in precisely the way he meant when speaking to lieutenant general bell bell waved the words aside with a motion of his good hand anything further to report lieutenant general the southrons continue to flee before us having even less spirit than my own brigade and wing commanders and your men are crossing the trumpeteth which is actually not bad news by his scowl he never expected to hear anything but bad news ever again nothing more very well then you may rejoin your riders and my congratulations for the spirit theyand youhave shown thank you sir ned saluted and left the pavilion his strides were lithe pantherlike he didnt care to think about the crutches leaning close by bells chair bell would never advance at anything but a caterpillars hitching crawl no ned didnt want to think about that hed already suffered several wounds one instant of bad luck and hed be no better off than the commanding general if everybody thought about those things whod go and mix it up he wondered how would you how could you fight a war he saw no answer not at first but as he swung up onto his unicornone more thing bell would never do unless someone tied him to the saddlehe realized the answer was that most men didnt think about such things he didnt want to think about them himself as hed just proved and he was as far from a coward as any man breathing he shrugged and scowled and went on riding when he got down to the trumpeteth he found only a rear guard of his unicornriders still on the northern bank the rest had crossed over with their animals on a motley little fleet of rowboats and rafts ned piled into a boat with the ordinary riders he commanded they chivvied his unicorn aboard a raft although the great white shining beast didnt like the journey at all once on the southern bank of the trumpeteth ned had to gentle the unicorn down again before it would deign to bear his weight you know how to handle em lord ned a trooper said admiringly i ought to ned of the forest was not sentimental about unicorns or about anything else that had to do with battle ive had enough of them killed out from under me thats on account of you always head for where the fightings hottest the soldier said im going to tell you a secret about how to be a general ned said do you want to hear it yes sir the trooper leaned forward if he could have pricked his ears ahead like a unicorn he would have done that too all right then here it is if you want to be a general you have to want to go where things are the hottest and you have to make your men want to follow you if you can manage that youll do all right lord ned sir you make a hells of a general the soldier said thank you kindly neds smile was a little less carnivorous than usual he liked praise and being called lord ned unlike most of the officers who fought for king geoffrey he was no noble hed made a good living before the war as a serfcatcher a lot of blond serfs ran away from the land and liege lord to whom they were bound and ned had more than a little genius for poking through the jungles and woods and swamps where they liked to hide and bringing them back that was how hed come to be known as ned of the forest but serfcatching while it might bring money didnt bring respect thraxton the braggart wasnt the only officer who looked down his nose at ned for his work and his low birth most of the scornful ones though had learned to keep their mouths shut for one thing ned had proved an even better commander of unicornriders than he was a serfcatcher and for another hed made it plain he had no qualms about killing men supposedly on his own side who were rash enough to insult him he booted his unicorn into motion it was a big sturdy beast it needed to be to carry a man with his big sturdy frame he brought it up to a fast trot unicornriders waved as he went past he waved back or sometimes lifted the broadbrimmed felt hat from his head for a moment to greet the troopers that made them wave even more and cheer too before too long he caught up with colonel biffle at the head of the column whats the word sir biffle asked well biff ill tell you ned answered when the whole army gets down to poor richard the stinking southrons had better look out for themselves all right but biffle frowned that wont be an easy position to crack not if john the lister digs in like he can bell thinks we can lick em even more to the point bell thinks we shouldve licked em at summer mountain ned said somebodys going to pay on account of we didnt somebodys going to pay all right colonel biffle agreed gloomily i tell you lord ned if we go at em at poor richard its liable to be us weve got to do some fighting bells dead right about that ned said john the lister wont disappear if we dont neither will doubting george down in ramblerton we went into this war talking about what a bunch of cowards the stinking southrons were well by now we know that isnt so if we want to shift em well have to shift em you know what i mean i sure do biffle replied and dont i wish i didnt cant be helped ned of the forest said everythingd be a lot easier if we only had to fight when we were sure of winning but sometimes we have to stand up there and prove we are men dont you reckon thats right colonel biffle gave him a reluctant half shamefaced nod they rode on together toward poor richard it wasnt far john the lister looked back toward the trumpeteth from the position hed chosen for his army just outside the little town of poor richard his men dug like moles at the high end of a long bare stretch of ground that ran north for a couple of miles turning to his adjutant he said if the traitors care to attack me here i will give them a warmer greeting than they care for one of major strabos wandering eyes looked towards one stretch of the lines the southrons were preparing the other toward another the devils in the seven hells might give them a warmer greeting than we can no one else i think they cannot flank us out here as they did before john said no indeed strabo said looking around his superior they would be idiots to try which may not stop them weve got a glideway line straight back to ramblerton john the lister said doubting george can send us all the food and bolts and firepots and fodder we need and the lines well fortified yes sir major strabo pointed toward the line of entrenchment his finger unlike his eyes went straight as you say theyll likely be through if they try to go through us theyd be idiots to try to do that too john said in fact if you ask me they were idiots to mount this whole invasion why isnt bell fighting general hesmucet as far as i can see none of the traitors is off fighting hesmucet how can they call themselves a kingdom if he marches across peachtree province to veldt and the western ocean simple sir strabo answered they can lie thats about what it comes down to sure enough john the lister said as a matter of fact thats just what it comes down to hesmucet was right once you crack the shell theres nothing but wind and air behind it some of that wind and air is coming this way his adjutant pointed out let em come john replied if they want to charge up that slope in the face of everything we can throw at em theyre welcome to try have we got the engines lined up where theyre supposed to be yes sir catapults and repeating crossbows both major strabo said and weve got plenty of stones and firepots and bolts for them if all the traitors in the world want to charge up that slope against us i think we can murder the lot of them john eyed strabo with more than a little surprise his adjutant was no blithe optimist strabo in fact was inclined to see difficulties whether they were there or not if he thought the southrons would have no trouble holding this position he was likely to be right john certainly hoped he was right at the same time john wondered what lieutenant general bell would do when he saw what sort of position the southrons had at poor richard he wouldnt have an easy time assailing it even if his army was close to twice as big as johns he couldnt ignore it and keep marching south either what did that leave nothing john saw just then maybe bell will give up and go away maybe hell throw his hand in the air and march back to dothan john the lister laughed whats funny sir major strabo asked john explained strabo laughed too the likelihood of that is most unlikely he said a sentence obscure even by his standards uh yes john said bells options are impenetrable in their opacity strabo added not only that nobody has a real good notion of what the son of a bitch will do john said indeed strabo said and in fact that too john agreed gravely now in fact im going to round up the famous major alva see what more help he thinks he can give us here and have another look at our works make sure everything is sited just the way i want it yes sir strabo said the one thing we havent sighted is the traitors john thought about groaning at that but decided not to bother strabos plays on words were frequent enoughand bad enoughthat acknowledging them only encouraged him to do worse john sometimes thought he couldnt do worse but his adjutant kept proving him wrong he waved for a runner yes sir the young man in gray asked tell major alva to meet me at the top of the slope there john pointed tell him i want to see him as soon as he can get there doubting george had warned him alva was a free spirit from everything john had seen so far doubting george had understated things but the wizard got to the field fortifications in good time only a couple of minutes after john the lister himself and alva did remember to salute he looked as if he was reminding himself of something before he did it but he did salute then he said tell me sir what do you think of the inward hypothesis of all the questions john had expected to get on what might become a battlefield that one might have been the very last he blinked wondering if hed heard rightly deciding he had he answered i dont really know major its not something a soldier needs to worry about is it hed done his best to dodge the question he learned trying to evade alva wasnt a good idea the wizards eyebrows shot up as if he couldnt believe his ears he said dont you think its important for every detinanfor everyone in the whole worldto wonder about how the gods fit into the scheme of things if they say be and something is the very next heartbeat then we look at them one way but if they say be after you go about shaping yourselves and changing for thousands or maybe millions of years then we look at them another way altogether or i do anyhow what about you sir when i need to worry about the gods ill worry about them john the lister said till then im going to worry about lieutenant general bell more because i expect hell be here sooner he waited to find out how the contentious wizard would take that to his surprise alva beamed well said sir i couldnt have put it better myself worrying about things of this world ahead of the gods is always a good ideaas far as im concerned anyway you must have some interesting talks with priests john remarked oh i do sir alva said earnestly they can believe what they want as far as im concerned theyre free detinans after all but they dont seem to understand that im a free detinan too they want me to stop thinking what i think it doesnt seem fair i can see how it wouldnt john said but then how often do they run into someone who doesnt believe in the gods i believe in the gods sir alva sounded shocked that john should doubt him i just dont believe theyre very important do you or do i mean dont you john the lister shook his head i can see how priests might have trouble drawing the distinction can you could you explain it to me sir ive never been able to figure out how anyone wouldnt want to draw the finest distinctions he could hes not joking john realized he does want me to explain it can i picking his words with care he said to somebody whos a priest to somebody who thinks about the gods all the time not believing in the gods at all and not believing theyre very important probably dont seem much different hmm alva thought it over john had the odd feeling he was taking a test when alva suddenly smiled he decided hed passed it oh perspective the mage said i should have figured that out for myself he thumped his forehead with the heel of his hand to show how stupid he thought he was its nothing to worry about john the lister almost added by the gods but at the last instant checked himself given what the conversation was about the phrase didnt fit but i was wrong i dont like being wrong by the way major alva said it he didnt like it at all he gave a partial explanation a mage cant afford to be wrong very often from everything ive heard and from everything ive seen youre not wrong very often john said i dont dare alva replied sir i started with nothing the only reason ive got anything at all is because im good at wizardry ill ride it as far as i can here in the army when i get out ill go even further this is what i can do this is what im good at im going to be as good at it as i can all right major john the lister nodded you sound like a proper detinan to me out to paint your name on the wall with the biggest letters you can this is a kingdom where men do things like that this is the best kingdom in the world sirin the whole godsdamned world major alva spoke with great conviction anybody can be anything here if hes good enough and works hard enough thats why the northerners are such fools to want to leave do they think theyll be able to climb to the top with all their pigheaded nobles clogging the road up not likely i dont know whether they worry about getting to the top so much as keeping blonds on the bottom john said but thats stupid too alva plainly had no patience with stupidity his own or anyone elses he pointed to a blond in the trenches a blond with a corporals emblem on the sleeve of his gray tunic take a look at him hes getting ahead because hes good at soldiering if he were an ordinary detinan hed probably be a lieutenant by now but even blonds can get ahead here john the lister had no enormous use for blonds he wasnt thrilled at the idea of unbinding them from the land and making them citizens like proper detinans if it werent for splitting the kingdom he would have been happy to let the north take most of them out of detina next thing you know he said youll be talking about women the same way oh dont be silly sir alva said some people do but theyre a bunch of crackpots well we see eyetoeye about something anyhow john said with a certain amount of relief the wizard plainly was a radical freethinker but even he had his limits the general commanding went on now is there anything you notice in these works that could be stronger from a wizardly point of view lets see alva didnt want to commit himself without looking things over which made john think better of him he paced along behind the rearmost of three lines of entrenchments looking out over them toward and along the northfacing slope at last he said would lieutenant general bell really be dumb enough to try to drive us out of this position i dont know john said only bell knows how stupid he really is but wed be stupid not to give him the warmest reception we could wouldnt we how can we make sure of doing that sir i think youve done it the mage replied i saw a few engines you might bring up closer so theyd throw farther other than that he shook his head i can feel the defenses youve set up against the traitors battle magic they should work youre the one to say that you put most of them up i told youim good alva had no false modestyand probably little of any other sort how soon do you think theyll attack john asked now the wizard looked at him in some surprise i dont know sir i deal with enchantments youre the fellow whos supposed to be a soldier ive just been given the glove john the lister thought his voice dry he said i do try to impersonate one every now and again yes alva looked at him in surprise of a different sort have you been listening to doubting george sir he asked reproachfully not for a while now john answered why because i dont run into a lot of men who are supposed to be soldiers alva seemed to like that phrase while john didnt not at all who know what it is to be ridiculous that only shows you havent spent enough time paying attention to soldiers john the lister told him the only officers who dont know what it is to be ridiculous are the ones whove never led men into battle those sons of bitches on the other side will do their best to make a monkey out of you and sometimes theyll bring it off what have they got to say about you major alva asked if im doing my job they say im trying to make a monkey out of them too john replied whichever one of us does best the other fellow ends up swinging through the trees he mimed scratching himself sounds like the inward hypothesis in action to me alva said john glared at the wizard alva mimed scratching himself too carefully adding sir afterwards iv captain gremios shoes thudded on the bridge the northerners had thrown across the trumpeteth river his company wasnt so loud crossing over the bridge to the south bank as he would have liked not enough of them had shoes with which to thud bare feet and feet wrapped in rags made hardly any sound at all unicorn hooves drummed quite nicely from atop his mount colonel florizel called step it up men theyre waiting for us in poor richard so they are gremio thought unhappily and theyve had a little while to wait now tooplenty of time to dig trenches to fight from trenches saved lives without them joseph the gamecock wouldnt have been able to delay hesmucet up in peachtree province for nearly so long as he had and then bell brought us out of our trenches and hit the southrons as hard as he could and we lost marthasville and were losing the rest of peachtree too keep moving sergeant thisbe said we have to whip the southrons the sergeants right gremio said weve got more men than john the lister and well swamp his whole army i hope we will wed better gods help us if we dont maybe they wont have dug too many trenches maybe his shoes stopped thudding and started thumping on dirt over the river thisbe said not far to poor richard now on they marched one of the soldiers in the company exclaimed in disgust whats the matter ludovic gremio asked i just stepped in some unicorn shit ludovic answered well wipe it off your shoe and keep going gremio said captain i havent had any shoes for weeks now ludovic said oh well wipe it off your foot and keep going then gremio said i dont know what else to tell you you cant stop on account of that make the southrons pay when you get to them thisbe said wasnt the godsdamned southrons was our own godsdamned unicornriders id like to make those sons of bitches pay them and their shitty unicorns ludovic scattered curses with fine impartiality if you find the fellow whose unicorn did it you have my permission to pick a fight with him gremio said gravely ludovic pondered that like the weather on a changeable day he brightened and then clouded up again how the hells am i supposed to do that captain godsdamned unicorn didnt leave any godsdamned calling card you know not except the one i stepped in snickers ran up and down the long files of marching men gremio said no i suppose not in that case youd better just slog along with everybody else dont you think you arent making fun of me by any chance are you sir gods forbid ludovic gremio had to deny it even though it was true a free detinan who thought himself mocked would kill without counting the cost an apology would have made gremio lose face a simple denial didnt ludovic nodded satisfied thats all right then he said and marched on without complaining any more about his filthy foot when the army of franklin camped that night the southrons fires brightened the horizon to the south theyre waiting for us gremio said as he seared a chunk of beef from one of the cows from the herd that shambled along with the army it wasnt very good beefit was in fact vile odious beefbut it was ever so much better than no beef at all we knew they would be sergeant thisbe searing another gobbet of that odious beef didnt sound worried the only time thisbe had ever sounded worried was about going to the healers after taking that wound in southern peachtree province other than that nothing in army life that gremio had seen fazed the underofficer well lick em of course we will gremio couldnt very well deny it not in front of his men colonel florizel had wanted his company commanders to make the men believe the war was still winnable gremio didnt know whether it was or not no matter how much he doubted itand that was almost enough to make him his own sides doubting georgehe couldnt show his doubts he understood why not if the men thought they couldnt win why would they want to risk their lives for king geoffrey poor southronsll be sorry they ever heard of poor richard a trooper declared a few men from the army of franklin had deserted the ones who remained still kept plenty of fight maybe returning to the province for which the army was named helped maybe they were just too stubborn to know they were beaten whatever it was gremio didnt want to disturb it he wished he had more of it himself thisbe pulled the ragged sorry beefsteak from the flames the sergeant sniffed at it and made an unhappy face before taking out a belt knife and starting to haggle off bitesized chunks better than nothing better than your belly rubbing up against your backbone thisbe said yes thats true gremio cut a bite from his own beefsteak he stuck it in his mouth and chewed and chewed and chewed eventually with a convulsive gulp he swallowed not a whole lot better than nothing he said i think it is thisbe as usual was determined to look on the bright side of things when youre empty you cant hardly do anything you feel all puny and sickly its not a wonderful supper gods know but its a supper and any supper is better than no supper at all well i cant say youre wrong i was thinking the same thing a little earlier in fact gremio didnt want to argue with sergeant thisbe he wrestled another bite of meat down his throat now i know why so many men in the company have no shoes the drovers have been butchering them and called the shoeleather beef thisbe did smile at that but then grew serious again i wonder what theyre doing with the hides of the cattle theyre killing if theyre just leaving them for scavengers thats a shame and a disgrace the army of franklin must have plenty of men who know how to tan leather maybe they could make shoes or at least patch the ones that are coming to pieces thats a good idea thats a hells of a good idea as a matter of fact gremio made fewer bites of the rest of his beefsteak than he should have a couple of times he felt like a small snake trying to choke down a large dog when at last he swallowed the final bite he jumped to his feet im going to find out whether were doing anything like thatand if we arent why not he hurried to colonel florizels pavilion the regimental commander was gamelywhich did seem the proper wordhacking away at a slab of meat no finer than the one gremio had eaten when gremio explained thisbes notion florizel paused swallowed with no small effort and then said that is clever i have no idea what were doing with the hides we should be doing something shouldnt we if we have any sort of chance to we should yes gremio said if you dont know sir who would patrick the cleaver i suspect florizel answered he sticks his nose into all sorts of things the other side of that coin was i cant be bothered sticking my nose into all sorts of things calling florizel on it would have been worse than useless gremio saluted and said thank you sir ill speak with him i hope something comes of it colonel florizel did mean well as long as he didnt have to put himself out too much he was a brave leader in battle gremio wished he were a better administrator but gremio a barrister himself highly valued organization in others hed never spoken to patrick the cleaver before and wondered how much trouble he would have getting to see the wing commander he had no more than hed had seeing colonel florizel as he had with florizel he explained himself this is your notion now patrick asked him no sir gremio answered my companys first sergeant thought of it huh hisname is thisbe its a good notion indeed and it is patrick said my hats off to you captain for not being after claiming it for your own i couldnt do that gremio said no eh the brigadier eyed him plenty could the which is nobbut the truth i dont steal gremio said stiffly from anyone but thisbe he might have from the sergeant never well good on you patrick the cleaver said if youre after giving this sergeant the credit you might also be thinking of giving him lieutenants rank to go with it sir i tried to promote the sergeant during the fighting south of marthasville for bravery then gremio said thisbe refused to accept officers rank i doubt anything has changed his mind since patrick chuckled sure and there are sergeants like that most of em i think are fools the army could use officers o their stripebetter nor a good many of the omadhauns giving orders the now thisbe had reasons for declining that patrick the cleaver probably hadnt contemplated gremio saw no point in discussing those reasons with the wing commander he asked is there any chance of doing what the sergeant suggested sir by the gods captain there is that patrick answered once were after driving the godsdamned southrons from poor richard ill see to it you may rely on me thank you sir gremio believed him patrick was one of the youngest brigadiers in king geoffreys armies but hed already acquired a reputation for reliability to go with his name for hard fighting gremio said may i ask you one thing more ask what you will patrick said i do not promise to answer thats only fair gremio said what sort of ground will we be fighting on at this poor richard place its open patrick the cleaver replied its very open his face which had been very open a moment before all at once closed if i were lieutenant general bell he didnt go on if you were bell gremio prompted never you mind patrick said ive told the general commanding my opinions and i need not repeat em to another soul had he stood in the witness box gremio could have peppered him with questions as with crossbow quarrels that wasnt how things worked here a man who tried to grill a superior not inclined to be forthcoming wouldnt find out what he wanted to know and would wind up in trouble patrick said give my compliments to your clever sergeant if youd be so kind and the top o the evening to you that was dismissal captain gremio saluted and left the wing commanders pavilion he made his way back to his own regiments encampment well sir sergeant thisbe asked when he sat down by the fire once more well sergeant brigadier patrick says you ought to be promoted to lieutenant for your cleverness gremio replied thisbe stared into the flames the sergeant said nothing while a soldier dumped more wood on the fire then in a low voice thisbe said i dont want to be promoted i told you that sir the last time you were generous enough to offer that to me im content where i am gremio looked around the soldier with the wood was building up another campfire ten or twelve feet away a couple of men lay close to this blaze but they were already snoring thunderously gremio spoke in a low voice do you have the same reasons now as you did then yes sir the sergeant answered are they the same reasons that kept you from wanting to see a healer when you were wounded gremio persisted thisbe looked into the flames again my reasons are my reasons i think theyre good ones the sergeant would not meet gremios eyes are they the reasons i think they are gremio asked that made thisbe look at him it didnt get him a straight answer though with what might have been a smile the underofficer said how can any man know what another man is thinking gremio took a deep breath hed never asked thisbe a direct question about the matter that interested him most even as he started to ask one now he stopped with it unspoken thisbe might give him a truthful answer but even if the sergeant did give him that kind of answer it might preclude further questions one of these daysvery likely not till the war ended if it ever didgremio hoped to have the chance to ask those questions all he said now was sergeant do you know how difficult you make things im sorry sir and thisbe really did sound sorry i never wanted to be difficult all i ever wanted was to do my job and to do it as well as i could youve done it very wellwell enough to deserve promotion gremio said i dont want to be a lieutenant the sergeant said i know you deserve to be one anyhow gremio said they eyed each other back at their old impasse thisbe shrugged gremio smiled a rueful smile and then in spite of everything they both started to laugh doubting george wished he could go north to poor richard all hells were going to break loose up there and he sat here in ramblerton gathering soldiers a dribble at a time actually he knew he could go up to poor richard john the lister was hardly in a position to shoo him away if he hopped on a glideway carpet and sped up there but john was only a captain in king avrams regulars if he could hold bell off or beat him he would surely gain permanent rank to match his ability george already had it less than he craved less than he thought he deserved but a sufficiency and so he stayed behind the line and did the things a good regional commander was supposed to do and didnt do anything else if he sometimes drummed his fingers on his desk and looked longingly toward the north well he was the only man who knew that colonel andy came in a troubled look on his round face sir he said word from the scryers is that lieutenant general bell is getting ready to attack john the lister johns got himself ready at poor richard hasnt he george asked as ready as he can be yes sir his adjutant nodded better bell should attack him there than when he was on the march and vulnerable by summer mountain eh george said well yes sir put that way andy nodded again but reluctantly even so hes badly outnumbered there is that doubting george allowed how imminent is this attack can we down here do anything about it i dont think so sir colonel andy looked very much like a worried chipmunk from what the scryers say john says bell will be on him this afternoon at the latest we could send men by glideway that fast if everything went perfectly george said we couldnt send so many as id like and we couldnt send much in the way of equipment with them not on such short notice but they would be better than nothing that was the other thing i wanted to tell you major andy said unhappily the northerners have desorcerized a stretch of the glideway line between here and poor richard i dont know whether bell got wizards past john and alva or whether these are local traitors sneaking out and making trouble now that weve recalled so many garrisons to ramblerton either way though till our mages repair the break we cant use that line to move soldiers well gods damn the northerners then george said i was just thinking john had the chance to make a name for himself i doubt he would have wanted quite such a good chance though yes sir i doubt that too andy said i wish we could do something more so do i doubting george drummed his fingers on the broad desktop right out there where andy could see him do it hed sent john the lister north to delay bell not to serve as a snack for him after a moment he brightened bells not what youd call a very clever fellow and hes bound to be spitting mad because john got away from him once hell go in as quick and as hard as he can no matter whats waiting for him if he has enough men how much will it matter colonel andy asked bleakly always an interesting question george admitted of course theres another interesting questionwhat do you mean by enough the north has never had enough men for all the ground false king geoffrey needed to cover at the start of the war thats why theyre losing in general terms thats true sir but whether bell has enough to smash john is a rather more specific question wouldnt you say unfortunately i would anything i can do to help our wizards fix the desorcerized stretch of glideway would sending more sorcerers help probably not sir andy answered theyre doing all they can and half the time more wizards only mean more quarrels more than half the time doubting george said all right then well do everything we can if we cant do enough john the lister will fight his own battle he brightened slightly i did send him major alva before the traitors got at the glideway line thats something anyhow yes sir colonel andy said and he has hardriding jimmys unicornriders with him hardriding jimmy hasnt got very many men not if he wants to stand against ned of the forest doubting george sounded even more dubious than usual his adjutant spoke soothingly they carry those newfangled quickshooting crossbows though there may not be many of them but they can put a lot of bolts in the air hesmucet had offered doubting george the same sort of consolation when hed given him hardriding jimmys brigade newfangled crossbows are all very well george said now but one of the reasons you take newfangled weapons into the field is to find out what goes wrong with them tangling with ned of the forests unicornriders is liable to be an expensive way to find out thats if they dont work as advertised andy said doubting george raised one dark eyebrow when have you ever known a newfangled weapon that did colonel andy frowned after a moment he shrugged well youve got me there sir but these have seen some useand besides theres bound to be a first time yes so there is george agreed but has the lion god come down from mount panamgam and whispered in your ear that this is it uh no sir colonel andy looked as if he wasnt sure whether george was serious since the commanding general wasnt sure whether he was serious either that suited him fine he gave andy his blandest smile have you got any other delightful news for me colonel uh no sir his adjutant repeated all right youre dismissed george said im going to review our works here unless john the lister takes lieutenant general bells army clean off the board bells heading this way or do you think im wrong no sir andy sounded sure about that and its not very likely that john can smash bell is it not when hes so badly outnumbered i thought i just said that maybe im wrong doubting george dug into his map case andy departed shaking his head the maps showed what george already knew ramblerton was a town fortified to a faretheewell the southrons had taken it away from king geoffreys men when the war was barely a year old and theyd held it ever since even when thraxton the braggart mounted an invasion of cloviston to hold it with the fewest possible men theyd surrounded it with a ring of trenches and forts as strong as any in detina save perhaps those of georgetown itself doubting george shook his big head the works at pierreville north of nonesuchthe works marshal bart was now besiegingwere probably this strong too he hadnt thought of them for a moment because they belonged to the traitors but that was wrong detina was still one kingdom if not why fight for avram he hadnt dwelt on such things for a while and hed already given his own answer to himself and to detina as far as he was concerned his homeland was and could be only one kingdom if that meant it would be one kingdom without serfs then it did and he would worry about what if anything that meant later on hed felt the same when he declined to follow duke edward of arlington after parthenia province declared for geoffrey and against avram that even though hed been a liege lord himself over a small fief in parthenia false king geoffrey had solved his problem there long before king avram could have worried about it george chuckled now at a distance of more than three years he could find it funny he didnt need to worry about serfs if he didnt own that estate any more and he didnt not according to geoffrey whod taken it away from him if the south won the war between the provincesno when the south won the war between the provinceshe could go back again he could take his place among his neighbors as a minor nobleman he could yes but how much good would it do him he would be a minor nobleman without blonds to work the land under those circumstances what point to going back at all that was one obvious question another question equally obvious was what would his erstwhile neighbors who were also minor nobles in parthenia province do after the south won the war how would they bring in their crops without plenty of blond serfs to do the hard work for them would they labor in the fields themselves with their wives and children i doubt it george said and went back to the maps but maps could show him only so much they chiefly showed him the places he needed to see with his own eyes he put on a wool hat and a gray overcoat and left his warm headquarters to give his own eyes the looks they needed ramblertonians glowered at him as he made his way north up a muddy street and when it rained ramblerton had no other kind of street king avrams soldiers had held franklins metropolissuch as it wasfor two and a half years now the locals still resented them doubting george laughed the locals did more than resent they hated southrons with a hatred that had curdled and grown more sullen over time because it was so impotent bellll bundle you bastards back where you belong somebody shouted after george walked past he stopped and looked back that was exactly what the ramblertonian had wanted him to do of course whichever ramblertonian it was six or eight detinans in civilian clothes sent mocking stares his way he judged they would all mock him if he said i doubt it what he said instead was well hes welcome to try then tipping his hat to them he went on his way they muttered behind him he doubted they would have the nerve to rush him and he proved right they could jeer but that was all they could do and geoffreys socalled kingdom is no better off than they are george thought and smiled again the maps had got behind the fortifications they were supposed to represent doubting george had hoped that was so but hadnt dared to expect it if he assumed the worst he was unlikely to be disappointed here though areas that had seemed weak on parchment looked rugged in reality blonds did most of the ongoing work under the orders of detinan engineers runaway serfs dug trenches carried dirt in barrows and hods and raised ramparts where none had stood before some of them wore gray tunics and pantaloons of a cut not much different from that of southron uniforms others had on the rags of the clothes theyd worn while fleeing their liege lords estates all of them were probably working harder than they ever had back on those estates what struck doubting george was how happy the blonds looked detinans especially detinans from the north thought of blonds as a happygolucky lot always smiling regardless of whether things called for a smile that george now suspected was a mask serfs wore to keep detinans from knowing what was really in their minds these blonds by contrast looked and sounded and acted really happy no matter how hard they were working one of them recognized doubting george waving the fellow called general we want you to use these works to kill loads and loads of those stinking northern nobles well do our best the general commanding answered he wondered if the blond knew he was a stinking northern noble he had his kill em all the blond said bury em all stick em in the ground dont give em to the fire dont let their spirits rise up with the flames and the smoke the rest of the runaways now laboring for king avram nodded back in the old days before the conquerors came most blonds had buried their dead now they followed ordinary detinan usage and looked on burial with as much horror as ordinary detinans did odds were these fellows hadnt the faintest idea what their ancestors had done are they savages or just savage doubting george wondered and if people had done to me what weve done to the blonds for generations wouldnt i have good reason to be savage he walked up and down the line from one end to the other it was anchored at both east and west by the cumbersome river a solid fleet of catapultcarrying war galleys rowed up and down the cumbersome all of them flew king avrams gold dragon on red the northerners had no galleys on the cumbersome and none on the great river either not any more several river fights and the losses of old capet and after a long siege camphorville had made sure of that in the center the line bulged out toward the north swallowing up the whole town of ramblerton and taking advantage of the high ground out beyond the edge of settled territory the more george walked the fewer the doubts he had he didnt see how lieutenant general bell and the army of franklin could batter their way through these works and into ramblerton of course what he saw and what bell saw were liable to be two different beasts i hope theyre two different beasts doubting george muttered the mere idea that he and bell might think alike offended him and if it also offended bell george did some more muttering thats his worry it was already past noon when lieutenant general bell and the army of franklin neared john the listers defensive position by poor richard bell looked across the wide empty fields toward the three slightly concave lines of entrenchments awaiting him king avrams banners fluttered on the earthworks he glanced over toward his wing and brigade commanders with a brusque nod he said we attack as simple as that your honor patrick the cleaver asked as simple as that bell said unless you havent the stomach for it as you hadnt the stomach for it at summer mountain like most men from the sapphire isle brigadier patrick was swarthy even by detinan standards that didnt keep him from showing an angry flush now ill show you what sort of man i am he growled sure and youve shown me now what sort of man you are that did nothing to improve bells temper neither did the pain he could never escape we can discuss this further at your leisure brigadier he said patrick bowed i am at your service in that as in all things and i brigadier provincial prerogative said when you insult brigadier patrick you insult all your officers thats true otho the troll said in a rumbling bass brigadier john of barsoom bowed to bell as a proper northern gentleman i would be remiss if i said this did not also hold for me and me for gods sake for gods sake john added hiram the cranberry turned even redder than usual and nodded without speaking bell wondered if he would have to duel with every officer in the army of franklin down to the rank of lieutenant he had a hells of a time cocking a crossbow but he could shoot quick and straight with one hand if they wanted to quarrel with him he would give each of them a quarrel right in the ribs ned of the forest said i thought we were supposed to be fighting the southrons not each other theory is wonderful provincial prerogative said still glaring at bell hed been one of the leaders in the attack on sumptuous castle in karlsburg harbor the attack that had started the war between the provinces bell glared back he didnt care what provincial prerogative had done in what now seemed the dim distant dead past wed better fight the southrons ned said anybody who doesnt care to fight them can fight me instead that produced a sudden thoughtful silence no one was eager to fight ned lieutenant general bell said i require no proxies im not doing this for you sir ned of the forest answered im doing it for the kingdom seems to me a lot of folks here have forgotten about the kingdom some of bells brigadiers still looked angry but several of them nodded for gods sake hes right for gods sake john burst out no one disagreed not out loud ned said sir by your leave id like to take my riders over to the left and back into the southrons rear when you lick em well be there in perfect position to fall on em as theyre running away bell didnt need to think long anything but victory was unimaginable this time hed follow up victory once he got it he nodded to ned good idea go do it ned of the forest started to leave the assembled officers then stopped and turned back matter of fact sir i reckon we can flank em right out of their works if youll hold up a little you wont even need to charge em that theres liable to be a hard line to take by assault several brigadiers brightened one man after another nodded the longer bell watched them the angrier he got he shook his leonine head no we will attack the commander of unicornriders scowled why the hells do you want to pick a fight when you dont have to sir he asked give me a brigade of footsoldiers to go with my riders and i will agree to flank the southrons from their works within two hours time i can go down the follyfree gap the one the ramblerton road goes through and sneak behind em before they even know im around what a fine notion youre after having there patrick the cleaver exclaimed were asking for naught but trouble crossing such a broad stretch of open space towards earthworks the thunderers hard prong couldnt pierce brigadier benjamin called the heated ham because hed made a bad schoolboy actor also nodded the wing commander said sir i think ned and patrick are right i dont like the looks of this fight here the southrons have a good position and theyre well fortified no bell said again my minds made up ned you may use your flanking move but with unicornriders only you at least have shown you are not afraid to manfully fight out in the open ned of the forest looked even angrier than he had before the wing and brigade commanders started screaming at lieutenant general bell all over again louder than ever how dare you call us cowards for gods sake for gods sake john demanded how dare you act like cowards bell retorted which might have been a new firepot bursting among his subordinates ned of the forest stamped away throwing up his hands in disgust john of barsoom cried at least have the decency to tell us why youre sending us off to be slaughtered i will tell you exactly why bell said in tones of ice i have made the discovery that this army after a forward march of more than one hundred fifty miles is still seemingly unwilling to accept battle unless under the protection of breastworks and this has caused me to experience grave concern in my inmost heart i question whether or not i will ever succeed in eradicating this evil it seems to me i have exhausted every means in the power of one man to remove this stumbling block from the army of franklin meaning no disrespect sir but it seems to me you dont know what the hells youre talking about benjamin the heated ham said bell wondered how he would have spoken had he meant disrespect the commanding general gave one of his oneshouldered shrugs i do not care how it seems to you he said his voice even colder than it had been a moment before it seems to me that some of my subordinates have a great deal to learn about obeying orders it seems to me somebody has a deal to learn about giving orders otho the troll muttered whats that whats that bell said by the lion gods claws king geoffrey trusts me to give orders for the army of franklin thats the truth and anybody who doesnt like it can go to the devils king geoffrey trusted thraxton the braggart to give orders for this army too otho the troll snapped fat lot of good that did us if i report that to his majesty youll be sorry for it bell said im already sorry for all sorts of things whats one more brigadier otho waved toward the southrons lines besides if we go up against that how many of us are coming back anyhow were not planning on coming back were planning on going through the godsdamned southrons and on to ramblerton bell said none of the assembled brigade and wing commanders said a word the silence seemed to take on a life of its own bells stump hurt his right leg hurt too though he had no right leg his ruined left arm was also full of anguish he longed for laudanum taking it here and now though taking it in front of his brigadiers would be an obscure admission of weakness and defeat instead of using the drug he craved he tried to hearten himself and his officers with hope by the gods we can do this we outnumber them well roll over them like an avalanche more silence colder than the late autumn afternoon lieutenant general bells wounds throbbed and burned worse than ever of itself his good hand again started toward the little bottle he always carried with him he made it hold still far from the easiest thing hed ever done well he said at last again silence all around him he stood as straight as he could well he said again it seemed a complete sentence in case it wasnt he spoke once more i have given you your orders gentlemen i expect you to show me what manner of men you are in the way you obey them mechanical as if they were so many machines stamped out by the manufactories of the south the wing and brigade commanders saluted still though not one of them spoke to bell he didnt care he was past caring he was as sure of what wanted doing as if the lion god had growled the plan into his ear we will go forward he said brigadier patrick directly addressed patrick had no choice but to answer saluting once more he said yes sir do you see the path there the one going through the field toward the center of the enemy line yes sir i see it sir patrick the cleaver was offensively polite bell matched him in fussy precision good form your men to the right of the path letting your left overlap the same give orders to your soldiers not to shoot a crossbow bolt until you run the southron skirmish line out of the first line of works then press them and shoot them in the back as they run to their main line then charge the enemys works poor richard is the key to ramblerton and ramblerton is the key to independence patrick the cleaver smiled grimly sure and you have given me the hottest part of the fire to quell your honor well that is as it is and no help for it i will take the southrons works for you sir or i will die trying his salute was of its kind a thing of beauty he turned and walked over to his unicorn which was tethered to a nearby oak no doubt a splendid tree in summer but barebranched and skeletal now mounting with a grace that roused nothing but envy in lieutenant general bell patrick rode off to the soldiers he commanded did i put his men in the most dangerous position on purpose because he has caused me so much trouble bell wondered after a few seconds he shrugged another of his painful oneshouldered shrugs what if i did someone has to be there and patrick the cleaver has never been a man to shrink from striking a mighty blow we need a mighty blow right now he nodded to himself if hed ever had any serious doubts that stifled them one by one the other wing and brigade commanders straggled off toward their soldiers some riding others walking those who stayed on foot all went with bowed heads and stooped shoulders as if trying to bear the weight of the world on their backs they did not look like officers heading into a battle for which they were eager bell had seen many such officers in the early days of the war up till the battle by the river of death and his second maiming hed been such an officer he didnt think many of that sort were left in king geoffreys army a victory will make more he told himself we have to have a victory because we have to have one well get one its as simple as that last of the subordinate commanders to stay by bell was benjamin the heated ham he looked as gloomy as any of the other brigadiers are you sure you want to do this sir he asked are you sure weve got men and engines enough to do the job the soldiers were starting to shake themselves out into a battle line i am sending everything i have bell answered what more can i do what more can geoffreys kingdom do if everyone gives all he has our victory will be assured benjamin still looked as mournful as a man planning his own cremation he said yes sir in a way that couldnt possibly mean anything but no sir then shaking his head he too went off to command his wing bell stroked his beard deep in thought where to get more men all his soldiers were here all except those riding off for that trip around the southrons flank with ned of the forest by the thunderer bell exclaimed and shouted for a messenger yes sir the young man said ride after lieutenant general ned bell told him kill your unicorn if you have to but catch up with him tell him i am recalling two of his regiments they are to report back here to me at once for direct use against poor richard have you got that yes sir the messenger said again and repeated it to him goodyou do have it straight now go and ride like the wind bell said nodding the messenger dashed to his unicorn sprang aboard roweled it with his spurs and went off like a crossbow quarrel bell nodded that would take care of that ned might grumble but bell was prepared to ignore grumbling he commanded here and the fight came first more long files of northern soldiers moved out over the field forming themselves into a battle line their brave standards red dragon proud on gold fluttered in the chilly breeze for all the carping and whining and grumbling bell had heard from his brigadiers the men complained not at all they knew they had a job to do and they were ready to give it everything they had in them with a nod bell turned to the trumpeter beside him blow advance he said ned of the forest listened to lieutenant general bells messenger with a mix of fury and disbelief you cant mean that ned said when the youngster finished you cant possibly mean that gods damn it bell cant mean that i do sir he does sir the messenger replied he requires the men at once to help in the attack on poor richard thats half my force ned exclaimed the messenger merely rode his unicorn alongside the commander of unicornriders without a word ned tried again maybe the young soldier would see reason itll help his attack a hells of a lot more if i can strike at the southrons flank with all the power ive got im sorry sir the fellow said uncomfortably i dont give the orders i only send them on from the general commanding this is a fools order ned of the forest thought hard about disobeying it about pretending hed never got it even about making something unfortunate happen to this messenger so he could be convincing when he pretended that reluctantly he decided he couldnt justify something unfortunate he didnt know how things were back by poor richard maybe bell did desperately need two regiments of unicornriders to turn john the listers right flank or for some other reason maybe ned of the forest still had a hard time believing it but hard time or not he turned to the trumpeter trotting along close by and said blow halt the words tasted putrid in his mouth like salt beef that had gone off a quarter of an hour later two regiments of unicornriders trotted back with the messenger the rest of neds force pressed on colonel biffle whose troopers ned had kept with him muttered into his beard he didnt need long to stop muttering and come right out and say this is a bad business sira very bad business dont i know it ned said bitterly then he laughed and that was more bitter still bell only half wanted to let me go in the first place and so hes ending up letting me go with only half my men i reckon that leaves me just about half a chance of doing anything worthwhile how do you cipher it biff about the same sir dont suppose anybody could cipher it any different what the hells do we do now the best we can ned of the forest answered dont know what else there is to do he raised his voice to call to a couple of men riding farther away from him than colonel biffle captain watson major marmaduke by strict protocol he should have named marmaduke first but he couldnt bring himself to put a mere wizard ahead of the man who led soldiers and engines both the sorcerer and the commander of catapults answered yes sir and guided their mountsone unicorn one asscloser to his are you ready to do everythingand i mean everything to make up for the loss of the soldiers bell just stole from us ned asked them yes sir they chorused again ned knew he could rely on watson no matter how young he was hed fought like a veteran from the day hed taken service with the unicornriders major marmaduke on the other hand ned of the forest sighed and shrugged counting on a wizard was always a roll of the dice that was one problem the southrons had too it might have been the only problem they had worse than king geoffreys men as a matter of fact a scout rode back calling follyfree gap just ahead sir theres southrons at the far end of it too ned swore hed hoped he could get through the gap and into the southrons rear before meeting up with their unicornriders then he would have had the edge or more of it even if bell had robbed him of half his force he shrugged again what you hoped for in war and what you got were all too likely to be different animals he turned to watson and marmaduke you heard that he asked they both nodded he went on all right then were going to have to shift the godsdamned sons of bitches do everything you know how to do yes sir they said once more watson added ill bring the engines up as close to the enemy as i can i know you will ned said major marmaduke made no such promises odds were he didnt know how he would be useful till the moment came ned hoped he would figure it out then colonel biffle had heard the scouts report too as the leading unicornriders entered follyfree gap the regimental commander asked you aim to move as near as we can mounted and then attack on foot sir best way to do it far as i can see ned answered i wish we had more cover coming down on em gods damn it in summertime the low gentle slopes of the gap would have offered plenty of concealment and he might have sneaked around the southrons before they knew he was there no chance of that now not with all the branches bare if he wanted to unplug the gap hed have to knock the enemy riders out of it colonel biffle pointed ahead nice little stand of woods there where we can tether our unicorns well only need to leave a handful of men behind to watch em i dont want to leave any not after bell went and robbed me ned of the forest drummed the fingers of his left hand against his thigh youre right though biff weve got to leave a handful i reckon by the thunderers beard we wont leave many tiny in the distance southrons on unicorns rode back toward their main body of men ned could easily see the unicorns because they were so very white he laughed one of these days if he ever got the chance he would have to slap brown paint on his mens beasts so they wouldnt stand out so much from the terrain over which they rode that might let him give king avrams unicornriders a nasty surprise no surprises here this would be straightup toetotoe slugging ned hated this kind of fight but the ground dictated it so did bells insistence on slamming straight ahead at poor richard ned muttered into his chin whiskers if only bell had had some sense to go with his undoubted courage the unicornriders reached the copse colonel biffle had seen they scrambled off their mounts tethered them and trotted toward the southrons they didnt move in neat lines as footsoldiers did all they wanted to do was close with the enemy or find some way to outflank him once they managed that they were convinced the rest would be easy it usually had been up till now a few of neds men stayed behind to guard the tethered unicorns a few of the unicorns went forward those ridden by officers ned among them and those pulling captain watsons catapults and repeating crossbows major marmaduke went forward still mounted too again though ned had trouble taking a man who rode an ass seriously a fellow who rode an ass was all too likely to be one too as usual ned sent his unicorn trotting out ahead of his men he wanted to make the southrons start shooting at him so he could discover where they were he also wanted them to see him to know who he was he won as much by intimidating the enemy as by outfighting them a firepot arced through the air and burst about twenty feet in front of him the unicorn sidestepped nervously he fought it back under control waving his sword he pointed to the stand of trees from which the firepot had flown captain watson theres some of what the bastards have waiting for us he shouted right sir the young officer said gaily he waved the siege engines he led forward because he came forward with themahead of them in factthe men who served the catapults and repeating crossbows didnt hesitate in advancing they set up in the open and got to work shooting at the southrons engines dismounted soldiers in gray came up in the same irregular way as neds own troopers ned recognized it at once recognized it and didnt like it the southrons werent supposed to fight as dragoons and werent supposed to look as if they knew what they were doing when they did ned also recognized what hardriding jimmys men were up to if they could get close enough to watsons engines to reach them with their crossbows they could pick off the soldiers serving the engines yes they knew what they were doing as dragoons all right well gods damn them lets see how they like this he growled and spurred his unicorn toward them if he killed a couple the rest might run away hed seen that happen before he didnt see it this time he didnt see the crossbow quarrels buzzing past his head either they were going too fast for that he didnt see them but he heard them they sounded like a swarm of angry wasps for a moment he thought a big repeating crossbow had decided to open up on him alone an honor he could have done without then he realized it wasnt one big repeating crossbow but a lot of quickshooting weapons in the hands of southron troopers they seemed to be crank and leveroperated and to shoot tenbolt clips and they put more quarrels in the air than anything hed ever imagined one tugged at the brim of his hat a couple of inches to one side and it would have hit him in the face another bolt glanced off his blade sending a shiver up his left arm and another caught his unicorn in the neck the beasts scream of pain turned to a gurgle it staggered stumbled toppled were this neds first unicorn lost in battle he might have been badly hurt but having had so many mounts killed under him he knew what to do he kicked free of the stirrups even before the unicorn went down when it did he rolled away instead of getting crushed beneath its body and then he was on his feet and running forward shouting come on boys lets get em on came his riders all of them roaring like the lion god the fierce northern war cry that struck fear into southron souls they shot as they advanced too ned of the forest didnt believe in closing with the sword as the beall and endall of battles if crossbow quarrels would kill the foe that was fine with him that the southrons ended up dead mattered how they ended up that way didnt hardriding jimmys men were still shooting too shooting as if theyd brought all the bolts in the world with them more quarrels hissed past neds head one snipped a slice from his sleeve it might have been a friend pulling on his arm to urge him to go that way it might have been but it wasnt and he was one of the lucky ones all around him dismounted unicornriders in blue fell the cries of the wounded echoed through follyfree gap he wondered how the place had got that name however that had happened it was badly miscalled trying to force his way through was turning out to be nothing but folly how many of those southron sons of bitches are there a trooper howled after two quarrels buried themselves in the dirt at his feet and a third snarled by his body and how long can they keep shooting those godsdamned crossbows of theirs another soldier complained dont you know about that asked a third who at least wasnt disheartened they load em on the day they sacrifice to the lion god and keep shooting em all week long ned of the forest laughed he would have laughed harder if the soldier hadnt told too much of the truth in sour jest the enemys quickshooting crossbows made him seem to have at least three times as many soldiers as he really did since he probably outnumbered neds men anyway that just made matters worse to the hells with lieutenant general bell too ned thought angrily he might have had some chance in spite of those fancy crossbows if hed had his whole force along with only half of it he shook his head barring a miracle it wasnt going to happen and the gods had been chary about handing the north miracles lately then ned shook his head again there was a miracle or what would do for one colonel biffle remained on his unicorn and unwounded though he was even closer to the enemy than ned he kept urging his men on they would surge forward whereupon a blizzard of bolts would knock them back till they could nerve themselves for another surge ned looked for major marmaduke maybe magic would help but marmaduke was down with a quarrel in his shoulder a soldier stooped beside him to bind up the wound there would be no fancy wizardry today even if marmaduke had had such a thing in him which was anything but obvious spying ned biffle called we cant do it sir not the way theyre shooting before ned could answer a bolt plucked the hat off his head calm as if no one were taking aim at him he turned stooped picked it up and set it back in place if we get in amongst em how colonel biffle asked bluntly ned started to reply but realized he had nothing to say his men were not going to get in amongst the southrons not with the enemy spraying so many quarrels all over the landscape hed been in a lot of hard fights in more than three years of war but this was the first time hed had to own himself whipped pain and wonder in his voice he said what can we do then biff i only see two things biffle said we can hang on here and keep getting shot to no purpose or we can pull back maybe see if we can outflank these sons of bitches maybe just wait and see how bell does back at poor richard and hope that makes them leave the gap on their own pull back the words tasted foul in neds mouth but they werent going forward here and they werent going to outflank hardriding jimmy either follyfree gap was the only way through the hills oh neds unicornriders could filter past a few men at a time but far too slowly to do them any good its up to bell then ned said hoping that wasnt so bad an omen as it seemed as captain gremio mustered the men of his company along with the rest of colonel florizels regiment along with the rest of the wing brigadier patrick the cleaver came riding up on his unicorn to look over the ground his men would have to cross before closing with the southrons entrenched outside of poor richard seeing patricks face sergeant thisbe whistled softly he doesnt look very happy does he the underofficer said in a low voice he sure doesnt gremio answered also quietly patrick stared toward the waiting field fortifications sheltering john the listers men then shook his head his sigh was loud enough to make people thirty or forty paces from him turn and look his way colonel florizel rode his unicorn out toward patrick the young brigadier from the sapphire isle reined in he managed a weary nod for florizel the two highranking officers spoke together not twenty feet in front of gremio and thisbe we must be after doing it colonel patrick pointed toward the southrons works come what may we have to take them theres to be no shooting till the skirmishers amongst those southron spalpeens flee back to their line so says the great and mighty lieutenant general bell and he is to be obeyed i shall so order my company officers sir florizel said stiffly you do that they all must know ill not give bell the least excuse to tell me i would not follow his orders in every particular yes patrick sounded weary and gloomy beyond his years florizel also eyed the long long stretch of ground the northern army would have to cross before closing with john the listers soldiers he saluted patrick the cleaver then remarked well sir there will not be many of us that will get back to palmetto province patrick nodded he reached out and let his left hand rest for a moment on the regimental commanders shoulder well florizel if we are to die let us die like men his voice held sadness but no fear he flicked the unicorns reins the white beast slowly walked on down the line florizel shook himself as if awakening from a dream a bad dream he turned to gremio asking did you hear that yes sir gremio replied it didnt sound good he too stared across the expanse of ground he would have to cover before breaking into the southrons lines how bare it seemed if youll forgive my saying so it doesnt look good either no it doesnt florizel agreed glumly come what may though we can only do our duty the gods i trust will favor our cause the gods must favor our cause they had better gremio said if they dont weve got no chance at all he waited for the regimental commander to round on him for talking like a defeatist but baron florizel only nodded his gaze kept going back toward the southrons entrenchments there so far away we would stand a better chance if we were asked to storm almost any other position i fear he said gremio also nodded florizel had always been a man who looked for the best hoped for the best expected the best if he now thought the army of franklin would have a hard time managing what lieutenant general bell required of it gremio was used to drawing inferences from evidence he didnt care for the inferences he couldnt help drawing here otho the troll commanded the brigade of which florizels regiment was a part he came by now on foot his broad muscular shoulders slumped as if he carried a sack full of rocks on his back no help for it he muttered again and again no help for it at all sergeant thisbe walked up to gremio and spoke in a low voice i wish theyd send us sir all this waiting around and thinking about what weve got to try and do wears on the nerves it does doesnt it gremio agreed me im scared green you sir thisbe sounded astonished you never show it that only proves im a better actor than i thought gremio said all barristers have to act some its part of the job but i havent been this frightened since thraxton the braggarts spell went awry at proselytizers ridge last year that wasnt my fault it was the spell i see what weve got to do now and im terrified no magic today just me im scared too thisbe said i wouldnt admit it to anybody but you but i am they can massacre us and we dont even get to shoot back at em till were just about up to their trenches if we get that far before gremio could answer bugles sounded up and down the line without being told to standardbearers stepped out in front of their companies and regiments and flourished the flags officersgremio among themdrew their swords the bugles cried out again this time with an order officers and underofficers echoed advance advance they did at a steady rapid pace once his feet sent him toward the enemy gremio found a lot of his fear falling away as if hed left it behind where hed waited while patricks wing shook itself out into line of battle logically that was madness every step took him closer to danger but now he was doing something not waiting and brooding it helped his men came with him not a one hung back in a way that made him proud of them in another way he thought them all idiots he thought himself an idiot too at some point the men of the army of franklin would get close enough for the southrons to open up on them with everything they had every step he took brought that point closer who else but an idiot would deliberately march into deadly danger come on men thisbe called let those bastards hear you let em know whose side the lion gods on they roared southron prisoners had told gremio that that roar was worth regiments of men on the battlefield the soldiers who fought for king avram had no war cry to match it other companies and other regiments took up the great growl of the lion god soon all of patrick the cleavers men snarled out defiance at their foes gremio hoped it made the southrons afraid he looked back over his shoulder his comrades and he had come more than halfway from their starting point toward the enemys line more than a mile before too much longer the southrons engines would bear on them they would have to take whatever the men in gray dished out till they got close enough for revenge thisbe said itif we get that close he thought and wished he hadnt on came the northerners roaring fiercely on they came and a firepot arced through the air toward them smoke trailing from the oilsoaked rag that would ignite it when it hit and burst it landed fifty yards in front of the advancing men in blue the splash of fire was impressive but harmed no one see they are afraid of us if they start shooting that soon thisbe said scornfully gremio hoped the sergeant was right though he doubted itboth sides usually started trying their weapons beyond their true reach even if thisbe was right though how much difference would it make in the end avrams men would have plenty of chances to do more and worse another catapult let fly this one hurling a thirtypound stone ball instead of sticking where it landed it bounded toward the men from the army of franklin they scrambled to get out of its way once a long time before an incautious soldier had tried to stop a bounding catapult ball with his foot it had looked easy and safe enoughand had cost him a broken leg for his foolishness people knew better now more firepots flew so did more stones some of them smashed down among the northerners men crushed or burning shrieked and fell the rest closed their ranks and kept on up on his unicorn florizel brandished his sword forward he cried and then the enemys repeating crossbows began their ratcheting clatter soldier after blueclad soldier went down some kicking some screaming some silent and still gremio watched a skirmisher out ahead of the main line take two or three staggering steps while clutching at his chest then crumple bonelessly to the ground but the pits that held john the listers skirmishers were very close now men in gray scrambled up out of those pits and ran back toward their main line theres the sign colonel gremio called may we shoot now yes florizel answered shoot send all those sons of bitches to the hells and gone behind gremio crossbows clicked and snapped his men those who still stood took vengeance on the southrons for everything theyd endured kill the bastards they shouted and the pickets in gray died like flies most of them perishing long before they reached their own entrenchments but theyre only pickets gremio thought uneasily a moment later he once more wished he hadnt had a thought for all the southrons in the first row of proper earthworks leaped up onto the shooting steps leveled their crossbows on the parapet and delivered a volley the likes of which gremio had never seen for sheer destructive power horrible screams rose all along the line of patrick the cleavers wing soldiers in blue toppled as if scythed colonel florizels unicorn might have charged headlong into a stone wall pierced by half a dozen quarrels it crashed to the ground gremio feared for florizel but the regimental commander twisted free from his mounts ruin and limped forward on his bad foot bravely done colonel gremio shouted florizel brandished his sword and went on so did gremio he had no idea why the gods had chosen to spare him he knew that had he had any sense he would have run away but his fear of looking bad in front of thisbe and the ordinary soldiers of his company was worse than his fear of getting shot by any logical standard that was madness logic though died when battle beckoned fear of letting comrades down was the glue that held the army of franklin togetherand probably all the armies on both sides gremio almost stumbled over a body the corpse wore blue not gray and not only blue but also gold lace and stars and the other accouterments of rank there lay otho the troll shot once in the face twice in the chest and for good measure once in the leg gremios stomach did a slow lurch battles when brigadiers fell like common soldiers did not bode well for the side that lost them colonel florizel needed to know if he didnt already colonel gremio yelled florizel waved his sword again to show hed heard gremio went on brigadier othos down that didnt say enough hes dead gremio added he couldnt get much balder than that thank you captain florizel answered he wasnt long on brains but nobody could say he wasnt brave the only question was would bravery be enough another volley tore into the northerners ranks more men crumpled behind gremio sergeant thisbe yelled keep going for gods sake keep going when we get in amongst em we can pay em back for everything theyve done to us hearing thisbes voice gremio let out a sigh of relief hed been through too much with the sergeant to want to think about he didnt have to think about it there was the southrons parapet just ahead he sprang onto it a soldier in gray in the trench thrust up at him with a pike he beat aside the spearhead with his sword shouting provincial prerogative forever he leaped down into the trench he wasnt alone there for even a heartbeat follow the captain thisbe shouted yelling king geoffreys name the northern soldiers did southrons rushed up to reinforce their men in the trench line the soldiers thrust with pikes and slashed with swords and shot the bolts they had in their crossbows and then used the weapons to smash in their foes heads no one on either side gave an inch of ground both sides fed more men into the fight this wasnt war any more this was madness soldiers were killed where they stood and had no room to fall down men clambered up on corpses to get at their foes no one down in the trenches could hope to load a crossbow soldiers behind the line passed forward weapons already loaded and cocked whoever got them shot at the first man in the wrongcolored uniform he saw the soldiers who got the loaded crossbows tried to shoot anyhow sometimes they got shot or speared before they could then someone else would clamber up onto their bodies and shoot or thrust at the foe till he was wounded or killed it went on and on and on why am i still alive gremio wondered after perhaps half an hour went by he had no idea save that he was luckier than he deserved blood turned his blue tunic and pantaloons black but it wasnt his blood most of it wasnt anyhow he had a couple of cuts and a crossbow graze that was actually a little more than a graze but nothing he had to worry about except getting crushed to death in the press which was anything but an idle fear where was thisbe gremio turned his headat the moment the only part of him that would movebut didnt see the sergeant he managed to twist his right arm free and slashed at a southron who couldnt hit back it wasnt sporting he didnt care he just wanted to live and killing southrons was the best way he knew how to do that after another time that might have been forever or fifteen minutes the southrons ran out of men to throw into that part of the fight scrambling out of the trench over the bodies of the slain gremio dashed toward a farmhouse the next southron strongpoint and there by the gods came thisbe trotting along not ten feet away gremio ran harder maybe in spite of everything this was victory v rollant watched the army of franklin form its ranks he watched it advance over the flat gently rising ground that led to the earthworks john the listers army had thrown up outside of poor richard as the northerners began to move smitty spoke with reluctant admiration theyve got guts dont they that they do rollant allowed and i want to see those guts scattered all over the landscape for the ravens and crows before the godsdamned sons of bitches get close enough to do me any harm he made smitty laugh youre a funny fellow your corporalship sir anybody who can tell a joke when the battles about to start has to be a funny fellow staring rollant asked what the hells makes you think im joking he knew what the trouble was smitty didnt take any of this quite so seriously as he did himself smitty was a detinan and fought to reunite his kingdom rollant was a blond he knew why he fought too he wanted to see every northern liege lord and wouldbe liege lord dead or maimed he had no doubt the northerners felt the same way about him too here came bells men proud banners flying before them they were lean and fierce and terribly in earnest if they hadnt been in earnest would they have marched down from dothan close to two hundred miles when so many of them had no shoes that he respected them made him want to kill them no less if anything it made him want to kill them more he understood how dangerous they were standing on the shooting step he listened to the traitors roar as they came on they thought the lion god favored them rollant had a different opinion not far behind him catapults began to buck and creak stone balls and firepots whistled over his head the first few fell short but as the northerners kept coming the engines began clawing holes in their line rollant whooped and cheered when a stone took out a whole file of traitors how would you like to be on the receiving end of that smitty asked wouldnt like it one godsdamned bit rollant answered without hesitation but i like giving it to the traitors just fine you bet i do i hope the engines wipe them all out then we wont have to do any fighting of our own thatd be good smitty said im not what youd call pleased when people try and kill me either john the listers pickets shot a thin volley of their own at bells men who kept on coming despite what the engines did to them they were brave think what you would of them repeating crossbows behind rollant started clattering more northerners fell the ones who werent hit leaned forward as if into a heavy wind rollant had seen that before hed done it himself when advancing into the teeth of a storm of bolts and stones and firepots be ready men lieutenant griff called theyll come into range of our crossbows soon rollant wished he had one of the quickshooting weapons hardriding jimmys unicornriders used he wanted to be able to knock down as many detinan liege lords as he could he laughed he was already living every northern blonds dream not only was he shooting at liege lords he was getting paid to do it if that wasnt right up there with living alongside the gods he didnt know what was only trouble was the liege lords shot back they hadnt shot till the southron pickets pulled back theyd just kept coming taking whatever punishment they got for the sake of striking back when they jumped down into their foes trenches rollant didnt want them jumping in there with him he made sure his shortsword was loose in its scabbard looks like theyre bunching toward the center smitty said it does doesnt it rollant agreed their regiment was off to the left not all of bells men moved toward the center though only a few paces from rollant and smitty a soldier in gray tunic and pantaloons fell dead a quarrel in his forehead hed been looking out from the shooting step exposing no more than the top of his head that was all some traitord needed be ready griff called again take aim rollant nestled the stock of the crossbow against his shoulder as the company commander cried shoot he pulled the trigger the crossbow kicked the bolt he shot was one of scores flying toward the northerners several of them crumpled he had no idea whether his bolt scored the only way to improve his chances was to shoot again and again and again frenziedly he loaded cocked aimed and shot northerners kept falling but the ones who didnt fall didnt run either they called false king geoffreys name and their fighting slogans they roared as if the lion god dwelt in all their hearts they came closer and closer to the entrenchment where rollant shot yet again this time he was pretty sure he saw the bolt go home the blackbearded detinan clutched at his midsection and slowly fell to the ground in front of the trenches rollant nodded to himself a wound like that was mortal if it didnt kill quickly from loss of blood it would in its own sweet time from fever hardly anyone lived after getting shot in the belly people said ned of the forest had but people said all sorts of uncanny things about ned thinking about ned paralyzed rollant the way seeing a snake was supposed to paralyze a bird a serfcatcher whod turned into a firstrate general and whose men had massacred blond soldiers yes that was plenty to frighten him he wasnt ashamed to admit it he shot again when the northerners were only fifty yards or so from the parapet one of their bolts dug into the rampart and kicked dirt up into his face as he rubbed his eyes a repeating crossbow opened up behind him hosing death into the men from the army of franklin at close range they crumpled one after another after another that was too much for flesh and blood to bear instead of swarming forward into the trenches the men in blue in front of rollant broke and ran he couldnt imagine how theyd come as far as they had john the listers soldiers and engineers had hit the traitors with everything they had as soon as they came into range how many northerners were already down dead or dying orluckilyonly wounded hundreds no surely thousands beside rollant smitty shouted see how much the lion god loves you now you bastards he shot a running man in the back then turned to rollant in surprise why arent you filling em full of holes too i dont know the blond answered sometimes enough is enough i guess as he watched the repeating crossbow cut down more men from behind even his blood lust was sated be ready to go after them if we get the order to pursue lieutenant griff said pursue that startled smitty and rollant who both echoed it rollant added i dont think weve got the men to chase them colonel nahath said anyone who ordered us to pursue given what we have and what bell and the traitors have the regimental commander shook his grayhaired head hed have to be crazy that hadnt always stopped officers on either side rollant knew as much if someone wearing a brigadiers star on each epaulet saw the northerners fleeing and decided they needed a clout in the backside hed order a pursuit and if it got the regiment slaughtered how much would he care but the order didnt come the din of battle got louder over to the right the sons of bitches are in the trenches there smitty said they can go in but lets see how many come out rollant said savagely hed already done his duty and more he would have been perfectly content to stay right where he was if bells men nerved themselves for another charge at this part of the line hed fight them off again if they didnt if they didnt as things turned out he and his comrades would go to them colonel nahath said men were shifting to the right to make sure the traitors dont break our line and cut us in half rollant had plunged the butt end of the company standards staff into the soft damp dirt at the bottom of the trench he snatched up the flag and carried it through the trenches toward the thicker fighting at the center of the southrons line as long as he carried it he wouldnt be able to shoot at the traitors hed have to do his fighting with his shortsword sometimes that meant he didnt do any fighting he didnt think that would happen today outside the parapet a northern officer shouted for gods sake men rally we can whip them yet for gods sake we can all you have to do is fight hard for smitty raised his crossbow to his shoulder and shot no standard hampered him the officers exhortation ended in a shriek got the preachy son of a bitch smitty said exultantly the traitors cried out in dismay for gods sake john is down one of them exclaimed i think you just shot a brigadier rollant told smitty his friend set another bolt in the groove of his crossbow and grunted with effort as he yanked back the bowstring too bad the bastard wasnt a full general he said detinans were seldom satisfied with anything no matter how fine it was not for the first time rollant wondered whether that was their greatest strength or greatest weakness most blonds lacked that restless urge to change things the lack made them have a harder time keeping up with their swarthy neighbors a southron officer still on his feet despite a bloody bandage on his head and another wrapped around his left arm waved a sword with his good hand go on in there boys and give em hells avram rollant shouted avram and freedom it was getting dark before long nobody would be able to see anybody else to see his gray uniform or his blond hair or which standard he bore his own side would be almost as likely as the enemy to shoot him unless he kept yelling avram and freedom he cried once more louder than ever some of the soldiers battling around the farmhouse shouted the same thing others called geoffreys name and cried out for provincial prerogative rollants comrades poured a volley of crossbow quarrels into those men then rushed at them drawing shortswords as they charged pikemen came up with the crossbowmen in colonel nahaths regiment they too stormed toward the northerners but more soldiers yelling for false king geoffrey burst out of the trench line theyd overrun and reinforced their comrades already in the farmyard if the southrons wanted to drive them backindeed if the southrons wanted to keep them from breaking throughthey would have their work cut out for them avram rollant shouted again he shifted the company standard to his left hand and yanked out his shortsword avram and freedom avram and victory bugger avram with a pine cone you stinking southron son of a bitch a man in blue cried furiously he too had a shortsword he and rollant hacked at each other rollants sword bit flesh the northerner groaned rollant slashed him again this time across the face he reeled back hands clutched to the spurting wound lightning smashed down out of a clear though quickly darkening sky southrons near rollant screamed their cries almost drowned in a thunderclap like the end of the world the stink of charred flesh made the blond want to gag a couple of minutes later another lightning bolt smote colonel nahaths men this one struck close enough to make every hair on rollants body stand erect the sensation was extraordinarily distinct and extraordinarily unpleasant where are our wizards that cry had risen from southron armies ever since the war was new southron mages usually managed to do just enough to keep the traitors wizards from destroying southron soldiers altogether that was enough to have brought king avrams armies to the edge of victory it wasnt enough to keep a lot of men in gray tunics and pantaloons from dying unnecessarily rollant didnt want to be one of those unnecessarily dead men he didnt even want to be a necessarily dead man he wanted to live how could he gloat at the beaten traitors if he didnt yet another bolt of sorcerous lightning smashed into the battlefield this one striking the twostory farmhouse where dozens of southrons sheltered and from which they shot at their foes when nothing much seemed to happen one more thunderbolt hit the farmhouse its roof caught fire some of the southrons inside fled others must have thought a burning farmhouse safer than the hellsish battle all around for they stayed where they were rollant did his best to ignore the northerners magics if they slew him they slew him and he couldnt do much about it he knew the protective amulet he wore around his neck was not proof against sorceries of that magnitude and if he stood around gaping at them some resolutely unsorcerous traitor would shoot him or spear him or run him through all he could do was fight his own fight and hope john the listers wizards eventually realized they had something important to do here geoffrey someone nearby yelled without even thinking about it rollant lunged with his shortsword his blade cleaved flesh the traitor howled well done corporal lieutenant griff called a crossbow quarrel or swordstroke had carried away the lobe of his left ear rollant wondered if he even knew it then he shrugged with the sort of fight this was turning out to be griff was lucky to have got away so lightlyand he himself so far luckier still john the lister had known he would have a fight on his hands at poor richard even he hadnt guessed the army of franklin would be able to make it as savage a fight as it was a year and a half before at essoville down in the south duke edward of arlington had ordered the army of southern parthenia to charge across open country against a fortified position most of the northern soldiers had given way under southron bombardment and never reached the southrons lines at all the few who did were quickly killed or captured here bells men had to cross far more open ground than the army of southern parthenia had they had only a handful of engines of their own where duke edwards catapults had pounded and pummeled the southron line before the charge but they held part of johns position refused to be dislodged and still threatened to break through and cut his army in half he had to admire them he also had to keep them from doing what they wanted if he didnt his whole army was liable to perish he knew how badly his men had hurt them as they advanced into the fight now that they were in it they were striking back with a fury at least half compounded of the lust for revenge john ordered more men to move from the flanks where the northerners hadnt been able to break into his entrenchments to the center where they had when lightning began striking in the center john cursed and shouted major alva where in the hells is major alva im right here sir alva said from beside him from in fact almost inside the breast pocket of his tunic john the lister glowered at him and not because he hadnt noticed him either what in the damnation are the traitors doing pounding us like that arent you here to stop them from working this kind of wizardry no sir alva answered john glowered even more but the mage ignored him continuing im here to stop them from working any really big spells and ive done that john suddenly noticed how weary he sounded after a sigh and a shrug alva went on if you knew what they wanted to do and what they almost did well they didnt manage it and they godsdamned well wont now this other stuff this is fumbling in your pocket and and pulling out copper when you went looking for gold oh john felt foolish not knowing exactly what to say he tried i suppose i ought to thank you that would be nice not a hells of a lot of people ever bother alva said but dont worry about it i wont turn you into a red eft or anything like that if you dont what in the name of the lion gods tail tuft is a red eft john the lister demanded its what you call a mostly water salamandera newtduring the time it lives on land major alva answered somehow john was sure he would remember that utterly useless bit of information the rest of his life at the moment though he had more things to worry about than red efts pointing toward the center of his line he said look that farmhouse is burning its a strongpoint for our men if we get forced away from there bells army will break thought and split us in half if that happens well all end up dead or captured stopping their lightning would make that a lot less likely even if you dont think much of it as far as magic goes alva very visibly paused to think it over well yes i suppose you have a point he said at last as if it was one he hadnt thought of himself maybe he hadnt for he went on we really do need to win this battle dont we that would be nice if you plan on living long enough to show how clever you are after this godsdamned war finally ends john the lister said dryly i do now alva sounded very determined oh yes i certainly do he pointed at the farmhouse as imperiously as a king he said one word in a language john did not know and never wanted to learn the fire ceased to be it might have been a candle flame hed blown out the disappearance was as sudden and abrupt as that now the mage murmured reminding himself the lightnings they struck again only moments after he spoke he muttered something under his breath then he spoke aloud again only one word when the lightnings came down once more from the clear night sky they struck off to one side of where they had been hitting is that still our position or are they coming down on the traitors heads now alva asked their mages are a little stronger than i thought i wanted to stop that bolt but all i could do was shift it john the lister goggled alva was taking on several northern wizards at once and winning that sort of thing hadnt happened all through the war john wasnt sorry to see ithe was anything but sorry to see itbut it took him by surprise he needed a moment to remember the question alva had asked ill need to send a runner and find out he said several heartbeats slower than he should have all right alva stretched and yawned he still looked like an unmade bed but john the lister saw why doubting george a man who had confidence in no one relied on major alva on johns command a runner dashed toward the fighting john hoped he wouldnt get killed up there more lightning struck in about the same place as the last bolt which side was it punishing they wouldjohn hoped they wouldknow soon he turned to alva if you can do this now what will you do in peacetime when you get a little older and you come into your full power do you think it will be greater than this alva asked interestedly ive wondered about that myself i suppose ill just have to find out back came the runner going flat out his face streaked with sweat in spite of the chilly night sir he panted those are still hitting our men but not in such a bad spot thank you john said and turned to alva what can you do about that major well see the mage answered theyre rallying against me but they havent got any one fellow whos really strong a bunch of bricks doesnt make one rock because theyll fall apart if the rock hits them the right way now i have to find it the northern wizards loosed another thunderbolt a couple of minutes later in that same spot while alva stood there thinking hard john the lister wondered if the wizards arrogancewhich he unquestionably had despite his shambling mannerhad got the better of him then alva laughed out loud a sound childish in its sheer glee he snapped his fingers and hopped up into the air thats what ill do by the thunderer lets see how they like it this time the charm he used wasnt just one word he brought it out in a way that made it sound almost like one of the work chants blond serfs used john found himself tapping his foot to the rollicking rhythm alva was tapping his foot too with a last little hop and a skipand a pass as intricate as any john had ever seenhe sent the spell on its way what will it do john the lister asked when he judged it safe to jog the wizards metaphorical elbow deflect the strike a little more alva answered absently well find out how they like that and what they can do about it by his manner he didnt think they could do much yes he had arrogance all right john waited to see if he deserved what he had when the lightnings didnt return for some little while the commanding general began to wonder whether alva had altogether stifled the northern wizards despite saying he couldnt but then the thunderbolt crashed down once more shall i send a runner to find out where that hit john asked later he paused to wonder about the propriety of a brigadiers asking a majorand a major by courtesy at thatwhat he required that was later at the time it seemed the most natural thing in the world and alva nodded as if it was the most natural thing in the world too yes sir thanks very much he said i think ive done it but i want to make sure off dashed another runner he came back panting even harder than his predecessor had but with an enormous grin stretched across his face sir that came down on the traitors who were moving up to reinforce their position near the farmhouse and it tore the hells out them at that news john the lister whooped and reached up to smack the taller wizard on the back he almost knocked alva over and had to steady him to keep him from falling well done major he exclaimed were holding them everywhere else so theyre really stopped if we can stop them there good thats good uh sir alva answered theyll try to break free of what ive done to them you know i dont think they can but there is the off chance that im wrong what then john asked can they beat down your magic i dont think so sir the mage said but they might make me do some more work you never can tell even as he spoke another thunderbolt smote the battlefield blinking against the greenishpurple afterimages john the lister said i think that came down on the same part of the field as the last one if it did it came down on the northerners heads again didnt it i think so sir i hope so sir alva said wed better find out though because i cant say for certain all right john sent forth yet another runner this one didnt even need to speak when he came sprinting back the expression on his face said everything that needed saying but he announced the news even so they dropped another one on their own men john the lister whooped and major alva hastily moved out of the way so he wouldnt get walloped again ive got the deflection where i want it sure enough he said once he was out of range of johns strong right arm now the only question is how stubborn are they will they keep pounding their own people or will they give it up as a bad job bell commands them john said which means alva asked at johns expression he explained i dont pay much heed to soldiers yes id noticed that john said even more dryly than before after a moment he added you really should you know theyre the opponents youre facing i suppose so i hadnt really looked at it that way all a wizard usually worries about is other wizards with the air of a man making a large concession alva went on tell me about bell then if he werent a man who charges like a unicorn in heat and kicks like an ass would he have attacked us here john asked hmm maybe not we have hit him hard havent we alva might have been noticing for the first time the carnage around him as carnage rather than as a problemand not much more than an elementary problem at thatin sorcery if we hit him any harder john the lister shook his head i dont see how we could have hit him any harder he must have lost three or four times as many men as we have weve had reports of several northern brigadiers falling when they fought right up at the front like common soldiers thats brave of them alva said isnt it kind of stupid too soldiers fight if they didnt fight they wouldnt be soldiers any more john said his voice clotted with disapproval sometimes evidently they arent soldiers any more even if they do fight alva replied before john had to worry about how to respond to that lightning smashed down yet again in the same spot it had already struck twice john didnt need to send a runner what had happened was very obvious do you see he asked alva do you see by the gods yes sir i see the wizard sounded more respectful than he had up till now you were right sir thats the key to it john the lister realized i was right he takes people who are right seriously if you happen to be wrong gods help you if youre wrong around him maybe hell be a little less heartless when he gets older maybe not too as if to prove how very right john was one more bolt of lightning smote that same place he is a stubborn fool isnt he major alva said his wizards are pretty stupid too to keep banging their heads against a wall they cant knock over well thats their worry yes it is john allowed himself the luxury of a long sigh of relief the northerners wouldnt break through in the middle now and theyd never come close to breaking through on the wings his army would live sooner or later bells men would give up the attack and pull back then he could get his own force on the road south get back into the works at ramblerton i hope doubting george thinks ive slowed bell down enough john the lister thought hed better by the gods no matter what happened to the army of franklin here weve paid a heavy price too im sorry sir im very sorry one of the bluerobed mages told lieutenant general bell weve done everything we know how to do but that godsdamned southron wont let us loose its like like wrestling sir sometimes youre pinned and thats all there is to it sometimes youre useless is what you mean bell snarled if youd gone on pounding them there we would have finished smashing them by now sir theyve got a stronger wizard than we do the sorcerer replied i hate like hells to say that since the son of a bitch is a southron we ought to eat up southron mages the way we eat fried fish we ought to but we cant not with this one we were in amongst them bell said we are in amongst them but how can we break through if this mage of theirs stifles your spells well sir the wizard picked his words with care if magic wont do it for us pikes and swords and crossbows will have to i told patrick the cleaver he dared not fail i told him bell muttered he shouted for a runner go up to the front and tell brigadier patrick we require a breakthrough at all costs at all costs do you hear me yes sir a breakthrough at all costs the messenger hurried away bell might have sentenced him to death sending him up to the part of the front where the fighting was hottest the young man had to know that so did bell though he didnt give it a second thought hed gone into plenty of hot fighting himself had the runner hesitated he would have had something to say this way he took a pull at his little bottle of laudanum and waited he was just starting to feel the drug just starting to feel the fire recede from his shoulder and his missing leg when the runner returned which meant something close to half an hour had gone by well bell barked sir we havent got the men in the center to break through the runner said laudanum or no laudanum bells temper didnt merely kindleit ignited havent got the men he shouted who the hells told you that patrick the cleaver patrick the coward ill cashier the whitelivered son of a bitch so help me gods i will but the messenger shook his head no sir patricks down hes dead he added to make himself perfectly plain oh bell could hardly accuse a dead man of dereliction of duty whos in command there then otho the troll otho knows what were supposed to dowhat we have to do no sir brigadier othos shot tooshot dead again the runner didnt seem to want to leave bell in any doubt oh the general commanding repeated this time on even more of a falling note well by the lion gods fangs who is in command in the center a colonel from palmetto province sira man named florizel the runner answered florizel bell scratched his head hed heard the namehe was sure of that but he could barely put a face to the man he had no idea what sort of officer florizel was a live one he thought the runner meanwhile went on he says everythings all smashed to hells and gone up there from what i saw sir hes right the news couldnt be good not if a colonel was trying to command a wing can we get help from the right or left put the men where theyll do the most good for gods sake johns been shot dead too over on our right the runner said florizel talked with men who saw him die oh bell was getting tired of saying that but he didnt know what else he could say what about benjamin the heated ham then over on our left that was the only straw he had left to grasp i dont know sir the runner replied i wasnt over in that part of the field and i cant tell you what happened there bell didnt know either not in detail he did know the men on the left wing hadnt broken into the southrons trenches which wasnt the best news in the world or even anything close to it with a sigh he said id better find out then will you send me again sir no bell shook his head youve gone into danger once already the runner didnt seem to know whether to look indignant or grateful after two or three heartbeats gratitude won lieutenant general bell called for another runner yes sir what can i do for you this one sounded as eager as the last the general commanding explained what he required the runner saluted and hurried off toward the left wing bell cocked his head listening to the fighting ebb he growled something his thick mustache and beard fortunately muffled by the sound of things his men had given everything they had in them even if the left had soldiers to shift to the center could they revive the fight all he could do was wait till the runner came back it seemed like forever but this young man didnt take much longer than the other one had well bell demanded when the fellow reappeared is benjamin breathing yes sir the messenger answered but john of barsoom and hiram the cranberry are both dead sir so hes got two brigades commanded by colonels and that whole wings been shot to pieces oh seemed inadequate that was more bad news than it could bear instead bell said what the hells happened the way benjamin tells it sir the southrons right gradually sticks out as the wing went forward heading in toward the center john the listers men enfiladed them that put them in trouble even before the enemy started shooting at them from the front why didnt benjamin suppress the enfilading shots before he went through with the rest of the right bell asked i cant tell you that sir not for sure youd have to ask him the runner replied but i did see that part of the field and i saw the bodies lying on it id say he tried but found out he couldnt he tried but found out he couldnt it sounded like something a priest would say before lighting a funeral pyre and how great would the pyres be after this fight for once even bell who seldom counted the cost in a battle shied away from thinking about that anything else for me sir the runner asked eh bell had to call himself back to the hereandnow no never mind youre dismissed thank you sir the youngster saluted again and left bell stared after him like a man suddenly realizing he was trapped in nightmare the commanding general shook his head as if trying to wake he opened his mouth starting to say no but checked himself at the last instant seeing the motion the nearest runner asked what are your orders sir what are your orders it was a good question bell wished he had a good answer for it or any answer at all with his right and left wings smashed with his center thwarted what could he do what could the army of franklin do sir the runner asked when he didnt say anything he had to respond the youngster was starting to stare but all that came out was i have none oh the runner said in the same sort of tone bell had used on hearing of disaster ill wait for more news to come in bell tried to put the best face on things he could then ill decide what we need to do next yes sir the runner sounded relieved perhaps hoping the situation wasnt so black as hed believed a moment before maybe it wasnt on the other hand maybe it was lieutenant general bell reached for the laudanum bottle again longing for the haze the drug could put between him and the pain of reality messengers from the front came back to him some on foot others on unicornback their news was all the same the northerners were pulling back from the forwardmost positions theyd won back to lines they might hold if john the listers men counterattacked one of the runners said some of the men on our left wing sir theyll building breastworks out of bodies are they bell said tonelessly and the soldier nodded bell muttered then bestirred himself and waved to his own corps of runners order my wing commanders here he told them we will confer and decide how to take up the attack in the morning that the army of franklin would take up the attack in the morning he had no doubt colonel florizel was the first wing commander to arrive he slid down off a unicorn and limped up to bell saluting he said reporting as ordered sir we have done everything flesh and blood can do you may rely on that very well colonel bell said are you badly hurt there this is an old wound sir florizel answered i went through everything today without a scratch though i lost a mount i aim to offer up a lamb to the lion god for thanksgiving i cant tell you how i got throughseemed like the crossbow bolts were thick enough to walk on can you go forward at sunrise bell asked florizel shrugged i dont have much to go forward with sir if you give the order well try before bell could reply benjamin the heated ham came riding up from the left bell asked him the same question benjamin shook his head go forward not a chance sir if the southrons strike us im not sure we can hold our ground weve been shot to pieces i dont know how else to say it last of all brigadier stephen the pickle a sourfaced man not far from bells age rode up from the right he looked even more sour when bell asked him if he could attack in the morning but he answered i have a couple of brigades that havent gone into the meatgrinder yet sir if you want to throw them at the southrons theyll advance but i dont know how many of them will come back again those lines are solid muster your men bell said his wave encompassed the three wing commanders muster your men all of you care for the wounded pile up the dead and make them ready for the fires we will go forward care for the wounded benjamin the heated ham exclaimed half the time we cant even drag them back out of range the southrons are too godsdamned alert and up too close for that they shoot anybody who tries to save a comrade or a friend they fight war as if it were nothing but murder bell said angrily they have been fighting that way ever since the marthasville campaign general hesmucets conduct during the siege was disgraceful yes sir benjamin said yes sir stephen the pickle echoed but if thats the way they choose to fight we have to fight the same way or well go under i know bell said that is one of the reasons i ordered this attack we have to show the enemy we still have the spirit to fight it out with him man to man colonel florizel said but how much good does that do us sir if he stays in his entrenchments and shoots us down by the thousands before we can close with him wouldnt we be better served making him attack us and pay the bigger butchers bill lieutenant general bell glared at him that is what joseph the gamecock was doing in the marthasville campaign before king geoffrey relieved him and appointed me in his place geoffrey wants men who can fight not soldiers who skulk in trenches we fought sir florizel said we fought as hard as flesh and blood can fight i already told you that when youre trying to carry a position like this one it doesnt matter how hard you fight though youll get chewed up any which way i do not wish a defeatist to command a wing colonel bell said coldly your tenure will be temporary that suits me fine sir florizel answered im not what youd call eager to tell my men to go forward and get cut to pieces attacking a position they havent got a chance in hells of taking we will attack at first light tomorrow bell declared we will attack and we will drive the southrons out of poor richard do you understand me do all of you understand me yes sir the wing commanders chorused unhappily very well then bell snapped you are dismissed go back to your men and ready them for the assault to come ready them to get their bums shot off somebody muttered bell glowered at each wing commander in turn all three of them glowered back he gestured peremptorily they turned to go by then it was well past midnight the moon sinking low a runner dashed back toward the officers shouting lieutenant general bell lieutenant general bell what is it bell braced for another disaster one of the wing commanders braced for the same thing growled oh gods what now sir the southrons have pulled out of poor richard the runner said their fires are burning but nobodys around em theyve gone theyve left by the gods bell said softly the field the field is ours he turned to the wing commanders dont you see men this this is victory colonel andy pointed north to the outer defenses of ramblerton here they come sir do you see them i cant very well not see them now can i doubting george asked more than a little irritably there are enough of them out there wouldnt you say hardriding jimmys troopers served as escorts and outriders for the rest of john the listers army they would have held off ned of the forests unicornriders had ned tried to harry johns footsoldiers during the withdrawal from poor richard to ramblerton but just as john had managed to knock bells footsoldiers back on their heels so hardriding jimmys men had warned ned that hitting them again wouldnt be a good idea no one had contested the withdrawal into ramblerton george spurred his unicorn forward andy rode alongside him and yet not quite perfectly level with him the perfect place for an adjutant george saw john the lister at the head of the long column of men in dirty often bloodstained gray tunics and pantaloons john saw him too and saluted returning the salute doubting george made it into a courtesy not only for john but also for the soldiers he commanded well done george shouted in a great voice well done you have given us time to prepare the defenses of ramblerton and to gather men from several provinces to hold those defenses now when the time is ripe we will drive the traitors far away a few of john the listers soldiers raised a ragged cheer most of them just kept on marching john pulled off the road and sat his unicorn in a field watching them pass by georgeand andyrode over beside him george saw what he knew hed see men whod been through the mill men with blank stunned faces men with bandages from wounds too minor to require them to take to the ambulance wagons theyd seen too much done too much to be of much use yet i had to leave a lot of the wounded behind john said unhappily we didnt have room in the wagons for all of them theyre in bells hands now so are our dead hell treat them with respect i give him that much george said we do the same for the northerners this has been a pretty clean war except now and again when it bumps up against the question of the blonds no sooner had he spoken than a blond corporal carrying a company standard tramped past the fellow was as grimy and batteredlooking as any of the detinans around him by his hollowcheeked face hed seen as much hard fighting as they had too looking at that face george could wonder why thered ever been a question about whether blonds were worth anything in war i suppose hell come after me now john said i dont see what else he can do its less than twenty miles from poor richard down here to ramblerton hes not about to go around the city and strike for the highlow not now not after the lick i gave him before he goes any farther south he has to take ramblerton hes welcome to try georges wave encompassed the works johns men were entering i cant promise him a very hospitable reception though john the lister seemed to take a good long look at the fortifications for the first time you havent been idle i will say that if bell tries to storm these works he wont take a man back to dothan alive thats the idea george said and now ive got the men to fill them up too counting your soldiers and the ones ive scraped up from garrisons all over franklin and cloviston fill them up hells john said when bell gets here we ought to go out and trample the son of a bitch we will george replied dont you doubt it for a minute when the time is ripe we will he set a hand on johns shoulder other thing is ill want you to get me the reports for your actions just as soon as you can ill send them on to marshal bart and to king avram if you dont get the rank amongst the regulars you deserve theres even less justice in the world than i always thought youll have em just as soon as i can write em up john said a little real rankd be welcome and i wont tell you anything different right now all ive got is a captains prospects once the war is over and if you look hard you can see the end of the war from here you can and i can doubting george said i dont think bell can yet well well show him when the time comes never you fear shouldnt be that tough sir john the lister said i left him holding the ground at poor richard but may the lion gods claws rip out my guts if i didnt tear the heart from his army he had to be mad attacking me across a couple of miles of open countrymad i tell you why didnt he just cut his own throat and save us the trouble hes not very smart he proved that in the marthasville campaign george said count joseph the gamecock didnt fight nearly so often but he gave us a much harder time can you imagine joseph charging you at poor richard not a chance john the lister said positively not a chance in the world youre rightcount joseph knows what hes doing come on into ramblerton doubting george said look at the works from the inside not just the outside youll see we have some little suspicion about what were doing too let my men go in first john said they bore the brunt of it lieutenant general bell may behells he is a godsdamned idiot but his soldiers still fight like sons of bitches next sign of quit i see in emll be the first no matter how stupid he was to attack us there they almost carried the position theyre detinans too theyre as stubborn as we are george said sometimes even the stubbornest fellows get licked though and well lick em yes sir john nodded he had heavy dark circles under his eyes how much sleep had he had the night before the night before that any at all george had his doubts well pour you a good full mug of spirits he said and well give you a nice soft bed and by the gods i dont care if bell invests this place five minutes after you lie downwe wont wake you till you get up on your own i expect well manage to keep ramblerton out of that bastards hands till then i thank you very m johns voice trailed off into an enormous yawn when at last he managed to close his mouth he laughed ruefully i suppose i just proved i could use a long winters nap didnt i lets say you gave me a pretty good hint doubting george might have added more to that but he noticed major alva riding by on an ass that looked almost as weary as john the lister alva waved but then remembered to salute after returning the courtesy george turned back to john how did that young whippersnapper serve you whippersnappers the word for him all right he kept going on and on about the godsdamned inward hypothesis till i wanted to kick him john replied i know makes me seasick just thinking about it george said but hes a pretty fair mage or i thought he was when i sent him to you john the lister nodded he is he is indeed i wouldnt try to deny it last night the traitors wizards were punishing us in the center bells men mightve broken through if they had i wouldnt he yawned again be here now but alva stopped em all by his lonesome he stopped em cold we held in the center and we ended up giving bell a thrashing thats what i was hoping you would do doubting george said johns wagons rattled past the general commanding wished he didnt have to hear the groans from the wounded men inside them he turned to john shall we go in now regardless of what he wished he would listen to them all the way into ramblerton yes sir john the lister said he proved too worn to look very hard at the fortifications from the inside george took him back to his headquarters gave him the promised glass of spirits and led him to a comfortable bed john lay down without bothering to take off his boots he fell asleep before george left the room a couple of hours later after listening to preliminary reports from some of johns officers george got in touch with marshal bart by scryer good day lieutenant general bart said peering out of the crystal ball at george he was a stubby man not very tall and not very wide with a closetrimmed dark beard havent heard from you for a while whats on your mind as of now marshal john the listers a regular captain after what he just did to bell and the army of franklin i believe he deserves better george summed up what had happened at poor richard bell was fool enough to charge at him over open ground bart said when he finished george nodded marshal bart shrugged even so youre right that was well done and no mistake a disaster there would have hurt us badly tell john ill recommend his promotion to brigadier of the regulars to king avram what marshal bart recommended king avram would approve doubting george whistled softly it wasnt that john the lister didnt deserve to be a brigadier in detinas regular army he did not even george could doubt that but raising him to brigadier from captain in one fell swoop george had expected bart to make him a colonel and then to promote him to brigadiers rank later if he continued to give good service ill tell him tomorrow i think george said bart frowned most of the time he looked like the most ordinary detinan in the kingdom anybody who thought he was ordinary though did so at his peril why not tell him now the marshal asked in tones suggesting george had better have a good reason and george did because hes liable to sleep till tomorrow sir he just got in to ramblerton and i dont think hes shut his eyes the last two days oh bart nodded all right yes when youre that worn down you dont care about anything hed probably strangle you if you woke him and he might not remember anything you told him true enough and if he did strangle me i couldnt very well tell him again er right marshal bartthe first marshal detina had had in a long lifetime the grandest soldier in the landhad no more idea what to do with doubting georges foolishness than did colonel andy unlike andy bart had the privilege of changing the subject do you expect bell to follow john up toward ramblerton yes sir george got down to business again i dont know what else he can do sir about the only other thing would be to turn around and march back up to dothan and i cant imagine bell doing that as long as hes got soldiers who will follow his orders hell take them into battle if he attacked around marthasville if he attacked at poor richard hell attack anywhere bart nodded again i think youre right as soon as he gets up there lieutenant general i want you to hit him with everything youve got i will hit him sir you dont need to worry about that george answered as soon as im ready i will hit him a lick the likes of which he has never known before dont waste time bart told him hit him just as soon as you can do not give him the chance to slip around you smash him send him back to dothan with his tail between his legs send him back there whether he wants to go or not sir i will strike him when i am ready i will not let him get away george promised the army of franklin will not slip by me it will not get down into cloviston you may rely on that bell has the last northern army in the field that can still maneuver and cause us trouble bart said worriedly i do not want us embarrassed not when the war looks like being won he commanded all the southron armies he had the right to say what he said that made it no less galling to doubting george sir when he comes here and i am ready i will strike him he repeated i want him smashed like a bug under a boot marshal bart said i want him i want him suppressed by the thunderers pizzle a couple of years earlier duke edward of arlington had used that contemptuous word in ordering the army of southern parthenia forward to smash king avrams soldiers at the second battle of cow jog john the hierophant whod commanded avrams men then was off in the east these days with the equally luckless general guildenstern chasing blond savages bart took more than a little pleasure in applying the term to false king geoffreys army of franklin sir when the time is ripe i will suppress him doubting george said he wont beat me and he wont get away hed better not bart still sounded fretful george sighed he feared the marshal would go right on nagging him even though a province and a half lay between them gods damn crystal balls anyhow george thought unhappily more times than captain gremio cared to remember hed seen a soldier hit square in the chest with a crossbow quarrel very often the man would stagger on for a few paces and perhaps even fight a little before realizing he was dead and falling over never till now had gremio seen an army take a similar blow but if after the battle in front of poor richard the army of franklin wasnt a dead man walking then gremio had never seen any such thing he wished he hadnt he wished he werent seeing such a thing now but he wasnt blind and couldnt make himself so he knew what his eyes told him somehow like one of those men shot in the chest the army of franklin kept lurching forward gremio trudged south down a muddy road south toward ramblerton since the battle of poor richard he commanded not just his company but the whole regiment that wasnt from any enormous virtue on his part he was the senior captain left alive and not badly wounded and colonel florizel as the senior colonel alive and not badly wounded was for the moment still leading the whole wing commanding the regiment felt like a smaller promotion than it would have before the fight by poor richard anyhow only a couple of companies worth of men were still fit for duty sergeant thisbe led gremios old company thisbe wasnt the only sergeant in charge of a company in the army of franklin eitherfar from it ask you something sir thisbe said now coming up alongside of gremio if youre rash enough to think i know answers go ahead he replied if you dont sir who does thisbe asked the answer to that all too probably was no one before gremio could say as much the underofficer went on once we get down to ramblerton captain what are we going to do there why capture the town of course storm the fortifications slay the southrons and drive away the ones we dont slay go sweeping south into cloviston well see the highlow river in a couple of weeks dont you think that was what lieutenant general bell had had in mind when he left dothan for franklin maybe if hed crushed john the lister at summer mountain instead of letting him get away his dream might have come true now it wasnt even a bitter joke not any more sergeant thisbe sent gremio a reproachful look that isnt even a little bit funny sir the way things turned out the underofficer stopped yes the way things turned out gremio liked that it let them talk about what theyd just been through without really talking about it if thisbe had called it the catastrophe that would have been just as true and more descriptive but they both would have had to remember the dreadful fighting in the trenches and their failure to dislodge the southrons from around that farmhouse even their mages had failed if that wasnt catastrophe for the north what was but gremio had to mention some of what had happened there some of what had left him in charge of a regiment and thisbe a company half a dozen brigadiers dead sergeant more wounded gods only know how many colonels and majors and captains and lieutenants and soldiers sir dont forget soldiers thisbe said im not likely to gremio answered we lost one man in four in the fight by the river of death thats what kept thraxton the braggart from properly besieging rising rockwed got shot to pieces here weve lost a bigger portion than that we must have but lieutenant general bell is going on thraxton should have gone on thisbe pointed out yes we had the enemy licked and he held back gremio agreed did we lick john the lister bell says we did but i doubt it and speaking of doubting how many more men has doubting george got in ramblerton they arent licked most of them havent fought at all theyre just waiting for us thisbe muttered something it sounded like licking their chops gremio thought about asking then changed his mind he didnt really want to know licking their chops seemed much too apt for comfort but then thisbe spoke aloud everything you said is true sir every word of it so what can we do when we get to ramblerton i dont know sergeant i just dont know gremio replied i dont see anything lieutenant general bell must or we wouldnt be going forward up till now gremio had always been a man who wanted to know answers hed wanted to learn what would happen next before it did that way he could try to wring the most advantage from whatever it was now now he didnt want to know all he wanted to do was go on putting one weary foot in front of the other as long as he did that he was doing his duty no one could possibly complain about him and whatever was going to happenwould happen every so often he marched past a wrecked wagon or a twisted corpse in gray proof the army of franklin had hit hard as well as being hit hard he needed the reminders whenever he thought back to the battle of poor richard he remembered nothing but northerners falling all around him cold clammy mud came in between the sole and upper of both shoes now still he remained luckier than a lot of his men some of them had managed to take shoes from the bodies of southrons during the fight many more though were barefoot and im ever so much luckier than the ones who didnt come out of the fight gods damn lieutenant general bell he yawned he didnt really want to keep marching he wanted to sleep with luck for weeks as happened so often in war what he wanted and what he got werent going to match one of those bodies by the side of the road was neither southron nor gremio realized dead it was a northern soldier whod fallen out of the column and fallen asleep because he couldnt take another step exhausted as gremio was he had a harder time blaming the soldier than he would have otherwise come on men thisbes voice and demeanor didnt seem to have changed at all we can do it we get where were going well rest then where are we going gremio wondered oh toward ramblertonhe knew that full well but what would the army of franklin do when it got there what could it do when it got there gremio had had no answers for sergeant thisbe and he had no answers for himself either here came colonel florizel now mounted on yet another new unicorn since his sudden promotion from regimental to wing commander maybe he knew more of what if anything was in lieutenant general bells mind gremio waved to him and called out colonel ask you something sir i sound the way thisbe did asking me he thought oh hello captain gremio yes what is it florizel remained the picture of a northern gentleman sir will we make ramblerton today i dont think so captain florizel replied we are wearyi know how weary i amand we have many walking wounded and we got off to a late start this morning i expect us to camp on the road when the sun goes down and then reach the provincial capital tomorrow thank you sir gremio supposed he really should have thanked bell not that he felt like it hed figured the commanding general would push on through the night regardless of the condition of his men why not bell had pushed ahead at poor richard regardless of how many soldiers fell but colonel florizel hadnt finished yet there is something i want you to attend to most particularly tonight captain you and all regimental commanders in my wing he grimaced at that had things gone better neither his status nor gremios would have been so exalted what is it sir gremio had rarely seen florizel so serious post plenty of pickets post them well south of wherever we do encamp if the southrons sally from ramblerton they must notthey must nottake us unawares they will destroy us if they do destroy us do you hear me yes sir i agree completely ill attend to it gremio promised he eyed his longtime superior his new wing commander with more than a little curiosity impelled by it he risked a more abstract question what do you think our chances are sir florizel had been hardly less eager to charge ahead than bell himself bell hadnt learned much about restraint since taking command of the army of franklin had florizel gremio waited to see the baron from palmetto province plucked at his white beard i think our chances are he began and then rode away without finishing the sentence that answered gremios question too they did camp by the side of the road about two thirds of the way down from poor richard to ramblerton mindful of colonel florizels orders gremio set an unusual number of pickets south of his regiment that done he wondered what he needed to take care of next hed commanded the regiment for less than two days now as florizel had he went from one company to the next making sure everything was in as good an order as it could be he was sure florizel had more to do than that the colonel had surely kept records and talked with other regimental commanders but no one was there to tell gremio just what those other duties were no one who knew was left alive and unwounded except for florizel himself and he was busy somewhere else sergeant thisbe had the same sort of trouble figuring out everything a company commander was supposed to do the underofficer though could at least ask gremio after gremio had answered the third or fourth question he said you see sergeant you should have let me make you a lieutenant after all you would have known more about what youre doing now i never wanted to be a lieutenant and you know it sir thisbe answered i dont want to do the job im doing either but i dont see that ive got much choice right now i dont see that you do either gremio said im proud to command the regiment but this isnt how i wanted to do it too many men dead feels as though our hopes have been shot dead too doesnt it yes sir i wouldnt have said that but its in my mind too thisbe replied the underofficer looked around to make sure nobody but gremio was in earshot i wish we were marching back to dothan not down towards ramblerton cant be helped sergeant gremio said and thisbe nodded gremio yawned he went on the other thing is were both bone weary this whole army is bone weary things may look brighter once we get a little rest maybe i hope so sir thisbe still sounded dubious other question is when will we ever get a little rest well sleep tonightwell sleep tonight like so many dead menbut then well march again and after that after that its ramblerton i know theres no help for it not unless wed want to go back toward dothan without orders or give up to the southrons the first chance we get im no quitter sir thisbe said i aim to stick as long as anybody else does and then half an hour longer but i wish i saw some kind of way of getting a happy ending to the story after the war gremio began no sir the sergeant gave a shake of the head after the war is after the war thats not what im talking about now im talking about a happy ending to this campaign and to the whole fight oh gremio shrugged in that case i dont know what to tell you he did sleep like a dead man that night and woke the next morning still feeling like one the nasty tea the cooks brewed up pried his eyelids apart and lent him a mournful interest in life come on men thisbe called when the soldiers moved out after a meager breakfast well go on to ramblerton and well whip the southrons there thats right gremio said well chase the southrons all the way down to the highlow river we walloped em at poor richard by the gods well wallop em again he did a barristers best to mask his pessimism after every other fight in which hed taken part the men of his companythe men of the whole regimenthad always been ready for more no matter how roughly the southrons had handled them hed expected them to raise a cheer now they didnt they got to their feet and they marched they didnt complain but something had gone out of them maybe it was hope whatever it was gremio wished he could put it back into the soldiers to be able to do that though he would have had to find hope or something like it within himself as well try as he would he couldnt hope or no hope the army of franklin reached ramblerton about noon the next day the wan sun of late autumn low in the north behind lieutenant general bells men sent their long shadows toward the capital of franklin at bells orders relayed by trumpeters and runners his blueclad soldiers formed a line along a ridge not far north of the city as soon as gremios men reached their assigned place they started digging trenches and throwing up breastworks in front of them bell gremio knew looked down his nose at fieldworks gremio didnt care hed seen how many lives they saved and urged the diggers on while they worked he got his own first good look at ramblertons fortifications had he had much hope left it would have died then vi ned of the forest had been up close to ramblerton before hed never had so many men at his back as he did now all the same hed never felt less cheerful about his armys chances whats bell going to do biff he demanded pointing south what can bell do going up against that gods damn me if i know lord ned his regimental commander replied those arent just fieldworks thats real fortcraft on display there real castles real stone walls engines everywhere ditches out in front of everything so we cant even get at it let alone over it i know ned scowled and kicked at the muddy ground under his feet when i joined up with the army of franklin i reckoned it was pretty goodsized i figured it could do something worth doing but its just asking to kill itself if it goes up against works like those there other side of that copper is the army of franklins a deal smaller now than it was before it got out of poor richard colonel biffle said what the hells was bell thinking going at that place that way i told him i could flank the southrons out ned said i told him and told him he didnt want to listenfools never do want to listen he stole half our men too the son of a bitch he thought he could smash right on through and look what it got him me i dont much fancy the way the footsoldiers look right about now biffle said they havent got a hells of a lot of spunk in em if the southrons were to sally from those forts he didnt go on he didnt need to go on weve got to keep em too busy to even think of it ned said i hope we can bring it off i truly do colonel biffle noticed his unhappy tones you hope sir he said as long as i can remember youve made things happen now you just hope they do gloomily ned nodded you saw what happened when we bumped up against those southron unicornriders theyve got crossbows we cant hope to match only ones we can get are the ones we take from their dead we dont make anything of the sort our ownselves we ought to but we dont we can only use the bolts we get from dead southrons too biffle said i know another even gloomier nod from ned theyre clever bastards no two ways about it these crossbows have a skinnier groove than the regular sort so our standard quarrels wont fit takes a sneaky son of a bitch to think of that sure does biffle agreed and sighed well the southrons have folks like that and thats the truth we could use some of our own right about now and thats the truth too we could use a lot of things right about now ned of the forest went no further saying anything more wouldnt do any good lieutenant general bell had courage and to spare asking the gods to equip him with a real working set of brains to go with it was a prayer unlikely to be answered people had been asking for that for a long time with no luck you know what worries me most lord ned the regimental commander said tell me ned hoped it would be the same thing he worried about most himself that way no new worries would go on his stack biffle said what worries me is bell still thinks we won the fight at poor richard we advanced afterwards and the southrons left behind a lot of their wounded and that makes it a triumph to him he doesnt look at the state the armys in that came close to matching neds concern about bell but didnt quite he looked toward ramblertons formidable works once more you dont reckon he wants to try and storm this town do you very few things had ever frightened ned of the forest the idea of hurling the army of franklin at ramblertons fortifications came closer than anything that had happened lately hed better not biffle exclaimed if he does you have to talk him out of itthat or bang him over the head with a rock one i will ned said grimly by the lion gods tail tuft i dont know how he can do anything for a little while weve got a colonel commanding a wing captains in charge of regiments sergeants leading companies nobody knows what the devils hes supposed to be doing he eyed the scraggly ranks of bells army then laughed a bitter laugh he likely figures were laying siege to ramblerton i wish we were biffle said i wish we could so do i both way ned replied but i know were not i hope bell does too i better go find out i reckon he swung up onto his unicorn and rode off to find bells headquarters the general commanding had set himself up in a farmhouse a little behind the line as ned rode up bell was talking to a young major you should think yourself a made man heading up a brigade at your tender age thank you sir the junior officer said if its all the same to you though i wish i were still secondincommand in my old regiment id know what i was doing thereand we wouldnt have so many men above me dead we go on lieutenant general bell said we have to go on what else can we do turn around and run back up to dothan not likely pride rang in his voice when he tossed his head to show his scorn for the southrons he caught sight of ned of the forest you may go major i have business to talk with lieutenant general ned here the major saluted and hurried away ned saluted too as usual he wasted no time on small talk what are we going to do now that were here he demanded very much as an afterthought he added sir i aim to give john the lister and doubting george another whipping of the same sort as they had at poor richard bell declared grandly one more whipping like that and you wont have any army left yourself ned said his voice harsh and blunt instead of answering right away bell took out his little bottle of laudanum pulled the stopper with his teeth and swigged ahh he said that makes the world seem a better place no matter what it seems like it isnt ned said even more bluntly than before im going to ask you again sir and this time i expect a straight answer what do you aim to do next something seemed to leach out of bell he tried to gather himself to hold on to the force of will that ned had seen failing him and succeeded to a degree lieutenant general i am going to make the southrons come out of their works if they intend to fight us if they come out things can go wrong for them i dont intend to storm the entrenchments around ramblerton i can see we would be unlikely to carry them the men feeling as they do about attacking forts ned of the forest considered if he were a footsoldier he wouldnt have cared to try to storm ramblertons fortifications either who in his right mind wanted to get killed to no purpose but bells plan if that was what it was struck him as being about as good as anyone could want for in the army of franklins present battered state all right sir he said dont reckon weve got much hope trying anything else but i want to warn you about something and whats that bell rumbled how do you have any business warning your commanding officer somebodyd better ned said you have to listen too dont go splitting things up we havent got the men for it we havent got room to make any mistakes not any at all you understand what im saying i have led us south for two hundred miles now bell replied i have had plenty of underlings make mistakesand no i am not speaking of you so you need not take offense i do not believe i have made any substantial blunders in this campaign you took half my men away from me when i was trying to outflank the southrons ned exclaimed if id had those men i mightve broken through and made john the lister fall back without any need for a fight at poor richard i needed those men no less than you did bell said the battle was long and hard enough even with their aid without it our arms might not have triumphed what makes you reckon they did ned asked bell looked at him as if hed started speaking the language of one of the blond tribes instead of plain and simple detinan we held the field when the fight was done the commanding general said ned might have been an idiot child to doubt him we advanced afterwards we took charge of the wounded men the southrons abandoned in their retreat if that is not victory what would you call it by all the rules they taught in the officers collegium at annasville bell was right ned of the forest knew about those rules and all other formalities of the military art only by hearsay but he knew what he saw with his own eyes he had no doubt at all there if this here is a victory sir then wed better not see another one and thats all ive got to say about that he saluted with as much precision as he could muster then turned on his heel and strode away from lieutenant general bell here now the general commanding called after him you come back at onceat once i sayand explain yourself do you say we failed to win a victory at poor richard do you how dare you ned pretended not to hear bell couldnt very well run after him after all as he neared his unicorn bells complaints grew fainter he mounted and rode off once in the saddle he didnt have to listen any more but the armys still stuck with bell he thought unhappily then even more unhappily he shrugged if you were in charge of things now what would you do different he asked himself he found no answer too late to worry about that the damage had long since been done well colonel biffle asked when ned got back among his unicornriders well biff the good news is we dont have to try and take ramblerton all by our lonesome ned replied the bad news isor maybe its good news too to the hells with me if i knowwe wait here outside of ramblerton till the southrons decide theyre good and ready to hit us what do we do then biffle asked dubiously hope we can lick em ned said think we can the regimental commander inquired even more dubiously dont know ned of the forest answered what i think is wed better are you going to tell me im wrong if were in our trenches and theyre trying to come at us well weve maybe got some kind of chance anyways maybe biffle didnt sound as if he believed it then he shrugged odds are better than us going up against those forts i expect odds of anythingd be better than that dont i know it ned said it could work i suppose if john the lister and doubting george figure weve got no fight left in us it could work but by the lion gods claws i hate laying my hopes on the off chance that the sons of bitches im up against dont know what theyre doing why colonel biffle said been plain for a goodish while now that we dont why should they be any different ned laughed biffles words held altogether too much truth long odds biff he said long odds indeed well weve had long odds before and licked the southrons anyways biffle said this past summer down in great river province i know i know and maybe we can do it again ned said somehow or other weve got to do it again you reckon we can he waited for a long time colonel biffle stood there without saying a word ned of the forest coughed telling him he would have an answer reluctantly the regimental commander replied you had it right lord ned weve got to lick em anything weve got to do we will how ned neither minced nor wasted words all he got by way of a reply this time was a shrug he coughed again louder even more reluctantly colonel biffle said gods damn me if i know maybe the southrons really will make a mistake theyd better ned of the forest sounded as if he held his regimental commander responsible for it both men looked toward the works in front of ramblerton even at this distance ned could see southrons in gray moving back and forth in those works even at this distance he seemed to see a whole great swarm of southrons moving back and forth how many of those bastards are there he grumbled too many biffle replied which startled another laugh out of ned the colonel continued you put any southronsany southrons mind youin a province thats sworn loyalty to good king geoffrey and thats too fornicating many true enough ned said itll take a good deal of pounding to be rid of em though now his gaze went to captain watson who was attacking a brokendown dartthrower with a hammer and a set of wrenches the young officer in charge of neds engines was as much a mechanic as a leader of fighting men as much a mechanic as any southron that made him all the more valuable to the northern cause had geoffrey had more men like watson loyal to him the north would have been in better shape ned saw that after a little while though he also saw the north would not have been the land he knew were that so how to win though try as he would ned could not see that once again rollant looked out at the northern army from the security of strong fortifications up at poor richard bells men had done everything they could to overwhelm the southrons works here rollant turned to smitty do you suppose belld be dumb enough to try and attack us again i hope so smitty answered at once if he does well kill every last one of the bastards hes got left we wont get hurt doing it either thats how it looks to me too the blond said i was wondering if maybe i was wrong not this time smitty said with a grin rollant glared funny you and your smart mouth i ought to set you chopping extra firewood for that even as he spoke he knew he wouldnt by smittys impudent grin he must have known the same thing have mercy your corporalship he exclaimed ill be good i really will i wont give you any more trouble not ever rollant laughed do you know what you remind me of no your illustrious corporalship but i expect youre going to tell me so thats all right with a snort rollant said you remind me of a fasttalking serf trying to flimflam his way out of trouble with his liege lord i always used to wish i could talk that way when i got in trouble on baron ormerods estate it never used to work for me though from behind them sergeant joram growled it shouldnt work for this fasttalking son of a bitch either rollant and smitty both jumped they hadnt heard joram come up the sergeant went on smitty go chop firewood go chop lots of it i want to see your hands bleeding when you bring it back go on get out of here smitty disappeared as if made to vanish by magecraft he knew there were times when he could argue with sergeant joram and times when he couldnt he also knew which was which and that this was plainly one of the latter joram folded massive arms across his broad chest he eyed rollant flimflam is it he said sergeant rollant asked youve made a good underofficer joram said truth to tell youve made a better one than anybody figured you would but you cant be soft on somebody just because you like him and hes a funny fellow i havent meant to be soft on anybody sergeant rollant said by his own standards that was true by jorams it probably wasnt joram was fair he treated everybody under him the same waymiserably maybe not he said now but i think you go too easy on smitty and i know the two of you were pals before you made corporal pals not for the first time rollant wondered about that could a blond and an ordinary detinan be pals didnt too much history stand in the way rollant still thought so that he wasnt quite sure any more said something about smittyand something about how long hed lived in the south ask you something sergeant he said go ahead joram growled when are we going to get out there and smash the traitors to the hells with me if i know whenever doubting george gives the order the sergeant leered when he does i promise youll hear about it yes sergeant i know that but even when we just had the little army john the lister led we put the fear of the gods in bells men now weve got a lot more soldiers rollant waved back toward ramblerton weve got all these extra men but bell doesnt even have what he hit us with before because we chewed him up so now maybe we ought to do some hitting of our own its not up to me joram said its up to doubting george when he tells us to march we march when he tells us to stay where we are we stay when he tells you you can complain go ahead and complain until he tells you you can complainshut up gods damn it what do free detinans ever do but complain rollant returned and if im not a free detinan what am i that of course was the question of the war between the provinces if a blond wasnt a free detinan what was he northerners insisted he was a serf and could never be anything else king avram disagreed with that and had the southrons on his side but even avram didnt seem convinced blonds would become ordinary detinans the instant the north gave up the fight jorams heavyfeatured facethe gods might have made him on purpose to be a sergeantclouded up but he had an answer that applied to rollant even if it didnt to blonds in general what are you by the thunderers balls youre a corporaland im a sergeant if i tell you to swallow your bellyaching youd better swallow it on account of ive got the right to tell you to have you got that yes sergeant rollant saidthe only answer he could give joram recognized his right to be a corporal as soon as that right was recognized as soon as a blonds right to pick up a crossbow or a pike and go fight the northerners was recognized everything else would follow and if grand duke geoffrey wanted to deny it and call himself king in the north too bad for him he had left only the army of southern parthenia and the army of franklin marshal bart had one by the throat while the other waited here for whatever doubting george would do to it when we do whip lieutenant general bell what will geoffrey have left here in the east rollant wondered aloud nothing i can see thats the idea joram said the son of a bitch is a traitor when hes done losing he ought to go up on a cross the buzzards can peck out his eyes for all i care were going to smash those bastards smash em good dont you worry about that not even a little bit itll happen nobody knows when yet but it will he thumped rollant on the back hard enough to stagger him then trudged on down the trench line boy smitty said if i gave him half that hard a time hed have my guts for garters and youd deserve it too rollant said i thought you went off to cut firewood so did joram smitty answered i just went into the little jog in the trench where we ease ourselves thats one good thing about cold weather anyhowthe little jog doesnt stink the way it would in summer hardly any flies either button yours rollant said smitty looked down rollant snickered that was the sort of joke schoolboys played on each othernot that hed ever been a schoolboy think youre pretty godsdamned funny dont you smitty said indignantly what i think is youd better go cut that wood before joram sees youre still around rollant said hes righti let you get away with all kinds of things but he wont and you know it nodding gloomily smitty went off to do his work rollant looked out at the northerners lines again they werent within crossbow range or even within range of the stone and dartthrowers that could outshoot any handheld weapon they had their own fortified positions on the hills in front of ramblerton a couple of miles north of doubting georges outworks all right theyre there now what the hells do they do rollant wondered what would i do if i were bell one answer to that question immediately came to mind id go somewhere high and jump off could bell jump with only one leg one more thing rollant didnt know but he wouldnt have wanted to go around leaving pieces of himself on different battlefields as the northern general commanding had done tiny as ants in the distance blueclad traitors went about their business as soldiers they werent much different from their southron counterparts as men as men they were welcome to the hottest firepits in the seven hells as far as rollant was concerned he knew they wished him the same and would do their best to send him there if hed cared about what northern detinans thought he never would have run away from baron ormerods plantation night fell early this time of year before long all rollant could see of the enemy was the light from his campfires over there common soldiers were also grumbling because their underofficers made them chop firewood one thing was different over there though none of the northerners underofficers was a blond lieutenant griff came up the line everything all right corporal he asked he spoke thickly up at poor richard a shortsword had laid one cheek open the black stitches the healers had put in to close the wound made him look like an outlaw or a pirate instead of the mildmannered fellow hed seemed before even when they came out hed be scarred for the rest of his days everythings fine sir rollant answered how are you he hadnt expected to sound so anxious griff had made a better company commander than most of his men thought he would after captain cephas got killed his voice still broke now and again but he had plenty of nerve and he looked out for his soldiers the way a good officer would now he managed a mostly onesided grin ill do he said no sign of fever in the woundits healing not festering that was my biggest worry im not what youd call fond of soaking a rag in spirits and pressing it on the cut ow rollant said sympathetically does that really do any good seems like a lot of hurt for not much help some of them say it does so im doing it griff replied i asked one of them if hed do it himself and he showed me a clean scar and said he had done it not much i could say to that rollant thought of raw spirits on raw flesh i dont know sir i think id almost rather have the fever lieutenant griff shook his head no that can kill this just hurts ill get through it unlike a lot of detinans he didnt brag or bluster about his bravery he just displayed it pointing to the fires north of ramblerton he said i wish lieutenant general george would turn us loose against the traitors ive been saying the same thing why wont he do you think rollant asked griff shrugged how can i say im not doubting george im not going to go back into ramblerton and ask him not even colonel nahath could get away with that george would throw him out on his ear maybe hes waiting for more meni hear another wing may be coming from the far side of the great river why does he need them rollant asked we stopped the army of franklin all by ourselves and george has a lot of soldiers here who didnt go north with john the lister we ought to be able to ride roughshod over the traitors smilingagain lopsidedlygriff said well rollant no one who listened to you would ever get the idea that blonds are shy about mixing it up he means that for praise rollant reminded himself and hes my company commander if i bop him over the head with something it will only land me in trouble you do have to remember though attacking a position is a lot harder than defending one griff went on cheerfully oblivious to the way hed angered rollant we would have to pay the price of winkling the northerners out of their trenches mm yes sir thats true even if rollant was annoyed with griff he couldnt deny the officer made sense still and all weve already got a whole lot more men than the traitors do corporal if you want to go petition the general commanding for an immediate attack you have my permission to do so griff said rollant tried to imagine himself marching into doubting georges headquarters and doing just that it wasnt that george didnt know who he was george did he was the man whod ultimately approved rollants promotion to corporal up in peachtree province but that made things worse not better it was only likely to mean hed come down on rollant harder than he would have otherwise no thank you sir rollant said hastily lieutenant griff nodded as if hed expected no different response odds were he hadnt and yet now that rollant thought about it more than a few detinans would have taken griff up on his offer detinans were convinced they were all just as good all just as smart as anybody else to a common soldier only a little luck separated himself from doubting george why wouldnt the commanding general want to listen to him i sometimes wonder what besides my hair and my blue eyes separates me from detinans rollant thought there it is i think george knows more about fighting a war than i do and down deep a lot of them dont believe any such thing do i have good sense or do they his shoulders went up and down in a shrug of his own considering some of the things generals on both sides had done during this war the answer wasnt altogether clear any which way griff said i dont think youll have to wait very long rollant looked north toward the traitors campfires once more do i really want to try to storm those lines he wondered and nodded to himself by the gods i really do to lieutenant griff he said one word good lieutenant general bell stared south toward ramblerton the stare was hungry and frustrated the stare of a hound eyeing a big juicy chunk of meat hung too high for it to reach here and there bell could see grayclad southrons marching along the works that defended the capital of franklin in the distance the enemy soldiers might have been so many gray lice crawling along the back of some huge hairless animal getting rid of lice in the field was never easy bell knew that all too well hed been lousy himself a time or two getting rid of the southrons in ramblerton looked harder yet hed told ned of the forest he wouldnt try to storm the place he didnt see how he could not when doubting georges men outnumbered his and had the advantage of those redoubtable redoubts such things hadnt stopped him at poor richard of course but these were in a different class altogether hed expected george to try to take advantage of southron numbers and attack him but that hadnt happened yet bell was beginning to wonder if it would waiting seemed an anticlimax and a squalid one at that his right leg itched he settled his crutch in his armpit and reached down to scratch only when his good hand met nothing but air did he remember he had no right leg though itching was the least of what it did for once though apparent sensation from his missing member didnt appall him didnt send him grabbing for the tiny bottle of laudanum given what hed been thinking hed wondered if he was lousy again realizing he wasnt came as no small relief a messenger saluted and waited to be noticed when bell nodded the man said sir brigadier benjamin would like to speak to you oh he would would he bell considered he didnt care to be lectured or harangued as wing and brigade commanders had been in the habit of doing since this campaign began on the other hand benjamin the heated ham hadnt bothered him so much as several other officers most of them now dead as if bell were a god he inclined his head in acquiescence he may come forward benjamin saluted with all due courtesy he was politeness personified when he inquired sir may i ask you a question go ahead bell replied i dont necessarily know that ill answer it oh i hope you do sir benjamin said earnestly you see its important he paused for dramatic effect hed got his nickname for bad acting and he still lived up to it bell half expected him to clasp his hands together in front of his chest he didnt but he did send bell an imploring look well ask bell knew he sounded gruff he didnt care he had no patience for melodrama now benjamin the heated ham at last came to the point all right sir what i want to know is now that weve come this far what are we going to do what can we do facing those works he pointed toward ramblerton ned of the forest had wanted to know the same thing have they no confidence in me bell wondered as he had to ned he said well wait here for doubting george to assail our lines when he does well beat him back sir if what the spies and prisoners say is true the southrons have a hells of a lot more men than we do benjamin observed bell glowered he knew that but didnt care to be reminded of it he said everyone keeps telling me this army doesnt care to fight away from the protection of entrenchments do you claim the men will not fight even when they enjoy that protection no sir i never said any such thing benjamin the heated ham backtracked in a hurry what precisely did you say then bell inquired with icy courtesy sir this army will fight like a pack of mad bastards the men will do what you tell them to do or theyll die trying if poor richard didnt teach you that nothing ever will benjamin said bell realized that wasnt exactly praise for his ordering the army to fight at poor richard but his wing commander hurried on before he could show his displeasure it all depends on what you order them to do if too many godsdamned southrons come at them theyre not going to win regardless of whether theyre in entrenchments or not do you believe doubting george has that many men brigadier lieutenant general bell said i for one do not i dont know for certain sir benjamin answered all i know for certain is like i said hes got a lot more than we do regardless of which i still maintain the southrons are a cowardly lot bell said now benjamin the heated ham stirred but the commanding general overrode him consider brigadier the southrons have outnumbered us all along yet we have advanced about two hundred miles against them and they have yet to dare stand against us whenever we have faced them in the field we have defeated them benjamin stirred again again bell refused to notice we whipped them at poor richard they yielded not only the battlefield but also prisoners and wounded if that doesnt prove them cowards i dont know what would sir you werent up at the front at poor richard benjamin said no offense to you with your wounds you couldnt be but the southrons arent cowards if you dont believe me ask patrick the cleaver or for gods sake john or john of barsoom or provincial prerogative or otho the troll or how can i ask them they are dead have you a crystal ball that will reach to mount panamgam beyond the fields we know bell asked no sir thats my point they wouldnt be dead if the southrons were cowards cowards dont kill half a dozen brigadiers in one fight if thats your point its a feeble one bell said it wasnt the enemys courage that killed our officers it was their own they closed with the foe and gloriously fell in service to their kingdom have it however you like benjamin the heated ham said but i wouldnt be doing my duty if i didnt warn you youd be making a mistake by counting on the southrons to play the craven thank you brigadier bell soundedand feltanything but grateful you have passed on your warning i shall bear it in mind now that you have performed this duty you are dismissed yes sir benjamin saluted and strode off stiffbacked and proud lieutenant general bell muttered something pungent under his breath he was sick to death of officers stalking away from him hed seen altogether too much of it on this campaign some of the brigadiers whod neglected military courtesy had paid for their bad manners with their lives but ned of the forest and benjamin the heated ham were still very much around bell couldnt even punish them for their insolence after the fight at poor richard the army of franklin had lost so many commanders he couldnt afford to sack any more things creaked bad enough as they were the general commanding remembered the losses he conveniently forgot that his orders at poor richard had led to them he also forgot that those orders might have had something to do with the surviving officers lack of confidence in him as far as he was concerned they had no business behaving any way but respectfully king geoffrey had put him in charge of the army of franklin and he had every intention of leading it to glory somehow he shifted his weight on his crutches that proved a mistakehis ruined left shoulder and arm screamed at him he took out the little bottle of laudanum yanked the stopper with his teeth and gulped down the drug that helped keep him going glory didnt concern itself with ruined shoulders and missing legs a man who stopped to think about the cost would never find the true magnificence of battle whether such a man might find victory was another question that never occurred to bell little by little as the laudanum took hold he floated away from his painwracked body as long as that wrecked arm and missing leg didnt torment him he could forget all about them just as he forgot about other inconveniences on the way to the victory that surely lay ahead one of those inconveniences was doubting georges army he couldnt very well attack it if it stayed in the works of ramblerton oh he could but even he doubted that that would have a happy ending he needed to lure that army out of those works if he was to have any chance of beating it there he and his subordinate commanders agreed but how hed hoped simply sitting in front of the city and making his army a tempting target would suffice evidently not he needed some new stratagem to make sure the southrons came forth what though what could he do that he wasnt already doing suddenly he snapped his fingers his right hand had not forgotten its cunningand he chuckled at the cunning his brains showed too despite or perhaps he thought even because of all the laudanum he had to take runner he called yes sir the closest messenger said i need to speak to ned of the forest just as soon as you can bring him here bell replied yes sir the messenger said again but then in a puzzled voice wasnt he here not too long ago what if he was bell demanded i am the commanding general and i am entitled to summon the officers of my army if i need to confer with them would you care to quarrel with that corporal uh no sir the messenger said hastily bell fixed upon him the stare that had led to his being compared to the lion god the messenger left in a hurry bell had to wait a while before ned of the forest returned for one thing the unicornriders camped at some little distance from the rest of the men in the army of franklin for another bell suspected ned of being slow to obey orders on purpose ned was still fuming because the general commanding had pulled back some of his riders to fight with the rest of the army at poor richard well too bad for ned lieutenant general bell said a couple of the runners standing not far away sent him curious looks but none of them had the nerve to ask a question as far as bell was concerned that was as it should be in due course ned of the forest did ride up slowly and deliberately he dismounted from his unicorn he made a small production of tethering the animal to a tree only after hed done that did he nod to bell what can i do for you sir his tone and manner made it plain he tacked on the title of respect very much as an afterthought he didnt bother saluting i have had an idea bell announced have you congratulations the commander of unicornriders said thank you only after the words were out of his mouth did bell realized ned might not have meant that as a compliment he gave the other officer the same glare as hed used against the luckless runner ned though was made of sterner stuff he stared back as intent on intimidating bell as bell was on intimidating him the silent angry tableau could have lasted even longer than it did but neds unicorn tried to jerk free from the tree to which hed tied it it failed but the motion distracted both men when ned of the forest looked back some of the cold fury had left his face what is your idea sir he asked i aim to send some of your unicornriders against reillyburgh to harass the southrons there and to draw doubting george out of ramblerton bell said didnt i tell you before youd better not divide your forces didnt you have enough of splitting up my men when we were down at poor richard ned said look what you got there you are insubordinate bell said and you are a godsdamned fool ned retorted by the thunderers thumbs you havent got enough men now to stretch from one bank of the cumbersome river to the other theres gaps on both sides and now you want to take soldiers away from this scrawny little army you must be clean out of your tree can you think of anything likelier to lure the southrons away from ramblerton than a threat to one of their outlying garrisons bell said we cannot fight them while they are in there they must come forth be careful what you ask for on account of youre liable to get it ned of the forest said and what pray tell does that mean if they come out sir do you really reckon we can handle em ned asked of course we can of course we will would i have come all this way if i expected my campaign to fail i dont know anything about what you expect ned answered all i know is i expect youre going to be sorry for splitting up your army the way youre doing you havent got enough men to fight doubting george as is let alone if you go detaching a piece of your force here and another piece there i am the commanding general bell declared in a voice like frozen iron obey my orders lieutenant general ned snarled something that sounded more like a wildcats hiss than real words but he did salute as he stormed off bell thought that meant he would obey if it didnt the army of franklin could get probably scrape up a new commander of unicornriders too somewhere sir a grayrobed mage stuck his head into doubting georges office and waited to be noticed george made him wait for quite a while at last though the southrons commander had no choice but to acknowledge the fellows existence yes lieutenant what do you want it isnt me sir the wizard made a point of distancing himself from the message he had to deliver it isnt me he repeated but marshal bart is on the crystal ball and he needs to talk to you ah but do i need to talk to marshal bart doubting george replied i wonder i truly do wonder sir the young wizard said desperately sir marshal bart orders you to come and talk with him oh he does does he george said the scryer nodded george sighed and got heavily to his feet well i suppose id better do it then eh yes sir i think that would be a very a very good thing to do sir the mage was all but babbling in his relief george didnt think it would be anything of the sort only three men in all detina were in a position to make him do anything he didnt think would be very good king avram general hesmucet and marshal bart avram had always let him alone hesmucet marching toward veldt and the western ocean was otherwise occupied bart off in front of pierreville laying siege to duke edward of arlington and the army of southern parthenia should have been otherwise occupied too but as commander of all of avrams armies he insisted on poking his nose into what should have been doubting georges business although george made the walk to the chamber where the scryers hunched over their crystal balls as slow as he could he did eventually get there the lieutenant dogged his heels like a puppy several other scryers in the room beamed when george did at last appear he sat down on a stool in front of a crystal ball from whose depths marshal barts blunt weathered features stared reporting as ordered sir george said blandly how are things over in parthenia tolerable bart answered weve got edward by the neck sooner or later well throttle him but i dont want to talk about parthenia i want to talk about franklin about ramblerton youre the marshal george sounded cheerier than he felt whatever you want thats what happens that was a mistake doubting george realized as much as soon as the words were out of his mouthwhich was of course too late bart said ill tell you what i want i want what i told you i wanted a week ago i want you to go out there and smash the army of franklin i intend to do exactly that sir george answered as soon as i am ready i will do it and just when do you expect to be ready lieutenant general marshal bart asked pointedly youve already dithered too long i am not dithering sir george replied with dignity i am waiting for a couple of good brigades to come in from the far side of the great river as soon as theyre here i will land on bell like a ton of barristers i am of the opinionand king avram is also of the opinionthat you have enough men to do the job without these footsoldiers from beyond the great river bart said i want you to get on with it george sir i will attack when i am ready doubting george said stiffly until i am sure i can do the job as it should be done i dont see how i canor why i shouldlaunch an attack lieutenant general if you stay in ramblerton much longer without attacking you put your command in jeopardy marshal bart said do i make myself plain odiously so george answered if you want to replace me you have the right to do just that you are the marshal after all confound it george i dont want to replace you bart said irritably i want you to go out there and fight and win the longer you sit there and dont fight though the worse you look and the louder people scream for your head tell those people to go scream about something else george said have i ever let you down have i ever let the kingdom down no but they say theres a first time for everything im beginning to wonder myself bart said i tell you that frankly as one soldier to another you outnumber bell he is there in front of you go strike him you outnumber duke edward he is there in front of you go strike him doubting george said you are not so funny as you may think if you saw the works of pierreville you would be more sparing of your advice sir it could be george allowed i do not understand the situation there i admit it and you do not understand the situation hereonly you refuse to admit it i understand that i am the commanding general of all the armies of the kingdom of detina marshal bart said i understand that i have ordered you to attack i understand that you are not attacking what more do i need to understand about ramblerton that ordering me to attack when my army is not ready is about as bad a mistake as you can make sir doubting george said that you are flabbling over nothing bell will not get away and i will whip him you are a stubborn man lieutenant general bart said i warn you once more though you are trifling with your career i will take the chance sir george replied let historyand youjudge by the result if you dont get moving before too long history would judge me if i didnt remove you from your command the marshal said you had better bear that in mind if you mean to sit around with a superior force you will do what you think best doubting george said stolidly not showing any of the outrage that boiled up in him at barts threat i wish you would credit me with doing the same though i believe you are doing what you think best marshal bart said but if i do not also happen to think that is the best thing to do i would be remiss in my duty if i did not take steps to see what i want done done you want a victory i will give you a victory if i dont give you a victory send me out to the trackless east and let me chase the blond savages along with guildenstern and john the hierophant i want a victory now lieutenant general you have it in your power to give me what i want bart said if you dont give me what i want i will get it from someone else that is the long and short of it bart turned to the scryer dealing with his end of the mystic connection between crystal balls the scryer broke it barts image vanished from the crystal ball in front of doubting george georges scryer asked do you want to send any messages of your own sir eh no george shook his head not only that i didnt want to hear the one i just got i dont blame you a bit the scryer said then remembering such conversations were supposed to be confidential he turned red not that i was paying much attention to it no of course not georges irony was strong enough to make the scryer flinch just keep that convenient forgetfulness in mind when youre talking with anybody else eh the wizard nodded quick and george thought sincere agreement it wasnt so much that he had georges interests uppermost in his mind but he had to know the general commanding could make his life amazingly miserable if he let his mouth run away with him doubting george stalked away from the room full of crystal balls miserable invention he thought they let distant commanders inflict their stupidity on someone on the spot if the ignorant bastards off in the west actually knew what they were doing and what things were like here he shook his head as hed seen that was too much to ask for he went out onto the streets of ramblerton he hoped he wouldnt have anyone asking him questions out there no such luck colonel andy emerged a couple of minutes later someone must have tipped him off that george had been summoned to talk on a crystal ball well georges adjutant asked no as a matter of fact its not so well george answered bart wants everything to start yesterday and if it doesnt andy asked hell throw me out on my ear george answered then hell go and pull somebody elses strings andy scowled like an irate chipmunk thats a hells of a thing for him to go and do fat lot of gratitude he shows for all youve done if you hadnt saved things by the river of death we might really be worrying about how to hold on to cloviston now nothing i can do about it doubting george said anyone who puts his faith in a superiors gratitude is like the fellow who said he believed in no gods at all till the thunderer hit him with a lightning bolt you can try it but chances are it wont do you much good hed heard that story since he was a little boy for the first time he paused to wonder if it was so from some of the things alva had said the wizard believed the gods were a lot less powerful than most people thought a solid conservative george doubted that but the thunderer hadnt smitten alva with any lightning bolts and if the inward hypothesis somehow turned out to be true how much room did it leave for the action of the gods in the world less than george would have wanted plainly to his relief colonel andy brought him back to the mundane world of battles could you make marshal bart happy and attack the traitors now i suppose i could george replied but wed have more of a chance of coming away with a bloody nose if i did when i hit them i want to hit them with everything we can get our hands on for that i need those last two brigades from the east side of the great river to get here what if bart replaces you before they do andy asked nervously why then i suppose they send me off to hunt blonds out on the steppe i already told bart id go george spoke with equanimity in fact he doubted anything so dreadful would happen he was a brigadier in the regulars and he wouldnt have lost a battle like guildenstern or john the hierophant odds were hed just spend the rest of his career in georgetown counting crossbow quarrels or something equally useful andy if i remember rightly andy is a captain of regulars george thought his adjutant probably would get sent to the steppe and to one of the less prepossessing forts there no wonder he seemed nervous dont fret george told him if you let anything but what you need to do prey on your mind youre in trouble i know whats going on here marshal bart doesnt regardless of whether he thinks he does but hes the one who can give the orders andy said well yes he can doubting george admitted but hed be wrong if he did by the gods colonel andy burst out when in the hells has that ever stopped one of our generals or even slowed the stupid son of a bitch down do bear in mind colonel that you are presently talking to one of those stupid sons of bitches george said andy had the grace to look embarrassed though george suspected he wasnt or not very the general commanding continued and i dont happen to think im wrong in delaying if i did i wouldnt he listened to himself to make sure hed said what he meant there after a bit of thought he decided he had andy however still looked unhappy maybe we ought to move forward now sir if bell gets reinforcements where george broke in shaking his head what are the odds of that whatever he can scrape up hes got i dont know where hed get them andy said petulantly i just think we ought to hit him as hard as we can as soon as we can and we will george said but that isnt quite yet in my opinion and mine is the opinion that counts not if marshal bart removes you his adjutant said he wont doubting george sounded more confident than he felt what if while youre waiting for your brigades bell comes up with a new strong wizard andy asked from where george asked again if the northerners have any decent mages who arent already wearing blue robes you can bet your last piece of silver its news to bell and geoffrey both besides even if bell does come up with one alva will handle him he patted andy on the shoulder cheer up everything will be fine i doubt it andy said in exactly the tone george would have used george found himself with no reply brigadier of the regulars the wordsand what they betokenedsang within john the lister up till he could use those words about himself hed almost dreaded the end of the war between the provinces he enjoyed being a brigadier and he thought hed proved he did a good job at that rank to drop down to a captains meager command would have been hard to drop down to a captains meager pay would have been even harder he didnt have to worry about that any more he would hold brigadiers rank till he died or retired he wouldnt have to go out to some steppe castle in the middle of nowhere and listen to wild wolves and wilder blonds howling outside the walls doubting george had said he would recommend him for promotion and hed kept his promise marshal bart and king avram had recognized what john did at poor richard now all the southrons had left to do was finish squashing lieutenant general bell and the army of franklin for some reason john couldnt fathom doubting george didnt seem to want to do that there the traitors were out on ridges in plain sight of ramblerton they didnt even have enough men to stretch their line all the way across the neck of the loop of the cumbersome river in which the capital of franklin laid as far as john the lister could see outflanking them and rolling them up would be the easiest thing in the world why didnt george want to move john knew he wasnt the only one who had trouble finding an answer most of the officers inside ramblerton kept scratching their heads wondering what george was doingor rather why he wasnt doing it and the rumors that came out of the scryers hall rumors like that came out all the time more often than not soldiers had the sense to ignore them this time john the lister shook his head how could you ignore rumors that bart was threatening to sack doubting george how could you ignore rumors that bart was threatening to leave the siege of pierreville and come east either taking command in ramblerton himself or appointing georges replacement you couldnt it was that simple whenever two officershells whenever two soldiersgot together the gossip started up afresh some people started saying john the lister ought to take doubting georges place when a colonel did it in johns hearing he rounded on the man i am not going to replace lieutenant general george he growled i dont think george needs replacing do you understand me uh yes sir the man answered his eyes wide with surprise youd better colonel john said if i hear youve been spouting more of this disruptive gossip i wont be the only one who hears about it i hope i make myself plain enough uh yes sir the unhappy colonel said again and retreated faster than general guildenstern had fallen back from the river of death that wasnt enough to satisfy john the lister he went and told doubting george what had happened though he named no names he finished sir i dont want you to think im intriguing against you im glad to hear it george replied now the question is do you want me not to think that because youre not doing it or because you really are intriguing against me but you want to keep me in the dark what john the lister needed several heartbeats to work through that when he did he stared at the commanding general with something approaching horror thats the most twisted bit of thinking i do believe ive ever run into sir thank you doubting george replied which only flummoxed john further george continued now answer the question if youd be so kind sir i am not intriguing against you and that is the truth john said stiffly if you dont believe me go fetch major alva and let him find out by magic he didnt fear what might happen if doubting george did that hed told the general commanding the truth hed shown no disloyalty in word deed or manner on the contrary that didnt mean he would have been unhappy if marshal bart booted george out of the command and set him in georges place again on the contrary ambition he told himself was different from disloyalty he didnt care for the smile that played on what he could see of georges lips behind the other officers thick beard and mustache still smiling that unpleasant smile george said i wont sic major alva on you if i think youre scheming against me brigadier ill just dismiss you have you got that yes sir john replied you leave me no room for er doubt doubting george laughed out loud john went on but may i ask you one different question go right ahead george was the picture of northern hospitality sir why the hells wont you attack bell john the lister blurted why because the son of a bitch isnt going anywhere and im not quite ready to give him whatfor yet i want those last couple of brigades from the far side of the great river here before i do george answered i tell this over and over to anybody wholl listen but nobody seems to want to is it so godsdamned hard to grasp he sounded as plaintive as a commanding general was ever likely to sir hes right in front of us hes just waiting to be hit if we cant whip him with what weve got here if we cant wed be stupid to try especially when those brigades are almost here doubting george said but i think we can john the lister said thats nice george sounded placid whether he was well now john was the doubting one the commanding general went on if marshal bart bounces me and names you in my place you can go charging forth just as though youd borrowed bells brains such as they are meanwhile youd better do what i tell you well both be unhappy if you dont but youll end up unhappier i promise you that brigadier yes sir john the lister said if youll excuse me sir he waited for doubting georges affable nod then left georges headquarters at something just this side of a run still steaming he hurried up the muddy puddlesplashed streets of ramblerton till brick buildings gave way to log huts and log huts gave way to barebranched broadleafed trees and brooding dark green pines the southrons line of fortifications abridged the forest along the ridges north of ramblerton john ascended to a sentry tower in the nearest fort the sentry in the tower was so startled to have a brigadier appear at his elbow he almost fell out of his observation chamber coming to attention when john did give me your spyglass john barked sir the sentry gaped give me your godsdamned spyglass john the lister said again numbly the sentry handed over the long gleaming brass tube john raised it to his eye and swept it over the traitors lines lieutenant general bells soldiers seemed to leap toward him mages insisted spyglasses werent sorcery only a clever use of the mechanic arts no matter what the mages said the effect always seemed magical to john now almost as if he were standing in front of its parapets he could see the army of franklin in action and in inaction scrawny men in tattered blue tunics and pantaloons many of the poor bastards barefoot lined up in front of kettles to get their midday meals they looked more like the survivors of some disaster than an army that probably imagined it was laying siege to ramblerton the earthworks theyd thrown up were very fresh and new but they didnt have many soldiers in them john scanned the northerners position trying to spy out how many unicornriders they had with them fewer than hed expected he wondered if some of them had gone off to raid somewhere else he wouldnt have divided his forces in the face of an enemy that outnumbered him what bell would do though was liable to be known only unto the gods back swung johns narrow circle of vision suddenly the spyglass stopped there was some northern sentry or officer looking straight back at him out of a spyglass of his own the traitors glass had stopped moving too had he spotted john watching him by way of experiment john raised his left hand the one that wasnt holding the spyglass and waved sure as hells the soldier in the army of franklin waved back john laughed and lowered the spyglass the southron sentrys face was a mask of perplexity whats so funny sir he asked john the lister told him the sentry nodded oh yes ive seen that son of a bitch i dont know that hes ever seen me but ive seen him hes got the very same kind of spyglass as mine well of course john said we all have the same kind of stuff the traitors took whatever was in their provinces when they declared for false king geoffrey and theyve been using it ever since yet even though hed said of course to the sentry it wasnt something about which hed thought much before it was worth remembering the two branches of the detinan trunk had spent the past three and a half years showing each other how different they were yet they were without question branches from the same trunk even if the northerners wanted to hold on to their serfs and their great estates while manufactories and glideways spread across the south both sides still spoke the same language worshiped the same godsand even used the same tactical manual for training their soldiers roastbeef william whod written it fought for geoffrey these days and had the unlucky assignment of trying to stop general hesmucets march across peachtree province toward the western ocean if he could have scraped up even a quarter as many men as hesmucet commanded he might have had a chance as things were as things are hes in just as much trouble as bell and the godsdamned army of franklin john the lister said who is sir the sentry asked never you mind john descended from the observation tower as abruptly as hed climbed to the top of it looking over the traitors position had only gone further to convince him that they were ready for the taking now maybe if he dragged doubting george up here and made him look with his own eyes and if that doesnt work john thought to the seven hells with me if i wouldnt be tempted to take that spyglass and shove it up his a subordinate wasnt supposed to have such ideas about his superior whether john was supposed to or not he did he was just coming back to the outskirts of ramblerton when a young officer on unicornback waved to him brigadier john the other man called congratulations on your promotion in the ranks of the regulars thank you kindly jimmy john the lister said and then do you mind if i ask you a question ask away hardriding jimmy answered after what we went through around poor richard wed better be able to talk to each other eh do you think we can whip the traitors with the men weve got here already me sir hells yes im within shouting distance of being able to do it all by myself jimmy said ive picked up a ton of reinforcements and theyve all got quickshooting crossbows send me around their flank and into their rear and ill rip em to shreds would you tell that to doubting george john asked eagerly i already have the commander of unicornriders answered and john said hardriding jimmy shrugged and he wants to wait a bit why john the lister asked in something not far from desperation why does george want to wait in the name of the thunderers great right fist why does he need to wait hes the general commanding jimmy shrugged again officers whore in charge do whatever they please no matter how silly it is he tipped his hat to john meaning no disrespect of course of course johns voice was sour what had he done that hardriding jimmy thought silly he decided not to ask the younger man was too likely to tell him instead he said you do agree george is making a mistake by not attacking the army of franklin i dont know if its a mistake or not jimmy said he says he can whip bell whenever he pleases maybe hes right maybe hes wrong if hes wrong waiting is a mistake if hes right what the hells difference does it make i will say this much though if i were in charge here idve hit the traitors a couplethree days ago i already told you that yes you did im glad to hear it again though now the next question is what can we do either to get george moving or to get a commanding general who will move hardriding jimmy studied him john the lister didnt care for that sober scrutiny the commander of unicornriders likely suspected him of wanting that command for himself hed told george he wouldnt intrigue for it and here he was intriguing i wouldnt if only george would move he thought at last hardriding jimmy said we cant do anything sir but marshal bart can vii papers in ramblerton could not print everything they chose most of them had they had a choice would have backed the cause of false king geoffrey as a southron army had held ramblerton for more than two and a half years they didnt have that choice doubting george had several officers deciding what the papers could and couldnt say editors screamed of tyranny but they printed what george wanted them to printor else as had happened they abruptly stopped doing business the ramblerton record was not conspicuously better or worse than any of the other surviving dailies because the army kept an eye on them and when necessary a thumb as well they all tended to sound alike doubting george preferred the record because its type was a little larger than those of its rivals he could read it without bothering to put on spectacles as its chief story this morning it carried a speech king avram had made to his council of ministers a few days before would it have done that without encouragement from those southron officers i doubt it george murmured and peered at the paper avram said the most remarkable feature in the military operations of the year is general hesmucets attempted march of three hundred miles directly through the insurgent region it tends to show a great increase of our relative strength that our marshal should feel able to confront and hold in check every active force of the enemy and yet to detach a wellappointed large army to move on such an expedition doubting george made a sour face the king of detina thoughtor said he thoughtthe traitors were stopped all over the map why didnt marshal bart think the same way george feared he knewbart was trying to drive him out of his mind the marshal was doing a pretty good job of it too and am i trying to drive marshal bart out of his mind george shook his big head he wasnt trying to do anything of the sort he was trying to get rid of the army of franklin and to make sure he didnt get rid of his own army instead if bart couldnt see that then gods damn him hed give the army to someone else mutteringhed distracted himselfdoubting george returned to the ramblerton record king avram continued on careful consideration of all the evidence accessible it seems to me that no attempt at negotiation with the insurgent leader could result in any good he would accept nothing short of severance of the kingdomprecisely what we will not and cannot give he does not attempt to deceive us he affords us no excuse to deceive ourselves he cannot voluntarily reaccept the unity of detina we cannot voluntarily yield it it is an issue which can only be tried by war and decided by victory if we yield we are beaten if the northern people fail him he is beaten the more george studied avrams speeches the more he became convinced the rightful king of detina was a very clever man he hadnt thought so when avram took the throne the new kings uncompromising attitude on serfdom had prejudiced him he saw that now he had to open the record to an inside page to find out the rest of what avram had told his ministers what is true however of him who heads the insurgent cause is not necessarily true of those who follow although he cannot accept the united kingdom of detina they can some of them we know already desire peace and reunion they can at any moment have peace simply by laying down their arms and submitting to the royal authority a year ago general pardon and amnesty upon specified terms were offered to all except certain designated classes and it was at the same time made known that the excepted classes were still within contemplation of special clemency during the year many availed themselves of the general provision during the same time also special pardons have been granted to individuals of the excepted classes and no voluntary application has been denied doubting george had to read that twice he hadnt realized king avram was so reasonable so merciful was the king softening on serfdom too he got his answer right away for avram finished in presenting the abandonment of armed resistance to the royal authority on the part of the insurgents as the only indispensable condition to ending the war on the part of the kingdom i retract nothing heretofore said as to serfdom in stating a single condition of peace i mean simply to say that the war will cease on the part of the kingdom whenever it shall have ceased on the part of those who began it no avram hadnt softened as well as more wit there was also more iron in the king of detina than anyone would have suspected when the thunderers chief hierophant first set the crown on his head a few days afterwards another hierophant of the thunderer had put a different crown hastily made for the occasion on grand duke geoffreys head up in the north not much later avram and geoffrey had stopped talking and started fighting theyd been fighting ever since matter of fact avram makes a pretty fair king of detina doubting george murmured hed sided with avram when he hadnt believed that at all out of loyalty to the notion of a united detina rather than from any particular loyalty to or admiration of the sovereign a lot of people in the north and even in the south had expected avram to make a dreadful hash of things but he hadnt and it didnt look as if he would colonel andy knocked on georges door which was open when george waved for him to come in he said sir theres a scryer here who wants to talk with you do you want to talk with him scryers lately had brought little but bad news even so george shrugged and nodded id better dont you think who knows andy turned away and spoke to a man in the antechamber go ahead but dont you waste the generals time i wont sir the scryer a captain wore a gray mages robe his epaulets of rank a sorcerers badge and a goldin fact probably polished brasscrystal ball to show his specialization he shut the door on andy after he came inside doubting georges adjutant let out a squawk but the scryer ignored him to george he said this is for your ears alone the commanding general reached up and tugged at one of the organs in question seems to be in tolerable working order he observed say your say captain im called bartram sir bartram the traveler bartram was somewhere in his thirties with a long lean mournful face and sad clever hounddog eyes he gave off a feeling of reliability some people did some of those people also let you down as george was painfully well aware the scryer coughed a couple of times then said my hobby sir is looking for ways to read crystal balls that ought to be out of range some people grow roses some people raise snakes you never can tell george said erwellyes captain bartram said but i wouldnt be here now if i did those things i suppose not youd probably be happier if you werent too doubting george said though he wondered whether bartram could be happy anywhere his face denied the possibility the commanding general went on since you are here suppose you go ahead and tell me why yes sir im here because of some of the things i heard when i was fooling around with my crystal ball late last night they stretch farther then i dont know why but they do and what you heard was george tried to project an air of expectant waiting sir what i heard was orders for baron logan the black to hop on a glideway carpet and head east to take command of this army and what i heard was marshal bart saying hed come east too to take charge of logan did you now george said slowly as if he came from the sapphire isle now he tried not to show the anger he felt logan the black wasnt a regular at all hesmucet had declined to let him keep command of a wing when he took it over after james the birds eye was killed outside marthasville and now marshal bart wanted to hand him command of a whole army of this whole army if that wasnt an insult doubting george had never run into one what will you do sir bartram the traveler asked i thought you ought to know i will do just what i am doing george replied i dont see what else i can do if bart wants to show me the door for doing what i think is right then thats what he will do i dont intend to lose any sleep over it that sounded very pretty george wished it were true when he saw captain bartrams expression he wished it were convincing he would have traded truth for that of course in war sometimes we can turn whats convincing into whats true as long as the bastards on the other side dont see behind it since he obviously wasnt being convincing here though that didnt apply bartram said sir maybe you really ought to attack now even you bartram george said then he surprised even himself by starting to laugh what the hells is funny sir the scryer blurted he started to apologize doubting george held up a hand dont worry about that captain its one of the most honest things ive heard lately and ill even give you the answer john the lister is another one whos been nagging me to do what i dont care to do just yet he has to have wondered if hed take over this army once marshal bart gave me the boot now we knowhe wouldnt he cant like the idea of serving under logan the black so i suspect hell stay loyal as loyal can be for as long as i keep command youve still got two or three days sir bartram the traveler said maybe even four baron logan will come east to cloviston then north from there to here marshal bart will have to sail from pierreville down to georgetown and then hell hop on the glideway too hes a few days behind logan i see thank you for putting everything so precisely george said one more thing i need to ask you how reliable is all this when youre playing with your crystal ball there youre not just imagining youre hearing what youre hearing are you no sir bartram replied im doing the same sorts of things we do when we try to read the northerners crystal balls except im doing them to our own side and i have some tricks not every scryer knows quite a few tricks not every scryer knows if i do say so myself he drew himself up with pride doubting george wondered whether to congratulate him or clap him in the brig finding out what you wanted to know regardless of whether you were supposed to know it was a very detinan thing to do if the individual was altogether free and untrammeled the kingdom would surely be free too wouldnt it i dont know would it as usual george had his doubts the kingdom might go down the drain instead he said since no one has bothered telling me logan the black is on the way to steal my command do me the courtesy of keeping this under your hat till it is official if youd be so kind yes sir bartram touched the brim of that hat with a forefinger in what wasnt quite a salute you can count on me thank you captain george nodded the scryer left george sighed if hed been guildenstern he would have reached for a bottle of brandy being who he was he just sighed again before long the news would get out if not from bartram the traveler then rushing ahead of baron logan gods damn his thieving soul doubting george thought that wasnt fair he didnt care bart wasnt being fair to him either he wanted to rush to the scryers room and find out exactly how far away those two brigades of footsoldiers from the east were he wanted to but he didnt if he showed worry people would start wondering why if they started wondering they would find out before long and a lot of his authority would fly right out the window if they found out he went outside shaking off colonel andys questions maybe i ought to attack the army of franklin without those two brigades george shook his head he still felthe strongly felthe would do better to wait what happened to his career was one thing what happened to his men was something else again something much more important if baron logan the black took over this army of course he would attack regardless of whether those brigades had come doubting george understood that logan would be taking over for the purpose of immediate attack as long as he got a victory out of it would he care what happened to the army george shook his head not fornicating likely he muttered hey general a soldier called georges head came up the man went on do you doubt we can lick those stinking traitors turn us loose well do it without waiting for an answer he tipped his cap and went on his way doubting george laughed in something not far from despair how many times in the war between the provinces had generals from both sides sent their men out to do things flesh and blood simply could not do more times than anyone could hope to count george doubted that not at all but how many times had generals held back from an attack their soldiers actually wanted to make if this wasnt the first he would have been astonished does that mean im wrong he wondered when he shook his head it was at first with the air of a man bedeviled by bees or at least by doubts but then his resolve stiffened he earned his pay because he allegedly knew more about what he was doing than the men he commanded allegedly he said much of the soldiers art was obvious advancing crossbowmen and pikemen usually had a pretty good notion of whether they would prevail even before bolts started flying maybe i am wrong here george thought maybe i ambut i still doubt it logan the black john the lister stared as if hed never heard the name in all his born days baron logan the black barts sending him to take over this army hes not even an annasville man colonel nahath shrugged thats what i heard sir a couple of blonds who serve the scryers were gossiping about it and one of my men a corporal listened to em they didnt shut up because hes a blond himself i thought you ought to know thanksi think john told the regimental commander from new eborac i understand how you must feel sir nahath said sympathetically if doubting george doesnt use this army he stopped right there that was the place where another word would go too far if george doesnt use this army you ought to might get back to baron logan if he did oust doubting george if logan ever heard that he was likely to make both john and nahath sorry for it nothing we can do is there colonel nahath said changing course doesnt seem to be john answered if the enemy gives us a hard time we can always go out and fight him i know doubting george doesnt seem to want to but we can but whos going to protect us from the people on the same side as we are no one ever has no one ever will i suppose not nahath sighed seems a pity doesnt it george has done so much good here in the eastand so have you sir you ripped the guts out of bells army at poor richard same way a tiger will rip the guts out of a sheep with his hind claws theyre a sorry lot now have you seen them seen them ive even been up in an observation tower with a spyglass theyre close enough for a man with a decent glass to see how many of em are barefoot i know colonel nahath nodded but theyve still got pikes and crossbows and some engines and they still dont like us when we do attack them theyll fight hard he sighed again ive never yet seen those bastards not fight hard the first time would be nice i dont suppose id better hold my breath no i dont think you should colonel john the lister said theyll always fight hard but if we can beat em once more beat em the way they should be beaten whatll they have left to fight with after that teeth fingernails ghosts nahath answered that might be enough to scare some blondsthough that corporal i was telling you about would be angry if he heard me say sobut it doesnt frighten me if we beat em once more sir i think youre right i think they fall to pieces he tipped his hat i think we can give em that beating too if its not under doubting george i also think its a godsdamned shame you dont get the chance to do it there hed come out and said it thats very kind of you colonel i do appreciate it believe me the regimental commander shrugged im telling you what i think sir im just as much a free detinan as baron logan the black even if hes got a fancier pedigree than i do hes a brave man hes a good soldier for a man whos not a regular but weve been through this whole campaign and he hasnt a man who has ought to be in charge when it all pays off thats how i look at things anyhow nahath shrugged again marshal barts liable to look at it differently looks like he does john said nahath nodded saluted and went on his way john strode down the board sidewalks and muddy streets of ramblerton here was a town unusual in the kingdom of detina a town with plenty of men of fighting age on the streets and going about their ordinary everyday business in most places south and north a large number of them would have been called to serve the gold dragon or the red not here the southrons who occupied ramblerton didnt trust the locals to fight on their side and theyd done their best to keep those men from slipping out of town and fighting for king geoffrey and so in between one side and the other the ramblertonians had what neither side enjoyed peace having it they refused to enjoy it one of them jeered at john as he went by you southron bastards are scared to fight general bell youve never been anything but a pack of stinking cowards john smiled his politest smile were winning he said and kept walking blondlover the ramblertonian shouted smiling still john answered well most of the blonds ive thought of loving are a lot prettier than your sister the man thought about that for two or three heartbeats then bellowing like an aurochs in the mating season he lowered his head and charged no matter how furious he was though hed never really learned anything about fighting that was what the occupation of ramblerton had done to the men who lived there it had deprived them of the chance to become efficient killers john the lister sidestepped and hit the local in the pit of the stomach with his left fist oof the man said a sound more of surprise and outgushing air than of pain pain or no though he folded up like a concertina john straightened him with an uppercut to the point of the chin his foe was made of solid stuff he stayed on his feet after that shot to the jaw though his eyes went glassy john the listers sword hissed from its scabbard far more often than not a brigadiers sword was a parade weapon nothing more highranking officers seldom came close enough to enemies in the field to use steel against them half a dozen of bells brigadiers had died fighting in the front ranks at poor richard but that was as unusual as everything else about the battle there but even though john seldom used the blade he kept it sharp its point caressed the ramblertonians throat just below the edge of his beard wan lateautumn sunshine glittered off the bright blade you were just leaving werent you john inquired in honeyed tones blinkingand swaying more than a littlethe local stood there with his mouth hanging open trying to make his wits work enough to answer a small trickle of blood ran from the corner of his mouth down into his beard yes he said at last i reckon maybe i was to make sure he was his friends grabbed him and hauled him away from john the lister hed better be careful john called after them he might run into another southron coward and not live through it none of them answered which he thought meanspirited if one southron can whip one northerner how many southrons do we need to whip all the northerners in the army of franklin john wondered fewer than weve already got i think most of the other southron officers in ramblerton came up with the same answer doubting george had a different one he was in command and so his answer was the one that counted but how long would he stay in command what sort of answer would logan the black come up with when he got here from the west john the lister had no trouble figuring that out logan would attack he would probably win too and whatever glory there was would go to him if it doesnt go to george it ought to go to me john had thought that before it did him exactly no good he wasnt the one who got to apportion such things marshal bart was and bart had chosen baron logan he can give out glory john thought wonderingly if that doesnt make a man a god on earth what would then he shook his head bart could give out the chance for glory there was no guarantee logan the black could seize it but after john looked north toward the army of franklins curtailed lines he let out a long sigh if logan couldnt whip lieutenant general bellif anybody couldnt whip lieutenant general bellnow he didnt deserve glory a man in a gray robe came out of a building on the far side of the street a tall skinny graceless man who looked as if he would fall over in a strong breeze john the lister waved to him major alva he called after a moment of blinking and staring and obviously trying to recall who this person wanting his attention was alva waved back hello sir he said and trotted across the street toward john an assdrawn wagon full of barrels bore down on him the teamster aboard the wagon jerked the reins hard braying resentfully the asses stopped less than a yard from alva the teamster cursed like like a teamster thought john who was too horrified at the sight of the best southron wizard east of the green ridge mountainsand very possibly west of them toobarely escaping destruction to indulge himself with fancy literary figures what was even more horrifying was that alva himself had no idea hed just escaped destruction the braying jackasses and cursing teamster the rattling wagon full of barrels as far as he was concerned they might have been in new eborac city or on the far side of the moon that meant he was liable to do something else just as idiotic this afternoon or day after tomorrow and luck and a foulmouthed teamster might not be enough to keep him safe then is something wrong sir he asked which meant that john the listers horror must have been even more obvious than he thought you should be more careful when you cross the street major john got out after considerable effort youre right alva said gravely that cheered john till the mage went on i almost stepped in a couple of mud puddles there only fool luck i didnt i suppose mud puddles john muttered he shook his head the gods must watch over you because you certainly dont seem to be able to take care of it for yourself what do you mean sir alva asked john spread his hands it wasnt that he couldnt explain but he could see explaining would be as useless as explaining the facts of life to a bullfrog then alva brightened whatever it is i hope it can wait ive been meaning to congratulate you on your promotion and this is the first chance ive had erthank you john wouldnt have bet that alva knew the difference between a captain and a brigadier his attitude toward subordination argued against it but the wizard said youre welcome making brigadier in the regulars will set you up for after the war hed already shown he was thinking about what he would do once the war between the provinces finally ended maybe he was thinking about what everyone would do once the war ended john nodded and said i hope so anyhow are the traitors up to anything sorcerous thats strange or out of the ordinary what an interesting question sir major alva said as a matter of fact i was checking on them yesterday afternoon you never can tell about those people well no john the lister said we are fighting a war with them if you recall what did your check show nothing alva replied oh not a great big glowinthedark nothing the kind that can only mean somebodys hiding a great big ugly nasty something behind it but as far as i can tell bells mages are just doing the usual kinds of things mages in an army dohealing scrying investigating for a whatdoyoucallit he didnt explain a whatdoyoucallit john asked you know where they try to find out whether a son of a bitch really is a son of a bitch alva said helpfully however helpful he meant to be he wasnt and then all of a sudden a light went on inside johns head a courtmartial he exclaimed yes one of those it was plainly all the same to alva the wizard went on anyhow uh sir theyre doing that kind of thing but i dont see them doing anything much else nothing that theyre showing anyhow could they hide it from you john the lister asked alva looked indignant noalva looked offended the bunglers bells got with him they couldnt hide their prongs when they pull up their pantaloons sir he said scornfully john the lister had never heard a southron wizard talk that way about his northern opposite numbers most southron sorcerers viewed the northerners with fearful respect most of them needed to not alva and he didnt the thump of drums the skirl of horns and the wail of pipes came from the south from the banks of the cumbersome alva peered look he said in childish delight a parade and so it was their musicians leading the way flags flying regiment after regiment of toughlooking southron soldiers in gray tunics and pantaloons marched from the river north toward the encampments by doubting georges field fortifications for a little while john the lister simply watched them as major alva did then realizing who those soldiers had to be he muttered by the gods what is it sir alva asked curse me if those arent the two brigades from the far side of the great river thats nice the wizard said agreeably what about em what about em john echoed this about em theyre the men doubting george has been waiting for the past two weeks hes said he couldnt attack bell without em now theyre here i wonder if he really will attack now that they are why wouldnt he alva asked i mean if he did say that people can come up with all sorts of excuses for not doing what they dont want to do john answered i dont know whether george has done that by the lion gods fangs i hope he hasnt but were going to find out because he hasnt got any other excuses left lieutenant griff looked up and down the trench his larynx big as an apple bobbed up and down in his throat he called are you men ready to do all you can for good king avram and for detina yes sir corporal rollant shouted he gripped the staff of the company standard hard enough to whiten his knuckles his voice wasnt the only one eagerly raised either he hoped bells men were too far away to hear the southrons yelling he thought they were but he wasnt sure his comrades all along the line were making a lot of noise weve waited a long time for this now griff said some people will tell you weve waited too long theres all sorts of stupid talk going about youll have heard it some folks say a new commander for us is coming from the west some folks say marshal bart is on his way here some even say a new commander and bart are heading this way in a few days maybe all that would have mattered but it wont now and do you know why why the men called lieutenant griff whod cupped a hand in back of his ear waiting for just that call grinned at them ill tell you why because were going to lick the hells out of the godsdamned traitors before anybody can get here from the west thats why a great cheer erupted as if the southrons had already gone and won their battle rollant gripped the flagpole harder than ever were they all deaf over there in bells lines well it wouldnt matter for long because the southrons were going to come forth from the line of forts theyd held for the past couple of weeks when they did the northerners would no longer have any possible doubt about what they intended rollants regiment along with the rest of the wing john the lister commanded was stationed on the right of doubting georges line johns men were in fact the rightmost footsoldiers in the line out beyond them were only hardriding jimmys unicornriders horns screamed all along the southrons front forward colonel nahath shouted in a great voice forward for good king avram forward for freedom forward because smashing this army of traitors into the dust at last takes a long step toward winning the war forward lieutenant griff yelled avram and victory his voice would never be very deep but it didnt crack he was bit by bit growing up forward sergeant joram boomed well whip the stinking traitors out of their boots or ill know the reason why like any sergeant worth his silver he wanted his men to fear him more than the enemy forward rollant yelled he was an underofficer he wanted to and had the right to make his voice heard forward for freedom for him no other war cry mattered in the north he wouldnt have been allowed to wear a sword on his hip let alone a corporals stripes on his sleeve beside him smitty said im confused your high and mighty corporalship sir which direction should we go in laughing rollant answered you can go to hells smittybut take some traitors with you before you do come on his breath smoked as he scrambled out of the trench the day was clear but cold the sun low in the northeast he waved the company standard back and forth more and more southrons came out of the works in front of ramblerton they formed their lines and advanced off to the right hardriding jimmys troopers swept out on what looked to be a looping path around the far left of the army of franklin rollant saw that much and then stopped worrying about the riders they still had to beat ned of the forest he knew all about nedand when had southrons ever come close to matching what hed done rollant knew the answer to that only too well never he looked to the left the standard he carried was one of scoreshundredssweeping forward at the same time the right was a little in front of the center where the banners seemed a little farther apart off to the left he thought the standards were tightly bunched once more he wasnt so sure of that though as the left was a long way off here and there stones and firepots arced through the air toward the oncoming southrons from behind the northerners lines the first ones fell short then they began clawing holes in the ranks of the men in gray repeating crossbows clattered into action too engineers were pushing the southrons own catapults and repeating crossbows forward as fast as they could they soon started shooting back lieutenant griff brandished his sword he said it must be true what they say about bells armythey havent got a whole lot of engines left a good thing too sir if anyone wants to know what i think rollant answered theyd hack us to pieces if they did bells men had dug shooting pits in front of their first line of trenches as john the listers army had done in front of poor richard men in blue popped up out of those pits and started sending crossbow quarrels toward the advancing southrons one hummed past rollants ear anotherthock punched a hole in the standard he carried it would have punched a hole in him too had it happened to fly a few feet lower behind him crossbowmen began to shoot at bells men zip zip more bolts flew past too close for comfort every so often a standardbearer or an officer got shot in the back by accident when someone in the ranks who didnt care for him let fly as a blond rollant knew plenty of people didnt care for him he couldnt do anything about it now and tried not to think about it motion ahead and to his right caught his eye it wasnt as hed hoped hardriding jimmys men sweeping down on the traitors flank instead it was ned of the forests unicornriders red dragon on gold flying from their standards maneuvering to block hardriding jimmy and keep him from doing whatever hed set out to do well who ever saw a dead unicornrider rollant thought not without bitterness if a footsoldier said that out loud to a unicornrider it was guaranteed to start a fight that didnt mean rollant and his comrades didnt think such things though unicornriders lent a touch of style to what would otherwise be vulgar brawls past that on the southron side at least theyd never been good for much maybe hardriding jimmy could change that rollant would believe it when he saw it the northerners in the shooting pits ran back toward their own line provincial prerogative they shouted and king geoffrey freedom rollant yelled back king avram and freedom he took one hand off the flagpole to shake a fist at bells men still waving his sword lieutenant griff ran ahead of his men toward the earthen breastwork in front of the northerners forward trench king avram and one detina forever griff shouted rollant hustled forward to keep up with the company commander griff swung the sword again avram and free a crossbow quarrel caught him in the throat he made a horrible gobbling noise and threw up both hands to clutch at the wound the sword fell forgotten to the ground blood dreadfully red fountained out between griffs fingers seeing so much blood rollant knew the wound had to be mortal griff couldnt have bled much more or much faster if a stone had struck off his head he staggered on for another couple of steps then his knees gave out and he crumpled to the ground rollant stooped to snatch up the sword he had dropped an officers blade it was half again as long as the stubby weapon the blond carried on his hip as he bent to take itshifting the company standard from right hand to left at the same timeanother bolt hissed malevolently over his head if he hadnt bent down it might have caught him in the face thank you thunderer he muttered ill do something nice for you if you let me live through this fight when he straightened he waved the standard and swung the sword a standardbearer hed found had to have some ham in him or the rest of the men wouldnt follow him the way they should and now he had the perfect war cry to make his comrades give all they could for lieutenant griff he shouted and ran on past the company commanders body for lieutenant griff the men behind him roared griffs fall meant sergeant joram was in charge of the company for the time being he ran up alongside of roland joram had his own way of getting the most out of his men pointing to rollant he bellowed are you sons of bitches going to let this fellow do it all by himself sergeant rollant began and then let it go hed already seen that joram didnt have too much against blonds the sergeant was also trying to get the men to fight hard later might be the time to talk about it now wasnt avraaaam joram yelled as he sprang up onto the parapet he shot one traitor threw his crossbow in the face of another drew his shortsword and leaped down into the trench avraaaam rollant echoed he jumped down into the trench too and spitted a northerner before the man in blue could shoot him another northerner rushed forward grappling with him to wrestle away the company standard struggling and cursing rollant couldnt get his arm free enough to stab the enemy soldier he hit him in the face with the pommel of lieutenant griffs sword somethingprobably the northerners noseflattened under the impact the man howled but hung on and tried to trip him rollant smashed him again with the weighted pommel the second blow persuaded the traitor he wasnt going to get what he wanted he lurched down the trench his face dripping blood more and more southrons jumped into the trench northern pikemen rushed up to drive them back that was badpikes had far more reach than shortswords but southron pikemen joined the fight moments later thrusting and parrying against their foes rollant was too busy trying to stay alive to pay much attention to the details he did know that southron reinforcements eased the pressure on his comrades the southrons were into the army of franklins trenches and it didnt look as if bells men could throw them out again there was colonel nahath scrambling up out of the first trench and pointing to the next one with his sword come on boys he cried are you going to let a pack of dirty stinking traitors slow us down no the soldiers shouted they hurried after the regimental commander the northerners they fought were dirty and stinking rollant and his comrades werent or not so badly theyd spent the past couple of weeks in far better quarters than their foes had a few days in the field though and nobody civilized would want to get anywhere near them either lets go lets go lets go that was sergeant joram urging his men on rollant waved the company standard again then he too fought his way up onto the high ground between the trenches he waved the standard yet again joram nodded thats the way to do it corporal king avram rollant yelled and sprang down into the melee in the second trench a bolt lifted his hat from his head and carried it away he didnt even have time to shudder at his narrow escape he was a standardbearer and so a target he was a blond in a gray uniform and so a target he was a blond in a gray uniform whod had the presumption to fool his superiors into thinking he deserved to be a corporal and bear a standardso northerners would think of it anyhowand so doubly or triply or quadruply a target he was glad hed picked up luckless lieutenant griffs sword it gave him more reach than most of his foes had it wouldnt do anything against crossbow quarrels of course but by now the trench was so packed with battling men hardly anybody could raise a crossbow let alone aim one again bells men tried to drive the southrons out of the trench again grayclad reinforcements swamped them rollant climbed up over dead bodieshe hoped they were all deadwearing blue and gained the next stretch of open ground between entrenchments fancy meeting you here smitty said panting rollant looked him up and down you mean they havent killed you yet he demanded i dont think so the other soldier patted himself as if looking for bolts or a pike or two that might have pierced him when he was busy with something else he shook his head nope i still seem to be more or less alive how about you about the same i think come on lets get back to it rollant said weve pushed em pretty hard so far havent broken through yet though smitty spoke with a connoisseurs knowledge of what he wanted but who knows we just might yes rollant nodded we just might that was as much of a breather as he allowed himself he waved the standard and rushed forward into the fight if the southrons did break through at last he wanted to be part of it after so much hard struggle he thought hed earned the right later that day a crossbow quarrel nicked his left ear he bled all over his tunic but it wasnt even close to a serious wound a healer put a stitch in it and said i dont even think youll have a scar oh rollant almost felt cheatedwith the little wound and with the battle the northerners gave ground but they didnt break he wanted them ruined not just driven back he could see that that smashing victory ought to be there he could see it but he couldntdoubting george didnt seem able tofind a way to reach out and grab hold of it captain gremios regiment along with the rest of what remained colonel florizels wing was posted at the far right end of the army of franklins line lieutenant general bell expects the southrons to concentrate their attack against this wing gremio told his company commandersthree captains four lieutenants and three sergeants youve got to let your men know theyd better fight hard a lot is liable to depend on them when the southrons move and i think the southrons are going to move today as if to underscore his words the sun rose in the northeast and spilled bloodcolored light over their lines and over the works in front of ramblerton to the south sergeant thisbe raised a hand when gremio nodded thisbe asked how does bell know this is where doubting george aims to hit hardest i cant tell you that because colonel florizel didnt tell me gremio answered i dont know whether bell told his wing commanders how he knowsor why he suspects i should say as usual he spoke with a barristers relentless precision one of the other company commandersgremio didnt see whomuttered i hope bells not right the way he was when he sent us at the southrons trenches by poor richard that will be enough of that gremio said sharply he wished the other man hadnt done such a good job of voicing his own fear hed lost faith in the commanding general that did him exactly no good as bell was going to keep right on giving orders regardless of whether gremio had faith in him the regimental commander continued we ought to get the men fed early too in case we do have to fight today none of the company commanders quarreled with that they got the cooks working earlier than usual and grumbling more than usual on account of it even so only about half the men got breakfast before warning cries from the sentries in the shooting pits out in front of the main line announced that the southrons were indeed coming forth gremio got nothing to eat himself his belly growled in disappointed resentment when he rushed out of the breakfast line and up toward the parapets when he looked to the south his jaw dropped that wasnt hunger it was shock hed known avrams soldiers would be moving against the army of franklin hed known yes but hed never dreamt the move would look like this from one end of the line to the other miles of southrons swarmed forward under what looked like thousands of company and regimental standards the attack might not succeed whether it did or not though it was the most aweinspiring thing gremio had ever seen forward he shouted to his own soldiers by the thunderers lightning bolt come forward we have to beat them back up came the men some eating others complaining theyd got no breakfast thisbes light clear voice put paid to that will you be happy if you get killed with full bellies gremio half expected some stubborn soldier to answer yes no one did or no one he heard the men filed into the trenches baggy wool pantaloons flapping as they ran they loaded their crossbows some of them thrust quarrels into the dirt in front of them so they could reload faster on came the southrons it was a couple of miles from their line to the one the army of franklin held we came that far over open country at poor richard gremio thought and then they tore hells out of us maybe we can do the same to them but it wouldnt be easy even the part of the southron army that had fought at poor richard had had far more engines than the army of franklin boasted gremio shook his head how can you boast about something you dont have not only that unicorns were hauling the southrons catapults and repeating crossbows right along with the rest of the army yes gremios side started shooting first but doubting georges men wasted no time replying in kind a stone thudded into the front of the parapet it didnt plow through but dirt flew out and hit gremio in the face farther down the line a firepot came down on top of the parapet sending up a great gout of flame and smoke another one landed in the trenches burning men shrieked some not for long with the sulfurous reek of the firepots came the stink of charred flesh a soldier on the shooting step suddenly toppled shot through the head by a long thick bolt from a repeating crossbow the scouts in the shooting pits in front of the main line came out and dashed back toward the entrenchments more than a few of them fell shot in the back before they made it some of them were shot by their own comrades in the trenches too the southrons had made the same mistake at poor richard why didnt we learn from them gremio wondered southrons were falling too a stone knocked down three men before losing its momentum repeating crossbows cut down more and firepots burst among the soldiers in gray shoot gremio shouted when he judged the southrons were in range of his mens weapons up and down the entrenchment crossbows clacked and snapped men reloaded with frantic haste someone not far from gremio cursed horribly when his bowstring broke he fit a replacement to the crossbow and went back to the business of slaughter gremio didnt need long to see that the southrons assailing his end of the line were veterans in the face of what the northern soldiers flung at them they went to the earth and started shooting back from their bellies some of them began to dig in gremio watched the dirt fly raw troops would have charged home in spite of everything not knowing any better they would have paid for it too paid gruesomely the army of franklin punished the southrons here but less than gremio would have hoped sergeant thisbe said they dont have orders to take our trenches no matter what the way we did a couple of weeks ago with theirs the underofficernow the company commandersounded bitter gremio had a hard time blaming thisbe for that not when he was bitter himself were holding em here gremio peered off toward the left anybody know how were doing along the rest of the line he didnt even after peering a swell of ground just a little to the east kept him from seeing much all he could do was wonderand worry even here where the army of franklin seemed to be doing fine a hells of a lot of southrons were attacking if lieutenant general bell happened to be wrong if this wasnt the stretch where doubting georges army was pushing hardest what was happening off to the left out of gremios sight but with luck not out of the commanding generals lieutenant general bell wrong gremio laughed how could anyone possibly imagine bell making a mistake the idea was absurd wasnt it of course it was up till now bell had conducted a perfect campaign hadnt he of course he had the army of franklin had smashed john the lister at summer mountain hadnt it and then gone on to destroy johns remnants at poor richard he shook his head some of those things could have happened some of those things should have happened but they hadnt that was at least partly bells fault could he make another mistake gremio knew too well that he could thinking along with himas the underofficer so often didsergeant thisbe asked what if theyre hammering us at the far end of the line then they are captain gremio replied with a fatalistic shrug i dont know what we can do about it except either send reinforcements or run away off to the south something roared the chill that ran through gremio had nothing to do with the weather a roar like that touched him deep in his brain deep in his belly a roar like that meant whatever is making this noise wants to eat youand it can another roar resounded and another and another the dragons looked old as time deadly as murder and graceful enough to make an eagle blush their great bat wings effortlessly propelled them toward the northerners trenches they took no notice of the southrons out in the open below them it was as if theyd decided to feast on pork and didnt care whether mutton was out there waiting for them several northerners didnt wait to be eaten they jumped out of the trenches and ran away as fast as they could go hold gremio shouted though he wanted nothing more than to run too why somebody yelled back fleeing faster than ever for a couple of heartbeats gremio found himself altogether without an answer then the rational part of his mind reasserted itself because theyre magical he exclaimed they arent real they cant be real when was the last time anybody saw a dragon that isnt on a flag west of the great river over in the stony mountains out past the eastern steppes yes but here not a chance they sure look real someone else said and they did the fire that burst from their jaws looked real too more men not willing to take the chance scrambled out of the fieldworks and started running away the southrons shot several of them when they broke cover colonel florizel limped past dont panic boys he shouted its just the godsdamned southrons telling lies again what else are they good for he nodded to gremio and a fine day to you captain were doing pretty well here arent we were holding them sir sure enough gremio answered florizel had limitsanything requiring imagination was beyond his ken within those limits though he made a pretty good soldierexactly how good gremio had come to understand more slowly than he should have the captain asked how are we doing off to the left i cant tell from here florizels face clouded not so well theyve forced back the line there we maywe likely willhave to fall back here too just to keep things straight i dont think any counterattack at that end will push the southrons out of our works gremio looked over his shoulder another ridge line stood a mile or two north of the one the army of franklin presently held he jerked a thumb towards it i suppose well make another stand there yes i suppose we will too florizel nodded weve hurt the southrons theyve hurt us but weve hurt them more than a little if we can hold off the next attackif they can even manage another attack tomorrow or the next dayid say well have won ourselves a victory and i dont mean the kind bell says we won at poor richard either he made a sour face you may be right your excellency gremio still reckoned florizel an optimist but he couldnt say for certain his superior was wrong florizel knew more about what was going on than he did and even an optimist could be right some of the timegremio supposed he said funny how weve held them here where they were supposed to be pushing hardest but we had to give ground at the other end of the line yes this is a mite strange colonel florizel agreed still and all though battles a funny business what you figure will happen doesnt and what you dont does thats true i wish it werent but it is gremio said has my regiment fought well captain florizel asked yes sir gremio answered truthfully good its a funny business of a different sort you knowneeding to ask about the soldiers i commanded for so long you still command us colonel yes but not that way how about your old company that will give you some notion of what i mean my old company is doing just fine sir even if it does have a sergeant in charge of it gremio answered good thats good you know if youd ever wanted to promote that thisbe to lieutenants rank id have done it in a heartbeat hes a hells of an underofficer i saw that right away sir i suggested promotion more than once whenever i did sergeant thisbe said no ah well there are some like that its too bad i think he would have made a pretty fair officer and i dont say that about every sergeant in the regiment i know sir i agree but gremio shrugged thisbe didnt doesnt nothing to be done about it in that case florizel said a pity though a panting runner came up to him from the left sir you are ordered to withdraw to the ridge line to the rear the messenger said weve been forced back to it on the left and we havent got the men to stretch from one ridge to the other we have to keep our line as short as we can is that what lieutenant general bell says gremio asked the runner nodded i cant say hes wrong florizel observed gremio couldnt say the commanding general was wrong either he wasnt sure bell was right but as with florizel before that was a different story florizel went on prepare my regimentim sorry captain your regimentfor withdrawal make sure it can still fight while pulling back the rest of the wing will accompany it yes sir gremio said up till now the southrons havent pressed us hard i dont suppose they will here either but why havent they he wondered and found no answer that satisfied him ned of the forest had gone up against hardriding jimmys unicornriders pushing south trying to flank john the lister out of poor richard he hadnt been able to shift them it was the first time in the whole course of the war that hed tried to make a move and had the southrons completely thwart him he hadnt cared for the experience one bit now hardriding jimmys troopers were the ones moving forward and ned had to stop them he was discovering he liked that even less for one thing he was again operating without his own full force of riders bell in his infinite wisdom had sent some of them off to raid reillyburgh hed claimed the raid would help draw doubting george out of ramblerton and make him attack the army of franklins entrenched positions hed been right too ned wondered how happy bell was now about being right for another between the fight near poor richard and this one jimmy had been massively reinforced every single one of his unicornriders seemed to be using a newfangled quickshooting crossbow he would have badly outnumbered ned of the forest even had ned had all his own riders this way this way it was like trying to hold back an avalanche with his hands every inch of ground between the left end of lieutenant general bells line and the cumbersome river seemed to have a southron unicornrider galloping forward over it and all of them were putting so many crossbow quarrels in the air a man might almost have walked across the battlefield on them what the hells do we do lord ned colonel biffle wailed after jimmys men made him give up a knoll hed badly needed to hold it was either give up the knoll or wait to get flanked out of the position or wait a little longer and get surrounded and destroyed what the hells can we do fight the bastards ned snarled hed been living up to his own advice his saber had blood on it he laid it across his knees for a moment while he snapped off a shot at a grayclad southron he missed and cursed and reloaded as fast as he could a southron could have got off three or four shots with his fancy weapon in the time ned needed to shoot once when he shot again though a southron unicornrider crumpled in the saddle thats the way biffle exclaimed but ned remained gloomy even as he set yet another bolt in the groove of his crossbow and yanked the string back with a jerk of his powerful arms theyve got four or five times the men we do and a lot more than that when it comes to shooting power he said how the hells are we supposed to whip em with odds like that if we had all the men were supposed to his regimental commander began it might help a little ned broke in i hated bells guts when he stole em from me i hated his guts and i hated his empty head but you know what biff right this minute im not sure how much difference theyd make colonel biffle stared at him ive never heard you talk this way before lord ned sounds like youre giving up before ned could answer a crossbow quarrel hummed past between the two men im not quitting theres no quit in me ill fight till those sons of bitches kill me even after im dead i want my ghost to haunt em but by the lion gods claws biff how am i supposed to win when ive got to fight everything the southrons can throw at me i dont know sir i wish i did you always have up till now but up till now ive been operating on my own if too many southrons came after me i could always ride off and hit em again somewhere else here though here im stuck i cant pull away from this fight on account of if i do hardriding jimmy gets around the footsoldiers flank and eats em for supper so ive got to stand here and take ittake it right on the chin another hillock fell the southrons shooting at the men on it from the front right and left at the same time neds troopers barely escaped if theyd waited much longer they would have been cut off and surrounded watching them fall back colonel biffle said thats what happened to me too i understood you ned said yet another bolt thrummed past wickedly close he went on if its just a shooting match theyre going to whip us i dont know of anything in the whole wide world plainern that if the southrons did push aside or beat back his unicornriders they would outflank the army of franklins footsoldiers and then that was all too plain to ned too biffle said what else can it be but a shooting match lets close with em ned said savagely this wasnt the kind of fight he usually made or usually wanted to make he knew how expensive it would be but he also knew how disastrous continuing the fight as it was going would be theyre tough enough with the crossbow all right how are they with sabers in their hands i dont know sir biffle said in wondering tones ned of the forest wondered too he wondered if hed lost his mind but when you were desperate you had to do desperate things he stood tall in the saddle brandishing his bloodstreaked saber pointing it toward the southrons he roared out a command chaaarge he set spurs to his unicorn and thundered at hardriding jimmys men his troopers followed without hesitation the southrons were a couple of hundred yards away ned hadnt ridden more than half the distance before realizing hed made a mistake the enemy didnt want to play his game and they had the shooting power to make sure his side paid a high price for even attempting it a storm of crossbow quarrels met his riders men pitched from saddles unicorns crashed to the ground screaming like women in anguish he wondered whether he would have any followers left by the time he got in amongst the southrons he didnt wonder if he would get in amongst them he had the good soldiers arrogance to be sure of that sometimes of course even good soldiers were wrong ned of the forest shoved that thought deep down out of sight he had no time for it now he never had much time for thoughts like those his mount lowered its head and charged for the closest enemy unicorn a young officer with only one epaulet rode the other unicorn a lieutenant he shot at ned who hunched low on his own beasts back the southron missed cursing he worked the lever that brought a new bolt up into the groove and cocked the crossbow at the same time he shot again he missed again even with a fancy quickshooting crossbow he had no time for another shot after that and paying so much attention to his crossbow he hadnt paid enough to his unicorn neds mount gored it in the left shoulder tearing a red bleeding line in the perfect whiteness of its coat the unicorn shrieked and reared the southron lieutenant had all he could do to stay in the saddletill lefthanded ned hacked him out of it with a savage saber stroke come on you sons of bitches ned shouted and even he couldnt have told whether he was yelling at his own men or king avrams lets see how you like it he struck out at another trooper in gray his sword bit the mans arm the cry that burst from the southron was as shrill as any a unicorn might have made most menmost men on both sides from what ned had seenhad little stomach for close combat they would sooner fight at crossbow range where they could think of their foes as targets not as other men like themselves and where they didnt have to meet them face to face ned was different he might have been a wolf who knew only how to kill with his own jaws meeting the enemy face to face didnt bother himon the contrary it helped him frighten the foe and the more fear he spread the easier that made the rest of his job he rode up to a southron sergeant the enemy unicornrider had drawn his saber but ned attacked from his left side which meant he had to reach across his body to defend himself neds smile was wolfish too being lefthanded had won him a lot of fights it didnt win him this one another shouting southron galloped up to help the man hed assailed by the time he drove that second fellow off with a wounded unicorn the sergeant had ridden away lightning smashed down out of a clear sky about time gods damn it ned roared hed wondered if all of bells wizards had died of old age or maybe just of accumulated uselessness at least they were trying but they werent succeeding no southron troopers rode anyplace near where the lightning struck it smote once moreagain in a place where there were no southrons ned cursed hed seen that doubting george had wizards who knew what they were doing men said bell might have prevailed at poor richard if a southron wizard hadnt thwarted the northerners sorcerous assaults now it looked to be happening again what did that say probably that bells wizards hadnt learned anything new since the fight at poor richard which surprised ned not a bit bell hadnt learned anything much since then so why should his mages prove any different again the futile lightnings crashed ned of the forest forgot about them they wouldnt change anything and he had to stay alive he traded swordstrokes with a southron who knew what he was doing with a blade in his hand battle swept them apart before either could wound the other colonel biffles shout resounded in his ears lord ned weve got to pull back hells with that ned ground out were still giving em a hard time but theyre giving us worse biffle said and besides sir the footsoldiers are falling back whats that engrossed in his own fight ned of the forest had paid scant attention to what was going on off to his right but the regimental commander had told the truth pressed by swarms of pikemen and crossbowmen in gray bells left wing was pulling back toward the rise a mile or two north of the position in which it had started the day the retreat was orderly the men in blue giving a good account of themselves as they withdrew no signs of panic showed but a retreat it unquestionably was and biffle had also told the truth about neds charge not many of his unicornriders remained on their mounts like the footsoldiers theyd done all they could but theyd come up against too many men and too many quickshooting crossbows theyd slowed the southrons yes the price theyd paid for slowing them all right all right gods damn it ned said now we can pull back without everything going to hells and gone and we can anchor our new line on the one the footsoldiers are setting up that sounded good but the farther north from ramblerton they fell back the wider the loop of the cumbersome river became ned knew he could keep hardriding jimmy off the footsoldiers flank but who was going to keep the southrons from getting around his flank and into the army of franklins rear nobody nobody at all that was the only answer he could see he glanced toward the west where the sun had slid far down the sky things hadnt gone too badly today darkness would force the fighting to stop before long if the southrons had enough left to push again tomorrow though theyd better not gods damn it ned muttered his men the survivors broke off their handtohand struggle with jimmys unicornriders another volley of crossbow quarrels helped speed them back toward their comrades but the riders in gray didnt try to close with them that charge might not have donehells hadnt doneeverything ned wanted but it had knocked the southrons back on their heels better than nothing and better than nothing was about as much as the north could hope for these days ned knew that all too well his own years of campaigning in dothan and great river province in franklin and even down in cloviston had driven it home hed needed one desperate makeshift after another to keep his unicornriders in the field had he had any lingering doubts bells all but hopeless lunge down into franklin would have murdered the last of them one more day and were still here fighting colonel biffle said thats right thats just right gods damn it ned said and we gave the southrons all they wanted and then a little more too he spoke loudly to make sure his men listened he wanted their spirits as high as possible he feared they would need to do more hard fighting when the sun came up tomorrow hed succeeded in heartening biffle anyhow the regimental commander nodded after the botch the footsoldiers made of the fight at poor richard i was afraid theyd fold up and run when the southrons hit em but they didnt they fought like mad bastards and no mistake like mad bastards yes ned of the forest didnt echo that and no mistake too many people had already made too many mistakes in this campaign far too many of those people wore northern generals uniforms some of them were now dead some werent with the darkness quiet settled over the battlefield quiet punctuated by occasional challenges and flurries of fighting and by the groans of the wounded what were hardriding jimmys men doing in the darkness ned sent out scouts but they couldnt learn much the southrons patrols were very aggressive very alert well find out tomorrow ned thought and tried to fight down worry viii lieutenant general bell hadnt just listened to the moans of wounded men on the battlefield at essoville in the west and at the river of death hed added his own moans to the mix better than most of his subordinates he knew what the wounded were going through for hed gone through it himself hed given up trying to escape the laudanum bottle it was as much a part of him now as his ruined left arm all things considered though he was more pleased than not with the days fighting he wished the army of franklin could have held its original line but it hadnt had to fall back too far the army remained in good order it hadnt been routed it had hurt doubting georges men as they came forth to attack if things hadnt gone exactly as bell hoped they hadnt missed by much either he levered himself off a stool and made his slow way across the pine boards flooring the shack that was for the moment army of franklin headquarters runners waited on the front porch shivering against the chill of evening they came to attention and saluted when he stuck his head out fetch me my wing commanders and my commander of unicornriders he told them we have to plan tomorrows fighting yes sir they said as one after briefly putting their heads together to see who went to get which officer they hurried away benjamin the heated ham reached the farmhouse first that didnt surprise bell benjamin commanded the center and bells headquarters lay in his part of the field he saluted good evening sir he said weve weathered the first day thats something anyhow thats not all well do either the commanding general declared let them throw themselves at our works again tomorrow let them bleed to death charging field fortifications yes sir brigadier benjamin replied i hope they do its a pity you didnt feel that way when we assaulted john the lister at poor richard sir before bell could do anything more than glare colonel florizel limped into the farmhouse reporting as ordered sir he said hello colonel bell said discontentedly he still wanted to replace florizel but surviving brigadiers were so thin on the ground in the army of franklin he hadnt been able to do it he couldnt complain about the way the colonels wing had fought today i congratulate you your excellency for withstanding the southrons hardest thrusts im no wench sir theyd better not go thrusting at me florizel said bell had seldom laughed since the wounds that mutilated him but he did then benjamin the heated ham threw back his head and let out a long high shrill guffaw colonel florizel went on sir im not sure the godsdamned southrons did strike us harder than they did anywhere else what dont be silly of course they did bell said everything our spies could learn in ramblerton plainly shows doubting george planned to throw the main weight of his army against our right you had the key assignment and you did a beautiful job of carrying it out i hope so sir was all florizel said again bell didnt get the chance he would have liked to argue the point further a couple of more men on unicorns rode up to the farmhouse together ned of the forest and brigadier stephen the pickle who commanded the left wing of bells footsoldiers came in side by side ned looked grim stephen looked sour enough to show how hed come by his nickname without preamble stephen said were in trouble ned of the forest nodded were in big trouble he said im not surprised you feel that way bell said you sir he pointed at stephen the pickle you were the one whose line gave way you were the one whose men retreated if theyd held their ground theyd all be dead every godsdamned one of them stephen snarled it was a godsdamned avalanche coming down on us you ought to sacrifice a lamb to the lion god they didnt go to pieces and run like hells after what they went through today id have trouble blaming em if they had lieutenant general bell took another pull from his little bottle of laudanum he hurt no worse than usual but maybe the drug would help calm himand he needed calming he glared toward ned of the forest you dont say much no i dont ned said i already told you were in trouble id be angrier at having half my men off by reillyburgh if i reckoned getting em back would have made much difference i dont so im not but hardriding jimmys outflanked us and gods only know how much thatll cost us in the morning why didnt you stop him bell yelped on account of i couldnt ned said bluntly too many riders too many quickshooters you mean theyre loose you mean you let them get loose bell demanded i thought i just said that ned aimed a cold glower at the commanding general i might have had a better chance with all my men i told you about that and told you about that but did you want to listen not likely but then he softened a little of course like i said i might have got licked any which way hardriding jimmys got more riders than you can shake a stick at what are we going to do benjamin the heated ham said if they have turned our flank wed be nailing ourselves to the cross giving battle tomorrow if they have turned our flank how are we supposed to retreat bell asked in turn head right on past them do you suppose theyd be kind enough to give us a summer mountain the way we did for them im afraid i dont think its likely a poisonous silence followed benjamin the only one whod commanded a wing then broke it by saying that was your fault sir it was not bell thundered more silence even more poisonous at last colonel florizel said its a little too late to worry about what we did or didnt do then we cant change that weve still got some say over what we do or dont do tomorrow though that makes good sense colonel ned of the forest said odds are we wont pay any attention to it but it makes good sense anyways all right what can we do bell said if we fall back we fall into the southrons hands does any man here say otherwise he waited no one spoke he nodded well then what does that leave as far as i can see it leaves only one thingfighting and doing our best does any man here say no to that his wing commanders and commander of unicornriders stirred but none of them claimed he was wrong stephen the pickle did say theyre going to pound on us in the morning and my wingll get it worse than anybody elses on account of were the ones whore flanked do you think we would do better trying to sneak past doubting georges men and skulking off toward the north bell asked the other officers stirred once more even so they didntcouldntask to retreat all right gods damn it benjamin the heated ham said savagely well fight em i dont think itll do us much good though nothings going to do us much good now ned said well have to see what sort of scraps and pieces we can save thats all lieutenant general bell had demoted men for talk far less defeatist than that now he watched his wing commanders somberly nod he felt like nodding himself he felt like it but he didnt he said we fought hard today and we stopped most of them we can do it again we will do it again he tried to put his own heart into his subordinate commanders he triedand felt himself failing theyre going to hammer on us tomorrow no mater how hard we fight stephen the pickle said well do our best it may keep a few more of us alive benjamin the heated ham said he saluted and strode out of the farmhouse without so much as a byyourleave ned stephen and florizel followed leaving lieutenant general bell all alone no one had ever accused bell of being a reflective man there were good and cogent reasons why no one had ever leveled such a charge at him chief among them being that he wasnt a reflective man here tonight though he wished his officers hadnt left so abruptly he would rather have argued with them than had to face his own thoughts with no one for company hed got what he wanted doubting george would have been impossible to beatimpossible even to confrontinside the works of ramblerton now the southrons had come forth theyd carried the fight to the entrenched army of franklin as bell had hoped they would the only trouble was theyd done a better job of it than bell had thought they could the way things stood none of his subordinate commanders believed they could stand up under another day of attacks we cant fall back bell told himself not even the wing commanders had argued about that if we cant fall back we have to fight if we fight we have to find some way to win all that seemed obvious what didnt seem obvious was what the way to win might be he snapped his fingers he might have one throw of the dice left he struggled to his feet again and hitched across the floor to the doorway the runners on the porch came to attention bell pointed to the closest one order my chief wizards here yes sir the runner hurried off into the night the wizards came before bells temper frayed too badly they didnt look like happy men bell anything but a happy man himself would have been furious if they had without preamble he said the southrons will likely hit us again tomorrow yes sir the wizards agreed a mournful chorus my wing commanders fear the soldiers wont be able to hold them back bell went on yes sir the wizards chorused again bell scowled at them if the soldiers cant youll have to he declared what can you do to beat doubting georges men and his mages no chorus this time no answer at all in fact only silence at last one of the wizards replied sir i dont know that we can do anything everything weve tried today has gone wrong we did our best to hold back the southron unicornriders with our lightnings we did our bestbut the lightnings went awry gods damn it youre supposed to be better than those southron mages bell burst out once upon a time we were the wizard said but the southrons have had three and a half years of war to learn what we knew going in and doubting george has at least one very fine mage under his command he shivered we found that out at poor richard if youll recall i found you that failed me there bell snarled now i find you failing me again what are you good for except telling me what you cant do sir the wizard said stiffly if we werent holding off a lot of what the southrons have tried to do to us things would be worse yet how bell asked how could they be would you like to have gone up in flames the wizard asked would you like to have seen a pit open under our left one nearly did all that is easy enough for you to claim bell said it makes you sound impressive it even makes you sound useful by the thunderers prong but such claims are all the better for proof oh you can have your proof sir you can have it as easily as you please the mage told him eh and how do you propose to give it to me bell asked the wizard bowed like a courtier nothing easier sir all you have to do is send us away then when the fighting starts again and the southron mages start flinging their spells youll see if weve done your army any good for a momentfor more than a moment in factlieutenant general bell was tempted to call his bluff he started to fling up his arms and order all the mages to be gone to head straight for the hottest of the seven hells he started to but he didnt he growled you havent got the right attitude generals always say such things the wizard replied imperturbably they say them until they remember they need us after all you are dismissed you are all dismissed bell said you are not discharged from your service to king geoffrey i intend to fight to the end i intend for every man in the army of franklin to do the same and if i had any women in this army i would expect nothing different of them the wizards stirred one of them began as a matter of another one poked him in the ribs he subsided the wizards saluted in ragged unison bell sneered out went the wizards noses in the air good riddance bell muttered godsdamned good riddance they cant help me they dont think anybody can help me well to hells with what they think well lick the southrons yet wizards or no wizards he took a large blissful swig from the laudanum bottle already well drugged he felt no particular pain except pain of the spirit after a while thanks to the potent medicament he stopped caring about that he stopped caring about anything no matter what tomorrow would come doubting george would attack or else he wouldnt if he did the army of franklin would fight they would win or they would lose whatever would happen would happen oh by the gods laudanum was marvelous stuff slowly ever so slowly so very slowly as to seem to be tormenting doubting george the sun rose over the battlefield black faded to gray gray took on colors it all happened an inch at a time though so that from one glance across the field to the next nothing seemed to have changed george was less happy than he wished he would have been after the first days fighting hed driven bells men back yes but he hadnt routed them as hed hoped to do they remained in front of him still ready to fight some more he hadnt wanted that to happen he hadnt expected it to happen yawning colonel andy came up beside him what do we do now sir georges adjutant asked do we renew the attack or well colonel ill tell you doubting george began before he could say more though hardriding jimmy rode up on a hardridden unicorn george waved to show just where he was jimmy brought his unicornhis indubitably hardridden unicornto a halt george nodded to him hello there lovely day isnt it for a coot maybe the commander of unicornriders answered sure enough it could have been better no sooner had the sun risen than gray clouds rolled towards it along with the stinks of the battlefield the wetdust smell of impending rain filled georges nostrils hardriding jimmy went on sir have you got a spyglass on my person no doubting george replied can i rustle one up if i need to i expect i can would you please sir hardriding jimmy quivered with urgency george hadnt seen the like since the last time hed watched major alva incanting more than anything else that excited quiver convinced him not to tease hardriding jimmytoo much he shouted for a spyglass and got one in short order raising it to his eye he said and where shall i train this little toy north sir jimmy said north past the traitors line theyre bent back into a kind of fishhook on their left here i see george remarked trying to keep us from outflanking them no doubt clever no doubt hardriding jimmy quivered even more theyve tried but they havent done it do you see sir do you see doubting george scanned with the spyglass i see i see standards with the gold dragon on red yes jimmy said yes those are my men sir and were square in the enemys rear if you dont take advantage of that sir itd be itd be criminal thats what itd be order us to the attack order your footsoldiers to the attack weve got the godsdamned traitors in a vise all we have to do is close it on them well george scanned some more he opened his other eye hardriding jimmy looked about ready to jump out of his skin or perhaps to throttle the commanding general letting him do that would have been bad for discipline it wouldnt have been very good for doubting george himself either he lowered the spyglass and beckoned for a runner yes sir the young man said regretfully george decided hed pushed hardriding jimmy as far as he could order a general attack all along the line he said the messenger saluted and dashed off doubting george turned to the commander of unicornriders and your men may attack too thank you sir thank you sir hardriding jimmy said for an awkward moment george thought jimmy was going to kiss him the young brigadier didnt he dashed back to his unicorn adding over his shoulder you wont regret this sir you wont but the traitors will thats the idea george answered he wasnt sure his commander of unicornriders heard him jimmy roweled the unicorn with his spurs george a fine rider himself wouldnt have treated a mount so harshly but the unicorn sprang away as if it had wings on its heels that was the point of the exercise george signaled for another runner when the soldier came up george said tell john the lister to press the enemy especially hard between him and jimmy i want bells left broken broken have you got that yes sir broken by the way the messenger dashed off he might have had hardriding jimmy on his heels what do you think happens now sir colonel andy asked doubting george eyed his adjutant now colonel he replied i think were going to break those traitorous sons of bitches things didnt go quite so smoothly as hed hoped hed thought john the lister whose force greatly outnumbered the northerners facing it would lap around the end of their line and eat them up but the spur their wing commander had dropped back from the end of his line to the north hampered john so that instead of outflanking the foe his advancing southrons met them face to face it was a pretty piece of tactics george would have admired it much more if it hadnt been aimed at him he shouted for the spyglass again as he raised it to his right eye he asked andy what the hells is bell using to try to hold off jimmys unicornriders how do i know andy replied with more than a little annoyance youre the one with the godsdamned glass and i havent had the chance to look through it oh yes thats right doubting george felt considerable embarrassment having considered it he dismissed it he wasnt about to let his adjutant get his hands on the spyglass till hed had a good long look himself bell had put together some kind of a line to withstand the onslaught of hardriding jimmys troopers a line with its back to the rest of the army of franklin even as george watched more northerners slipped out of the line facing his footsoldiers and hurried north to try to stop the unicornriders doubting george cackled like a laying hen whats so funny sir andy asked irritably thrusting the spyglass at him george said here see for yourself colonel andy swept the glass across bells position before long he was cackling too theyre robbing the painter to pay the potter he said pretty soon itll be the piper theyre paying yes that did occur to me george said that surely did occur to me theyre now youre squawking whats going on hardriding jimmys men just swamped a section of that makeshift line bell managed to cobble together his adjutant replied theyre pouring through the gap to the hells with me if i know what bell can do to stop em as a matter of fact hes doing about as well as he can considering what hes up against doubting george said hes in worse shape than we were on merkles hill there by the river of death we outnumber him worse than the traitors outnumbered us then i didnt think hed even be able to slow down hardriding jimmys troopers but he did and a whole fat lot of good it did him andy pointed he looked like nothing so much as an excited chipmunk sitting up at the mouth of its burrow look sir just look at that now the line hes holding against our footsoldiers is starting to break up too and there go our men right on through i told marshal bart i could whip bell george said i told him soand i was right by the thunderers great right hand yes sir his adjutants voice held awe i thought we could beat them too but i never thought wed managethis i told bart i would wait till i was ready and then id hit hard george replied i did what i said i was going to dono more no lessand this is what we got i dont know about you colonel but ive seen men do more and get less even as he spoke another chunk of bells line dissolved and disappeared like a lump of sugar in hot tea colonel andy also noted that he said sir for this victory i dont see how they can help promoting you to lieutenant general of the regulars do you know what colonel doubting george said as a matter of fact i dont care if you know or not since im going to tell you and what im going to tell you is i dont give a good godsdamn they should have made me a lieutenant general of the regulars for what i did by the river of death they didnt do it then and i have a hells of a time caring now a column of muddy disheveled northern prisoners came stumbling by the hale helping the wounded along grinning soldiers in gray carrying crossbows and pikes herded the captives toward the south one of the northerners spotting doubting george called by the gods general why didnt you go and drop an anvil on us too whats that george boomed whats that you say dont you think i already went and did it the northerner didnt answer he just lowered his head and trudged on into captivity before long more prisoners followed that first column this time one of the guards called out to doubting george were capturing a hells of a lot of their catapults too sir good good i like to hear that the commanding general turned back to his adjutant lets see baron logan the black come one inchone godsdamned inch do you hear me past cloviston now by the lion gods claws i swear ill clap him in irons if he has the gall to try it yes sir colonel andy said enthusiastically we dont need anybody but you here in the east well i dont know about that doubting george said having a good many thousands of soldiers who know what theyre doing makes my life a lot easier no sooner had those words crossed his lips when a messenger came tearing back to him shouting sir sir the enemys breaking up and running what do we do sir somehow being confronted by one of his soldiers who didnt know what he was supposed to do bothered george not in the least not when the man brought news like that the general commanding answered chase the sons of bitches chase em hard dont slow down for anything dont let em regroup keep pushing em till you run the legs right off em have you got that yes sir we are to pursue vigorously saluting the messenger dashed back toward the north pursue vigorously the words tasted bad in georges mouth the man had squeezed all the juice from the order but hed got it right or right enough more prisoners came back each time a new column stumbled and staggered past the guards wore bigger smiles they understood what was happening how the battle was going weve got em whipped one of them shouted to doubting george they can take provincial prerogative and put it on the pyre because its dead some of the captured northerners still had spirit left they jeered and hooted and called out false king geoffreys name more though tramped along with their heads down glum and dejected and weary one fellow said to the hells with provincial prerogative fill my belly full and you can have king avram for all of me doubting george hadnt heard that very often he hoped he would hear more of it colonel andy said sir i really think weve broken them he sounded as if he couldnt believe it that irritated george you dont need to seem so surprised colonel did you think this war would go on forever andy looked startled do you know sir i think i almost did well by the gods it wont george declared it is going to end and we are going to help end it we are going to take the army of franklin and grind it to dust and when we do what does geoffrey that son of a bitch have left east of the mountains not bloody much thats what even as he spoke another stretch of bells line assailed from the front and both flanks collapsed into a chaos of men running away as fast as they could go or throwing down crossbows and pikes throwing up their hands and surrendering the northern soldiers had done everything a general could reasonably ask of his men they had very likely done more than a general could reasonably ask of his men in asking a small number of weary hungry soldiers to beat more than twice as many wellfed wellrested wellarmed ones though lieutenant general bell had wanted altogether too much now he wasor rather his men werepaying the price for his asking that of them colonel andy watched that stretch of line go to pieces too this is this is what victory feels like isnt it i dont mean victory in a battle i mean victory he sounded disbelieving but he said the word doubting george nodded thats what ive been telling you colonel thats what ive been telling anybody whod listen up till now nobodys much felt like listening not bart by the thunderers beard some people youve just got to show well weve shown em all right we have we really have yes andy sounded dazed having shown the world doubting george wanted to see for himself too he shouted for his unicorn when an orderly brought it he swung up into the saddle and rode north so he could see it for himself what will you do if an enemy attacks you sir colonel andy called after him whatll i do ill kill the bastard george answered his adjutant stared doubting george laughed didnt victory make the world seem fine back when rollant was a serf hed had to harvest rice and indigo on baron ormerods estate in palmetto province every year the job looked enormous far too large for the serfs on the estate to finish in time pitching in to do it only strengthened that feeling but then one day you realized it was almost done usually you realized that with something approaching astonishment where had all the work gone rollant had something of the same feeling now where had all the war gone no one in his regiment despised the northerners more than he did no one had better reason to despise them though some of the other blonds had reasons just as good but however much he loathed the traitors hed always known them as men who fought hard had anyone anywhere ever fought better for a worse cause he didnt think so yesterday bells men had gone right on fighting hard yes the southrons had driven them back but they hadnt had an easy time of it the army of franklin had retreated to this second ridge line in good order and theyd seemed ready enough to offer battle again today and the northerners had even fought hard in the early hours of the morning though theyd had footsoldiers coming at them from the south while hardriding jimmys unicornriders pressed them from the north before too long though they seemed to realize they simply did not have the men to hold off all their foes here being unable to hold off all their foes meant about the same thing as being unable to hold off any of those foes they seemed to realize that too the army of franklins battle was lost lost irretrievably once bells men figured that out once it sank in they did something rollant had never seen them do before they went to pieces rollant had northerners surrender to him without even complaining about yielding to a blond others instead of taking a shot they were all too likely to make at a standardbearer threw away their crossbows and ran that didnt always do them any good rollant and his comrades pursued and pursued hard not only that hardriding jimmys troopers still lay between the northerners and escape some of bells men surrendered to them others never got the chance troopers with quickshooting crossbows put a lot of bolts in the air more than a few of them struck home keep on keep on gods damn it colonel nahath shouted his voice cracking with excitement push em hard keep pushing drive em weve got em where we want em now we finish em off in all his time in king avrams army rollant had never heard orders like that no one on the southron side had ever had an excuse for giving orders like that now people didthey had that excuse and made the most of it come on sergeant joram bellowed they havent got much fight left in em lets kick em while theyre down the harder we pile on this time the easier the next battle getsif there is a next battle if there is a next battle no rollant hadnt heard anything like that before either but he didnt think joram was wrong waving the company standard he charged past blueuniformed northerners crumpled in death past blueuniformed northerners writhing in the torment of their wounds and past blueuniformed northerners throwing up their hands and hoping they could yield before someone killed them here and there by ones and twos and small groups some few of bells soldiers still showed fight but even when a whole company held together under a stubborn officer how long could it hold back the southrons not long as rollant and his comrades proved again and again and again even the bravest northern soldiers found that when attacked from three sides at once as they were repeatedly they could fall back or die those were the only choices they had they could not stem the southron tide keep after em sergeant joram yelled dont let em get away one more order whose like rollant had never heard he liked it joram looked around wheres the company standard here sergeant rollant waved the banner good thats good joram looked around again come on you lugs dont get lazy on me now gods damn it they didnt they tasted triumph as surely as the northerners tasted disaster this was what theyd waited for ever since theyd joined king avrams army many of them no doubt had wondered if it would ever come rollant knew he had now that it was here at last they intended to make the most of it waving the standard rollant trotted past a pair of repeating crossbows the men of the army of franklin had abandoned in their desperate retreat he eyed the engines with the respect they deserved how many southrons had they slain now his own side would use them against their former owners hed never understood the phrase poetic justice suddenly he did the soldiers of the army of franklin were falling back to the west and then to the north trying to wriggle out of the trap whose jaws were doubting georges footsoldiers and hardriding jimmys unicornriders with their quickshooting crossbows some of the traitors got away more didnt or so it seemed to rollant however much the southrons pushed their officers never seemed satisfied colonel nahath kept right on shouting for the men of his regiment to press the pursuit joram a company commander now but still not an officer did the same for his soldiers rollant not an officer and certain never to become one did his share of shouting too why not the stripes on his sleeve gave him the right his regiment along with the rest of john the listers wing followed bells men west and north although rollant would never make an officer he could see what john wanted to bring the army of franklin to battle one last time to roll over it and to wipe it off the face of the earth if they could make the northerners stop and fight they would wipe them off the face of the earth rollant could see that too much as john wanted it it didnt quite happen there was a time in the middle of the afternoon when rollant thought it would one of the southrons columns was moving faster than the shattered force of traitors it pursued if it could swing in hit bells men from the flank while the rest of the southrons assailed them from the rear rollant always believed the southrons waited a little too long to try before they could a regiment of ned of the forests unicornriders pitched into the head of that flanking column the unicornriders couldnt hope to beat the southrons but they could slow them down and they did meanwhile the remnant of the army of franklin got over a bridge across a rainswollen stream the southrons once they drove off neds men looked for another bridge or that failing a ford they didnt find one southron soldiers around rollant cursed furiously when their comrades came up short no less than he they understood what a successful attack then would have meant warll go on a while longer now smitty said in disgust im afraid so rollant agreed but its going our way by the gods it really is how far do you suppose weve come today hells with me if i know smitty looked back toward ramblerton rollant had no idea what good that did several rows of ridges hid the town from sight but maybe it helped smitty make whatever arcane calculations he required for he went on has to be six eight miles easy rollant thought it over then nodded yes that feels about right my feet are that tired id say not just my godsdamned feetall of me what i wouldnt give for a nice soft featherbed and a nice soft girl to keep me company there hed probably been on the point of saying blond girl when he remembered rollant was a blond himself blond women had a reputation for being easy even among southrons whod never seen a blond woman or man in all their lives rollant knew why his people had that reputation detinans in the north especially but not only nobles took blond women whenever they wanted to if the women already had husbands well so what either they could keep their mouths shut or they could end up deadand so could those husbands blonds died easily in the north no one asked a lot of questions when they did ill take the featherbed you can have the girl rollant said if this miserable war really is somewhere close to getting done ill go home to my wife before too long i hope so by the gods i miss her you could grab whatever you find the way most married men do out in the field smitty said shed never know i would rollant answered smitty shrugged and scratched his head rollants fidelity to norina never failed to bemuse him forward sergeant joram yelled his voice was raw and hoarse from all the shouting hed done the past couple of days he pointed to the bridge bells men had used to get over the stream if we can cross there ourselves well keep the heat on those northern sons of bitches they dont have much in front of the bridge and theyve been running all day theyll run some more if we push em we can do it king avram avram rollant shouted avram and freedom he didnt know whether the men from the army of franklin would run he didnt much care either if they tried to make a stand the southrons would roll over them only as he trotted toward the soldiers in blue did he blink even yesterday morning he wouldnt have assumed victory would come so easy run the northerners did they ran like rabbits in fact before the southrons even got within crossbow range they scampered over the bridge to jeers from john the listers soldiers cowards yellowbellies come back here and take your whipping you nasty naughty little boys that last shouted out by smitty made rollant laugh so hard he got a stitch in his side and had to slow down he was still short of the bridge when lightning crashed down on it and set it ablaze the northerners hadnt had much luck smiting southron soldiers with thunderbolts but nothing no spell seemed to keep them from calling down lightning on a place where no soldiers stood balked rollant and the rest of the southrons stared from the southern branch of the stream at the escaping northern soldiers a few northerners took shots at them before retreating most didnt bother theyd had enough engineers colonel nahath shouted and waved we need pontoons here by the gods we need em fast too the traitors are getting away the engineers did eventually come forward they did eventually bridge the stream by then though more than an hour of precious daylight on one of the shortest days of the year had been lost the soldiers who would go after the army of franklin understood as much too even though the pursuit would have taken them into new danger they cursed and fumed at the delay they knew a shattering victory when they saw one and they wanted to finish off bells army and crush it altogether it didnt quite happen bell and ned left behind crossbowmen and unicornriders who fought a series of stubborn rearguard actions and kept the southrons from overwhelming what was left of the army of franklin as twilight spread over the land rollant realized his comrades and he werentquitegoing to destroy the army of franklin that day a lone unicornrider came up to sergeant jorams company for a moment rollant thought the fellow was a messenger then he took a longer look and joined the cheers ringing out it was doubting george himself gods damn it to hells boys the commanding general said waving his hat at the southron soldiers didnt i tell you wed lick em didnt i tell you yes sir rollant roared along with everybody else and well finish the job too george said i aim to run the legs right off the traitors any of em who get away from usll be some of the fastest men nobodys crucified yet isnt that right yes sir the men cried even more excitedly than before doubting george rode past them as if he intended to capture singlehanded not only bell but also all the men the enemy general still commanded rollant turned to smitty who stood not far away you know something whats that your corporalship sir smitty asked george was the rock in the river of death but hes the hammer at ramblerton the hammer smitty paused tasting the words youre right by the thunderers lightning bolt i dont want to stop here tonight rollant said i want to go on the way doubting george went on i want to stomp the traitors into the ground i want them beaten gods damn it how about you smitty me smitty shrugged right now what i want is supper thus reminded of the flesh and blood of which he was made rollant realized he wanted supper too in fact he was ravenous he remembered gulping down a hasty breakfast had he had anything after that he didnt think so and hed come a long way since then a cook handed him a hard cracker and a chunk of raw dripping meat he roasted the gobbet on a stick over a fire without asking what it was beef dead donkey unicorn he didnt much care not right now it helped fill the hole in his belly next to that nothing else mattered picking his teeth with a twig smitty gave his own opinion of what supper had been i dont know for sure mind you but i think i just ate greataunt hilda thats disgusting rollant exclaimed i didnt know youd met the old battleaxe smitty answered rollant grimaced blithely smitty continued we shouldve turned greataunt hilda loose against the traitors shedve nagged em back into the kingdom in about five minutes tops youre ridiculous rollant said and im sure your greataunt hilda is too after all shes related to you but the way things are going i think we can handle the traitors without her smitty didnt argue evidently he thought so too marching down to ramblerton captain gremio had thought of the army of franklin as a dead man walking on the second day of the battle in front of the town the dead man stopped walking he fell over that was true only in the metaphorical sense literally speaking the army of franklin or those parts of it that managed to escape doubting georges men spent most of that second day in headlong retreat only when night fell at last could the survivors begin to take stock and figure out how enormous the disaster truly was but that came later when the second day of fighting started gremio whose regiment remained on the far right of lieutenant general bells line again thought the southrons werent pushing so hard as they might every attack they made his men and the rest of colonel florizels wing pushed back without much trouble sergeant thisbe said i dont much care what bell thinks sir it doesnt look to me like doubting george is putting all his weight into the fight here id say youre right sergeant gremio replied i wish you were wrong but id say youre right which makes me wonder if hes not putting his weight into the fight here where is he putting it he got his answer within an hour a horde of northern soldiers came running over from the left with southrons on their heels and even in their midst surrounded the men from the army of franklin cried footsoldiers some of them yelled unicornriders others shouted trapped outflanked they all seemed pretty sure about that from behind them came other shouts the kind gremio least wanted to hear king avram freedom hurrah for doubting george what do we do sir thisbe asked urgently the underofficer commanding a company didnt sound afraid gremio never remembered hearing thisbe sound afraid but gremio could hardly blame the sergeant for that urgency he also wished he had a better response than try to hold them back what else can we do them who thisbe said them the enemy or them our own men that was another excellent question gremio had no idea whether anything could stop the retreathe didnt want to think rout sweeping down on his regiment you soldiers he shouted doing his best get into line with us face the southrons maybe we can stop them a few of the retreatinghe didnt want to think fleeing eithersoldiers obeyed him he pulled some of his own men out of the southfacing trenches to join them but more men from the army of franklin kept right on going theyd had all the war they wanted and the southrons who hadnt been pushing hard now saw their foes in disarray and stepped things up more and more shouts of avram king avram came from what had been the left but was rapidly turning into another front more and more crossbow quarrels came from that direction too the southrons were putting more bolts in the air than gremio would have imagined possible from their numbers then he realized that when people talked about the quickshooting crossbows the southron unicornriders used they werent joking he also realized his makeshift line facing east wasnt going to hold at almost the same time he realized what had been the real line the line facing south was liable not to hold either captain theyre going to break through sergeant thisbe exclaimed in dismay what was obvious to gremio was also obvious to other people then hold fast by the gods men hold fast colonel florizel shouted diligently whipping a dead unicorn the soldiers on the right werent going to stop the southrons even if they died in place to the last man but florizel made more sense when he went on theyll just shoot you down from behind if you run away pikemen gremio yelled looking around for some we need more pikemen to hold the enemy off our crossbows not far away another officer was roaring crossbowmen gods damn it where can i get some crossbowmen the southrons are shooting down my pikemen and i cant answer back not enough crossbowmen gremio thought glumly not enough pikemen either we can put them together and have not enough of bothwhich is about what the north has everywhere these days even so he sent a runner to the officer who commanded pikemen they did join forces just as the southrons rolled down on them and they did prove not to have enough of both more than a little to gremios surprise they beat back the southrons first charge leaving dead and wounded men lying in front of their improvised line the pikemen did vicious work against the southrons who leaped down among them while the crossbowmen shot down avrams grayclad soldiers in droves gremio was proud of the detachment hed patched togetherproud for about five minutes then a mournful cry rose from his left were flanked as if to underscore that crossbow quarrels zipped up the line cutting down one northerner after another the southrons there on the left whooped with glee they knew what theyd done so did gremio he looked around wondering if making a stand here and selling his regiment as dearly as he could would let the rest of the army of franklin escape he was willing to sacrifice the men but only for something worthwhile he didnt see the point not here not now even colonel florizel had stopped shouting about holding fast florizel was a stubborn man but he wasnt altogether an idiot retreat gremio shouted he didnt like it but he didnt like getting destroyed either fall back form a new line as you can if you can he should have said a lot of his men had already started falling back without permission once they got it they fell back faster the army of franklin had some order left as the southrons drove its remnants north but only some gremio had heard of routs before up till now hed never been part of one today he was he felt like a man staggered after a blow to the head with a club because his regiment along with the rest of colonel florizels wing kept more cohesion than the rest of the army of franklin he went on trying to form new lines and hold back the southrons while the rest of bells men pelted off toward the north sometimes the enemy disrupted his efforts before they were well begun sometimes he did manage to hold them off for a while but then as they had before doubting georges soldiers would outflank the line hed pieced together then it was retreat again retreat or stand and be massacred one of his men asked why have the gods turned their backs on us captain he sounded not far from despair gremio felt not far from despair himself and had no time for anyone elses ask a priest he snapped maybe hed know or tell you he knows all i know is weve still got to try to come out of this in one piece the soldier sent him a wounded look he had no time for those either too many men were really wounded their groans filled his ears he looked back over his shoulders a couple of hundred yards to the rear stood a woodlot the trees barebranched and skeletal now that winter was at hand he didnt much care about the branches the trunks the trunks were a different story pointing to the trees he said well get in among them and use the trunks for cover we havent got time to dig trenches and the tree trunks will be better than nothing when the southrons get close well give em a volley theyll remember for a long time his men did too the southrons recoiled as much from surprisehere were northerners still showing fightas because of the damage the volley did but the surprise didnt last long neither did the recoil the men in gray started sliding around the woodlot to the east and west they also brought engines forward with what was to gremio truly damnable speed firepots flew through the air some of them smashed on bare ground those were harmless or near enough but the ones that hit trees set them afire before long the whole woodlot would burn not only that gremio saw the southrons outflanking move fall back he yelled once more coughing from the lungful of smoke hed inhaled fall back sergeant thisbe echoed well make another stand soon they cant drive us like this forever gremio wondered why not what was going to stop the southrons not the army of franklin not by what had happened today but thisbe had never been one to give up a fight as long as one last crossbow quarrel remained in the quiver before long gremio began to wonder whether that last bolt was gone doubting georges men were pressing him from the front and both flanks and theyd got so far ahead of his regiment that even retreat would be like running the gauntlet he thought about throwing aside his officers sword and raising his hands in the air the war would be over for him and he would have lived through it but he knew thisbe wouldnt surrender thisbe of all people would think it impossible and had good reasons to think so gremio couldnt stand to give up while the sergeant was watching and then quite suddenly he didnt have to a detachment of ned of the forests unicornriders came galloping up from the east and pitched into the southrons assailing gremios flank the men in gray taken by surprise scattered in wild disorder had they had any notion neds riders were close by they surely would have put up a better fight as things were no thank you kindly colonel gremio called to the rider who looked to be in charge of the detachment youre welcome the other officer answered touching the brim of his hat nice to know not quite everythings gone to hells in a handbasket isnt it not quite is about the size of it im afraid gremio said do you knew where or even if the army is going to make some real stand the colonel of unicornriders shook his head sorry captain wish i did colonel biffle colonel biffle sir a rider hurried up to the officer and reined in he pointed off to the west more footsoldiers in trouble over there sir with a weary sigh colonel biffle nodded well lets see if we cant get em out of it then he tipped his hat to gremio again nice talking with you captain sorry i cant stay longer good luck he rode off followed by his men colonel florizel limped over to gremio still here i see same to you sir gremio replied oh yes still here florizel shrugged wearily for how much longer though who knows theyve whipped us right and proper this time yes sir gremio admitted what he could hardly deny how do we go on after this how can we go on after this i have no idea florizel answered all i know is nobodys ordered me to throw down my sword till someone does im still in the fight until king geoffrey has to give up if he ever does hes still in the fight so weve got to keep grinding away see what happens next and hope its something good hes a simple man gremio thought not for the first time here though florizels simplicity amounted to strength the wing commander didnt worry about what he couldnt help he kept his mind on his own job and did that as well as he could anything else anything else wassimplybeyond his ken and he didnt dwell on it gremio wished he could ignore the world falling to pieces around him as well as his superior managed the trick if we can use a couple of more rearguard actions to get some separation between our main force florizel began you mean the biggest mob of soldiers running away gremio broke in florizel only nodded he didnt even bother quarreling about the way gremio put it if we can get some separation he went on we can salvage something from the ruins anyhow an army that can keep doubting george from marching all the way through dothan to shell bay the way hesmucets marching through peachtree maybe gremio said though he wasnt sure the army of franklin could have done that even before the southrons smashed it to bits it certainly would have had a better chance then he couldnt deny that either gods damn it were free detinans florizel said as if gremio had claimed they were blond serfs id sooner die on my feet than live on my knees yes sir gremio said but id sooner live on my feet if i possibly can florizel considered that by the startled look on his face it hadnt occurred to him up till now after more than a little thought he nodded yes that would be best wouldnt it it would if we could manage it i mean i dont know how were going to we have to get away from the southrons gremio preferred not to mention that only a little while before hed almost surrendered to doubting georges men florizel didnt need to know that it hadnt happened and nowmaybeit wouldnt gremio dared hope anyhow but even if they did get back up to dothan or great river province what could they do then precious little not after the losses theyd taken for years the army of franklin had been the heart of king geoffreys power here in the east now it was broken and so was that power how could it be revived could it be revived gremio didnt know he shook his head no that wasnt true he did know he just didnt care to think about what he knew for as long as lieutenant general bell could he looked on the second days fighting in front of ramblerton much as he had on the first days the southrons had pushed his men hard but hed held his lines together even if he had had to give some ground the night before though his wing commanders and ned of the forest had agreed with him or at least not disagreed too loudly none of them had quarreled with his intention of inviting the second day of battle none of them had seen any better choices available to the army of franklin tonight though tonight the wing commanders and ned didnt wait to be summoned they sought bell out in the pavilion hed run up when he couldnt find a farmhouse as night fell one word came from all the officers disaster sir my wing was attacked from front rear and flank all at the same time stephen the pickle said those godsdamned southron unicornriders with their quickshooting crossbows he shuddered we didnt break not in any ordinary sense of the word they tore us to shreds not much of what was the left is left or of the center benjamin the heated ham said the southrons tore us to pieces too from the front and then from the flank when the left retreated he nodded to stephen seeing what happened to it i dont know how it could have done anything but retreat bell turned to florizel and you colonel what have you got to say hed expected the least from florizel hed got the most a fair part of florizels wing remained in good fighting trimor as good as any in the army of franklin well sir florizel answered we thought the hardest blows would fall on us and id say we got the softest thats why were not in such dreadful shapecompared to the other wings i mean even there a knife hed expected to take the hardest blows because bell had said they would fall on the right but bell had been mistaken did florizel also think hed been mistaken elsewhere in the campaign the general commanding bristled he didnt believe that regardless of whether anyone else did question now is how do we pick up the pieces if we can i mean ned of the forest said what have we got to pick up stephen the pickle asked sourly we left most of the pieces on the field that is not so bell declared the army of franklin remains in being it remains a fighting force no one contradicted him he found himself wishing somebody would have the chilling silence from ned of the forest and the wing commanders hurt worse than any argument could have done the officers just stood in poses of weary dismay they didnt bother quarreling with him it was as if they were beyond quarreling as if the catastrophe was too obvious to need any more quarrels in what was for him an unwontedly small voice lieutenant general bell asked what do we do tomorrow fall back two wing commanders and ned said the same thing at the same time ned added the southrons will be coming after us with everything theyve got with all those unicornriders and their quickshooting crossbows and with their swarm of footsoldiers theyve got a lot theyre going to want to finish us off unless we scoot theyll do it too cant we stop them bell said in dismay if we take a strong defensive position and force them to come at us theyll roll right over us benjamin the heated ham broke in all the other officers nodded somber agreement ned added that pick a good place and make em come at usthatll do for rearguard actions well have to fight a lot of em i reckon to keep the southrons off our main body if we can more nods from the wing commanders stephen the pickle said if we can get away thats a victory thats about as much as we can hope for too if you men abandon the idea of victory you condemn this army to irrelevance bell said horrified benjamin the heated ham replied if you try to win a victory now sir you condemn this army to extinction once more the rest of the officers in the pavilion solemnly nodded bell started to ask what they would do if he ordered them to attack or even to stand and fight he started to but he didnt the answer was entirely too obvious they would disobey him even he could see he was better off not giving some orders with a long sigh he said you are dismissed gentlemen in the morning we will see what we can do they ducked out of the pavilion one after another left all alone again bell eased himself down into a folding chair then leaned his crutches against the chairs wooden arm gods damn it he said softly gods damn it to all seven hells he wished he were whole a whole man had choices a cripple didnt had he been whole he could have hurled himself into the fighting when things went wrong he could have killed several of doubting georges men on his own he could have made them kill him he wouldnt have had to live through the disastrous battle wouldnt have had to suffer this humiliation and once dead he could have looked the thunderer and the lion god in the eye and assured them hed been as gallant as it was given to a mortal man to be instead here he sat with the army of franklin as mutilated as he was he pulled out the little bottle of laudanum and stared at it then he pulled the stopper off with his teeth if he gulped the whole bottle instead of his usual swig maybe that would be enough to stop his heart on the other hand maybe it wouldnt hed got used to ever bigger doses of the drug hed had to to come even close to holding his unending pain at bay a small gulp sufficed him he put the bottle back into the pouch on his belt in a little while some of the pain from his wounds would ease in a little while some of the pain from the lost battle would recede too yes laudanum was marvelous stuff relief had just started to sparkle along his veins when a scryer came into the pavilion and said sir king geoffrey would speak to you by crystal ball would he bell said grandly and what if i would not speak to him instead of answering that the scryer stood there with his mouth hanging open in surprise maybe that was lucky for bell he reached for his crutches unfreezing the scryer said ill tell him youre on the way yes do that bell said but as the scryer turned to go he added wait what does the king want to talk about why how the fight went sir the scryer replied what else yes what else the commanding general agreed gloomily the laudanum hadnt done nearly enough to shield him from what was bound to be king geoffreys wrath go on go on tell his majesty im coming as fast as i can the scryer disappeared lieutenant general bell wished he could do the same hed led the army of franklin south hed fought hard and hed lost hed lost disastrously in fact had he won he would have been a hero he hadnt he wasnt instead of the credit he would get the blame that was how things worked bell couldnt have moved fast even if hed wanted to he wanted anything but this camp seemed much too small to house the army of franklin up till tonight it would have been but this was what remained of the army bell scowled and shook his head wounded men groaned as healers and mages did their best to help them a cricket too stupid to realize how cold it was let out a few lethargic chirps an owl hooted a unicorn whickered soldiers snored only a few hitching steps to the scryers pavilion a guard outside held the tent flap wide so bell could go in he could have done without the courtesy there was the kings face in one of the crystal balls the others were mercifully dark bell wished this one would have been too as usual folding himself so his fundament came down on a stool was an adventure but he managed your majesty he said nodding to the image in the crystal ball lieutenant general king geoffrey favored him with a single curt nod geoffrey had a lean almost ascetic countenance with burning eyes a long thin blade of a nose and a disconcerting beard it grew under his chin but not on the front of it bell who sported a particularly luxuriant growth of face foliage had never understood why his sovereign chose to trim his whiskers that way how may i serve you your majesty bell asked tell me how things stand in the east the king replied have you won the victory over the southrons our cause so badly needs well no not yet bell said looking down at the dirt under his foot king geoffrey frowned he looked unhappy even at his most cheerful when he was unhappy a man could watch the end of the world on his face and hed been a soldier so he knew what questions to ask to determine the exact situation tell me your present position he said crisply we are about fourteen miles north of ramblerton lieutenant general bell replied wishing he had the nerve to come right out and lie to his sovereign geoffreys eyebrows leaped like startled stags fourteen miles he burst out did i hear you correctly lieutenant general he sounded as if he hoped he hadntnot for his own sake but for bells but he had yes your majesty the commanding general said unhappily what happened king geoffrey demanded you lost twelve miles of ground today more like ten miles bell said we lost a couple of miles in yesterdays fighting but we took a strong defensive position at the end of it geoffrey rolled his eyes the motion shown in perfect miniature inside the crystal ball seemed even more painfully scornful than it would have face to face oh yes lieutenant general it must have been a wonderfully strong defensive position his sarcasm flayed by the thunderers thumbs you probably would have run all the way up to dothan by now if the godsdamned southrons had forced you out of a weak position bell hung his head we held their footsoldiersmost of them anyhowfor quite a while he said but hardriding jimmys unicornriders got into our rear with their quickshooting crossbows and and and we broke there hed said it he waited for the king to do or say whatever he would you broke geoffreys voice was eerily flat yes your majesty we were assailed from front rear and flank by an army more than twice our size we fought hard we fought bravely for a very long time but in the end in the end we couldnt take the pounding any more the men did what men will do they tried to save themselves assailed from front rear and flank by an army more than twice your size king geoffrey echoed still in that tone that showed nothing of what he was thinking and how pray tell did you manage to put the army of franklin in such an enviable strategic position your majesty bell said reproachfully answer me gods damn you geoffrey screamed loud enough to make every scryer in the tent whip his head toward the crystal ball from which that anguished cry had come you went south to whip avrams men not to to throw your own army down the latrine this result is not what i intended your majesty a man who walks in front of a runaway unicorn doesnt intend to get gored either which does him no good at all king geoffrey ground out my army lieutenant general bell give me back my army i would like nothing better your majesty bell whispered how many men have you got left the king asked any at all or is it just you and some godsdamned scryer wandering in the dark no sir not just me bell said with such dignity as he could muster after the the initial collapse he had to keep hesitating we retired in fairly good order we could fight again tomorrow if we had to wed get slaughtered but we could fight by the way king geoffreys eyebrows twitched he was thinking the same thing but he didnt say anything about that what he did say was you did not answer my question lieutenant general how many men have you got left sir i have not tried to make a count bell answered my best guess would be about half of those who went into todays fight half geoffrey yelped painfully thats even worse than i thought and i thought id thought things were as bad as they could be now he paused perhaps wondering whether hed said what he meant to say apparently deciding he had he continued what happened to the rest of them shot speared not not all your majesty bell said the king seemed intent on embarrassing him every way he could some unknown but i fear fairly large number of men were captured by doubting georges footsoldiers and unicornriders and probably glad to come out of it alive geoffrey commented yet more acid in his voice what do you aim to do now whatever it is do you think it will matter or will the southrons smash you to pieces come what may i dont think so your majesty bell said we still can resist king geoffrey hadnt asked him how many engines hed lost that was likely just as well if the king heard that doubting georges men had captured more than fifty hed burst like a firepot except with even more heat and bell couldnt blame him however much he wanted to he almost blamed himselfalmost but not quite the disaster had to be someone elses fault didnt it ix had general guildenstern won a victory he would have got drunk to celebrate john the lister was sure of it he saw doubting george drunk too but drunk on triumph rather than spirits i told you so george cackled gods damn it i told you so i told you and i told marshal bart too and do you know what else i was right thats what else we didnt just lick em we fornicating wrecked em yes sir john said dutifully he would rather have won a victory under doubting george than under baron logan the black who would have been promoted over his head the more george carried on though the more john wondered if listening to the general commanding was worth the triumph it was of course it was he couldnt remember ever making such an astounding amazing fantastic advance against the traitors and wondered if it had an analog anywhere in the war between the provinces prisoners by the thousands their war over at last shambling off into captivity more northerners dead on the field and in the long retreat north from the field more captured catapults and repeating crossbows than hed ever seen before wrecked em doubting george repeated and john the lister could only nod the commanding general went on im going off to the scryers tent marshal bart and baron logan need to know what weve done today and so does king avram yes sir so does king avram away he went a procession of one john the lister nodded again no one doubted doubting george now hed said he needed to wait and would win once he was done waiting and what hed said hed done could he have won without waiting john still thought so but it didnt matter any more and john still a new brigadier of the regulars knew this victory was better for his career than any baron logan the black could have won he was georges reliable secondincommand he would have been logans secondincommand too but he would have been passed over for the main prize now nobody could say that about him and a good thing too he thought colonel nahath came up to him after the salutes and the congratulations nahath said ive got a little problem id like to talk over with you sir go ahead john said expansively nobody has big problems not after today whats your little one well sir one of my company commanders lieutenant griff got killed in yesterdays fighting nahath said sergeant joram took over the company and did well with it id like to promote him to lieutenant go ahead john repeated thats your problem we should all have such little worries but colonel nahath shook his head no sir thats not my problem the problem is id like to promote my standardbearer a corporal into the sergeants slot jorams leaving open hes carried the banner well and hes fought bravely he should get another stripe if hes as good as all that go ahead and promote him by the gods john the lister said why are you flabbling about it anyway because the corporals a blond sir oh sure enough that got johns attention he snapped his fingers i remember this is the fellow who grabbed the flagstaff when your standardbearer got killed over in peachtree isnt it the one you said deserved a chance to fail as a corporal yes sir his name is rollant and he hasnt failed as a corporal hes had to win a fight or two to hold the rank which an ordinary detinan wouldnt have but hes done it from what poor griff told me rollant told him he didnt dare lose the colonel from new eborac said if he can do a corporals job why not a sergeants hes earned the chance to fail again but this time i dont think he will a blond sergeant john the lister said musingly who would have imagined that when the war started king avram would have i think nahath answered john pursed his lips when avram announced his intention of freeing the blond serfs from the land and from their ancient ties to their liege lords who had taken him seriously well grand duke geoffrey and the northern nobles had but that was a different story people in the south hadnt dreamt blonds could ever amount to much even if they did have the right to leave the land from a southron point of view the war at first had been much more about holding detina together than it had been about removing the serfs from bondage to the land but maybe avram really had seen something in the blonds that almost everyone else missed you may be right colonel john said solemnly yes you may be right you dont object if i promote this fellow then nahath asked i wanted to make sure before i went and did it if hes been a good corporal odds are hell make a good sergeant john said go ahead and do it the other thing to remember is it likely wont matter as much as it would have a year ago i dont see how the war can last a whole lot longer not after what weve done the past couple of days i hope youre right sir id like to go home get back to the life i left when the fighting started nahath said he was a colonel of volunteers not a regular at all when the war ended he would take off his gray uniform and go back to running his farm or putting up manufactories or practicing law or whatever he did john didnt know what that was hed never asked he would be glad to go on soldiering even if hed never again lead another army the size of the one hed commanded here he didnt see how he could the only enemies in his lifetime whod truly challenged detina were other detinans he said ive seen regular officers who didnt do their jobs as well as you do colonel he spoke the truth nahath was everything anyone could want as a regimental commander though he might have been out of his depth trying to lead a brigade or a division nahath touched the brim of his gray felt hat now i thank you very much sir ive done my best but this isnt my proper trade he looked north toward what was left of the army of franklin what will we do tomorrow i dont know not for a fact i spoke with doubting george a little while ago but he didnt say john the lister replied still my guess would be that well go on driving them as hard as we can i dont think the general commanding will be content to let the traitors remnant get away if we can take that army off the board altogether yes sir that would be a heavy blow to whatever hopes the north has left nahath nodded good i hoped youd say something along those lines saluting he did a smart aboutface and marched off whatever he does back in new eborac ill bet hes a success at it john thought then he started to laugh it wasnt necessarily so marshal bart the one southron officer whod won victory after victory even in the dark days when few others did had failed at everything he tried away from the army only after he redonned his gray tunic and pantaloons did he show what he could do shouts and cheers rang out not far away john hurried over to find out what was going on picking his way past the campfires came hardriding jimmy every man who saw the young commander of unicornriders tried to clasp his hand or pound his back or give him a flask by the way he swayed hed already swigged from quite a few flasks john came forward to congratulate jimmy too well done he said without you we couldnt have broken them the way we did jimmys answering grin was wide and foolish yes hed done some celebrating before he got this far thank you kindly sir he said you didnt do too bad yourself by the lion gods holy fangs every day another step john said on a night where hardriding jimmy and even doubting george were sounding like the great detinan conquerors of days gone by the men whod subjected the blonds he could afford to be or at least to sound like the voice of reason he added we took a big step today none bigger hardriding jimmy said no sir none bigger ive never seen the traitors go to pieces like this before he flashed that grin again i hope i see it some more do you expect anything different from now on john asked jimmy shook his head not me theyre ruined itd take a miracleno by the thunderers balls itd take a miracle and a half for them to rally after this bells got to be fit to be tied from what we did to him hes still got ned of the forest john remarked curious to see what the mention of one leading commander of unicornriders would do to the other neds a fine officer hardriding jimmy said with the owlish sincerity of a man whod had a little too much to drink a fine officer dont get me wrong but we whipped his men and well whip em again next time we bump into em too theyre plenty brave never braverdont get me wrong if he hadnt had too much to drink he wouldnt have repeated the phrase but he hasnt got enough troopers and he hasnt got enough proper weapons to give us a real fight those quickshooting crossbows make that much difference john asked hells yes i should say so hardriding jimmy exclaimed sir inside of five years the ordinary crossbow will be gone from the detinan army gone i tell you it makes a decent hunting weapon but thats all with quickshooters well sweep the blond savages off the eastern steppe like that he snapped his fingers but without a sound he tried again this time it worked that gods damn it well after what youve done the past two days i cant very well tell you you dont know your business john the lister said he clapped hardriding jimmy on the back again grinning still the commander of unicornriders lurched off brigadier john a runner called john turned and waved to show hed heard the messenger hurried over to him im glad i caught up with you sir doubting georges compliments and the orders for the morning for your wing are hard pursuit you are to take an eastern route as best you can and try to get ahead of the traitors that way with luck we can surround them and wipe them out hard pursuit by an eastern route john repeated im to get out in front of the army of franklin if i can my compliments to the commanding general in return i understand the orders and ill obey them with another salute the runner trotted away george had brought engineers forward to put more bridges across the stream that had slowed pursuit the evening before as soon as they got near the far bank northern snipers started shooting at them the southrons pushed repeating crossbows up to the edge of the stream and hosed down the brush on the north bank of the stream with quarrels they sent men in gray in there after the northerners too all that slowed but did not stop the sniping slowing it let the bridges reach the north bank and let the southrons cross with ease after that the snipers fell back riding at the front of his column of footsoldiers john the lister pushed ahead as hard as the tired men would go every once in a while off to the west he got a glimpse of the remnants of the army of franklin which was also moving north at something close to double time the traitors had to be even more weary than his own men how long could they continue that headlong withdrawal john grinned not long enough or so he hoped he was about to order his men to swing in on the fleeing northerners when a crossbow quarrel zipped past his head if he could see bells men they could see him too and even bell no great generalas hed proved again and againcould see what the southrons had in mind bells rear guard came from ned of the forests troopers they were as every southron whod ever met them had reason to know a stubborn bunch here they were fighting mostly dismounted from a stand of trees that gave them good cover john the lister wanted to roll over them even so he wanted to but discovered he couldnt they knocked his first attack back on its heels cursing he shouted deploy well flank them out by the lion gods mane and his men did exactly that with some help from hardriding jimmys unicornriders they did it yes but doing it took them an hour and a half they didnt damage neds force very much either instead of waiting to be surrounded and slaughtered the northern troopers went back to their unicorns and rode off when their position grew difficult they wouldnt have any trouble catching up with bells retreating column of footsoldiers they wouldntbut john the listers men would while the southrons were fighting that rearguard action the main body of their foes marched several miles john did some more cursing step it up boys he called the soldiers tried hed feared he was asking more of them than flesh and blood could give toward evening they came close to catching up with the northerners again again though a detachment of neds troopers this time backed up by footsoldiers in blue delayed them long enough to let bells main force get away well keep after them john declared he wondered if they would be able to make the traitors stand and fight though ned of the forest supposed he might have been more disgusted but he had trouble seeing how one thing that might have let him show more disgust would have been less to worry about he was as busy as a onearmed juggler with the itch the southrons knew they had the army of franklin on the run for once that didnt satisfy them they wanted the army deadno not just dead extinct they were liable to get what they wanted too bell had given ned the dubious honor of commanding the rear guard against doubting georges onrushing army ned didnt want the job the only reason hed taken it was that he couldnt see anyone else who had even a chance of bringing it off theyre going to hound us all the way out of franklin biff he said at the end of the first days retreat yes sir colonel biffle nodded gods damn me to all the hells if i see how we can stop em either stop em ned started he didnt know whether he felt more like laughing or crying since both would have made colonel biffle worry he contented himself with a growl that could have come from the throat of a tiger in the far northern jungle by the thunderers belly button biff were not going to stop those stinking sons of bitches if we can slow em down enough so they dont eat all of bells army king geoffrey ought to pin a medal on us just for that yes sir biffle said and then after a long long pause if we cant stop em though lord ned the wars as good as lost ned of the forest only grunted in response as hed tried not to show pain whenever he was wounded he didnt think his regimental commander was wrongwhich only made the words hurt worse what do we do sir biffle asked what do we do if if king avrams bastards really can lick us the best we can our ownselves ned answered firmly they havent done it yet and i aim to make it as hard for them as i can as long as we keep fighting weve got a chance if we throw up our hands and quit we really are licked yes sir colonel biffle sounded a little happierbut only a little when ned of the forest got a good look at his own troopers after their latest encounter with john the listers footsoldiers he understood why their heads were down their shoulders slumped for the first time they looked like beaten men they kept on yes but they plainly had no faith in what they were doing come on boys ned called well hang a few more bruises on those southron bastards and after a while theyll give up and go home we can do it we always have whats one more time a few of the unicornriders smiled and perked up most of them though kept that trampled look theyd been wearing when they compared what they heard to what they saw they realized the two didnt match and what they saw what everyone in the east who followed king geoffrey couldnt help seeing was a great tide of disaster rising up to roll over them and drown them captain watson rode up to ned the young officer in charge of his siege engines said sir the catapults are about played out weve done so much shooting with em the sinew skeins are stretched to death our range is down and our accuracy is worse where can we get more sinew hamstring some southrons ned answered watson started to chuckle but then broke off as if unsure whether ned was kidding ned wasnt sure he was kidding either but he didnt contradict when watson said i cant do that sir well to the hells with me if i know where youll come up with any sinew ned said sinners yessinners weve got swarms of but sinew he shook his head what else can you use next best thing is hair long coarse hair watson answered then shave the unicorns ned said at once cut off their manes trim their tails do whatever you need to do start with my beast can troopers twist hair into skeins uh yes sir id think so watson said dazedly its not hard to do once you know how all right get started on it then show em what they need to do dont waste any time ned said were going to need those enginesyou can bet on that captain watson nodded oh yes sir i know i do believe i would have come up with that notion myself but i know i wouldnt have done it so fast he laughed after all i didnt do it so fast did i never mind ned of the forest said just get on with it where it comes from doesnt matter long as you can make it work do you know sir there are menmore than a few of them toowho would want a promotion for coming up with an idea like that watson said you dont even seem to care i dont much ned said nobodys going to promote me now im already a lieutenant general and king geoffrey isnt going to fancy up my epaulets any more besides the mess were in now the idea counts more than whoever had it some of his troopers didnt care for the scheme at all it wasnt that they minded twisting unicorn hair into skeins for the catapults and repeating crossbows they didnt but they hated the way the unicorns looked once shorn of shaggy manes and tails in piteous tones one of them said lord ned those godsdamned southronsre going to laugh at us when they see us riding such sorry beasts too bad ned answered heartlessly if they do laugh watsonll shoot em out of the saddle with the hair hes taken that counts for more because he was who he was he bullied them into going along with him with a minimum of fuss and feathers that captain watson had trimmed his unicorn first helped and the unicorn did look sorry after it was trimmed more like an overgrown white rat with a horn on its nose than one of the beautiful noble beasts that added a touch of style and oldtime glory to modern battlefields most of which taken all in all were anything but glorious but if their leader was willing to go into a fight on a unicorn that looked like that the troopers couldnt very well cavil and ned for his part didnt care what his mount looked like he felt none of what northern officers of higher blood called the romance of the unicorn as far as he was concerned a unicorn was for getting from one place to another faster than he could walk or run hed had plenty of mounts killed under him if this one shorn or not lasted to the end of the war he would be astonished watsons engine crews spent the wee small hours threading the roughly made skeins of unicorn hair into the engines their thumping and banging and clattering kept ned awake those werent the usual noises he heard in the field and they bothered him on account of that he poured honey into a cup of nasty tea the next morning trying to make it palatable it stayed nasty but at least was sweeter there not ten feet away stood captain watson doing the same thing well captain ned called pretty well sir watson answered sipping from his tin cup and making an unhappy face how about you hells with me ned said how are the engines in working order watson said better than they were before we reskeined em thank you sir never mind me ned told him long as we can give the southrons grief they got a fair amount of grief themselves later that morning beating back an attack from some of hardriding jimmys troopers the two disastrous days of fighting in front of ramblerton had made ned of the forest despise the southron unicornriders they would have made any normal man fear those troopers but ned reserved fear for the gods and doled it out sparingly even to them the southrons had too many men and could put too many bolts in the air to make it any kind of fair fight that being so ned didnt try to make it one either instead he used a feigned retreat to lead the eager southronswho did jeer at his mens funnylooking unicornsstraight up to captain watsons engines which sat cunningly concealed at the edge of a thicket watson had been rightthe engines worked the way they were supposed to a barrage of firepots and stones greeted the southrons so did the nasty mechanical clackclackclack of the repeating crossbows southrons tumbled out of the saddle unicorns crashed to the ground as if theyd run headlong into a wall the survivors galloped away from the trap a lot faster than theyd galloped towards it theres a proper job of licking them watson said beaming colonel biffle remained gloomy theyll be back the stinking sons of bitches oh yes theyll be back ned of the forest agreed but they wont be back for a while the time they spend figuring out how they stuck their peckers in the meat grinder our footsoldiers can use to get away thats what the game were playing is all about right now they wont be so easy to trick next time biffle said that was also true without a doubt hardriding jimmy had shown himself to be no fool but ned said other side of the copper is from now on theyll look before they leap thatll slow them down we want them slow we dont want em charging all over the landscape captain watson nodded he understood colonel biffle had a harder time he still wanted to beat the southrons here even if he knew how unlikely that was to change the course of the war ned had stopped worrying about beating them at least in the sense he would have used for the word before setting out on this campaign delaying them counted as a victory for it let the battered fragments of the army of franklin put more distance between themselves and doubting georges disgustingly numerous revoltingly wellfed and alarmingly wellarmed soldiers it isnt fair ned thought it isnt even close to fair if we had that many men and could give them the food and gear they need he laughed though it wasnt really funny if the north could have raised and supported armies like that of course it would have broken away from king avrams rule but it couldnt it couldnt come close and nobody had ever said war was the least bit fair ned included hed used every trick he knew and invented several fresh tricks on the spur of the moment expecting the southrons not to use their advantages of wealth and manpower was like wishing for the moon you could do it but that didnt mean youd get what you wished for a rider came up and pointed to the northeast the southrons are trying to slip around our flank again lord ned he said well wed better try and stop the bastards then eh ned said yes sir the messenger said and then erhow sir you leave that to me ned handled the problem with unfussy competence it wasnt as if he hadnt dealt with such situations before detaching men from the right he shifted them around behind the center to extend the left general hesmucet had made the same sort of flanking maneuver again and again for king avrams army in peachtree province the year before as hardriding jimmy was using now and count joseph the gamecock had matched it time after time joseph had traded space for time again and again not bell not after he took command of the army of franklin hed gone right out and slugged toe to toe with hesmucets bigger army which went a long way toward putting the army of franklin in its present unhappy predicament ned shifted captain watsons engines along with the men from the right they were the only things that could give his riders a decent chance against the quickshooting crossbows hardriding jimmys men used by the shouts of dismay from the southrons when the repeating crossbows clattered into action jimmys troopers knew it too of course had neds unicornriders already been under attack on the right when hardriding jimmys men hit them on the left he wouldnt have been able to shift troopers and engines like that all through the war the southrons had had a certain trouble coordinating their blows a good thing too ned thought theydve whipped us a long time ago if they really knew what they were doing northern magecraft had also helped hold king avrams armies at bay that made it all the more disconcerting when lightning crashed down from a clear sky and wrecked one of captain watsons precious newly reskeined catapults a few minutes later another deadly accurate thunderbolt set a second siege engine afire major marmaduke ned of the forest roared furiously where in the godsdamnation are you you worthless excuse for a mage the wizard in the blue robe came over at a fast trot im sorry sir he quavered ill do my best but hes too quick and strong for me hed better not be ned ground out without those engines my troopers are dead men if they lose them major youre a dead man marmaduke went even paler than he was already he did not make the mistake of thinking ned was joking when the commander of unicornriders spoke in such tones joking was the furthest thing from his mind and perhaps more inspired by fear than hed ever been by patriotism major marmaduke succeeded in deflecting the next strokes from the southron sorcerer the lightnings smote yes but not where the engines were the invaluable repeating crossbows survived and kept spitting death at hardriding jimmys men eventually the southron unicornriders drew back in discouragement made it through another day ned of the forest thought how many more rollant wasnt much with needle and thread his wife would have laughed if shed seen the clumsy botches hed made of some repairs to his uniform but norina was back in new eborac city so he had to do what he could for himself and sewing a third stripe on his sleeve wasnt a duty it was a pleasure hed never expected to make sergeants rank come to that hed never expected to make corporals rank either if the south hadnt needed bodies to throw at false king geoffreys men he might never have got into the army at all bodies his mouth twisted at that if two detinan soldiers hadnt suddenly become no more than bodies he wouldnt have been promoted once let alone twice and he knew it snatching up the company standard when the standardbearer went down won him his corporals stripesthat of course and staying alive once he did it and now lieutenant griff was dead too sergeant joram was lieutenant joram and corporal rollant became sergeant rollant ordinary detinans could get promoted without having someone die to open a slot for them blonds it didnt look that way but ordinary detinans could also get promoted when someone did die sitting crosslegged in front of the fire by rollant was smitty who was making heavy weather of sewing a corporals two stripes onto the sleeve of his gray tunic he pricked himself yelped and looked up from what he was doing this whole business of being an underofficer seems like more trouble than its worth he said no rollant shook his head oh no not even a little bit this is as good as it getsit says the army likes what youre doing what kind of a man you are to him that meant a great dealmeant everything in fact respect always came grudgingly to blonds when it came at all but smitty a detinan born took his status for granted i know what kind of man i am gods damn it im a man whos sick of getting shot at whos sick of sleeping on the ground and whos ready to pack this whole stinking war in and go home cant do that not yet not till its over rollant said dont remind me smitty said mournfully he raised his voice to call out to a couple of common soldiers to gather up water bottles and fill them at a nearby creek see what happens one of them said a detinan speaking his mind as detinans did you havent even got the stripes on your sleeve yet and already youre treating people like you were a liege lord off he went still grumbling smitty turned to rollant thunderers ballocks sergeant but were getting a poor sort of common soldier these days his voice brimmed with righteous indignation rollant gaped at him then started to laugh when you were a common soldier and i was a corporal didnt you bray like a whipped ass whenever i asked you to do the least little thing if that wasnt you it sure looked a lot like you oh but i didnt understand then smitty said now i do i know what you understand rollant told him you understand youd rather get somebody else to do something for you than do it yourself well what else is there to understand smitty said although the blond thought smitty was joking he wasnt sure he answered ill say this smitty the liege lords up here think the same way its great for them but not for their serfs fine smitty said you can do as much work as a common soldier and still keep your stripes or you couldi dont see you doing it its different in the army rollant insisted how because rollant grimaced spelling out what he meant wasnt so easy he did his best because the army tells me what im supposed to do and what all sergeants and corporals are supposed to do and it doesnt have one set of rules for ordinary detinans and a different set for blondsnow that blonds get paid the same as ordinary detinans it doesnt anyway that never was fair smitty allowed godsdamned right it wasnt rollant growled if they send us out to get killed the same as anybody else wed better make the same silver as anybody else too and sergeant joramwhen he was a sergeant i meandid the same things as im doing so if you dont like it take it up with him no thanks smitty said in a way implying that that subject wasnt open to discussion whether he liked the rules or not he didnt like joram regardless of rank he went back to sewing the stripes onto his sleeve rollant returned to adding the sergeants stripe joram came up to the fire with a shiny new lieutenants epaulet on the left shoulder of his old faded gray tunic the only place the tunic still displayed its original color was where the underofficers chevrons hed just cut off had protected the wool from sun and rain when rollant and smitty jumped to their feet and saluted joram grimaced as you were he said and then im not used to thisnot even close i never wanted to be an officer i never wanted to be a corporal either smitty muttered shall i tear those stripes off before you finish putting em on then joram asked smitty hastily shook his head lieutenant joram nodded in something approaching satisfaction rollant couldnt say he hadnt wanted his promotion he hadnt counted on it he hadnt even particularly expected it but hed craved it just as hed craved corporals rank after giving himself the chance to earn it rank meant the detinans had to recognize what hed done it would vanish at the end of the war but what it meant would remain inside him forever is all well here joram asked plainly serious about meeting his new responsibilities yes sir rollant and smitty chorused good the new company commander went off to another campfire the troopers smitty had sent out came back with the water bottles they started to dump them at the new corporals feet rollant shook his head you know thats not how you do it take each one to the man it belongs to and give it to him to begin with you can give me mine he took it from one of the soldiers hed delivered plenty of water bottles before he got promoted now that was someone elses worry rollant didnt miss it or cutting firewood or digging latrine trenches or any of the other duties common soldiers got stuck with because they were so common smitty unrolled his blanket and started wrapping himself in it we ought to grab whatever shuteye we can he said come morning theyll try and march the legs off us again he wasnt wrong as rollant knew too well his own legs were weary too he could feel just how much marching hed done but he said as long as weve got the traitors on the run ill keep going id chase that serfcatching son of a bitch of a ned of the forest all the way up into shell bay if i could he came after you when you ran away smitty asked a strange blend of sympathy and curiosity in his voice not himhes always worked here in the east rollant answered but there are plenty more like him over by the western ocean i hate em all i know every trick there is for shaking hounds off a trail and i needed most of them too and you did all that so you could come down to new eborac and get yourself three stripes smitty said you ask me it was more trouble than it was worth rollant also spread out his blanket he knew smitty was pulling his leg some jokes were easier to take than others though maybe it looks that way to you the blond said to me though these three stripes mean a hells of a lot they mean i can give ordersi dont have to take em my whole life long smitty eyed him as he cocooned himself in the thick wool blanket you may be a blond your sergeantly magnificence he said but i swear by all the gods you talk more like a detinan every day its rubbed off on melike the itch rollant answered and fell asleep up up up lieutenant joram shouted at some ungodsly hour of the morning all rollant knew when his eyes came open was that it was still dark he groaned and unwrapped himself and relieved his own misery by booting out of their bedrolls the men whod managed to ignore the racket joram was making after hot strong tea and oatmeal thick and sweet and sticky with molasses the soldiers started after the army of franklin again rollant had had to get used to the idea of eating oatmeal when he came down to new eborac in palmetto province oats fed asses and unicorns not people right now though he would have eaten anything that didnt eat him marching and fighting took fuel and lots of it the northerners had also abandoned their encampments a few miles north of those of doubting georges army but theyd left ned of the forests unicornriders and a small force of footsoldiers behind to slow down the retreating southrons the troopers and crossbowmen would take cover fight till they were on the point of being outflanked and then fall back to do it again somewhere else they werent fighting to win only to delay their foes that they managed to do even though the rear guard kept the southrons from falling on the army of franklin one last time and destroying it bells army kept falling to pieces on its own from the hard pursuit more and more men in blue tunics and pantaloons gave up stopped running and raised their hands when king avrams soldiers came upon them most went off into captivity a fewthose who came out of hiding too suddenly or those who just ran into southrons with grudgesmet unfortunate and untimely ends such things werent supposed to happen they did all the time on both sides even after surrendering northerners stared at rollant what is this world coming to when blonds can lord it over detinans one of them exclaimed its simple rollant said i wasnt stupid enough to pick the losing side you were now get moving the prisoner looked from one ordinary detinan in gray to the next you fellows going to let him talk to me like that he demanded indignantly we have to smitty answered his voice grave what do you mean you have to the prisoner said hes a blond youre supposed to tell him what to do cant smitty said hes the sergeant we tell him off he gives us the nastiest duty he can find just like a regular detinan would i think you people have all gone crazy said the man from the army of franklin setting his hands on his hips maybe we are crazy rollant said but were winning if we can win while were crazy what does that make you traitors im not a traitor the northerner got irate all over again its you people who let blonds do things the gods didnt mean to have em doyoure the traitors you and that godsdamned son of a bitch of a king avram if the gods didnt want me to do something theyd keep me from doing it wouldnt they rollant said if they dont keep me from doing it that must mean they know i can do it right and since you traitors are losing the war that means the gods dont want you to win it right his comrades in gray laughed and whooped listen to him smitty said he ought to be a priest not a sergeant and rollant saw hed troubled the captured northerner the man said nothing more but he looked worried he hadnt before hed looked angry that the southrons had taken him prisoner and at the same time relieved that he wouldnt be killed now his brow furrowed he seemed to be examining the reasons for which hed gone to war in the first place rollant jerked a thumb toward the south take him away id like to give him just what i think he deserves but i have to follow orders too off went the prisoner still looking worried from not far away lieutenant joram boomed out an order rollant had heard a great many times since joining the army but one hed come to enjoy the past few days forward forward rollant echoed and waved the company standard and forward the company went sooner or later ned of the forests troopers would try to slow them down again even if the northerners managed to do it they wouldnt delay king avrams men for long if something happens to joramnot that i want it to but ifwill they make me a lieutenant rollant wondered it wasnt quite impossible there were a handful of blond officers though most of them were healers but it also wasnt even close to likely and he had enough sense to understand as much hed been lucky to get two stripes on his sleeve amazingly lucky to get three for that matter considering the fighting hed seen hed been amazingly lucky to come through alive and with no serious wounds he wanted that luck to go on especially with the war all but won next to staying in one piece what was rank if theyd offered to make him a lieutenant general like bell but with bells missing leg and ruined arm would he have taken them up on it of course not the war couldnt last too much longer could it he wanted to live through it and go home to norina getting killedeven getting hurtnow would be doubly unfair hed done everything any man could do to win the fight didnt he deserve to enjoy the fruits of victory he snorted he was a standardbearer he had no guarantee of staying alive for the next five minutes forward he shouted again if anything did happen to him he would be facing the foe when it did and if that wasnt a quintessentially detinan thought when would he ever have one lieutenant general bell sat in a carriage as the army of franklin tramped over a wood bridge to the northern bank of the smew river the smew ran through rough heavily wooded country in northern franklin bell wished he were on a unicorn but days of riding had left his stump too sore for him to stay in the saddle if he didnt travel by carriage he would have been unable to travel at all no matter how obvious that truth it was also humiliating he felt like a civilian he might have been going to a temple on a feast day like any prosperous merchant to his relief the men didnt seem bothered about how he got from one place to another they waved to him as they trudged past some of them lifted their hats in lieu of a more formal salute bell waved back with his good arm well lick em yet general a soldier called by the gods we will bell answered lets see them try to drive us off the line of the smew he wanted to make a stand while he still remained here in franklin even if the ramblerton campaign had accomplished less than he would have likedthat was how he looked at it through the most rosecolored of mental spectacleshe didnt want to have to fall back into dothan or great river province staying in franklin would show the doubters he didnt pause to think about doubting george both in his own army and in king geoffreys court back at nonesuch that he was still in charge of things that these battered regiments still responded to his will boots thudded on the planks of the bridge more men though had none their feet bare as those of any blond savage made next to no sound some of them left bloody marks on those gray and faded planks the weather was not far above freezing and the road up from the south an ocean of mud how many of the surviving soldiers had frostbitten feet more than a few surely more than bell cared to think about even more surely here came ned of the forests unicornriders and the rest of the rear guard the unicorns hooves drummed as they rode over to the north bank of the smew come on sir ned yelled to bell nobody left between you and avrams bastards i wish i could fight them all singlehanded bell thought had he been whole he would have and gladly things being as they were though things being as they were bell muttered to his driver the man flicked the reins the unicorn started forward each jolt as the wheels rattled across the bridge hurt bell wondered when he would get used to pain hed lived in so much for so long but it still hurt he suspected it always would as soon as hed crossed wizards called down lightning this time the cursed southron sorcerers didnt interfere with the spells the lightnings smote the bridge crashed in ruins into the smew bell hoped to find a farmhouse in which to make his headquarters he had no luck most of the country was woodland and scrub with farms few and far betweenso far that none of them made a convenient place from which to lead the army of franklin up went the pavilion even with three braziers burning inside it it made a cold and cheerless place to spend a night after a meager supper bell summoned his wing commanders and ned of the forest when they arrived he said we have to hold this line we have to keep the southrons out of dothan and great river province stephen the pickle looked as steeped in vinegar as his namesakes how do you propose to do that sir he said we havent got the men for it not any more we havent he looked as if he wanted to say more but checked himself at the last minute what stephen didnt say benjamin the heated ham did weve thrown away more men than weve got left if we can make it to great river province or dothan with the pieces of this army weve got left thatd be the gods own miracle all by itself anything more forget it he shook his head where is your fighting spirit bell cried dead colonel florizel said murdered ned of the forest added glaring from one of them to the next the commanding general said we need a great stroke of sorcery to remind the southrons they cant afford to take us for granted and to show them we are not yet beaten stephen benjamin florizel and ned all stirred at that bell ignored them i aim to fight by every means i have at my disposal till i can fight no more i expect every man who follows me to do the same trouble is sir we dont have enough men left to fight benjamin the heated ham said we dont have enough wizards either the other wing commanders and the commander of unicornriders all nodded at last gods damn it we have to do something bell burst out do you want to keep running till we run out of land and go swimming in the gulf no sir benjamin said stolidly but i dont want to get massacred trying to do what i cant either ned of the forest said sir while were trying to hold this stretch of the smew whats to keep the southrons from crossing the river east or west of us and flanking us out of our position or surrounding us patrols from your troopers among other things lieutenant general bell replied acid in his voice i can watch ned said i can slow the southrons downsome stop em no way in hells if you fight here sir you doom us stephen the pickle said i dont want to fight here i want to form some kind of line we can defend bell said no one seemed to believe he could do it silent resentment rose in waves from his subordinate commanders they had no hope none at all bell waved with his good arm stephen benjamin florizel and ned filed out of the pavilion i could use their heads in a rock garden bell thought never once imagining they might feel the same way about himor that they might have reason to feel that way he called for a runner what went through his mind was half the men in this army are runners theyve proved that the young soldier who reported though was still doing his duty bell said fetch me our mages i want to see what we can expect from them yes sir saluting the runner hurried away in due course the wizards came they looked worn and miserable bell wondered whyit wasnt as if theyd done anything useful he said i propose holding the line of the smew i know ill need magical help to do it what can you give me the magicians looked at one another their expressions grew even more unhappy at last one of them said sir i dont see how we can promise you much not when the southrons have handled us so roughly all through this campaign but we need everything you can give us now bell said and then brightened he pointed from one wizard to the next i know what we need by the gods gentlemen i do give us a dragon illusion a mage said doubtfully i think were too far gone for illusion to do us much good not illusion bell shook his big leonine head i know that wont serve us theyll penetrate it and disperse it conjure up a real dragon and loose it on the godsdamned southrons the wizards stared at one another again this time in something approaching horror sir one of them said there are no dragons any more not west of the great river not west of the stony mountains come to that you know there arent everybody knows there arent then conjure one here from the stony mountains bell said impatiently i dont care how you do it just do it lets see doubting george and his pet mage handle a real live firebreathing dragon do you expect us to seize one out of the air in the stonies bring it here and turn it loose a mage demanded yes thats exactly what i expect by the lion gods mane the general commanding said thats what we need thats what we have to have and thats what wed better get but how the sorcerers made a ragged chorus how is your worry lieutenant general bell said grandly i want it done and it shall be done or ill know the reason whyand youll be sorry have you got that a dragona real dragon not one of the stupid illusions the southrons threw at us a few times in front of ramblertonby day after tomorrow any more questions he didnt gave them time to answer but gestured peremptorily dismissed out went the wizards if anything they looked even more putupon than bells subordinate commanders had a little while earlier bell didnt care hed given them an order all they had to do was obey bell stretched himself out on his ironframed cot he didnt sleep long though when his eyes first came open there in the darkness inside the pavilion he couldnt imagine what had roused him it wasnt a noise no bright lights blazed outside the big tent he didnt need to ease himself what was the trouble then sentries in front of the pavilion murmured to one another a single word dominated those murmurs magic grunting with effort bell sat up pushing himself up with his good arm then he used his crutches and surviving leg to get to his foot he made his slow way into the chilly night the sentries exclaimed in surprise bell ignored them now he knew why he was awake like the sentries hed felt the power of the wizardry the sorcerers were brewing he couldnt see it he couldnt hear it but it was there he could feel it feel it in his fingertips feel it in his beard feel it in his belly and the roots of his teeth the power was strong enough to distract him both from his constant pain and from the laudanum haze he used as a shield against it he stood there in the darkness his breath smoking and waited to see what that power would bring when it was finally unleashed something great surely what he wanted it had better be he thought the marvel didnt wear off more and more soldiers came out of their tents to stare at the wizards pavilion like bell they stood there and stood there careless of sleep careless of anything waiting waiting waiting dawn had begun painting the eastern horizon with pink and gold when the building bubble of power finally burst high overhead the sky opened or so it seemed to a yawning halffreezing bell the sky opened and a dragon burst forth out of thin air a great winged worm where nothing had been before had it stooped on the army of franklin but it didnt the wizards held it under so much control at least roaring with fury it flew off toward the smew river off toward the southrons doubting george had a habit of rising early so he could prowl about his army and see what was what major alva had a habit of staying up very late on nights when he wasnt likely to be needed the next day every so often the two of them would run into each other a little before sunrise so it chanced this particular morning the commanding general nodded to the wizard alva remembered to salute doubting george beamed alva would never make a proper soldier but he was doing a better and better impersonation of one how are things george asked he expected nothing much from the wizards reply as far as he could see things were fine bells army was on the run he hadnt managed to crush it altogether and realized he probably wouldnt but he was driving it out of the province from which it drew its name driving it to the point where it would do false king geoffrey no good waving to the north alva answered the mages over there are up to something sir he was a beat slow using the title but he did what is it this time doubting george was amazed at how scornful he sounded before finding alva he would have been worried northern magecraft had plagued the southron cause all through the war now now in this weedy young wizard he had its measure or so he thought till alvas head came up sharply like that of a deer all at once taking a scent its something big the sorcerer said slowly something very big can you stop it george asked whatever it is you can keep it from hitting us right its not aimed at us alva answered its aimed somewhere far away then why worry about it the commanding general asked alva didnt answer him this time not right away the wizard stared north his face tense and drawn much more to himself than to doubting george he said i didnt think they could still manage anything like that he sounded both astonished and admiring can you stop it george asked again his voice sharp this time i dont know alva didnt look at him the mages attention still aimed toward the north as a compass needle did toward the south maybe i could he raised his hands as if about to make a string of passes but then let them fall to his sides once more too late sir whatever they were trying to do theyve just gone and done it cant you feel that doubting george shook his head you know how marshal bart is tonedeaf and doesnt know one tune from another im like that with wizardry a lot of soldiers are most of the time its an advantage unless magic bumps right up against me i dont have to worry about it shouts from the pickets and the forwardmost encampments said somebody was alarmed about something soldiers in gray tunics and pantaloons pointed up into the sky a dragon they shouted a godsdamned dragon a godsdamned dragon doubting george threw back his head and laughed is that all the traitors could cook up an illusion its a stale illusion at that because we aimed the seemings of dragons at them in the fights in front of ramblerton good for little scares maybe but not for big ones quietly major alva said sir that is not the illusion of a dragon that is a dragon conjured here from wherever it lives my hat is off to bells sorcerers he suited action to word no matter how desperate i was i would not have cared to try the spell that brought it here a real dragon george whod served in the east had seen them before flying among the peaks of the stony mountains what can your magic do against a real dragon now that the beast is here i dont know sir alva answered not much i dont think magic isnt what drove dragons out to the steppe and then to the mountains hunting is stooping like an outsized hawk the dragon dove towards a knot of tents flame burst from its great jaws the southron soldiers hadnt panicked till that moment thinking it an illusion similar to those alva and their other wizards had also used then the tentsand several soldiersburst into flame some of the screams that rang out were anguish more were terror as the men realized the beast was realreal angry and hungry they were good soldiers as soon as they realized that they started shooting at the dragon ordinary crossbow bolts though slowed it about as much as mosquitoes slowed a man the dragon roared a noise like the end of the world it didnt like ordinary crossbow quarrels any more than a man liked mosquitoes as a man will pause to swat the dragon paused to flame as mosquitoes will get smashed so a couple of squads of soldiers suddenly went up in smoke do something gods damn it doubting george shook major alva he didnt even realize he was doing it till he noticed the wizards teeth clicking together then not without a certain regret he stopped once alva had stopped clicking he said im sorry sir i still dont know what to do dragons arent a wizards worry this one is george snapped before alva could either protest or start working magic the repeating crossbows opened up on the dragon along with the ordinary footsoldiers weapons those big crossbows shot longer thicker quarrels and flung them faster and farther than a bow that a man might carry could manage this time the dragons roars were louder yet louder and more sincere now it might have had wasps tormenting it not mosquitoes but however annoying they are wasps rarely kill the dragon remained determined to lash out at everything that was bothering it and everything it saw that it could eat as far as doubting george could tell between them those two categories encompassed his whole army thuk thuk thuk crossbow bolts tearing through the membrane of the dragons wings sounded like knitting needles thrust through taut cotton cloth cotton though didnt bleed the dragon did drops of its blood smoked when they hit the ground soldiers that blood touched cried out in pain but even if the dragon did bleed that made it no less fierce no less furious on the contrary it flew towards a battery of repeating crossbows that hosed darts at it again the fangfilled jaws spread wide again fire shot from them the flames engulfed the repeating crossbows some of the crews managed to flee others kept working the windlasses till the very last moment and went up in flames with the engines they served the dragon landed then its tremendous tail lashed about obliterating repeating crossbows its fire had spared doubting george cursed those engines would have been useful against the army of franklin now now they might as well never have been built but with the dragon on the ground the soldiers serving catapults started flinging firepots at it some of them had already let fly while the dragon was still in the air that was not the smartest thing they could have done their missiles missed and came down on the heads of southron soldiers still in their tents or in the trenches or rushing about they aimed better with the beast on the ground when a firepot burst on its armored back the dragon remained grounded no more it sprang into the air with a scream like all damnation boiled down into a pint no mosquitoes here and no wasps either not even a dragon could ignore a bursting firepot screaming again the terrible beast flew off toward the west that set doubting george to cursing once more hed hoped the dragon would visit vengeance on the northern sorcerers whod summoned it but no such luck have to take care of that ourselves he thought major alva was staring in the direction the dragon had gone how much harm will it do before people finally manage to kill it he wondered i dont know probably quite a bit even doubting george was surprised at how heartless he sounded alva looked more appalled than surprised dont you care shrugging the commanding general said not a whole hells of a lot for one thing the dragon wont be doing it to us for another most of the people it will harm would rather see geoffrey over them than avram since geoffreys wizards summoned it here you could say theyre getting what they deserve oh the wizard considered you make a nasty sort of sense were fighting a war major theres not much room for any other kind george stabbed a finger at the mage what are the odds the traitors will try flinging another dragon at us thunderer smite me with boils if i know sir alva answered ill tell you this though i wouldnt have tried bringing one let alone two anybody who works that kind of spell has to be as close to crazy as makes no difference you say that george asked in amazement after the great sorceries youve brought off you say that hells yes i say that the wizard told him what i do is dangerous to the enemy its not particularly dangerous to me if something goes wrong with one of my spells well then it doesnt work thats all if something went wrong with the spells those northern wizards cast to snare that dragon it would have eaten them or flamed them or something even worse if there is anything worse anybody who risks bringing that down on his own head has got to be a few bolts short of a full sheaf dont you think when you put it that way i suppose so george said but youre the one who knows about magecraft i dont and i dont pretend to alva let out a barely audible sniff as if to say that anybody who didnt know much about wizardry had no business commanding an army in this day and age he might well have been right but george was the fellow with the fancy epaulets on his shoulders he had the responsibility he had to live up to it part of that responsibility at the moment involved finishing the destruction of the army of franklin he pointed to alva can you make it seem to the traitors that the dragon hurt us worse than it really did i suppose so sir but why puzzlement filled alvas voice doubting george let out a more than barely audible sniff as if to say that anybody who didnt know much about soldiering had no business putting on a uniform or even a gray robe then he condescended to explain if they see us here in dreadful shape maybe they wont be looking for us to outflank them and cut them off oh alva wasnt stupid he could see things once you pointed them out to him deception now i understand good george said now that you understand can you do it i dont see why not the sorcerer replied its an elementary problem thaumaturgically speaking youll be able to fool the traitors and their mages i think so alva answered i dont see why i wouldnt be the wizards on the other side of the screw its called the smew doubting george said diplomatically alva waved the correction away whatever its called those fellows arent very bright he said like i told you they have to be pretty stupid in fact if they go and yank a real dragon out of the air so yes i ought to be able to fool them that the northern wizards had succeeded in yanking the dragon out of the air impressed alva not at all not in this context he didnt waste time talking more about what he was going to do he set about doing it instead as far as doubting george was concerned taking care of what needed doing was one of alvas best traits apologetically the wizard warned you wont be able to see the full effects of the spell sir youd need to be looking from the other side of the river to do that because its directional so dont worry about it to the traitors itll look just the way its supposed to all right the commanding general said thanks for letting me know he wasnt even sure alva heard him the wizard had dropped back into his incantation his skinny face showed how intensely he was concentrating he muttered spells in detinan and in a language george had never heard before his bony longfingered hands thrashed through passes as if they had separate lives of their own sooner than george had expected him to he finished the enchantment shouting transform transform transform transform things did the wizard had been right to warn doubting george about the directional nature of the spell george saw the result but as if it were made from fog everything seemed half transparent and ragged around the edges he might almost have been watching the memory of a dream smoke or the wraithlike semblance of smoke poured up from the encampment the ghosts of flames sprang from tents that werent really burning shadowy figures that might have been men ran in all directions as if in terror bells wizards are seeing this sharply george asked not just the wizards sir alva told him anybody peering across the uh smew will think the dragon has wrecked everything in sight all right then the general commanding said hold the illusion for as long as you can and ill get hardriding jimmys troopers and some engineers moving if they can cross the river and hit bell in the flank when he thinks im all messed up here deception major alva said happily yes sir i get it good doubting george shouted for a messenger when the young man appeared came to attention and saluted george gave him his orders the youngster saluted again he trotted off before long the unicornriders and the engineers hurried up the smew ghostly smoke between them and the river should conceal them from prying eyes on the other side assuming it seemed as solid as it was supposed to from the north doubting george had no cause to doubt that another reason he approved of alva as a mage was that the man delivered a messenger came back and reported were over the smew sir good george said can i send a column of footsoldiers after you have you got a ford or a bridge safe and ready to use yes sir the messenger answered but brigadier jimmy says to warn you that if youre looking to surprise the traitors youre going to be disappointed they already know were moving against them gods damn it george exclaimed in disgust what went wrong we hadnt been on the north bank of the river more than a couple of minutes before ned of the forests unicornriders found us the messenger replied well to hells with ned of the forest too the commanding general said all rightwere discovered can jimmys riders get in front of bells men and hold them until the rest of us come north and finish them off sir i dont think so the young man on unicornback said bells men are scooting north as fast as they can go and neds unicornriders are slowing our troopers down so we cant reach bells main force im sorry sir so am i doubting george said wearily we did everything right hereafter that godsdamned dragon anyhowbut it didnt quite work well well go after them anyhow maybe bell will make a mistake it wouldnt be the first one hes made on this campaign by the lion gods tail tuft he said that but he didnt really believe it it wasnt that he didnt believe bell could make more mistakes he was sure bell could but prisoners had told him ned of the forest commanded the northern rear guard doubting george had seen that ned made a very solid soldier george wished he had more officers of neds ability he was just glad the war looked nearly won even ned didnt mattertoo muchany more x captain gremio had never particularly wanted to command a regiment for that matter gremio had never particularly wanted to command a company had his previous captain not been killed at proselytizers rise he would have been more than content to remain a lieutenant with but a single epaulet on his shoulder but he had the whole regiment in his hands now like it or not and had it in the worst possible circumstances a grinding retreat after a disastrous battle and his men could hardly have had a harder time they were worn and ragged and hungry as was he his shoes what was left of them leaked mud onto his toes at every stride too many of them had no shoes at all what the hells am i supposed to do sir one of the soldiers asked my feet are so godsdamned cold how long will it be before my toes start turning black well were in camp now jamy gremio answered camp being a few small smoky fires in a clearing in the woods get as close to the flames as you can thatll keep you from frostbitten toes yes sir were in camp now jamy said but what am i supposed to do about tomorrow morning when i start tramping through halffrozen muck again find some rags wrap your feet in them gremio helplessly spread his hands wide i dont know what else to tell you jamy muttered something under his breath it sounded like if i let myself get captured i dont have to worry about it any more gremio turned away pretending not to hear if jamy did hang back how could gremio stop him more than a few men had already given themselves up to the southrons also muttering gremio went off to stand in line and get something to eat half a hard biscuit and some smoked meat that was rancid because it hadnt been smoked long enough werent going to fill his belly he asked the cooks what else have you got they looked at him as if hed lost his mind youre godsdamned lucky weve got this here sir one of them said plenty of folks in this here army they get a big fat nothing for supper tonight oh gremio sighed and nodded i suppose youre right but how long can we go on with this kind of food in unison the cooks shrugged hells of a lot longer than we can go on with nothing replied the one whod spoken before the worst of it was gremio couldnt even argue with him he was incontestably incontrovertibly right scrounge whatever you can gremio told him im not fussy about how you do itjust do it i wont ask you any questions weve got to keep moving one way or another one by one the cooks nodded well take care of it captain dont you worry said the one who liked to talk pretty good a regimental commander who tells us we can forage however we want the rest of the cooks nodded again one of them added sergeant thisbe already said the same thing thats a sergeant this here is a captain thems two different breeds you bet like unicorns and asses the mouthy cook said gremio wondered whether officers were supposed to be unicorns or asses he didnt ask the cook was all too likely to tell him what he did say was if sergeant thisbe told you its all right it is you can bet on that oh yes sir the talkative cook agreed thisbe hes got his head screwed on tight probably why he never made lieutenant he didnt look a bit abashed at smearing officers with the army of franklin falling to ruins what was gremio going to do to him what could gremio do that the southrons hadnt done already sergeant thisbe has been offered promotion to officers rank more than once but has always declined gremio said stiffly the cooks looked at one another none of them said a thing not even the mouthy one gremio turned away in dull embarrassment they hadnt embarrassed him hed done it to himself if thisbe was a good soldier and thisbe was and if thisbe didnt want to become an officer and thisbe didnt as gremio had admitted what did that say about officers it says officers are asses gremio thought feeling very much an ass he went off to eat his meager and unappetizing supper he was cleaning his mess tin when thisbe came over to the creek to do the same thing scrupulous as always thisbe saluted gremio answered with an impatient wave never mind that nonsense he said nobodys going to worry about it now all right sir thisbe said equably whats this i hear about your saying it was all right for the cooks to gather food any which way they could gremio inquired with an anxious look thisbe asked was i wrong sir not so far as im concerned gremio answered i told them the same thing weve got to keep eating thisbe said if we dont eat we cant march and we cant fight we might as well lay down our crossbows and shortswords and give up and im not ready to do that neither am i but gremio thought of jamy how long could his men keep marching without shoes not forever he knew that too well remembering jamy made him ask how are your feet sergeant not bad at all as a matter of fact sure enough shoes much newer than gremios covered and protected thisbes feet the underofficer explained i found this dead southron a little short fellow his shoes were some too big on me even so but i stuffed some rags into the toes and theyre all right nowa lot better than the ones i had good thats good nice somebodys taken care of one way or another captain gremio said i wish all our men were that lucky his laugh held nothing but bitterness i wish a lot more of our men were lucky enough to still be here yes sir sergeant thisbe nodded sir can we fight another battle now if we have to i mean depends on what you mean by a battleand on what lieutenant general bell wants us to do gremio answered we can fight plenty of these rearguard actionsand weve got to to keep the southrons from running over us like a brewery wagon on a downgrade but if the army of franklin lines up against everything doubting george has got if that happens were all dead thisbe nodded once more thats about the way i look at things too i just wondered whether you were thinking along with me again that again warmed gremio when we get back to palmetto province sergeant who knows what will happen sir thisbe said we have to worry about getting home first of all and about whether home will even be worth getting back to if now the sergeants voice trailed away if gremio prompted but that wasnt fair that was making thisbe say something gremio didnt want to say himself with an effort of will he forced it out if we lose the war no one but thisbe could have heard the words gremio made sure of that even so mentioning defeat came hard despite all the disasters the army of franklin had already seen just imagining the north could lose imagining king avram could rule all of detina felt uncommonly like treason so gremio thought at any rate but when he said so thisbe faced the idea without flinching well pick up the pieces and go on thats all the sergeant replied what else can we do win gremio wanted to say it but found he couldnt with the army of franklin broken with duke edward of arlington penned up inside pierreville north of nonesuch what did his side have with which to resist the oncoming southron armies not enough not from what he could see sergeant he began thisbe held up a hand this isnt the right time is it sir if its not when would be after the war is over thisbe looked around too before adding i dont reckon itll be too much longer another pause and then the sergeant said id kind of hate to get killed now when dying wont make the least bit of difference one way or the other a laugh of sorts thats probably treason too if it is theyll have to crucify me next to you gremio said they smiled at each other with a grimace gremio went on sometimes dying can make a difference even now not about who wins and losesi think thats pretty much over and done with but if you can help some of your friends get away safe well what else is a rear guard for sergeant thisbe looked as unhappy as gremio felt youre right sir you usually are gremio shook his head he felt as emptyas emptied of good answers as of everything else thisbe ignored him but even though you are right i still think itd be a shame oh so do i i dont want to get killed ive never been what youd call eager for that from somewhere gremio dredged up a wry smile ive known a few men who were or seemed to be bell gods damn him getting mutilatedgetting mutilated twicedidnt satisfy him no not even close he had to cut off his armys leg too by the way thisbe nodded the underofficer was also thinking of the commanding general thisbe went back by the fires got out a blanket and made a cocoon of it around a yawn the sergeant said maybe itll look better in the morning following thisbe toward what warmth they had gremio doubted that he doubted it would ever look better for king geoffreys cause but he was also too weary to see straight he rolled himself in his own blanket using his hat for a pillow good night sergeant maybe it will it cant look much worse can it with the winter solstice close at hand nights were long and cold gremio woke well before sunrise he wasnt much surprised to find thisbe already up and gone he also wasnt much surprised to find ned of the forest prowling around on foot neds eyes threw back the dim red light of the campfires like a cats mens eyes werent supposed to be able to do that but neds did whos in charge of this here regiment he demanded of gremio as a matter of fact i am gremio gave his name and rank adding at your service sir i dont want service i want to kill some of those southron bastards are your men up to it such straightforward bloodthirstiness appealed to gremio tell us what to do sir if we can we will if we cant well try anyway that won him a thin smile from the commander of the rear guard all right captain thatll do cant ask for anything more in fact heres what ive got in mind an hour or so later gremio found himself behind a tree trunk waiting as ned of the forests unicornriders galloped past to the north it looked as if even the rear guard of the army of franklin were breaking up in ruin as so much of the rest of the army already had it looked that way but it wasnt true gremio hoped it wasnt anyhow after a brief pause riders in king avrams gray pounded after neds troopers the southrons werent worried about their flanks they werent worried about anything why should they worry bells men were on the run gremio remembered ned of the forests instructions dont shoot too soon the commander of unicornriders had said ill rip the head off any fool who starts shooting too soon gremio didnt think hed meant it metaphorically he didnt think ned would have known a metaphor if it walked up and tried to buy him a brandy and for that matter he probably would have turned it down if it didhe was famous for his abstemiousness with spirits and so gremio and his crossbowmen waited till the southrons were well into the trap they were veterans they could all figure out when that was and they all raised their crossbows to their shoulders and started shooting at almost exactly the same moment unicorns screamed like women in anguish unicornriders screamed too some in pain others in fury unicorns crashed to the ground unicornriders crouched behind them those who could started shooting back frantically reloading and shooting gremio discovered how many bolts the enemy put into the air with their quickshooting crossbows it was as if each of them had five or six pairs of arms each pair busy with its own crossbow without the advantage of surprise gremios regiment would have been mad to attack them but it had that advantage and made the most of it and neds unicornriders came hurrying backon foot as dragoonsas soon as the trap was sprung not only that but neds commander of engines a captain named watson who seemed improbably young got a couple of repeating crossbows placed in the roadway where they bore on the southrons those weapons put out even more quarrels and quarrels that flew farther than the southrons could manage with their quickshooters beset from front and flanks the southrons did just what gremio would have done in their boots they fell back and as they fell back hungry barefoot northerners dashed forwardnot to push them back farther still but to plunder the corpses theyd had to leave behind gremio was no slower than anybody else he pulled a pair of shoessolid wellmade shoes shoes that would last a whileabout his size off the feet of a southron trooper who wouldnt need them any more he stole the troopers tea and hard biscuits and smoked meat too if he could have got his hands on some indigo dye he would have also taken the mans tunic it was thick wool better suited to this cold nasty weather than his own but he didnt and didnt want to get shot for wearing gray even after knocking the southrons back on their heels he knew he was all too likely to get shot for wearing blue ned of the forest was as happy as he could be in his present circumstances which is to say not very everything had gone perfectly when the rear guard he led taught hardriding jimmys troopers a sharp lesson no matter how good they were they couldnt have everything their own way everything had gone perfectly and what had it accomplished it made the army of franklins retreat a little more secure and that was all huzzah ned said sourly that meant bells force might make it back to dothan or great river province and not be altogether destroyed in northern franklin an improvement without a doubt but how large an improvement not large enough and ned knew it colonel biffle rode up to him in the dismal winter woods weve driven them back sir he sounded pleased and excited well so we have biff ned sounded anything but next question is how much good will that do us biffles long face corrugated into a frown after a moments thought he said itll do us a lot more good than if theyd busted through ned of the forest had to laugh at that i cant even tell you youre wrong he admitted but are we going to win the war because we gave hardriding jimmy a black eye are we going to win anything thats worth having he watched colonel biffles eyes cross as the regimental commander worked on that biffle wasnt used to thinking in such terms he was a man you pointed at the enemy and loosed as if he were a crossbow quarrel again he paused before answering at last he said well were still here to try again i cant say youre wrong about that either ned looked south and unless i miss my guess were going to have to if we hang around here much longer jimmy wont like getting poked hell send more men forward and we wont have such an easy time suckering them into an ambush id say its about time to leave weve bought the army a few hours anyways thats the most we can hope for these days yes sir colonel biffle suddenly blinked several times he frowned again though this time for a different reason gods damn it its starting to rain got me right in the eye he was right it was starting to rain and with scarcely any warning to rain hard good thing this held off till we drove the southrons back ned said wed have looked a proper set of fools wouldnt we if wed tried shooting at those bastards with wet bowstrings good thing we didnt before hed got out of the woods his unicorn was squelching through mud big fat heavy raindrops poured down with all the trees bare in winter nothing slowed down the drops ned pulled his broadbrimmed felt hat down low on this face to keep the rain out of his eyes that helped a little the regiment of footsoldiers whod helped in the ambush came out of their cover and retreated along with his unicornriders ned waved to their commander who nodded back the fellow was only a captain but hed done his job well and without fuss or feathers get your boys moving ned called to him well keep the southrons off your back he had the more mobile troops and owed the footsoldiers that much thank you kindly the captain touched the brim of his own hat which was also pulled down low he handled the withdrawal with the same unfussy precision hed used against the southrons one of his company commanders a sergeant whod managed to shave amazingly well considering the sorry state the army of franklin was in also proved very competent by the way the captain and the sergeant sassed each other without heat theyd served together a long time they might almost have been married ned hid his amusement hed seen such things before at the moment he had business of his own to attend to captain watson he called come here if you please what do you need sir the young man in charge of his engines asked i need you to trundle your repeating crossbows south down the road a little ways and give hardriding jimmys men a proper hello when they start coming after us again ned answered watson frowned i would sir but but what ned of the forest asked ominously he wasnt used to having captain watson tell him no watson was the fellow who did whatever needed doing but then ned thumped himself in the head with the heel of his hand a gesture of absolute disgust oh the rain yes sir the godsdamned rain watson agreed its not as hard on the skeins of a repeating crossbow as it is on an ordinary bowstring but they do lose their their pop you might say when they get wet i knew that i know that i just wasnt thinking straight ned still soundedstill was angry at himself for forgetting never mind moving em then it wont work have to try something else instead he thought for a little while then nodded to himself that might do it by the lion gods tail tuft youve got something sir i can see it in your eyes watson said a certain gleam coming into his own trip lines ned said we string a few of them between the trees on either side of the road the southrons come swarming up to get their revenge on us and then they go flying unicorns break their legs maybe some riders break their necks and a good driving rain makes trip lines work better not worse on account of theyre harder to spot yes sir the gleam in captain watsons eyes grew brighter ill take care of it sir you dont need to do that ned said its got nothing to do with engines oh sir itll be my pleasure watson said with a jaunty grin and you know ive got plenty of ropes i need em to pull the engines and wagons i can set up the trip lines and ill enjoy doing it too all right see to it then ned of the forest nodded decisively he himself rode north leaving watson to do what hed said he would at the edge of the woods he waited before too long watson came out with the last of the engines unicorn teams straining to haul them up the increasingly soupy road catching sight of ned watson waved and nodded ned waved back the long retreat went on after trying and failing to make a stand at the smew river lieutenant general bell seemed to have abandoned all hope of holding the southrons all he could think to do was fall back as fast as he could and stay ahead of doubting georges men ned of the forest would have reckoned that more contemptible if hed had more hope himself since he didnt he found it harder to quarrel with the commanding general hardriding jimmys men didnt come bursting out of the woods to harry the retreating northerners ned didnt run into them at all for the next couple of days in fact he concluded that captain watson had not only enjoyed putting down trip lines hed also done a good job of it watson might be a puppy but he was a puppy whod grown some sharp teeth bells army stumbled through the town of warsaw on the way up to the franklin river ned of the forest remembered crossing the river heading south a couple of months before hed still had hope then hope and the confidence that whatever happened he would figure out some way to whip the southrons that wasnt going to happen now all he could hope to do was figure out some way to keep the southrons from destroying the army of franklin in warsaw the townsfolk stared glumly at the retreating northerners what are we going to do now one of them called to ned of the forest as if all too well aware the town would see king geoffreys soldiers no more and would have to make what peace it could with king avram do the best you can ned told him unable to find any better answer by the look the local sent him that wasnt what the fellow had wanted to hear it wasnt what ned had wanted to say either but he had a very clear sense of what was real and what wasnt he hoped the other man did too north of warsaw ned loaded a lot of the men in the rear guard who were barefoot into unicorndrawn wagons that kept them from getting their feet frostbitten if they had to fight they could deploy from the wagons pretty sneaky lord ned colonel biffle said admiringly oh yes im clever as next week ned said think how smart id be if i only had something to work with they went up into the province of dothan just before they came back to the franklin river the weather was no better there than it had been in the province of franklin the river swollen by the cold hard rain ran almost out of its banks no one would find an easy way to ford it as doubting george had at the smew bells engineers and wizards didnt have an easy time creating a pontoon bridge across the franklin for one thing pontoons were hard to come by for another the river kept doing its best to carry them away before the engineers and mages could secure them one to another and for a third precious few engineers and wizards were left to do the work theyd suffered no less than the rest of bells army at last though the job was done bells weary footsore soldiers began crossing to the northern bank of the river by then the southrons were very close behind ned of the forests rear guard ned told his troopers and the footsoldiers with them well boys were going to have to wallop the sons of bitches one more time reckon youre up to it yes sir they shouted and hells yes and you bet lord ned and they did roaring as if the lion god had taken possession of them body and soul they hit the advancing southrons a savage blow that sent them reeling back toward warsaw in surprise dismay and no little disorder ned of the forest didnt think hed ever been prouder of men he led than he was on that frozen field they had to know they werent going to win the war with this fight they couldnt even turn the campaign into anything but a disaster they struck like an avalanche all the same captain gremio came up to ned saluting he said sir i beg leave to report that my men have captured one of the southrons siege engines doesnt begin to make up for all the army lost of course but now that weve got it what should we do with it well done ned said and then captain watson will take charge of it captain hes welcome to it then gremio said ill have my men drag it over to him i expect hell have unicorns to haul it off toward the north i expect he will ned agreed and once youve done that captain order your regiment ready to get moving again you know we cant stay around here and enjoy the victory weve won i understand sir the other man said i sure as hells wish we could though because this is the only victory weve won in this whole godsdamned campaign and the only one were likely to bitterness came off him in waves cant be helped ned said captain gremio nodded sketched a salute and then went off to carry out neds orders the footsoldiers went off toward the franklin first with neds unicornriders screening them again the southrons held off on their pursuit for some little while the ferocious attack ned had put in persuaded them they would do better to wait that being so ned retired as slowly as he could to his surprise though a courier came riding down from the north from lieutenant general bells main force urging him to move faster by the thunderers iron fist whats the trouble now he growled the southrons have galleys carrying catapults in the franklin river sir the rider answered theyre heading toward the bridge if they land a couple of firepots on it before you get across youll be stuck on this side of the river ned of the forest had never yet reckoned himself stuck he was confident he could handle whatever trouble the southrons gave him if he had to by ordering his men to disperse and to reassemble somewhere else he said doesnt bell have his own engines up near the bridge to keep it safe yes sir the courier told him but you never can tell that was altogether too true you never could tell and where bell was concerned you might worry not just about whether things could go wrong but about how they could go wrong with an angry mutter ned said all right then dont fret yourself sonny boy well step lively he came to the southern bank of the franklin a day and a half later making better time than even hed expected looking up the river he saw no sign of southron war galleys he did see on the far bank engines lined up wheel to wheel here bell hadnt blundered get moving he called to the men under his command lets put the river between us and the bastards on our heels those bastards were starting to nip close againbut not close enough ned was sure they wouldnt catch him gremios footsoldiers crossed over to the north bank of the franklin wheels rumbling on the planks laid over the pontoons to pave the bridge watsons engines and the supply wagons followed last came lieutenant general neds troopers and last of all came ned of the forest himself as soon as he reached the northern bank of the river a couple of bells men set a firepot on the bridge the pot began to burn a moment later so did the bridge the army of franklin or what remained of it wended its way north and east into great river province john the lister saw the great column of black smoke rising into the sky from a couple of miles away he knew what it had to mean cursing he spurred his unicorn forward toward the franklin river he got to the river too late hed known he would be too late even as he set spurs to the flanks of his mount he would have been too late even if he hadnt had to delay because columns of footsoldiers and unicornriders and prisoners wouldnt get out of his way as fast as he wanted them to having to squeeze through them did nothing to make his curses any less sulfurous though sure enough the pontoon bridge by which the army of franklin had crossed was engulfed in flames far beyond the hope of any mans quenching it not even an opportune storm would save it now and the franklin was a formidable river wide and swift and now swollen like so many other streams by the winter rains on the far bank most of the northerners had gone their way but a few tiny in the distance still moved about on foot and on unicornback one of them a mounted officer waved mockingly to the southrons on the opposite side of the river fury made john the lister grab for the hilt of his sword half a heartbeat later he checked the motion knowing hed been foolish even the bolt from a repeating crossbow right on the riverbank would have splashed harmlessly into the franklin less than halfway on the journey to that northern unicornrider hardriding jimmy came up beside john on his face was the same frustration as john felt well be a while bridging this stream and longer if their troopers give us a hard time while were working at it jimmy said i know john answered unhappily he shook his head toward the traitors on the far bank theyre going to get away gods damn them jimmy tempered that as best he could some of them will get away but an awful lot of them godsdamned well wont well i cant tell you youre wrong john the lister said still i wanted more i wanted this whole army destroyed not just wrecked so did doubting george the southrons commander of unicornriders laughed if all our officers were so bloodthirsty wedve won this war two years ago were supposed to be bloodthirsty john said weve spent too much time putting up with men who arent and dyou think bell and ned of the forest didnt want to drink our gore they knew what they wanted to do to us all right they just couldnt bring it off i admire ned i hate to admit it but i do jimmy said wasnt that a lovely spoiling attack his men put in a couple of days ago as pretty as anything ive ever seen especially considering how worn they had to be yes theyre still bastards though john said hes a bastard too but hes a bastard whos monstrous good at war that he is jimmy said and now sir if youll excuse me he rode off out in the franklin river a galley flying king avrams flag drew near john scowled at it why couldnt it have come sooner to attack the now burning pontoon bridge before bells soldiers crossed it a moment later he got his answer to that cunningly hidden catapults on the northern side of the river opened up on the galley stones and firepots splashed into the franklin all around it it hastily pulled back out of range john the lister shook his fist at the northerners again but then suddenly he started to laugh in the end how much difference did it make that a few of them had managed to escape for all practical purposes the war here in the east was won before long the soldiers in doubting georges army would go elsewheremaybe after lieutenant general bells men maybe off to the west to help finish off the armies there that remained in the field for false king geoffrey either way how likely was it that geoffreys rule would ever be seen in this part of the kingdom again not very and john knew it from now on if the locals wanted to send a letter they would have to send it through a postmaster loyal to king avram if they wanted to go to law against each other they would have to do it in one of avrams lawcourts if one of the local barons wanted to keep on being a baron he would have to swear allegiance to avram if he didnt if he refused he wouldnt be a baron any more he would be an outlaw and hunted down by avrams soldiers and from now on all the blonds in this part of the kingdom would be free men no longer bound to their liege lords lands as they had been for so many hundreds of years ever since the invaders from the far side of the western ocean overwhelmed the blonds kingdoms theyd found in the north of what became detina theyd looked on the people theyd conquered as little more than domestic animals that happened to walk on two legs that had changedchanged somein the south where blonds had been fewer and the land itself poorer and where serfdom never really had paid for itself now no matter how little the northerners liked itand john the lister knew how little that wasit was going to change here too king avram had always been determined about that hed made his views plain long before succeeding old king buchan hed made them so plain grand duke geoffrey had rebelled the instant the royal crown landed on avrams homely head and hed taken all the northern provinces with him even if some of them hadnt actually abandoned avram till after the fighting started geoffreys war was going on four years old now it wouldntcouldntlast much longer after the spilling of endless blood and endless treasure king avram would get his way john the lister wondered how well things would work once peace finally returned to the kingdom like a lot of southrons and almost all northerners he remained unconvinced that the average blond was as good a man as smart a man as brave a man as the average detinan hed needed the war to convince him that some blonds could match some detinans in any of those things he knew one of his regiments had a blond sergeant in it thanks to the promotion from colonel nahath that a blond could rise so high could give orders to detinans and get away with it still surprised him that a detinan with such abilities whod started as a common soldier would probably be a captain or a major by now never once crossed johns mind one other thing of which john was convinced was that the detinans in the north werent about to accept blonds as their equals no matter what king avram had to say about it and even if they did lose the war between the provinces the brigadier wondered how that would play out in the years to come how many soldiers would avram need to garrison the northern provinces to make sure his will was carried out would he keep them there to make sure it was he was a stubborn man john knew as much but the northerners like any detinans were stubborn too gods be praised it isnt my worry john the lister thought all he had to do was carry out commands king avram was the one who had to give them and to figure out what they ought to be most of the time brigadier john had the same schoolboy fancies as flowered in the heart of any other man what if i were king of detina wouldnt it be wonderful for me and for everybody else looking at what lay ahead for the kingdom at what king avram would have to do if he wanted to knit things back together for south and north yet at the same time cling to his principles john decided the current king was welcome to the job after hes straightened things outthen maybe john got so lost in his reverie he didnt notice another unicorn coming up beside his a dry voice snapped him back to the hereandnow well brigadier it hasnt turned out too bad the past couple of weeks has it no matter what those bastards over in georgetown say i mean snapping to attention on unicornback wasnt practical john the lister did salute no sir not too bad at all glad you agree doubting george said of course baron logan the black would have done everything a hells of a lot better hes sure of it even now i bet and so is marshal bart sarcasm like that flayed john said sir i dont see how anybody could have done anything better on this campaign maybe his words held some flattery he knew they also held a lot of truth doubting george muttered something into his beard something distinctly un flattering to the marshal of detina part of john the lister hoped the general commanding would go into more detail he liked gossip no less than anyone else in king avrams gossiploving armies but all george said after that was well by the thunderers prick weve done every single thing we were supposed to do with the army of franklin weve done every single godsdamned thing we were supposed to do to the army of franklin too that wasnt altogether true the army of franklin still existed at least after a fashion george had wanted to expunge it from the field altogether thanks more to ned of the forest than anyone else he hadnt quite managed to do it though bells force wouldnt endanger cloviston or even franklin again what now sir john the lister asked do we go up and down the river till we find a place where we can get our own pontoon bridge across do we keep on chasing bell and whatever hes got left of an army with a certain amount of regretmore than a certain amount in factgeorge shook his head those arent my orders however much i wish they were my orders are to hold the line of the franklin and to garrison the northern part of franklin against possible further attacks by the traitors a chuckle rumbled down deep in his chest i dont expect that lastll be too godsdamned hard a weasel doesnt come out and bite a bear in the arse theyd better not by the lion gods talons john exclaimed not even bell could be crazy enough to want to go back to the fight ha doubting george said you never can tell what that son of a bitchd be crazy enough to do im sure he wants to fight us some more he just doesnt have any army left to do it with thats all at least not so far as i can see our job now is to make sure we send him back with his tail between his legs if he is daft enough to try it he paused and frowned dissatisfied with the figure of speech how the hells can we send him back with his tail between his legs if hes only got one leg if thats your biggest worry sir this campaign is well and truly won john said i expect it is doubting george still sounded imperfectly ecstatic did i tell you i had a call on the crystal ball from his imperial bartness the other day telling me what a clever fellow i was and how id been a good little boy after all no you didnt mention that john the lister replied he couldnt help echoing his imperial bartness what would you call him george said we have kings of detina all the timeweve got too godsdamned many kings of detina right this minute but theres always at least one but till bart we hadnt had a marshal of detina for seventy or eighty years if that doesnt make a marshal of detina fancier and more important than a king of detina to the hells with me if i know what would and dont you suppose a fancy important rank deserves a fancy importantsounding title to go with it to tell you the truth sir i hadnt really thought about it john wondered if anyone but doubting george would have thought of such a thing well anyway like i say he told me i was a good little boy and he patted me on the head and said id get a bonbon or two for singing my song so nice even over and above making me lieutenant general of the regulars the general commanding went on not bothering to hide his disdain and i rolled on my back and showed him the white fur on my belly and kicked my legs in the air and godsdamned near piddled on his shoe to show him how happy i was about the bonbons john the lister had an alarmingly vivid mental image of doubting george acting like a happy bearded puppy and marshal bart beaming benignly out of a crystal ball john had to shake his head to drive the picture out of it you always have such an interesting way of putting things sir he managed at last you think im out of my mind too george said equably well hells maybe i am who knows for sure especially these days but crazy or not i won thats what counts it was what counted for a soldier nothing else really did john nodded and said this kingdoms going to be a different place when the fighting finally stops ive been thinking about that a lot lately ive been thinking about it myself as a matter of fact doubting george replied i doubt im going to be very happy with all the changes either but itll still be one kingdom and thats what counts too he was right again that was what counted too for king avrams side john the lister nodded yes sir what was left of the army of franklin straggled into the town of honey in the southwestern part of great river province the southrons had given up their pursuit after failing to bag the army in front of the franklin river now lieutenant general bell wanted to salvage whatever he could from the ruins of his campaign up toward ramblerton he even hoped to salvage what was left of his own career that last hope died a miserable death when he recognized the officer sitting his unicorn in the middle of honeys muddy main street and waiting for him saluting bell spoke in a voice like ashes good day general peegeetee how very fine to see you your grace marquis peegeetee of goodlook punctiliously returned bells salute it is good to see you too lieutenant general as always he replied reminding bell which of them held the higher rank he was a short ferretfaced man a very fine and precise commander who would have been of more use to king geoffrey if he hadnt been in the unfortunate habit of making plans more elaborate than his men most of whom were anything but professional soldiers could carry out and if he werent at least as touchy as count joseph the gamecock he went on we shall have a good deal to talk about you and i bell liked the sound of that not a bit he would even rather have seen count thraxton the braggart he and the luckless count thraxton at least both despised joseph the gamecock but what he liked wasnt going to matter here with a grim nod he said i am entirely at your service your grace if he could be brave facing the enemy he could be brave facing his own side too even on this chilly day a bee buzzed by bells ear he shook his head and the bee flew off the hives around the town had helped give it its name general peegeetees expression though could have curdled honey he said where is the rest of your army lieutenant general there it was bell had known it was coming he said what he had to say what i have sir is what you see peegeetees expression grew more sour more forbidding still bell hadnt imagined it could the marquis blurted but what happened to the rest of them i knew it was bad but sir the ones who survive and were not captured are with me bell said by the thunderers big brass balls marquis peegeetee muttered you cannot have left more than one man out of four from among those who set out from dothan in the fall it is a ruin a disaster a catastrophe when it came to catastrophes he knew exactly what he was talking about hed been in command at karlsburg harbor where the war between geoffrey and avram began he and joseph had led the northern forces at cow jog the first great battle of the war down in southern parthenia which had proved that neither north nor south yet knew how to fight but both had plenty of brave men and hed taken over for sidney the war unicorn after sidney bled to death on the field at the battle of sheol a hellsish conflict if ever there was one we made the southrons pay a most heavy price your grace bell said stiffly they paidand they can afford to go on paying peegeetee said but what of this army he shook his head this army is not an army any more we can still fight sir bell insisted all we need to do is refit and reorganize and well soon be ready to take the field again no doubt this time general peegeetees politeness was positively chilling i am sure your hostyour small host your diminished hostcan defeat any enemy army of equal or lesser size he did not sound sure of even so much but continued before bell could call him on it unfortunately my good lieutenant general doubting georges force is now about five times the size of yours you will correct me if i chance to be mistaken of course he waited bell thought about protesting that the southrons surely could not have more than four times as many men as he did he might even have been right to claim that but what difference would it make four times as many men or five doubting george had far too many soldiers for the army of franklin to hope to withstand when bell kept silent peegeetee nodded to himself as calmly and dispassionately as if talking about the weather he remarked king geoffrey is most unhappymost vocally unhappy you understandabout the manner in which this campaign was conducted again a hot retort came to the tip of lieutenant general bells tonguecame there and went no further he was unhappy about a whole great raft of things geoffrey had done too once more though what difference did it make geoffrey was the king bell wasnt all he said was by the gods general we tried as hard as mortal men could have i tried to deny it peegeetee replied no one denies your valor lieutenant general or the valor of the men you leadthose of them who survive unfortunately no one doubts your lack of success either he steepled his fingertips and looked past bells right shoulder this now leaves you with a certain choice a choice bell echoed frowning in incomprehension what kind of choice marquis peegeetee still didnt seem to want to meet his eyes you may pay a call on the headsman or you may fall on your own sword this i fear me is the only choice remaining to you at the moment a pity no doubt but such is life for a moment bell thought he meant the words literally figurative language had always been a closed book to the man who led the army of franklin here though he found the key you mean his majesty will sack me if i dont lay down my command but of course peegeetee told him as i say i regret this but i can do nothing about it save convey the choice to you bell thought about making geoffrey dismiss him that would show the world he thought hed done nothing wrong but what counted except results nothing and what had come from this campaign also nothing worse luck shruggingthe motion sent a wave of agony through his ruined left shoulder making him long for laudanumhe said you may convey to his majesty my resignation and my readiness to serve him in any capacity in which he believes i may be of use peegeetee bowed in the saddle your sentiments do you credit i want no credit your grace what i wanted was to beat our enemies since that was denied me bell shrugged again not so much careless of the pain as embracing it once it had washed over him he asked and who will succeed me in command of this army to his surprise marquis peegeetee looked past him again i am afraid lieutenant general that that is not such an easy question to answer why not bell demanded someone has to surely well no not necessarily peegeetee replied king geoffrey plans to send part of your army to count joseph the gamecock who is gathering forces in palmetto province to try to hold off the southrons veldt you know fell to general hesmucet a couple of weeks ago his majesty fears hesmucet will turn south aiming to join marshal bart in an assault against nonesuch the rest of your force here he shrugged too a dapper little shrug will be able to carry on without the formal name of the army of franklin rage ripped through lieutenant general bell what he growled youd gut my army to feed soldiers to that useless son of a bitch of a joseph with icy courtesy peegeetee replied it seems to me lieutenant general that you are the one who has gutted your army bell ignored him gods damn it if id known geoffrey was going to do that i never would have resigned as a matter of fact i withdraw my resignation i am going to pretend i did not hear that the marquis said believe me when i say you are lucky i am going to pretend i did not hear it i told you his majesty was disappointed in the army of franklins performance i did not tell you how disappointed and how how wrathful he was if you fail to resign he will sack you lieutenant general and he will do worse than that lieutenant general bell give me back my army he cried when word of your sad piteous overthrow before ramblerton reached him if he sacks you you will go before a courtmartial one with membership of his choosing perhaps you will only see the inside of a prison perhaps on the other hand you will see a cross a cross bell said hoarsely he would do that to me for fighting a campaign the best way i knew how by the thunderers strong right hand where is the justice in this world a cross not for the fight i would say general peegeetee judiciously pursed his lips as he paused to find just the right words a cross for throwing away geoffreys last hope east of the mountainshis last hope really of ruling a kingdom that amounts to anything a tiny flicker of disdain gone from his face almostbut not quitebefore bell was sure he saw it said peegeetee shared king geoffreys opinion of bell and of what he hadand hadntdone that scorn hurt him worse than either his missing leg or his ruined arm excuse me he said thickly and fumbled for his little bottle of laudanum he gulped careless of the dose poppies and fire chased each other down his throat i regret the necessity of bringing you such unfortunate news when your wounds trouble you so peegeetee murmured bell doubted he regretted it if he had to guess he would have said peegeetee derived a sneaking pleasure from his pain and for once the wounds werent what troubled the general commandingno the general formerly commandingthe army of franklin could laudanum also dull torment of the spirit if it couldnt nothing could that possibility sent a cold wind of terror howling through bells soul have you now reconsidered your reconsideration the marquis inquired i have bell replied in a voice heavy as lead but your grace no matter what you say i aim to go to nonesuch to put my case before his majesty i would not dream of standing in your way peegeetee said i do offer two bits of advice however for whatever you may think they are worth first do not get your hopes up king geoffrey has always been touchy and he is all the touchier now that the war is going less well than he would have liked and whose fault is that bell said meaning it was geoffreys but general peegeetee answered in his opinion yours i also note that nonesuch is not the place you think it to be i am familiar with nonesuch bell said it is less than a year and a half ago that i last passed through it surely it cannot have changed much in so short a time it can it has general peegeetee told him with marshal barts army clinging to the siege of pierreville as a bulldog clings to a thiefs leg the shadow of the gibbet and the cross falls ever darker on the city it is not without its gaiety even yet but that gaiety has a desperate edge i care nothing for gaiety bell snapped i care only for victory and for vindication both of which i fear are in moderately short supply in nonesuch these days peegeetee shrugged this is not my concern however i like you wish it were otherwise and please believe me when i tell you i wish you good fortune in your quest as i say though do please also be realistic in your expectations bell had never been realistic either in the field or in his maneuverings with and against other officers serving king geoffrey his headlong fighting style had made him a hero it had also left him a twicemutilated man he had risen to command the army of franklinand in commanding it had destroyed it when he told marquis peegeetee i shall of course take your advice most seriously he meant i shall of course pay no attention whatsoever to you with another bow in the saddle peegeetee replied i am most glad to hear it by which he meant i dont believe a word of it which men will be sent to palmetto province bell asked by putting it that way he didnt have to mention or even have to think of count joseph the gamecock the less he thought of joseph the better he liked it that joseph might not care to think of him either had never once entered his mind marquis peegeetee pulled a sheet of paper from the breast pocket of his goldbuttoned blue tunic you are ordered to send the wing commanded by colonel florizel he paused and raised an eyebrow a wing commanded by a colonel senior surviving officer bell said when we fight your grace we fight hard fighting well would be even better peegeetee murmured and bell glared furiously ignoring him the nobleman continued you are also ordered to detach half the brigades from the wing commanded by brigadier benjamin called the heated hamhow picturesque the said brigadier is to accompany the attached brigades have you any questions no sir but do please note you are taking half the armys strength bell said not i lieutenant general i am but delivering his majestys orders and the army of franklinthe former army of franklin i should sayis from this moment on no longer your official concern i understand that your grace bell held his temper with no small effort even so its fate and the fate of the kingdom still interest me mightily as they should interest any man with a drop of patriotic blood in his veins i have you know spent more than a drop of my blood on king geoffreys behalf he glanced down toward the stump of his right leg peegeetees gaze followed his ownbut only for a moment then the marquis looked away an expression of distaste crossing his narrow clever features still not meeting bells gaze he muttered no one has ever faulted your courage he gathered himself but would you not agree it is now time to let other men shed their blood for the land we all hold dear i am still readystill more than readyto fight sir bell said that i regret to repeat you must take up with his majesty in nonesuch general peegeetee replied bell nodded to nonesuch he would go he had scant hope but he would go his good hand folded into a fist by all he could see geoffreys kingdom had scant hope either righteously bell thought i did all i could come on captain gremio called to his regiment get aboard the glideway carpets fill em up good and tight too we dont have as many as we need beside him sergeant thisbe murmured when have we ever had as much of anything as we need men food clothes siege engines glideway carpets that was so obviously unanswerable gremio didnt even try he said what im wondering is how the hells are we going to get to palmetto province we ought to go through marthasvillejust about all the glideways from the coast out here to the east pass through marthasville but the southrons have held the place since last summer he felt foolish as soon as hed spoken thisbe knew that as well as he did the army of franklinthe army now breaking up like rotting icehad done all it could to keep hesmucet and the southrons out of marthasville all it could do hadnt been enough gremio didnt think the attack orders lieutenant general bell had given after taking command from joseph the gamecock had helped the northern cause but he wasnt sure marthasville would have held even absent those orders any which way it was much too late to worry about them now one after another soldiers in blue stepped up onto mounting benches and from them up onto the carpets from time out of mind men had told stories of magic carpets of carpets that flew through the air like birds like dragons like dreams but up until about the time gremio was born theyd been only stories even now glideway carpets didnt rise far above the ground they traveled at no more than the speed of a galloping unicorn though they could hold their pace far longer than a unicorn and they could only follow paths sorcerously prepared in advance glideways as so often happened practical magecraft proved very different from the romance of myth and legend colonel florizel limped toward gremio who came to attention and saluted as you were captain florizel said thank you sir gremio relaxed were heading back towards our home province eh been a long time yes a frown showed behind florizels bushy beard under the circumstances i worry about desertion can you blame me no sir i understand completely gremio answered i wouldnt worry so much if the war were going better as things are he didnt go on florizel nodded heavily yes as things are it wasnt a complete sentence but what difference did that make gremio understood him again florizel continued what makes it so bad for my regimentexcuse me captain for your regimentis that we are ordered back to our homes in the middle of a war that is not going well if our men think to hells with it what is to stop them from throwing down their crossbows and heading back to their farms or wherever they happen to live not much sir im afraid maybe things will go better or at least seem better once we get to palmetto province if they do the men will be less likely to want to run away dont you think maybe i hope so colonel florizel still sounded profoundly dubious shaking his head he went on down the line of glideway carpets gremio wondered whether he doubted things would go better in palmetto province or that it would make any difference to the men if they didor maybe both gremio could have given florizel even more to worry about being convinced the war was lost and not just going badly hed begun to think about deserting himself no one in karlsburg would have anything much to say if he returned before the fighting formally finished he was sure of that he could resume his career as a barrister easily enough he felt sergeant thisbes eyes on his back sure enough when he turned he found the underofficer looking at him thisbe quickly turned away as if embarrassed at getting caught gremio quietly cursed he wasnt cursing thisbefar from it he was cursing himself he knew he wasnt going to desert as long as the sergeant kept fighting for king geoffrey he couldnt stand the idea of losing thisbes good opinion of him and if hesmucet storms up through palmetto province with every southron in the world at his back gremio shrugged if you get killed because youre too stupid or too godsdamned stubborn to leave while you still have the chance he shrugged again even then it wasnt anything he hadnt already known and known for months now though hed spelled it out to himself he felt none of the fear hed thought he might he simply liked having everything in order in his own mind well sergeant our men seem to be aboard the carpets he said to thisbe shall we get on ourselves yes sir thisbe said after you sir no after you gremio answered im still the captain of this ship last on last off thisbe tried to argue but gremio had both rank and tradition on his side clucking the sergeant climbed up onto the closest carpet and sat crosslegged at the edge gremio followed he found a place by thisbe soldiers crowded together to make a little more room for them a man in a glideway conductors black uniform came by no feet over the edges of the carpet he warned bad things will happen if you break that rule the men all knew that most of them also probably knew or knew of someone whod broken a foot or an ankle or a leg against a rock or a tree trunk that happened to lie too close to a glideway line detinans were stubborn people who delighted in flouting rules no matter how sensible those rules might be silently smoothly the carpets slid west along the glideway the silence persisted the smoothness no the spells on the glideway line badly needed refurbishing no mages seemed to have bothered doing that essential work the wizards the north had were all busy doing even more essential work trying to keep the southrons from pushing deeper into king geoffreys tottering realm they werent doing any too well at that but they were trying great river province and dothan had suffered relatively little from the war even in those provinces though everything had a shabby rundown look to it as if no one had bothered taking care of anything that wasnt vital since the war began gremio saw a lot of women working in the fields sometimes alongside blond serfs sometimes by themselves no detinan men who didnt have white beards were there to help them if they didnt take care of things themselves who would nobody a measure of how little the war had touched great river province and dothan was that serfs were working in the fields down in franklin most of the blonds had fled their liege lords holdings choosing with their feet liberation from feudal ties northern nobles had long proclaimed that blonds preferred the security of being tied to the land the evidence looked to be against them here and there the path the soldiers detached from the army of franklin took twisted like a drunken earthworm even here so far north southron raiders had sometimes penetrated their wizards had dethaumatized stretches of the glideway on those stretches the carpets might as well have lain on the floor of some dukes dining hall for all the inclination toward flight they displayed the soldiers had to roll them up and carry them along till they reached a working stretch of glideway once more and then more slowly than they should have the glideway carpets reached peachtree province they had to skirt marthasville which had been the hub of all glideway routes it still lay in the southrons hands and the garrison there was far too strong for this ragtag force to hope to overcome instead florizels men and those led by benjamin the heated ham went west and then north they passed through the swath of destruction hesmucets army had left a couple of months before marching west from marthasville to the western ocean that swath was a good forty miles wide the southrons had ruined the glideways along with everything else the men whod set out from honey had to march across it and they got hungry on the way hesmucets men had burned every farm and castle they came upon theyd ravaged fields cut down fruit trees and slaughtered every animal they caught skeletons with bits of hide and flesh still clinging to them dotted the landscape vultures still rose from the bones though the carrion birds had long since battened on most of the bounty presented them the stench of death lingered no blonds remained here theyd run off with the southrons by the thousands how could hesmucets men do such a thing thisbe wondered how simple gremio answered grimly they were strong enough and we couldnt stop them everyone was grim by the time the detachment reached the far edge of that strip of devastation torn across peachtree province it had to run all the way from marthasville to the ocean had geoffreys kingdom been strong hesmucets men never could have done such a thing since they had colonel florizel wasnt far from despair by the time his men got to unravaged soil he came up to gremio asking how can i ask even the bravest soldiers to give their lives for king geoffreys realm when everything is falling into ruin here at the heart of it i dont know sir gremio answered how much more can we take before before we go under before the disaster in front of ramblerton he wouldnt have dared ask his superior such a question florizel would have called him a defeatist maybe even a traitor now not even florizel could believe the norths prospects were good he looked at gremio for a long time before he shook his head and said i dont know either captain by the thunderers strong right arm though wed better find out soon he stumped away without waiting for a reply later that evening gremio and thisbe sprawled wearily in front of a campfire gremio said i think even the colonel is losing hope he told thisbe what had passed between florizel and him what do you think sir thisbe asked staring into the yellow flames as if they were a crystal ball is it all over shall we go home when we get to palmetto province or do we still have a chance if we still keep fighting ill fight as long as you will sergeant gremio had thought that before but now he amplified it if you decide youve had enough i wont say a word thisbe swung around to face him thats not fair sirputting it all on me i mean im sorry sergeant gremio said i just thought you didnt think sir thisbe said with a shake of the head youre the officer so its really up to you you said so yourself when we were getting on the glideway carpet at honey i do believe ive just been hoist with my own petard gremio mimed taking a deadly wound although thisbe laughed the underofficers face remained serious if it is up to you sir what will you do ill see how things look when we get into palmetto province and ill make up my mind then gremio answered what will you do follow you thisbe said without hesitation i know youll come up with the right thing to do you always have thank you i only wish it were true before they could say any more a rider came up from the southwest are you the men coming to the aid of joseph the gamecock he asked tensely looking ready to gallop away in a hurry if the answer were no but gremio said thats right how are things in palmetto province these days a lot of us are from there been a lot of rain the unicornrider answered plenty of what would be roads most of the year are underwater now that ought to slow down the godsdamned southrons if it doesnt were in a hells of a lot of trouble on account of those fornicating bastards outnumber us about five to one gremio and sergeant thisbe looked at each other that was what had happened to lieutenant general bell once you came to a certain point bravery stopped mattering much no matter how brave you were youd get hammered if you were outnumbered badly enough one of gremios soldiers said well it aint so bad any more on account of now youve got us the unicornrider managed a nod but the look on his face was pained gremio didnt couldnt blame him for that a good many farmers who put on geoffreys blue tunic and pantaloons had hardly more education than blond serfs the men whod come from bells shattered army to the one joseph the gamecock was trying to build might mean his force was outnumbered only four to one how much would that help him when he tried to hold back hesmucet the answer seemed obvious to gremio if not to the common soldier what do we do now sir thisbe asked it wasnt a question about how they should proceed on the next days travel gremio knew it wasnt and wished it were it would have been much easier to deal with as that sort of question he sighed and shook his head i dont know sergeant i just dont know xi sergeant rollant looked across the franklin river on the north bank ned of the forests unicornriders trotted up and down on endless patrol rollant reached for his crossbow but arrested the motion before it got very far what was the point the franklin was a lot more than a bowshot wide beside rollant smittycorporal smittyalso eyed the unicornriders who were tiny in the distance smitty said if we could push some men across we could smash up all those sons of bitches i know ive been thinking the same thing rollant let out a small noise full of longing the sort of noise a cat on the ground might make at seeing a plump thrush high in a treetop the other thing ive been thinking is it wouldnt be very hard thats right thats just exactly right it wouldnt be hard at all smitty practically quivered with eagerness we could head straight on up to the gulf and how could the traitors stop us or even slow us down they couldnt not a chance rollant was as sure of it as he was of his own name wed be heroes were already heroes ive had a bellyful of being a hero smitty said what i want to do is win the godsdamned war and go home home rollant spoke the word with enormous longing for the first time since hed taken king avrams silver and put on the kingdoms gray tunic and pantaloons the idea that he would be going home before too long began to seem real why doesnt doubting george turn us loose on them beats me smitty shrugged but you know what i dont much care one way or the other he waved across the river i mean look at those poor sorry sons of bitches weve licked em his voice held absolute conviction absolute certainty in fact he said it again weve licked em they arent going to come back and give us trouble the way they did in peachtree province we could all go home tomorrow and ramblerton still wouldnt have a thing to worry about you going to tell me im wrong he looked a challenge at rollant no the blond admitted no i dont suppose you are godsdamned right im not smitty said and since they are licked what the hells difference does it make whether we go after em hard or not what difference did it make any at all rollant hadnt looked at things like that now he did again he couldnt say smitty was wrong what do you think well do then he asked wait here by the river till the war ends in the west just stay here and make sure ned of the forest doesnt get loose and make trouble like most blonds he had a respect and dread for ned that amounted almost to superstitious awe a man who was both a serfcatcher and a firstratebetter than firstrate brilliantcommander of unicornriders and whose men had been known to slaughter blonds fighting for avram no wonder he roused such feelings in the soldiers who had the most reason to oppose him smitty on the other hand was an ordinary detinan if anything impressed him he wasnt inclined to admit it even to himself he said to the hells with ned of the forest too he tries getting cute hardriding jimmyll take care of him smitty spoke with the blithe confidence most ordinary detinans showed the blithe confidence that baffled rollant and other blonds and as if to say he didnt think ned or the rest of the northerners were worth worrying about he turned his back on the unicornriders and the franklin river and strode off whistling licked rollant tasted the word in his mouth could it really be true hed thought so during the pursuit but now that seemed over was it still true with him standing here in cold blood by the gods maybe it is he murmured where smitty had turned his back on the river rollant stared avidly across it licked what a lovely word he was recalled to his side of the franklin when somebody spoke to him in a tongue he didnt understand several blond laborers all plainly escaped serfs stood there gaping at him in openmouthed admiration some wore the undyed wool tunics and pantaloons avrams army issued to such men others the rags in which theyd run away from their liege lords estates such things had happened to him before blonds in the north had used a swarm of languages before the detinan conquerors came many still survived if precariously and a lot of them had added words to the detinan spoken in the north but the speech whose fragments rollant had learned as a child on baron ormerods estate in palmetto province sounded nothing like this one talk detinan he told them in that language it was the conquerors tongue but the only one they had in common what do you want they looked disappointed he couldnt follow them hed expected that one of them visibly plucking up his courage asked you are really a sergeant sir yes im a sergeant rollant answered and you dont call me sir you call officers sir theyre the ones with epaulets he saw the blond laborers didnt know what epaulets were so he tapped his shoulder the fancy ornaments they wear here you men havent been with the army long have you no sir another of them said the laborer whod spoken first poked him with an elbow he tried again uh no sergeant yet another blond asked how did you get to be a sergeant sir force of habit died hard in them the man added how did they let you be a sergeant they made me a corporal when i took the company standard after the standardbearer got killed rollant replied i charged at the northerners and i was luckythey didnt shoot me then when the lieutenant who commanded this company got shot at ramblerton they made our sergeant a lieutenant and they made me a sergeant a sergeant a blond sergeant the laborer who spoke might have been talking about a black unicorn or some other prodigy of nature the blond whod called to rollant in the language that wasnt detinan asked and when you give an order do the detinans obey all the blonds leaned forward eagerly hanging on the answer they all sighed ecstatically when he nodded he couldnt blame them what blond trapped in serfdom in the north didnt dream of turning the tables on his liege lord rollant knew he had back when he was bound to baron ormerods estate outside of karlsburg they do now he told them now they all echoed that a big burly blond in rags asked why didnt they before rollant wished the man hadnt asked that question reluctantly he gave back the truth because i had to beat up one of them to convince them i deserved to wear my stripes ahhh they all said that together too wait rollant held up a hand with desperate urgency he said do you know whatll happen if you try to beat up detinans the blond laborers shook their heads theyll give you stripesstripes on your backs he told them or they may nail you to crosses dont try you cant get away with it they frowned the burly one asked why could you then thats not right why could i now rollant was the one doing the echoing ill tell you why because ive killed northerners all the men in my company knew i could do that theyd seen me do it theyd seen i could fight and didnt run away the only question left was whether i was tough enough to lick them and i showed them i could do that too when one of our detinans wouldnt obey me if you havent done all the other things dont try this or youll be sorrier than you ever imagined you could be and no one will help you he wondered if they were really listening or if one of them would try to hit a detinan overseer he didnt like right in the eye he hoped they wouldnt be so stupid but you never could tell maybe they would just try to strip off their colorless clothes and get the detinans to give them gray tunics and pantaloons instead they might even succeed king avrams armies seemed permanently hungry for men but if the blonds expected promotion to be easy or quick they were doomed to disappointment it was probably easier for them to end up dead than to end up as corporals let alone sergeants rollant shrugged still if they wanted to try why shouldnt they he looked across the franklin again neds unicornriders kept right on patrolling the north bank they probably kept right on being convinced that geoffrey was the rightful king of detina too and that blonds were serfs by nature but as far as the larger scheme of things went what ned of the forests troopers were convinced of mattered less and less with each passing day lollygagging around again are you a deep voice rumbled behind rollant he turned and saluted oh yes sir lieutenant joram he replied you know all blonds are shiftless and lazy same as you know all blonds are a pack of dirty yellow cowards joram opened his mouth to answer that then closed it again before saying anything the newly commissioned officer rumbled laughter only after hed got it out of his system did he remark gods damn it rollant there are still plenty of detinans who do know that or think they do yes sir rollant nodded but are you one of them well that depends joram said judiciously theres a difference you know between whether you were lollygagging around on account of youre a shiftless cowardly blond and whether you were lollygagging around just in a general sort of way oh yes sir rollant nodded again thats the truth there is that difference the detinans you were talking about though they cant see it before you rubbed my nose in it i would have had trouble seeing it myself joram said some blonds are shiftless cowards thats true too sir so are some detinans joram grunted detinans prided themselves on being a warrior race after a moment jorams big head bobbed up and down and thats the truth so sergeant in a general sort of way were you lollygagging around if rollant had admitted it while still a common soldier his reward would have been extra duty of some sort chopping wood or digging a latrine trench or filling canteens as a sergeant he was supposed to be immune to such little oppressions but hed been a common soldier longer than hed been an underofficer sir i dont know what youre talking about he said blandly ill bet you dont joram laughed again a laugh so big and booming rollant wondered if the riders on the far side of the franklin could hear it but they just kept on riding the company commander said blond or not youre sure as hells an old soldier arent you rollant shrugged ive been doing this a while now he said but any serf would tell you how much of a fool you have to be before you admit anything that puts you in trouble you dont need to be a serf to learn thatthough i dont suppose it hurts joram said now that youre an officer sir have you heard anything about whether well cross the franklin and finish the traitors once and for all rollant asked that made joram laugh yet again but this time without much in the way of amusement in his voice just because they gave me one epaulet doesnt mean they tell me anything he answered if i had my way wed already be pushing those bastards out of honeyi hear thats where they finally went and ran to but even though im a lieutenant i dont have my way for whatever it may be worth to you id do the same rollant said of course im only a sergeant and im only a blond so i really dont have my way no i dont suppose you do joram agreed but tell me thiswhen the war started before you joined the army did you ever think youd say something like im only a sergeant no sir cant say that i did rollant admitted what i wonder now is how things will be for my children and for their children i dont want them to have to go through a lot of the things ive had to put up with because of the way i look joram nodded his big heavyfeatured head once more dont blame you a bit if i were a blond id say the same godsdamned thing since im not a blond ill say something else instead dont expect miracles the gods dont dole em out very often if you figure everythings going to be perfect on account of weve gone and whipped false king geoffrey youll wind up disappointed now rollant laughed sir im a blond its a miracle i believe in miracles if you know what i mean i think maybe i do lieutenant joram smacked him on the back hard enough to stagger him never mind miracles then believe that weve won this war whether we go over the franklin or not and that well go on from there everyone kept saying the same thing it wasnt so much that rollant believed it was wrong for he didnt after the fight in front of ramblerton no northern army worthy of the name survived east of the green ridge mountains but he wanted to be in at the death to see false king geoffreys realm fail hearing that it happened somewhere else later on didnt have the same feel the same meaning yes i want victory in my own hands he thought and then how very very detinan im getting john the lister had done a lot of hard and dangerous things during the war between the provinces hed got his detachment through the battle of poor richard and wrecked the army of franklin in the process his men had played a major role in the victory in front of ramblerton and in the pursuit that followed and now here he was talking negotiating terms of surrender for a postmaster the postmaster in question a wizened bespectacled little man named ithran had taken care of letters and parcels going into and out of the town of warsaw hed done that before the war and hed done it under the auspices of false king geoffrey during the war and he wanted to go on doing it now that king avrams authority had come to northern franklin what he didnt want to do was swear an oath of allegiance to avram well thats simple enough john told him if you dont your town will have a new postmaster fast as we can find one ithran writhed like a man who needed to run to the jakes its not fair he whined with the war just about over who else would i be loyal to i dont know i dont want to find out neither does his majesty john replied no penalty will fall on you if you dont swear the oath king avram is a merciful manmore merciful than he ought to be i often think but if you cannot swear loyalty to him by the thunderer and the lion god and the rest of the heavenly host on mount panamgam beyond the sky you will not stay postmaster in warsaw but ithran threw his hands in the air he must have seen that john the lister meant what he said all right all right ill swear do i give you my oath no you give it to the priests theyre the proper ones to hold it ask in our encampment john said someone will tell you where to find them ill do that thank you despite the polite words ithran sounded anything but grateful still fuming he scuttled out of johns presence john reminded himself to check to make sure ithran had sworn the oath before letting him open up the post office in warsaw even if he did swear it john judged he wouldnt do so with anything even approaching sincerity he had after all already sworn allegiance first to king buchan and then to false king geoffrey after that how important would he reckon one more oath but john was not charged with enforcing sincerity only the law king avram had ordained and once the oath was sworn the priests wouldnt be the only ones holding it the gods would also keep it in their hands while that might not matter in this world it should in the next several of the seven hells had particularly interesting sections reserved for oathbreakers that was one reason why john the lister didnt fret much about ithrans sincerity though he did wish major alva had never told him about the inward hypothesis which made the gods seem weaker than they should the other was that as the postmaster himself had said the war was nearly over false king geoffrey nearly beaten if no one could carry on the fight for geoffrey ithran and all the people like him would have to stay loyal to avram a runner came up to john and stood at attention waitingostentatiously waitingto be noticed when john nodded the young soldier in gray saluted and said sir you are ordered to report to lieutenant general georges pavilion right away oh i am am i john said whats this all about the runner shrugged i dont know sir i was just told to deliver the message and now ive done it im on my way then john wondered if the runner could have told him more than he had rumor and gossip always swirled through the camp john shrugged broad shoulders hed find out soon enough doubting george stood waiting for him outside the pavilion the commanding general didnt look particularly happy but then george never looked particularly happy he returned johns salute in an absentminded way reporting as ordered sir john said whats going on will we cross the franklin and chase the traitors after all no doubting george shook his head this army will do no such thing the new orders i have from georgetown make that perfectly clear oh dear too bad john said we really ought to finish smashing up the army of franklin and lieutenant general bell or whoevers in charge of it if bell really has resigned the chowderhead is gone george said no doubt about that at all i dont know who the traitors will appoint in his place i dont know how much it matters either not with these orders ive got john the lister frowned what are your orders sir whatever they were they seemed to have sucked all the vitality out of the commanding general john couldnt remember ever having seen him so low not even after the disaster by the river of death george had been a tower of strength then without him general guildensterns whole army and the southron war effort east of the mountains might well have gone to pieces in the aftermath of the defeat now he said your wing brigadier is to be detached from my army and sent to general hesmucet in the west to go to croatoan and join him after he moves south through palmetto province toward marshal bart at pierreville my entire wing with me in charge of it john the lister had trouble believing his ears but doubting georges heavy painfilled nod assured him hed heard correctly that is what the order says i suppose i should congratulate you he held out his hand youll get to be in at the very end to see everything false king geoffrey has left fall to bits automatically john took the proffered hand he said but why are they leaving you behind sir if anybodys earned the right to be there youre the man not according to what the orders say theyre not happy with me over in georgetown no theyre not happy at all why the hells not john asked in honest amazement he knew his own career was rising while georges stumbled and he rejoiced that he was moving up in the world and in the army but this left him baffled what could they ask you to do that you havent done well for one thing theyre still grumbling because they think i took too long to hit the army of franklin in front of ramblerton they dont seem to care that i shattered it when i did hit it and theyre annoyed with me for not pursuing harder and not destroying it altogether that last touched john the listers honor too by the thunderers prick sir dont they know youre up here on the franklin he asked angrily dont they know how many traitors weve killed how many weve captured if they dont its not because i havent told them doubting george replied but whether they want to listen is another question gods damn it you know how easy it is to be a genius when youre running a campaign from a few hundred miles away from where the real fighting is and how simple it is to blame the poor stupid sod whos actually there for not being perfect yes sir like any officer in the field john knew that all too well all i can say is its a good thing geoffrey has the same disease or worse or wed be in a lot more trouble than we are george spat in disgust but so it goes and so you go and may good fortune go with you considering the dribs and drabs that are left of the traitors armies i expect it will john expected that too and for the same reason thank you sir he said thank you very much and what will you be doing well im ordered to stay here with the rest of my army for now the commanding general replied you notice im not ordered to pursue bell even though they say theyre unhappy that i havent what i figure will happen is theyll keep on detaching pieces from my army till i havent got much left then maybe theyll order me after whats left of the army of franklin and if i have trouble theyll blame me for it he shrugged like i say so it goes army politics is a nasty business john said sympathetically doubting georges glum prediction sounded all too likely to him with another shrug george said it wont change who wins the war not now it wont i console myself with that of course once we have won theyll probably ship me out to the steppe to fight the blond savages instead of letting me help hold down the traitors urgh was all john the lister said to that garrison duty at some dusty castle in the middle of nowhere command of a regiment at most after leading an army tens of thousands strong he looked down at his wrists if he got orders like that with the rank among the regulars he now held hed think about slashing them and george was a lieutenant general of regulars not just a brigadier but the other officer surprised him saying if thats where they send me ill go why the hells not the blonds are honest enemies not like some of the ones ive got in georgetown eryes john thought george was being indiscreet no he didnt just think so he knew george was being indiscreet if he let word get back to georgetown about what the general commanding had said well what difference would it make if george didnt care whether they sent him to the trackless east it would make no difference at all the power of indifference john the lister thought indifference was a power hed never contemplated before which made it no less real trust doubting george to come up with a weapon like that i have my orders george said and now you have yours go get your wing ready to travel brigadier i know youll show hesmucet he didnt take all the good soldiers with him when he set out to march across peachtree ill do that sir john promised and im sorry things didnt turn out better for you i doubt it doubting george said what you wish is that marshal bart wouldve named you commanding general here instead of trying to ship baron logan the black here from the west then you wouldve smashed bell in front of ramblerton and you wouldve been the hero eh am i right or am i wrong youre right john mumbled embarrassed he had to admit it why didnt you do more to call me on it back then george had warned him but hadnt made it so plain he knew what was going on in his mind with one more massive shrug the general commanding said we had to beat bell first now weve done that so whether we squabble among ourselves doesnt matter so much his smile was strangely wistful to the victors go the spoilsand the squabbles over them yes sir john the lister gave doubting george a salute that had a lot of hailandfarewell in it believe me sir ill have the men in tiptop shape when we go west to join up with general hesmucet now doubting george looked and sounded as sharp and cynical as he usually did oh i do believe you brigadier after all if the soldiers perform well you look good because of it nodding john saluted again and beat a hasty retreat hed served alongside george before serving under him he wouldnt be sorry to get away to serve under general hesmucet again yes hesmucet could be difficult but from everything john the lister had seen any general worth his pantaloons was difficult hesmucet though had a simple driving energy john liked doubting george brooded and fretted before he struck when he finally hit he hit hard that his army stood by the southern bank of the franklin proved as much still his long wait till all the pieces he wanted were in place had driven everyone around him to distraction hesmucet now hesmucet had blithely set out across peachtree province toward veldt without even worrying about his supply line let alone anything else hed taken a chancetaken it and got away with taking it john tried to imagine doubting george doing the like and then just when he was about to dismiss his present but not future general commanding as an old foof he remembered george had had the idea for tramping across peachtree weeks before hesmucet latched on to it and made it real john scratched his head what did that say to the hells with me if i know he muttered the more you looked at people the more complicated they got john had hardly returned to his own command before a major came running up to him and asked sir is it really true were going to croatoan how the hells did you know that john stared lieutenant general george just this minute gave me my orders the major didnt look the least bit abashed oh its all over camp by now sir he said airily so it is true eh yes its true johns voice by contrast was heavy as granite gods damn me if i know why we bother giving orders at all rumor could do the job twice as well in half the time wouldnt be surprised sir trying to be agreeable the major accidentally turned insulting instead he didnt even notice saluting he went on well the men will be ready i promise you that he hurried away intent on turning his promise into reality john the lister gaped then started to laugh gods help the traitors he said to nobody in particular then laughing still he shook his head no nothing can help them now officers set above doubting george had given him plenty of reason to be disgusted all through the war between the provinces there were times and more than a few of them when hed worried more about his own superiors than about the fierce blueclad warriors who followed false king geoffrey but this this was about the hardest thing george had ever had to deal with hed done everything king avram and marshal bart wanted him to do hed kept bell and the army of franklin from reaching the highlow river hed kept them from getting into cloviston at all theyd hardly even touched the cumbersome river and theyd never come close to breaking into ramblerton once hed beaten them in front of the capital of franklin hed chased them north all through the province hed broken the army of franklin broken it to bits much the biggest part of the force bell had brought into franklin was either dead or taken captive bell had resigned his command in disgrace what was left of that command wasnt even styled the army of franklin any more it wasnt big enough to be reckoned an army and for a reward doubting george had got a good kick in the ballocks and thats it the commanding general muttered in disgust staring across the franklin at ned of the forests unicornriders they knew what hed done to the army of franklin why the hells didnt the fancypantaloons idiots back in georgetown beside george colonel andy stirred it isnt right sir he said looking and sounding for all the world like an indignant chipmunk tell me about it george said and while youre at it tell me what i can do about it andy was silent george had known his adjutant would be hed known why too theres nothing i can do about it not fair not right andy looked and sounded more indignant than ever by the lion gods mane sir if it werent for you king avram wouldnt have been able to carry on the fight here in the east that did exaggerate things as doubting george knew voice dry he answered oh marshal bart and general hesmucet mightve had a little somethingjust a little something mind youto do with it too and a good many thousand soldiers too i know what the trouble is andy said hotly its because youre from parthenia sir that isnt right either not when were fighting to hold detina together even if youre right i cant do anything about it now george said only thing i ever could have done about it was fight for grand duke geoffrey instead of king avram and i do believe idve sooner coughed up a lung he feared andy had a point though a lot of southrons distrusted him because almost everyone in his province with the exception of the southeast which was now east parthenia a province of its own had gone over to geoffrey and the parthenians who followed geoffrey called him a traitor to their cause as far as he was concerned they were traitors to the detinan cause but they cared not a fig for his opinion he tried not to care about theirs either it wasnt easy theyd been his neighbors his friendshis relativesbefore the war began now even though some of them still were his relatives they despised him to a man no not quite he shook his head he knew that wasnt quite true duke edward of arlington had chosen to fight for his province rather than for a united detina but he still respected those whod gone the other way duke edward of course was no man of the ordinary sort people said king avram had offered command of his armies to duke edward when the war began duke edward though had counted parthenia above the kingdom as a whole doubting george wondered how things would have gone had edward gone with detina as he had himself he suspected geoffreys forces wouldnt have lasted long without their great generaland with him leading the other side but that was all moonshine george had enough trouble dealing with what really was across the river the unicornriders went back and forth back and forth on their endless patrols bell hadnt had the faintest notion what he was doing or so it often seemed to george and yet bell had gone to the military collegium at annasville ned of the forest by contrast had never been anywhere near the military collegium or any other place that had anything to do with soldiering hed first joined geoffreys side as a common soldier yet he was as dangerous a professional as anybody on either side george doubted anyone could have run the rearguard skirmishes during bells retreat any better than ned had if ned hadnt done quite so well the army of franklin might have been completely destroyed that might have sufficed to make marshal bart happy then again it might not have bart seemed most determined not to be happy with doubting george george knew why too hed committed the unforgivable sin for a subordinate hed bucked his superiors orders and hed proved himself right in doing it no wonder bart was breaking up his army and taking it away from him a piece at a time doubting george was so intent on his gloomy reflections he didnt notice someone had come up beside him till a polite cough forced him to sorry to disturb you sir major alva said apologetically i know how important a reverie can be when youre trying to work things through a reverie george snorted i dont believe i could come up with a good chain of thought right now by the thunderers beard i dont believe i could even come up with a good link and you accuse me of reverie ha the mage blinked oh well can you answer a question for me i can always answer questions major of course whether the answers make any sense depends on what questions you ask uh of course alva took half a step away from doubting george as if realizing he was dealing with a lunatic who might be dangerous but he did ask his question is it true that im ordered to palmetto province with john the lister the way i went to summer mountain and poor richard with him although the general commanding wished he could give an answer that made no sense he had to nod yes major that is true youre specifically mentioned in the orders sending john west i wish i could tell you otherwise because id like to keep you here youve done splendid work for me dont think i havent noticed thank you sir alva said if you want to know what i think i think its a shame you dont get to do more here so do i now that you mention it doubting george said but thats not how things have worked out all i can do about it is make sure the traitors dont get loose in spite of everything i dont believe you have much to worry about there alva said i dont believe i do either but that doesnt mean i wont be careful it doesnt mean i wont be twice as careful as a matter of fact george replied the worst things happen when youre sure youve got nothing to worry about and if you dont believe me ask general guildenstern he waved as if inviting the wizard to do just that go ahead major ask him uh i cant ask him sir alva said nervously he isnt here he might have feared the general commanding had forgotten guildenstern was off in the east fighting blond savages on the steppe but doubting george hadnt forgotten he remembered all too well no he isnt here he agreed and the reason he isnt here is he was sure he had thraxton the braggart whipped he was sure the traitors were trundling up to marthasville as fast as they could run he was sure he didnt have a single solitary thing to worry about he was sureand he was wrong i dont intend to make that mistake with the three men king avram leaves me ill keep an eye on whatever the traitors still have up in honey they may lick me but they wont catch me napping alva pondered that you make good sense sir i wish theyd given lessons like that when i was studying sorcery id be better off for them but that isnt a lesson in sorcery george said its a lesson in life a lesson in common sense are you telling me they dont teach mages common sense that shocks me that does well thats not just what i meant i alva broke off and gave doubting george a dirty look youre making fun again he said accusingly with one of his broadshouldered shrugs george said i can either make fun or i can start yelling and cursing and pitching a fit which would you rather me i think it would be entertaining if you pitched a fit alva tried to project an air of childlike innocence he didnt have too much luck you would doubting george told him now why dont you disappear so i can go back into mywhat did you call it my reverie that was it but you said it wasnt a reverie sir alva said it might be if i give it a chance but if it wasnt one in the first place then you cant very well go back into it can you did you study wizardry or at a collegium of law george rumbled to his surprise major alva laughed out loud can you imagine me a barrister sir or even a solicitor he asked and doubting george laughed too for he couldnt with a halfmocking salute alva did leave and there stood doubting george looking at the rainswollen waters of the franklin looking at neds unicornriders looking at the ignominious conclusion to what should have been glorious instead it had been glorious in fact the only trouble was they couldnt see the glory back in georgetown or maybe they could but they didnt think it glittered brightly enough is this a reverie george wondered he doubted it he just felt as chilly and gloomy as the winters day all around him hoofbeats brought him back to himself he looked around blinking a couple of times maybe it had been a reverie after all up came hardriding jimmy the brash young commander of unicornriders swung down out of the saddle tied his mount to a lowhanging branch and came over to doubting george he saluted crisply returning the salute george said and what can i do for you sir ive just received orders from georgetown jimmy said excitement thrummed in his voice george could see it in his stance what sort of orders the commanding general asked though jimmys delight gave him a pretty good idea and sure enough jimmy answered detached duty sir my whole contingent of unicornriders im ordered to go down into dothan smash up everything in my path and hound ned of the forest to death he sounded quiveringly eager to be about it too doubting george was also quiveringquivering with fury congratulations brigadier i hope you do it and i think you can he wasnt angry at jimmy or not directly these orders came straight to you uh yes sir they did now jimmy knew what the trouble was do you mean to say you didnt get them that is exactly what i mean to say george growled by now the butchers dismembering the carcass of my army must suppose im dead for they dont even bother letting me know before they hack off another limb at least they had the courtesy to tell me when they took john the lister away from me hardriding jimmy turned red he stroked one end of his long drooping mustaches im sorry sir i assumed you would know before i did ha doubting george said marshal bart doesnt think i deserve to know my own name let alone anything else well the commander of unicornriders was too excited about what he was going to do to worry much about his superiors woes i cant wait to come to grips with ned not when im getting reinforced all my men will have quickshooting crossbows and he cant afford to send his troopers scattering like quicksilver hell have to defend the towns in my path because the manufactories in them make crossbows and catapults and such for the traitors hell have to defend them and i aim to take them away from him and burn them to the ground southron brigadiers had been talking like that when they went up against ned of the forest since the war was young most of the brigadiers who talked like that had come to grief in short order doubting george doubted whether hardriding jimmy would though he was a good officer had a swarm of good men armed with fine weapons that had already proved their worthand the north now was visibly coming to the end of its tether may the gods go with you george said i wish i were going with you too but i cant do a godsdamned thing about that i wish this had been handled more smoothly jimmy said i feel real bad about it nothing you can do nothing i can do either doubting george answered when you do go to dothan with your detached command though you make sure you do whip those traitor sons of bitches you hear me yes sir hardriding jimmy saluted once more ill do it sir he got back onto his unicorn and rode away doubting george stared after him then the commanding general turned and kicked a small stone into the franklin it splashed a couple of times before sinking without a trace might as well be my career george thought gloomily not all the sons of bitches are traitors too godsdamned many of em are on king avrams side these days ned of the forest often felt he was the only officer in honeyindeed the only officer in great river province and dothan put togetherwho was behaving as if he felt the north could still win the war in a sour sort of way that was funny for bells disaster in front of ramblerton had thrown the last log on the pyre of his hopes but as far as he was concerned the fight had to go on hope or no hope king geoffrey hadnt surrendered geoffrey in fact kept loudly insisting that he wouldnt surrender that he would sooner turn bushwhacker than surrender ned a master bushwhacker if ever there was one had his doubts about that but he kept quiet about them his unicornriders kept patrolling north of the franklin a few of them sneaked across the river and raided southron outposts on the far bank they behaved as if the war still were the close hardfought struggle it had always been not so the footsoldiers who remained in honey the remnants of the onceproud army of franklin every day a fewor on a lot of days more than a fewof them slipped out of their encampments heading for home lieutenant general richard the haberdasher the general whod taken over for bell summoned ned to his headquarters in the best hostel in town richard a belted earl was king geoffreys brotherinlaw and had a blood connection to king zachary the rough and ready now some years dead despite his blue blood hed proved a capable soldier and had done some hard fighting in the northeast to do any more fighting with what had been the army of franklin ned was convinced earl richard would have to be more than a capable soldier hed have to be able to raise the dead but all ned did on walking into richards suite was salute and say reporting as ordered your grace richard the haberdasher was tallthough not quite so tall as nedand handsome he was in his late thirties four or five years younger than the commander of unicornriders i have a favor to ask of you lieutenant general he said what do you need ned asked i want you to put a cordon around honey richard said these desertions have got to stop can you do that yes i can ned of the forest answered and i will he was glad to see richard trying to take matters in hand about time he thought still he couldnt help adding you could do it with footsoldiers too you know i could but id rather not earl richard said im not sure i can rely on them your men thoughyour men i can count on and so if its all right with you id sooner do that all right ill take care of it ned wished he could disagree with richard the haberdasher that would have meant the remaining fragments of the broken army of franklin were in better shape than they really were the commander of unicornriders felt he had to add if i set some of my troopers to riding patrols around honey that means i cant use those fellows against the southrons yes i know richard answered but it also means ill have more pikemen and crossbowmen to send against them when i find the chance he seemed to hear what hed just said to hear it and think he had to retreat from it if i find the chance i should say ned of the forest nodded bells successor was proving he had a better grasp on reality than the man hed replaced had the onelegged officer kept his command here he probably would have been planning yet another headlong assault on the southrons he seemed to have wanted the army of franklin as thoroughly maimed as he was himself but richard the haberdasher clearly realized the days of storming to the attack were gone forever for these soldiers we have to do all we can to hold the manufactories in dothan and the smaller ones here in great river province richard said with marthasville and veldt gone theyre the most important ones weve got left this side of nonesuch i understand ned said and with marthasville and veldt gone gods only know how anything they make in nonesuchll get out here to the east that means the ones hereabouts count for even more than they would otherwise true every word of it true earl richard hesitated then said may i ask you something else i swear by the thunderers strong right hand that whatever you answer wont go beyond the walls of this room the walls of that room were covered by a garishly flowered wallpaper that couldnt have been much uglier if it tried ned of the forest didnt like to think of anything that hideous listening to him but he nodded again go right ahead thank you after another long pause richard said what do you think of our chances of carrying on the war well ned puffed out his cheeks then sighed loud and long and hard enough to make the flames of the candles on richards desk dance well i dont know how things are in the west ive heard this and that and the other thing but i dont know so i shouldnt talk about that here in the east hereabouts would you be asking me to ride patrol against our own deserters if things were going the way they were supposed to he waited richard the haberdasher also waited to see if he had anything else to say when the nobleman decided no more was coming he clicked his tongue between his teeth all right thats a fair answer thank you youre welcome i wish i couldve had something different to tell you ned sketched a salute and strode out of the room with the lurid wallpaper he wondered if richard would call him back the other general didnt when ned ordered patrols out against deserters he rode out with them he never sent his men to any duty he wouldnt take himself and before long the squad with which he rode came across deserters three men in the ragged ruins of blue uniforms sneaking away from honey across the muddy fields around the town ned spurred his unicorn toward them the rest of the squad followed the three footsoldiers froze in dismay what the hells do you think youre doing ned roared aiming a crossbow at the leading mans face the footsoldier looked at his pals they looked back at him as if to say he asked you so you answer him the scruffy soldier gathered himself i reckon were going home he said apparently deciding he might as well be hung for a sheep as for a lamb i reckon youre godsdamned well not ned of the forest thundered i reckon all three of you sorry sons of bitches are going to turn around and go back to honey i reckon ill put a crossbow quarrel through your brisket if you dont too you might as well go ahead and shoot us the soldier replied wont make any difference to the war either way defiantly he added wont make any difference if we go home neither he was right ned had known the war was lost for weeks he felt a certain embarrassment at not being able to admit as much to the wouldbe deserter and tried to cover that embarrassment with bluster by the lion gods pointed toenails where would we be if everybody in king geoffreys army acted the way you gutless bastards are doing where the footsoldier answered about where were at now i reckon dont see how we could be much worse off and thats the gods truth one of the other unkempt soldiers plucked up enough courage to add thats right and so it was but ned didnt intend to admit it you dont get moving back to honey right this minute ill show you how you could be worse off you want to try me get the hells out of here before i decide to crucify you on the spot to give the other cowardly fools in this army a taste of what they can expect if they try running away they blanched and turned around and started back toward the sad sorry encampment of what had been the army of franklin a couple of years before when the war still seemed an even affair ned really would have crucified deserters hed done it a couple of times a couple of years before though soldiers like these would never have thought of abandoning their army theyd been through everything flesh and blood could bear theyd seen hope slaughtered on the battlefield and theyd had enough ned turned back to the other unicornriders come on he said lets see how many others who want to run away we can catch yes sir said the sergeant commanding the squad by the way he said it his heart wasnt in what they were doing he proved as much by adding when we run into poor miserable bastards like those fellows though cant we just look the other way thats not why were out here riding around ned said weve got a job to do and were going to do it earl richard the haberdasher had thought his men were especially reliable ned had thought so himself now suddenly he wasnt so sure was their hope failing too maybe it was the sergeant said not a whole hells of a lot of point to getting killed now is there if you worry about getting killed maybe you shouldnt have turned soldier in the first place ned of the forest said coldly the sergeant was a typical swarthy detinan not only that his thick black beard grew up to just below his eyes even so ned could see him flush he said ive never run away from anything lord ned and im not about to start now but im not a blind man either if we were whipping the godsdamned southrons would we be up here in great river province riding circles around stinking honey to keep our poor miserable footsoldiers from running away only one answer to that was possible and ned gave it no but he went on irregardless of whether were winning or losing weve got to keep fighting hard otherwise were not just losingweve lost that sergeant was also as stubborn as any other freeborn detinan he said well sir i reckon we can lose even if we do keep fighting hard we fought like hells in front of ramblerton and a whole fat lot of good it did us he wasnt wrong about that either again ned said the only thing he could lieutenant general bell is gone we wont make the mistakes we did on that campaign not any more we wont of course we wont gods damn it the sergeant was as plainspoken as any other freeborn detinan too we cant make those mistakes any more we havent got enough men left to make em one more painful truth ned of the forest shrugged you can either do the best you can as long as youve got a unicorn under your butt or else ill muster you out and send you home right this minute you wont be a deserter on account of ill give you a discharge he waited if the sergeant really was fed up and called him on that he would have to let him go but the underofficer said oh ill stick you wont be rid of me that easy but ill be godsdamned if i like the way things are going i dont reckon anybody doesexcept the southrons i mean ned said but were still here and weve still got our crossbows if we quit king avram wins to hells with me if i want to make things that easy for him now come on this time he didnt give the sergeant a chance to reply he urged his own unicorn up to a trot the squadincluding the sergeantfollowed him ned wasnt completely comfortable when he stayed in the saddle too long old wounds pained him he didnt grumble about them they didnt keep him from getting about or from fighting there if nowhere else he sympathized with lieutenant general bell poor bell had been a fine officer leading a brigade when he was all in one piece hed been a disaster in the larger commands hed got after he was wounded how much did the endless swigs of laudanum and the inability to go forward and see for himself have to do with that more than a little ned feared a fine mist began drifting down from a leadgray sky even this far north where winters were relatively mild this time of year the land seemed dead trees and bushes stood barebranched skeletal grass was yellow and brown dry stalks bent and broken somewhere off in the distance a ravens croak sounded like the chuckle of a demon mocking the hopes of man neds troopers muttered among themselves he knew what they were muttering about too they were wishing they hadnt heard the raven the big black birds had an evil reputation no doubt because they ate carrion ned felt a certain amount of superstitious dread too but he suppressed it he had other things things of the real world to worry about and for him things of the real world always counted for more than ghosts and spirits and haunts would the desertions stop how much difference would it make if they did would doubting george or hardriding jimmy try to push past the franklin river and finish off the remnants of the army of franklin here in honey if they did what could neds unicornriders do to stop them anything at all weve got to keep trying ned thought if we dont then this war will end and sooner not later the serfsll be off the land forever and the southronsll go around telling em theyre just as good as real detinans ned squared his broad shoulders and shook his fist toward the south in stubborn defiance cant have that gods damn it marthasville again rollant hadnt expected to see the biggest city in peachtree province again not till john the listers men got the order to move west and rejoin general hesmucets army even after boarding the glideway carpet in northern franklin rollant hadnt expected to stop in marthasville for very long but here he was cooling his heels in the town for a second day now too many glideway carpets had come into the city all at once from east and west and north and south and the officers in charge of such things were still untangling the snarl before the warand even during it as long as false king geoffreys men held the placemarthasville had had pretensions of being a big city those pretensions made rollant who lived in new eborac city the metropolis of detina laugh more than half the streets here were nothing but red dirtred mud at this season of the year cobblestones would have done wonders to improve them but nobodyd bothered withor been able to affordcobblestones here that by itself would have been plenty to take marthasville out of the bigcity class as far as rollant was concerned and marthasville now wasnt what it had been before hesmucet captured it from the traitors hesmucet had burned it before setting out on his march across peachtree to veldt and his siege engines had had their way with it even before it fell into his hands blackened ruins lined the muddy streets here and there people were already rebuilding elegant homes and fancy shops might have perished in the flames but shacks built from salvaged lumber and tents sprouted everywhere a forest fire burned oaks and maples but toadstools and poison sumac sprang up where theyd stood the shabby new structures catered to soldiers they were saloons and brothels and gambling dens all designed to separate southrons from silver as swiftly as they could provost marshals patrolled the streets but they could do only so much especially now with the glideway snarl men in gray tunics and pantaloons wanted what the northerners were selling if some of them ended up poisoned by bad spirits or poxed or rolled in the brothels or fleeced in the gambling dens they didnt seem to care every bit of it was part of having a good time nobody in marthasville knew what to make of rollant a blond with sergeants stripes northerners stared some of the detinans from marthasville glared rollant smiled back why not he had the power of king avrams army behind him and king avrams army had proved itself mightier than anything in the north the blonds who lived and worked in marthasville stared at rollantand at the stripes on his sleevetoo but they didnt glare he always collected a caravan of little blond boys who followed him through the streets they did their best to imitate his marching stride a best that was usually pretty funny blond men doffed their hats and bowed as if he were a marquis and the smiles some of the blond women sent his way acutely reminded him of how long ago hed left norina not for the first time smitty teased him about that if you dont want em by the sweet ones sweet place steer some of em my way that one little sweetie back there his hands shaped an hourglass in the air rollant knew exactly which girl smitty meant hed noticed her too he hadnt fooled around on his wife but he wasnt blind he said im not stopping you from chasing her even that took a certain effort detinans in the north had taken advantage of blond women too freely for too long to let him feel easy about encouraging any detinan man to make advances to a woman of his people he knew more than a little relief when smitty shook his head she didnt even see me his comrade said mournfully but you she looked like she wanted to have you for breakfast dont talk that way rollant said when smitty did he felt the urges he was trying to ignore and all the more acutely too how shall i talk like this smitty put on what he imagined to be a northern accent still using it he went into lascivious detail about what he would have liked to do with the pretty blond girl rollant wanted to clout him over the head with a rock that seemed to be the only way to make him shut up i never thought id be glad to get back on the glideway carpet and away from this place rollant said at last it wont make any difference smitty said wherever we go in the north blonds look at you like youre the thunderer come to earth he held up a hand i take it back i expect itll make some difference on account of gods only know when well see another girl that fine if you need a woman so bad wait your turn at a brothel rollant said smitty shrugged ive done it now and again but a willing girls more fun than one youve got to pay that way she wants it too shes not just just going through the motions you might say all right i wont argue with you about that rollant said its one of the reasons i steer clear of these women they dont care much about me if i werent a sergeant they wouldnt look twice they care about the stripes well so do you smitty said rollant grunted that crossbow quarrel had hit the target sure enough he was proud of the sergeants stripes not least because they showed what hed done in a detinandominated world how could he be surprised if other blonds saw them the same way yaaa you stinking blond the shout came from an upstairs window you dont know who your father was when rollant looked up he saw no one in the window whoever had yelled at him lacked the courage of his convictions of course i do rollant shouted back hes the fellow who paid your mother three coppers shed rememberits twice her going rate that set smitty giggling rollant wondered if an enraged northerner would come boiling out of the falsefronted wooden building ready to do or die for his mothers honor if any but everything stayed quiet after the initial jeer smitty said well i guess your old man got his moneys worth right rollants answering smile was tight for centuries detinans had made free with blond women but if a blond man presumed to look at a detinan woman let alone to touch her dreadful things were liableno were sureto happen to him back in palmetto province baron ormerods wife had been a famous beauty whenever rollant was anywhere near her hed kept his eyes to the ground to make sure he didnt anger her or his liege lord so had every other male serf with an ounce of brains in his head ormerod hadnt been a particularly nasty overlord with some things though no one dared take chances even in new eborac city rollant treated detinan women with exaggerated deference he paid attention to them as customers not as women that wasnt just because he was a married man hed found some of them attractive some of them by the looks and gestures theyd given him found him attractive too but hed never had the nerve to do anything about it even if it would have helped pay back debts hundreds of years old if it went wrong if he guessed wrong or if a woman just changed her mind or felt vindictive he would have been lucky to last long enough to be crucified a mob might have pulled him out of prison and taken care of matters on the spot lets go back smitty said suddenly ive seen more of this miserable place than i ever wanted to suits me fine rollant answered the traitors were so proud of marthasville they thought it was a big thing only goes to show they didnt really know what a big thing is when they got to the glideway depot lieutenant joram collared both of them were moving west again soon get the men out of the dives and onto the carpets fast as you can in the end they all went together one man or even two was too likely to be ignored maybe to get knocked over the head anybody who tried to take out joram rollant and smitty at once would have a fight on his hands though they hauled blinddrunk soldiers out of taverns and poured them onto the waiting carpets they hauled soldiers out of brothels too some smug and sated others frustrated because they were taken away before they could worship the sweet one one of those tried to slug joram instead of ordering him held for courtmartial the company commander knocked him cold slung him over his shoulder and lugged him back to the depot some of the women in the brothels were detinans not blonds that surprised rollant whod assumed every harlot in the north came from his own people his being there in a uniform with three stripes on his sleeve surprised the whores too one of the detinans perhaps the bestlooking woman in the waiting room in the place he and smitty went to while joram was dealing with the coldcocked soldier called out to him you want to try something you never did before yellowhair she stood up and waggled her hips to show exactly what she meant the silk shift she wore was so thin so transparent rollant wondered why shed bothered putting it on on the other hand she might have looked even more naked with it than she would have without it staring at her he almost forgot the question shed asked only when the other women jeered at him did he remember and shake his head im here to get men from my company out not to dally myself he managed that brought more jeers and catcalls youve got a lot of godsdamned nerve taking business away from us like that a blond harlot said by the sweet ones teeth havent you got enough rollant asked come upstairs with me urged the detinan woman in the transparent shift rollant shook his head again even if his eyes never left her she saw thatshe couldnt very well help seeing it a slow smile spread across her face her lips were very red very inviting she said on the house yellowhair come on itll be something different for both of us is it true what they say about blond men she was looking at him too but not at his face on the house three other women lounging on the couches in the waiting room said it at the same time in identical tones of astonishment by that astonishment rollant guessed how big a compliment hed just got in a brothel what could be more perverse than lying with a man for nothing somehow rollant shook his head once more imim a married man he said that might have been the funniest thing the whores ever heard they clung to one another howling with laughter smitty spoke up if he doesnt want you sweetheart ill take you up on that corporal rollant said we havent got time i wont take long smitty said blandly but the detinan harlot shook her head not unless you pay me the going rate soldier theres nothing special about you hells theres not smitty said angry now just let me he took a step forward rollant grabbed him as two very large very muscular bouncers sprang into the waiting room get away rollant told them he had to wrestle with smitty who was furious and not making the slightest effort to hide it calm down gods damn it rollant said we didnt come in for that anyway all right youre right smitty quit trying to break away from him odds are id end up poxed anyway the harlots all screeched furiously the bouncers advanced on smitty they both carried stout bludgeons rollant let go of his comrade smittys shortsword hissed from the scabbard so did rollants the bouncers stopped good thinking rollant told them were all free detinans here right we can all speak our minds right one of the bouncers jerked his thumb toward the door im speaking my mind get the hells out of here have we got all our men out of the rooms here rollant asked smitty yes sergeant we do theyre waiting for us in the hall by the respect in smittys voice rollant might have been marshal bart that must have irked the bouncers who were doubtless men from peachtree province it didnt irk them quite enough to make them do anything but glower though which was luckyfor them after the worst false king geoffreys soldiers could do to him rollant didnt fear a couple of whorehouse toughs he and smitty led the unsatisfied customers from the brothel back to the glideway terminal the men in gray climbed up onto the carpets some resigned to leaving others glum an hour passed and nothing happened gods damn it sergeant we couldve had our fun one of the frustrated soldiers complained i had my orders rollant said with a shrug youre not happy take it up with lieutenant joram the soldier stopped grumbling nobody wanted to complain to joram hed been a sergeant too long the men knew what sort of firepot would burst if they pushed him too far sooner or later they may start thinking that way about me rollant liked the idea he didnt think it was all that likely to come true though joram could roar like the thunderer come down to earth that had never been rollants way in the north blonds who roared at detinans ended up gruesomely dead and the lesson had stuck he seemed to manage just the same the glideway carpet started west and south rollant settled himself against the motion palmetto province ahead hed left a fugitive serf he was coming back a conqueror and a sergeant he said softly yes hed already won a lot of battles the carpet picked up speed xii tell it to me again ned of the forest said i want to make sure ive got it straight all right lord ned the man whod come north from southern dothan nodded he looked weary he had the right to look that way too hed traveled hard and dodged the southrons patrols till he finally reached country king geoffreys men ruled i seen them southron sons of bitches ride out they aint that far in back of me neither if they wasnt looping around to hit you some funny way or other reckon they wouldve got here ahead of me hardriding jimmys men youre talking about ned said to nail it down tight all of hardriding jimmys men thats about the size of it the fellow whod brought the news nodded again hells of a lot of bastards in gray uniforms every godsdamned one of em riding a white unicorn he didnt even seem to notice his accidental nearrhyme ned of the forest wasnt inclined to play literary critic either thats not good news he saidan understatement if ever there was one hardriding jimmys force of unicornriders badly outnumbered his own to make things worse every southron carried one of those quickshooting crossbows that made him much more deadly than anyone with an ordinary weapon ned plucked at his chin beard then asked they have any footsoldiers with em i dont know for certain the man from dothan replied only thing i can tell you is i didnt see none just riderslots and lots of riders lots and lots of riders ned echoed unhappily they were heading for the franklin river aiming to cross it and get farther up into dothan cant tell you for certain the other man said all i know for certain is them buggers is on the move if you dont stop em lord ned who the hells is going to nobody ned answered with a mournful sigh nobody at all he nodded to the informant i do thank you for bringing me the news he wished the news hadnt happened so the other man wouldnt have needed to bring it such wishes though were written in water ned took a certain not quite modest pride in realizing as much hardriding jimmys move was real now ned had to find some way to stop it he knew where jimmy would be heading toward the manufactories in hayek and the other nearby towns if the southrons could seize them or wreck them where would king geoffreys men in this part of the realm get the crossbows and quarrels and engines and firepots they needed to carry on the fight against the southrons we wont get em anywhere in that case ned thought and if we dont then its really all over by noon the next day his own force of unicornriders was hurrying west out of great river province richard the haberdasher had promised to send footsoldiers after them ned had thanked him without believing a word of it for one thing ned doubted the crossbowmen and pikemen whod survived the advance to ramblerton and the retreat from it were in any sort of fighting shape even now for another they were bound to get to dothan too late to do much good ned wondered if he would get to dothan too late to do much good in winter roads turned into quagmires that worked a hardship on both sides for it also slowed hardriding jimmy but streaming away from hayek and the other towns full of manufactories was a great flood of refugees who clogged the roads even worse than the mud did the people of dothan knew jimmy was coming and didnt want to get in his way bastards burning everything in his path same as that other bugger done did over in peachtree one man said others fleeing the southrons nodded adding their own tales of horror being who and what he was ned of the forest needed longer than he might have to notice one thing about the flood of refugees they were almost all detinans with hardly any blonds this part of dothan though held about as many blonds as it did ordinary detinans ned wondered what that meant but not for long it meant the serfs were either staying put and waiting on the land for jimmy to sever their ties to their liege lords or else they were fleeing toward jimmy and not toward ned attached to his command he had a wagon train staffed by several dozen serfs theyd been with him since the earliest days of the war some of the blonds were men ned had caught but whod appealed to him because of the way theyd escaped or the way they handled themselves others had sought him out men who wanted an overlord perhaps but not the one theyd got by custom theyd done a lot of things for ned carried supplies doctored foraged and even occasionally picked up a crossbow and taken a few potshots at the southrons hed promised to cut their bonds to the land and to him when the war ended well boys he said now weve been through a lot together these past four years havent we sure have lord ned darry rumbled ned of the forest was a big man darry stood half a head taller and was broader through the shoulders the blond had not an ounce of fat on him anywhere he was hard as a boulder several other men nodded you know i promised you id set you up as yeoman farmers when the war was done if you stuck with me till then ned went on before the war blond yeomen had been exceedingly rare in the north but there had been a few his crew of blonds nodded again this time more or less in unison they werent his serfs not in any formal sense of the word he had no noble blood he owned no estates to which serfs were tied but for all practical purposes he was their liege lord and they gave him more loyalty than most real nobles ever got they could have fled or betrayed him to the southrons countless times they could have but they hadnt clever arris raised an eyebrow ned nodded for him to speak arris was only about half darrys size but had twice his brains if hed been born a detinan he might have made a general himself instead he worried about unicorns and asses and scroungingand about feathering his own nest which hed done quite nicely now he said if you grant us land lord ned will the grant be good what you reckon lord nedd cheat us anger darkened darrys face he clenched a massive fist i ought to break your face for you ned held up a hand its all right darry im not mad arris he noted hadnt flinched that might have meant hed figured ned would protect him or it might have meant hed stashed a knife in his boot ned wouldnt have been surprised either way the commander of unicornriders continued he means if i grant you land and the godsdamned southrons win will they recognize what ive done if the godsdamned southrons win even now darrys frown showed he had trouble imagining that being neds partisans he and his comrades were stalwart partisans of the north too will they win lord ned can they a blond named brank asked he sounded as if he didnt want to believe it either they can they probably will ned answered but i think the grants will be good anyhow theyre on lands up near luxor that i owned before the fighting started i didnt get em while geoffrey was king he feared nothing done while geoffrey ruled in the north would stand now that avram was returning to power here then he added and you boys are blonds the southronsll likely be happy with you on account of that you may even have it easier than if you were ordinary detinans in fact darrys rugged bluntfeatured face furrowed into another frown as he tried to imagine having it easier than a detinan several of the other blonds laughed to show what they thought of the idea arris said dont bet on it lord ned ned of the forest shrugged maybe youre right i dont know for sure but the reason im telling you is were moving against hardriding jimmy now hes liable to lick us hells hes liable to smash us hed never said anything like that before the words hurt if you want to take your grants now and head for luxor ill give em to you nobodys ever going to say you boys didnt meet your end of the bargain arris said ill stick lord ned i reckon ive got a better chance of getting my land if youre there to say i deserve it one by one the rest of the blonds nodded arris had more brains than the others and they had brains enough to know it but did the sly serf see everything that might happen they could put a bolt through my brisket tomorrow you know or they could wait till the wars over call me a real traitor and nail me to a cross all the blonds shook their heads oh no lord ned darry said nothing like thatd ever happen to you none of them seemed to think it was possible ned wished he didnt to the blonds he was something not far from a god or perhaps from a demon something more than an ordinary man anyhow the scars he bore proved crossbow quarrels thought differently though and king avrams men wanted him dead general hesmucet had growled there could be no peace in eastern franklin till he was if they won the warno when they won the warwhat would stop them from making their wishes come true nothing he could see he bowed to the blonds with as much courtesy as if they were king geoffrey and his courtiers there were times when he respected them much more than geoffrey and that crowd of useless parasites in nonesuch thank you kindly boys he said well all do what we can to come out of this in one piece thats all his riders met those of hardriding jimmy outside the town of hayek that was a town king geoffrey had to hold both sides fought as dragoons not as unicornriders in the strict sense of the term they used their mounts to get where they were were going quickly but they fought on foot scouts rode back to ned worried looks on their faces hes got a hells of a lot of troopers with him lord ned one of them said ned of the forest already knew that he saw how long and thick a column of men hardriding jimmy led weve licked three times as many as weve got before he said which was true we can do it again he hoped he sounded as if he believed that he wasnt so sure though jimmys riders had the bit between their teeth theyd tasted victory and they liked it and they had those quickshooting crossbows no northern artisan had been able to match that made their effective numbers even greater than their actual ones at neds shouted commands his soldiers took the best defensive position they could hed never been able to spend men with the lavish prodigality of a commander of footsoldiers now especially every man he lost was one he could never have back again jimmy on the other hand looked to have been substantially reinforced since the battle in front of ramblerton the southrons stormed forward plainly hoping to overwhelm neds men by weight of numbers and by the blizzard of bolts they put in the air it didnt happen neds veterans had been through too many fights to fail to take advantage of the ground they gave back a murderous volley that knocked the southrons onto their heels thats the way ned shouted as his troopers frantically reloaded he wondered whether the southrons would try to rush his position again he hoped so if they did he could keep killing them by swarms but having been repulsed once they paused out of crossbow range ned could almost see their officers surprise oh they might have been saying as they pointed toward his line and talked among themselves these northerners still have some fight left in them after everything we saw down in franklin who could have imagined that fighting flared again half an hour later ned would have liked to go forward himself and drive hardriding jimmys men while they were still shaken by their reverse he would have liked to but he didnt dare if his men left the safety of their shooting pits and trenches the southrons quickshooting crossbows would pincushion them he knew it and hated the knowledge when the southrons tried his position again they treated it with the respect of men who knew they would be in for a brawl he could have done without the compliment hardriding jimmy was as lavishly supplied with engines as he was with men and unicorns firepots flew through the air trailing smoke they burst in and around neds lines men screamed when flames poured over them repeating crossbows sent endless streams of quarrels hissing through the air just at breastwork height any man who stuck his head up to shoot was asking to take a bolt in the face captain watson answered back as best he could but was able to do little to suppress the enemys shooting under cover of that bombardment jimmys troopers advanced again this time they came in loose order moving up in short rushes and then dropping to take advantage of whatever cover the ground offered watching them ned cursed they knew what they were doing all right and they could do it too and then as the shooting heated up a soldier from the left came dashing up to ned theyve got a column nipping around our flank lord ned he cried theyre mounted and riding like hells if they hit us from the side or behind itll be the second day at ramblerton all over again gods damn it ned of the forest shouted but however much he cursed he could see the dust the enemy unicornriders were raising the messenger was right if they got where they wanted to go they could wreck his army he said what he had to say fall back fall back you bastards we cant hold em here if his men couldnt hold the southrons here they couldnt hold hayek either and if the north lost hayek another big log thudded onto the pyre of king geoffreys hopes ned swore again in anger at least half aimed at himself hed had a good notion this would happen when he began the campaign now it was here and the end of everything looked closer by the day the scryer who came up to doubting george had the sense to wait to be noticed george took his own sweet time but finally nodded to the man in the gray robe yes and what exciting news have you got for me today sir i just got word from hardriding jimmys scryer the mage replied hes taken hayek and burnt it to the ground what hardriding jimmys scryer has done that what a remarkable fellow he must be no no no doubting georges scryer started to explain then sent the general commanding a reproachful look youre having me on sir would i do such a thing george said heaven forfend er yes sir the scryer said warily but isnt that good news hardriding jimmy licked ned of the forestlicked him high wide and handsomeand he took hayek and now hes heading on up toward clift isnt it grand well to the hells with me if i dont want to see clift burnt to the ground doubting george said few men who backed king avram would have said anything else clift was where grand duke geoffrey put a crown on his head and started calling himself king geoffrey if that didnt make the capital of dothan deserve whatever happened to it george couldnt think of anything that would the scryer waited to see if george would have anything more to say when the commanding general didnt the young man in the gray robe shrugged and walked away george said something then he said several somethings in fact all of them pungent and all of them lowvoiced so no one but him could hear them indeed hardriding jimmy was doing wonderful thingsas an independent commander john the listers wing was going to help throw logs on the pyre in the westunder hesmucets command another couple of brigades that had fought well in front of ramblerton were now marching on shellunder the command of brigadier marcus the tall doubting george did some more muttering no good deed goes unpunished he said hed saved avrams hopes in the east with his stand at the fight by the river of death hed smashed lieutenant general bell in front of ramblerton wrecked the army of franklin beyond hope of rescue or repair murdered false king geoffreys chances east of the mountains and what had he got for it his command pruned like a potted plant and very little else colonel andy came up to him george set his teeth andy was going to be sympathetic george could tell just by the way his adjutant carried himself by the way he pursed his lips even by the way he took a deep breath and then let it out as if he stood by a sickbed and didnt want to talk too loud youll have heard i suppose andy said oh yes doubting george nodded hardriding jimmys scryer has gone and done great things andy frowned his scryer sir i dont understand never mind george said but isnt it remarkable how a man becomes a geniusa paladinthe instant he escapes my command whats remarkable andy said swelling up in righteous wrath is how marshal bart keeps nibbling away at your command remarkable and disgusting if anyone wants to know what i think no one didno one who mattered anyhow doubting george knew as much colonel andy surely did too the only opinion that counted was barts and bart didnt want george in charge of anything much any more king avram could have overruled bart but avram hadnt raised up a marshal of detina to go around overruling him afterwards with me or without me colonel we are going to whip the traitors george said i console myself with that colonel andy nodded yes sir we are but you ought to play a bigger part youve earned the right by the lion gods talons i think i have too doubting george sighed marshal bart doesnt and he and king avram are the only ones who matter bart thinks im slow because i waited for all my men before i hit bell and the army of franklin i think i was just doing what i had to do and we won gods damn it thats right sir we sure did colonel andy still had plenty of confidence in george the only trouble was colonel andys confidence didnt matter barts did and bart had decided other men could do a better job he was the marshal of detina he had the right to do that and if george didnt care for it what could he do nothing not a single solitary thing baron logan the black george muttered at least hed been spared that humiliation to be ousted by a man who wasnt even a professional soldier but it hadnt happened he had gone forward he had won he had got no credit for it nor by all appearances would he ever he found out exactly how true that was at supper hed just sat down to a big plate of spare ribs though he doubted the pig theyd come from had thought them spares when a scryer came in and said sir marshal bart wants to speak to you right away he would doubting george didnt want to speak to the marshal of detina what a mere lieutenant general wanted in such circumstances mattered not at all well run along and tell him im coming he cast a last longing glance at the spare ribs before heading off to the scryers pavilion there was barts image staring out of a crystal ball bart wasnt an impressive man to look at in a crowd he tended to disappear but no one could deny he had a driving sense of purpose a refusal to admit he could be defeated that had served detina well good evening lieutenant general he said now when he spotted george how are you hungry sir if you want to know the truth george answered what can i do for you at suppertime if the barb bothered bartif bart even noticed it was a barbhe gave no sign he said i want you to move your force to wesleyton in western franklin as soon as is practicable the less delay the better you must be in place there in two weeks time move the force i have left you mean doubting george said yes thats right bart agreed again ignoring the sarcasm i have an important task for you there do you george said i thought my sole and entire function in this army was to stay where i am and grow moss what else am i supposed to be doing before too long i aim to commence operations against duke edward of arlington bart replied still impassive if he is dislodged from the works covering pierreville he is likely to retreat eastward your men in wesleyton will keep him from using western franklin as a refuge and you will be able to hold him until i can catch up with him with the bulk of my force and destroy the army of southern parthenia he was as calm as if talking about the qualities of pine boards but he meant every word of it of that doubting george had no doubt at all the idea left him slightlyno more than slightlystunned ever since the beginning of the war between the provinces the army of southern parthenia had been a fearful prodigy to all of king avrams generals and armies that had to face it it had been but it was no more bart had its measure and for that doubting george admitted to himself the nondescript little man who wouldnt believe false king geoffreys armies could beat him deserved to be marshal of detina whether he deserved it or not though what he had in mind failed to delight george you want me to go to wesleyton and sit there just in case duke edward happens to come my way thats right bart nodded pleased that he understood of course since you will be there with your army edwards less likely to come that way hes slippery as a barrister edward is and so weve got to make sure hes shut up tight i see george said slowly isnt there anything more useful i could be doing than sitting around in wesleyton impersonating a cork i dont believe so bart answered its a useful thing to do and the other pieces of your army are off doing different useful things in other places this seems a good enough thing for the men you still have with you to do a good enough thing doubting george echoed gods damn it bart we were more than good enough not so long ago finally yes but you could have whipped bell sooner you should have whipped bell sooner instead you had king avram and me half out of our minds with worry that the army of franklin would get around you and head for the highlow river well marshal if his majesty thought thatand especially if you thought that you were out of your minds and not just halfway either george said bell wasnt going anywhere and neither was his army hed come as far as he could if youd had a look at his men you could have seen that for yourself i did and i knew what i saw too george said did something glint in marshal barts eyes george wasnt sure the marshal had perhaps the deadest pan in detina too bart said you are entitled to your opinion lieutenant general i am also entitled to mine my opinion is that sending you to wesleyton is the best thing i can do right now given the way the war is going carry out your orders yes sir doubting george said woodenly bart turned to his scryer his image vanished from the crystal ball george refrained from picking up the ball and chucking it into the franklin river he couldnt have said why he refrained from chucking it into the river but refrain he did afterwards he decided it had to prove he was a more tolerant man than even he would have imagined carry out your orders in his mouth the commonplace soldierly phrase somehow turned into a curse bart had the right to tell him to do ithad the right and used it and i reserve the right to reckon bart is a firstclass son of a bitch doubting george thought that didnt eliminate the need to do as bart said worse luck the general commandingnot that george had so very much left to command any moreturned and strode out of the scryers tent none of the mages in there said a word to him in fact they all seemed to be pretending they were somewhere else scryers like other sorcerers often missed emotions they should have seen what doubting george felt was too raw too obvious for even a scryer to miss colonel andy bustled up to george before hed gone very far from the pavilion someone must have told the adjutant george had been summoned well andy asked expectantly what did he have to say for himself now wesleyton is lovely this time of year dont you think george answered wesleyton his adjutant gaped what the hells has wesleyton got to do with anything who in his right mind would want to go to wesleyton its not even a good place to die let alone to live no doubt youre right colonel doubting george couldnt help smiling no matter how miserable he was miserable or not though thats where were going you and i and as much of my army as marshal bart has graciously let me keep are we colonel andy said and the commanding general nodded andy asked and why pray tell are we going to wesleyton i understand why whiskery ambrose went there last year to take it away from the traitors but weve held it ever since whats the point of sending a whole lot more men there now doubting george explained marshal barts reasoning his adjutant looked like a chipmunk whod just bitten down on a castiron acorn thats one of the strangest things ive ever heard sir how likely is it that the army of southern parthenias going to come running in our direction not very not as far as i can see george answered but barts rightit could happen now hell have somebody in place to make sure duke edward doesnt get far if he tries it yes sir so he will andy didnt seem delighted at the prospect and isnt that a wonderful use for the army that broke the traitors backs out here just a wonderful fornicating use he is the marshal of detina he can give the orders he has given them as a matter of fact we need to obey them youll want to draw up plans to shift us to the western part of the provinceglideway lines supply dumps and such oh i have them andy said you dont need to worry about that doubting george stared you have them even to wesleyton yes sir andy nodded thats what an adjutant is for making plans i mean most of them end up in the trash thats how things work too but one will come in handy every now and again excuse me pleaseill start things gliding he saluted and hurried off behind him doubting george started to laugh now i know what an adjutant does he thought and if only someone would tell me what a commanding general is for here in the west the war looked and felt different that was john the listers first thought when his wing moved through georgetown on the way to the coast of croatoan and a rendezvous with general hesmucets harddriving army things seemed cramped here without the room to maneuver that had marked the fighting in the east georgetown itself appeared confident the war was won engineers had been fortifying the capital of detina ever since the war between the provinces broke out castles and earthworks and trenches littered the landscape for miles around the heart of the city if the army of southern parthenia had ever come this far it would have had to fight its way through all of them to get to the black palace when that thought crossed johns mind he suddenly remembered that a detachment from the army of southern parthenia had tapped at those fortifications only the summer before till forces detached from marshal barts army pushed them back what a difference a bit more than half a year made now jubal the lates detachment was smashed the valley hed guarded so long a smoking ruin that could no longer feed duke edwards men and the army of southern parthenia penned up and hungry in pierreville that army would see southern parthenia no more nor georgetown either john the listers eye went to the black palace the home of detinas kingsof detinas rightful kings anyhowtowered over the city looking out from the battlements of the black palace king avram could see a long way he could look on parthenia to the north and on the loyal provinces to the south even if crossbowmen and pikemen had been required at the start of the war to keep peterpaulandia loyal now everything looked likely to turn out for the best a couple of years earlier john wouldnt have bet on that twice duke edward of arlington had invaded the south once count thraxton the braggart had pushed an army down into cloviston too even men of the stoutest loyalty to king avram could hardly be blamed for fearing that geoffrey might yet forge a kingdom of his own it hadnt happened though it hadnt and now it wouldnt the end was visibly at hand geoffrey duke edward and count joseph the gamecock were all stubborn men they hadnt given up yet thats why my wings come west john thought to make them give up hed found his way back to his hostel while hardly even noticing in which direction his feet were going anyone who was anyoneanyone who had pretensions of being anyonestayed at the house of the rat when he came to georgetown for one thing it had the softest beds and finest kitchen of any establishment in the city for another it lay right at the edge of the joyhouse quarter with brothels to suit every purse and every taste within easy walking distance fighting joseph had stayed at the house of the rat rumor said hed enjoyed the nearby attractions too knowing fighting joseph john the lister suspected rumor was true and marshal bart had stayed at the house of the rat rumor said hed almost got a dreadful upstairs room because no one recognized him till he signed the guestbook knowing bart john suspected rumor there was also true bart was supposed to be coming down from pierreville to confer with him the marshal of detina had already delayed the meeting once john took the delay in stride he was sleeping and eating in fancy style at king avrams expense he would have to spend his own money in the joyhouses but every man had to sacrifice a little now and then there was a war on after all at the desk john asked any messages for me im sure i dont know the clerk there replied fixing john with a fishy stare who are you anyway john the lister brigadier of the regulars john answered proudly hed hoped that would impress the desk clerk he rapidly discovered nothing impressed the clerk with a yawn the fellow said ive seen plenty of those before you you cant expect me to recognize everybody but he did condescend to look and see if john had any messages with a grudging grunt he passed the officer from the east a scrap of paper here you are thank you so much john said the desk clerk proved immune to sarcasm too i might have known john thought when he unfolded the scrap of paper he brightened oh good its from marshal bart that at least kept the scrawny little man behind the desk awake enough to ask what has he got to say were going to have supper here tonight john answered before he realized he didnt have to tell this annoying creature anything gathering himself he added youd better inform the kitchens so they can fix up something extra fine for the marshal of detina but the desk clerk only sneered shows how much you know whatever he orders marshal bartll want it with all the juices cooked out of it he always does cooking fancy for him is just a waste of time defeated john the lister went off to his room he emerged at sunset to meet bart in the lobby if he hadnt worked with the marshal of detina in rising rock he wouldnt have recognized him as things were he almost didnt bart wore a common soldiers plain gray tunic with epaulets fasted on very much as an afterthought no fancy uniform for him his boots were old and muddy his face he could have been a teamster as readily as the most eminent soldier detina had produced in the past three generations good to see you brigadier bart said an eastern twang in his voice your men have done some fine work and i know theyll do more once they get to croatoan and link up with general hesmucet thank you very much sir john replied shall we go into the dining room i suppose so marshal bart said have to eat i reckon he sounded completely indifferent that nasty nosy little desk clerk gods damn him had had it right in the dining room the blond waiter fawned on bartand incidentally on john the lister as well basking in reflected glory john chose a fancy seafood stew and a bottle of wine bart ordered a beefsteak dont you care for anything finer sir john asked not me bart turned back to the waiter make sure the cook does it up gray all the way through no pink or ill send it back the blond nodded and hurried away to john bart said i cant abide the sight of blood i never have been able to uh yes sir john said reflecting that that was an odd quirk for a man whod commanded most of the bloodiest fights in detinan history as if thinking along with him bart remarked ive seen too much blood already i dont need to look at more on my plate yes sir john said again the waiter brought the wine and filled his goblet then set the bottle on the table between the two officers john reached for it shall i pour you some no thanks marshal bart answered i will take a drink every now and again but only every now and again i used to like it too welli daresay youll have heard about thatso now im very careful about how much i pour down john felt selfconscious about drinking when the marshal of detina wouldnt but bart waved for him to go on his first taste of the wine removed his lingering hesitation the house of the rat had an excellent cellar the cooks worked fast too the waiter fetched johns stew and a beefsteak that looked as if it had just come from a long stay in the hottest of the seven hells bart attacked the beefsteak with gusto though it was so thoroughly cooked he had to do some serious work with his knife to hack through it he said youll know joseph the gamecock is operating against general hesmucet in palmetto province operating as best he can i should say because hesmucet outnumbers him at least three to one your job will be to go up to croatoan by sea hit joseph in the rear or in the flank as opportunity arises and join forces with hesmucet then if the war has not ended before you get there you will come up to pierreville and help me finish off duke edward of arlington that made john take another big sip of wine finish off duke edward of arlington he echoed awe in his voice that hardly seems real oh it is real all right bart said real as horseradish we are going to whip the traitors and we are going to do it pretty quick i have no doubts about that none at all hed never had any doubts about that which made him unique among king avrams officers and hed been right time and time again hed been right he didnt look like much he didnt sound like much but he won that was why avram had made him marshal of detina and hed kept hammering till even duke edward and the army of southern parthenia were visibly coming to the end of their tether doubts john thought then he heard himself saying doubting george isnt very happy with you you know yes i do know that bart paused to take another bite of his leathery beefsteak once hed choked it down he went on i am sorry about it too george is a good man a sound man when it comes to holding off the foe there is not a better man in all of detina but when it comes to going after him when it comes to going after him george is too godsdamned slow that is the truth i am sad to say it but it is the truth there at ramblerton he should have struck bell two weeks before he did he would have won since john the lister thought the same he could only nod that sufficed anyhow if he said unkind things about doubting george bart would see it as backbiting instead he spooned up a plump juicy oyster better this than burnt meat he thought at a table not far away a goodlooking young man began cursing king avram careless of the many grayclad soldiers in the dining room john the lister scowled who is that noisy fool he asked to his surprise bart seemed unconcerned that is barre the actor he answered he is handsome edwins younger brother he loves lost causes so naturally he adores false king geoffrey does he john the lister said in a voice as neutral as he could make it how serious is he about adoring geoffrey should he be doing it inside a cell somewhere instead of in the dining room of the house of the rat folks who know him better than i do say he is nothing but wind and air and that he would not harm a fly bart answered putting him in prison would stir up more trouble than he is likely to cause so he stays loose i see said john who liked none of what he saw or heard barre went on ranting he didnt sound like an actor he sounded like a crazy man thus always to tyrants he shouted and thumped his fist down on the table in front of him maybe they could lock him up for being a lunatic john said hopefully marshal bart shook his head with just the hint of a smile you have been in the east a long time john things are different here in georgetown it took me a while to get used to it too a lot of men here favor geoffrey king avram does not get upset about it as long as they keep it to talk and they mostly do there were serfs on the estates hereabouts till the war started you know in a lot of ways this is more a northern town than one full of southrons john had heard that he hadnt wanted to believe it evidently it was true no matter what he wanted he said they ought to clean out all those traitors and crucify the worst of em now marshal bart gave him an odd look i said something not much different from that when i first got here too brigadier but king avram would notwill nothear of it he says victory will cure what ails them after we whip false king geoffrey we will all be detinans together again and we will have to live with one another when you look at it that way it is hard to say he is wrong maybe but john the lister cocked his head to one side and listened to young barre a little longer to the hells with me though if i think that mouthy son of a bitch has any business running loose well i would be harder than avram is myself bart allowed but he is the king of detina we have fought this whole war to show the northerners that that is what he is if he gives an order to let people like that alone what can we do but leave them alone without turning into traitors ourselves i mean john thought that over with a scowl he said you know what sir im godsdamned glad im just a soldier i dont have to worry about things like that some soldiers do bart said when fighting joseph was head general here he talked about seizing the throne after he won some victories its a wonder avram didnt take his head john said avram heard about it but he only laughed bart replied he said that if fighting joseph gave him the victories he would take his chances with the usurpation then duke edward whipped the stuffing out of joseph at viziersville and that was the end of that kind of talk our job is to make sure the traitors do not pull off any more little stunts like viziersville and we are strong enough to do it that is why i brought your wing west we will manage we will manage it wasnt a flashy motto nothing for soldiers to cry as they charged into battle but it was a belief that marshal bart had turned into a truth and a truth none of king avrams other generals had ever been able to find john the lister nodded yes sir he said however much lieutenant general bell didnt want to admit it even to himselfperhaps especially to himselfgeneral peegeetee had been right about how things were in nonesuch like most detinans and all the more because he was a healers son bell had spent time in sickrooms that held people who were going to die walk into such a room and you could see death brooding there sometimes even before the bedridden patient knew the end drew near nonesuch was like that now king geoffrey still made bold speeches to listen to him victory lay right around the corner to look around in nonesuch was to know geoffrey was whistling in the dark everyones eyes fearfully went to the north where duke edward and the army of southern parthenia had ever more trouble holding marshal bart and his men in gray away from the last couple of glideway lines that fed the cityand not so incidentally the army if bart seized those glideways nonesuchand duke edwardwould commence to starve and even if bart didnt seize the glideways how much would it matter in the end everything was scarce everything was expensive prices had been bad in great river province they were worse here much worse almost everything cost ten or twenty times what it had before the war began bell understood why too for the coins geoffrey put out these days though called silver were copper thinly washed with the more precious metal bell didnt like using them either if a man had king avrams silver money he could buy whatever he pleased and at a civilized price that also said too much about how the war was going for the time being king geoffrey was still feeding and housing bell even if bell had renounced command of the army of franklin he remained a lieutenant general in his chosen sovereigns service how much geoffrey welcomed that service at the moment was an open question he did not publicly renounce it though not publicly renouncing bells service and feeding and housing him were as far as geoffrey went time after time bell tried to secure an audience with the king time after time he found himself rebuffed at length his temper fraying he growled to a flunky i dont believe his majesty wants to talk to me the flunky who remained as toplofty as if geoffreys armies had overrun new eborac city looked at him from hooded eyes what ever could have given you that impression lieutenant general bell glowered back im having trouble believing the king has all this many meetings and suchlike things are you what a pity the servitor murmured some people will believe anything whats that supposed to mean bell asked why what it said of course the other man replied he refused to be pushed he was as agile with words as a dueling master with sabers after a while bell gave up and went away that that might have been what king geoffreys secretary had in mind never occurred to him but bell almost by accident figured out a response to geoffreys evasions since the king would not see him since the king would not hear him he started telling his story to anyone else who might listen that included his fellow officers in geoffreys capital the nobles who thronged into nonesuch to be near the king and the merchants and gamblers who kept trying to get rich when everyone else got poorer and hungrier by the day bell talkedand talked and talked after several days of this everybody in nonesuch was talking about what had happened in front of ramblertonand talking about bells version of what had happened there that version perhaps not surprisingly gave bell as much credit as could be salvaged from what had befallen the north the rumors bell had started soon reached king geoffreys ears and geoffrey whod spent much of the war trying to strangle rumors was naturally unenthusiastic about having more start he didnt summon bell to him to discuss the officers reinstatement he summoned him to try to get him to shut his mouth to lieutenant general bell the difference in the two possible reasons for the summons was academic that geoffrey had summoned him to the citadel of nonesuch was all that mattered bell was earnest bell was aggressive but bell had the political sense of a watermelon worse he was completely unaware he had the political sense of a watermelon as far as he was concerned the summons represented a vindication of sorts grimfaced guards in blue stood outside the citadel in geoffreys capital for the life of him bell couldnt figure out why they looked so grim they were here on ceremonial duty werent they if theyd been in the trenches of pierreville with the army of southern parthenia facing marshal barts army they would have had some excuse for long faces as things were not likely well fortified with laudanum bell hitched along on crutches past the guards and into the citadel king geoffreys throne resembled nothing so much as a gilded diningroom chair well how much does geoffrey resemble a king bell asked himself but the answer to that formed in his mind at once more than avram does by the lion gods fangs had bell not been mutilated he would have had to bow low before his sovereign as things were he contented himself with a nod and a murmured your majesty lieutenant general geoffrey replied his voice colder than winter bell waited for the king to order a blond servitor to bring him a chair the king did no such thing as bell stood there taking weight on his left leg and right crutch geoffrey glowered down at him from that cheaplooking throne that was when the general began to suspect how angry at him the king really was bell should have been sure of that from the moment the second days fighting in front of ramblerton went wrong he should have but he hadnt in spite of general peegeetees warning after the wounds hed taken though the prospect of facing down a king fazed him not in the least considering what you did to my kingdom lieutenant general you have gall and to spare complaining of your treatment at my hands geoffrey said at last you named me commander of the army of franklin to fight bell said or so i inferred at any rate since the moment i replaced joseph the gamecock that is what i endeavored to do i named you commander of the army of franklin to fight and to win king geoffrey said instead you threw your men away so that the army of franklin exists no more i do not thank you for that or for misliking the fact that i accepted your resignation the instant you tendered it i served the north proudly and the best i knew how bell said i faced our foes and fought them in my own person the wounds i bear prove it your majesty no one has ever questioned your courage lieutenant general geoffrey answered your wisdom and your judgment on the other hand you knew what sort of man i was when you placed me in command or so i must believe bell said if you did not expect me to challenge the foe wherever i found him you should have chosen another i not only expected you to challenge the enemy i expected you to destroy his armies king geoffrey said i did not expect you to destroy your own no one can make war without suffering losses anyone who thinks he can is a fool bell said the enemy had more men more siege engines and in the last fight more quickshooting crossbows than we did he was better fed and better shod we fought with the greatest of courage we hurt him badly in the end we did not achieve quite the success i would have desired by then lieutenant general bell had considerable practice in making disasters sound palatable not quite the success i would have desired seemed bloodless enough especially if whoever was listening didnt know what had followed from that socalled incomplete success king geoffrey unfortunately knew in intimate detail gods help us if youd been defeated then he exclaimed the eastern provinces probably would have fallen right off the map your majesty i resent the imputation bell said stiffly lieutenant general i dont care geoffrey answered i have no army worth the name left between the green ridge mountains and the great river marthasville has fallen hesmucet has torn the living heart out of peachtree province as if he were a blond priest sacrificing a bloody goat franklin and cloviston will likely never see my soldiers again and whom do i have to thank for these accomplishments which must surely make king avram grateful you lieutenant general you and no one else had bell won great victories he would have wanted to share credit with no one else he was more inclined to be generous about sharing blame no one else he rumbled what about the officers who could not get me grain or shoes or crossbow bolts what about the officers who could not get me reinforcements when i needed them so desperately what about the subordinate commanders who let me down again and again i could not fight the southrons all by myself though often it seemed i had to try what good would reinforcements have done you king geoffrey asked poisonously you would only have thrown them away along with the rest of your men i am so very sorry your majesty bell said with just as much venom you have been such a perfect paragon of leadership a paladin of proficiency all through our struggle if not for your blunders you were my worst blunder the king screamed next to you even joseph the gamecock looks like a soldier next to you even avram looks like a king bell retorted a true measure of how disgusted he was they stared at each other in perfect mutual loathing you are dismissed geoffrey said in a voice clotted with fury get out of my sight if you ever come into my sight again i shall not answer for the consequences you already have plenty of consequences to answer for bell jeered and if you crucify me how long will you last before avram crucifies you geoffrey turned pale not from fear but from fury i am going to win this war he insisted i shall yet rule a great kingdom oh yes indeed your majesty and i am going to win the mile run at the great games next year bell cursed his mutilation not because he wouldnt win that race but because he couldnt turn and stomp out of king geoffreys throne room the slow progress he made on crutches wasnt the same he wondered if hed pushed geoffrey too far if the king decided to have him seized and crucified to encourage the others what could he do about it not much was the obvious answer a onearmed onelegged swordsman was not an object to strike fear into the hearts of palace guards but for the click of bells crutch tips on the stone floor and the thump of his shoe all was silence absolute maybe geoffreys had an apoplexy and fallen over dead bell thought hopefully he didnt turn around to look for one thing turning around on crutches was commonly more trouble than it was worth for another he was all too liable to fall victim to disappointment if he did turn and so he didnt he got out of the throne room he got out of the citadel he made his hitching way back to his hostel only when hed sat down in his room did he remember hed come to nonesuch not to give geoffrey a piece of his mind he didnt have that many pieces to spare but to seek reinstatement reinstatement he would not get now that was plain hed commanded his last army for king geoffrey well its geoffreys loss gods damn him bell muttered he remained convinced hed done everything he couldhe remained convinced hed done everything anyone couldto serve the north well if things hadnt always gone quite the way he would have wished well if they hadnt that couldnt possibly have been his fault his subordinate commanders had botched too many fights the army of franklin should have would have won if only theyd followed his clear orders if they werent a pack of blundering fools he thought why did so many of them end up dead at poor richard they got what they deserved by the thunderers hairy fist and one of these daysone of these days before too long tooking geoffrey would also get what he deserved bell could see that plainly now anyone coming into nonesuch after long absence could see the kingdom was dying on its feet only someone who stayed here nearly all the time like geoffrey could have any possible doubts on that score well all be stuck with avram and well all be stuck with blonds hating the idea but not knowing what he could do about it bell took his little bottle of laudanum off his belt he yanked out the stopper and swigged healers sometimes gasped and turned pale when he told them how much laudanum he took every day he didnt care he needed the drug it held physical torment at something close to arms length a good stiff dose also helped him avoid dwelling on any of the many things he didnt care to contemplate he caressed the smooth glass curve of the laudanum bottle as if it were the curve of a lovers breast till he was wounded hed never known how marvelous a drug could be he tried to imagine his life these days without laudanumtried and shuddering failed without laudanum he wasnt truly alive and i never would have known if i hadnt been wounded he murmured i would have missed allthis he caressed the bottle again laudanum made him real laudanum made him clever as long as he had laudanum everything that had happened to him every single bit of it was all worthwhile captain gremio had seen more in the way of warfare than hed ever wanted now in his own home province he saw the final ruin to which the hopes of the north had come colonel florizels soldiers had joined with the forlorn handful of men count joseph the gamecock was using to try to hold back the great flood tide of general hesmucets advance with the addition of florizels veterans joseph the gamecock now had a forlorn double handful of men handful or double handful what joseph didnt have was enough men hesmucets soldiers ranged through palmetto province almost as they pleased joseph had hoped the swamps and marshes in the north near veldt would slow the southrons down as they swarmed south toward parthenia building roads through the trackless wilderness the southrons had broken through the difficult country faster than joseph or any other northerner imagined possible now karlsburg where the war between the provinces began and where gremio lived was lost it wasnt that hesmucets men had captured the place they hadnt theyd simply passed it by heading for hail the provincial capital and leaving a trail of devastation in their wake karlsburg would belong to avrams men as soon as they bothered to occupy it at the moment they were showing it the ultimate contempt they werent even wasting their time to conquer it as a regimental commander gremio could hope to get answers to questions that would have kept his men guessing when count josephs men camped outside of hail one chilly night that made the place seem to live up to its name he asked colonel florizel sir is there any chance we can hold them out of this city florizel looked at him for a long time before shaking his head no captain we couldnt hold them out if we had twice our men and they had half of theirs we are ruined we are finished we are through that would have hit gremio harder if he hadnt already expected it what can we do sir he asked fall back through hail destroy whatevers in there that the godsdamned southrons might be able to use stop on the south bank of the next river we come to pray to the gods that we can delay hesmucet for a few hours if were very very lucky maybe we can even delay him for a whole day then we fall back to the river after that and pray to the gods again florizel whod carried so much on his broad sturdy shoulders for so long sounded like a man altogether bereft of hope gremio had been without hope for a long time hed hoped to borrow a little from his stronghearted superior finding none he gave florizel his best salute and went back to his regiment whats the news sir sergeant thisbe asked perhaps hoping to borrow some from him the news is bad sergeant gremio answered and relayed what colonel florizel had said thisbe frowned youre right sir that doesnt sound good if we cant hang on to hail whats the point of going on with the war you would do better to ask that of king geoffrey than of me gremio said his majesty might be able to answer it i on the other hand have no idea all right sir the underofficer said i wont give you any more trouble about it then seems to me weve got trouble enough seems to me youre right gremio said i wish you werent but you are if they had tried to fight in hail they would have been quickly surrounded and destroyed that was obvious like doubting georges army after the fight in front of ramblerton general hesmucets force kept extending tentacles of soldiers hoping to trap its foes as joseph the gamecock had in peachtree province he traded space for time the difference here was he really couldnt afford to lose any more space at all and healong with the northwas fast running out of time old men and boys and women cursed josephs soldiers as they marched south through hail a whitebearded fellow pointed to the governors palace and shouted at gremio who stood out perhaps because of his epaulets thats where we started thats where we said we wouldnt be part of detina any more not if godsdamned avram was going to take our serfs off the land where they belong doesnt that mean anything to you it means a great deal to me sir gremio answered stiffly then why the hells are you running away instead of fighting to save it the old man howled why because we cant save it gremio said if we try well lose the palace and well lose this army too this way the army lives to fight or to run he thought another day he didnt convince the man with the white beard he hadnt thought he would the local kept right on yammering complaints and protests that of course did him no good at all meanwhile joseph the gamecocks army went about wrecking everything in hail that might have been of some use to general hesmucet they set the arsenal ablaze it had more sheaves of crossbow quarrels and more squat deadly firepots than the soldiers could take with them up in flames they went to keep the southrons from seizing them and flinging them at josephs men bolt after bolt of indigodyed wool and cotton cloth burned too hesmucets men might dye it gray and turn it into their tunics and pantaloons better they didnt have the chance so said joseph and no one disobeyed more fires rose up to the heavens joseph had almost waited too long his little army was just pulling out of hail at sunset as the vanguard of hesmucets much bigger army entered the provincial capital gremios regiment stopped for the night a few miles south of town when it got too dark to march any farther campfires flickered to life sergeant thisbe pointed back toward hail look fire made the northern horizon glow red and yellow and orange though light had leaked out of the rest of the sky the town is burning gremio said dully less sad and surprised than hed ever dreamt he might be maybe our fires got loose maybe the southrons are torching it what difference does it make now what difference does anything make now how can we go on thisbe asked the place where everything started in the southrons hands and burning how can we go on gremio looked north toward those flickering flames which leaped higher every moment everything in hail was going to burn nothing could be plainer than that and nothing could be plainer than the answer to thisbes question either gremio looked around no one but the underofficer was paying the least attention to what he said we cant go on any more he replied whats the use its over its done its broken weve lost the sooner this cursed war ends the better there hed said it that hed said it felt oddly liberating he waited to hear what sergeant thisbe would say now that hed said it the underofficer looked at him for a long moment then slowly nodded yes sir thisbe said after perhaps half a minutes silence and then if thats how you feel what do you aim to do now im going home gremio answered thats the best thing i can think of to do now he was the one who hesitated before asking will you come with me yes sir the sergeant said again this time right away id be pleased to come along if youre sure you want the company thisbe again waited a moment before asking will you tell colonel florizel before you go no gremio shook his head that would only put the weight on him not on me where it belongs this is my choice florizels not a blind man and not nearly so stupid as i thought when i first got to know him ifno whenwe run into each other after the war ill explain myself then but i wont need to do much explaining yes sir thisbe said one more time they left joseph the gamecocks army in the gray halflight before dawn the next morning fires from the burning hail still lit the sky a sentry challenged them someone was still alert and doing his job the best way he knew how gremio didnt know whether to laugh or to cry he gave his name and rank the sentry said advance and be recognized as soon as the fellow saw his epaulets he nodded and said pass on sirand you too sergeant thank you thisbe answered with no trace of irony gremio could hear leaving the army was easy gremio wasnt sure how hard evading hesmucets men would prove he hurried west out of the southrons line of march reasoning they would be more interested in josephs army than in a couple of stragglers from it his reasoning wasnt always what he wished it would be but he turned out to be right about that he saw men in gray in the distance three or four times they probably saw him too but they kept on moving south two soldiers already out of the fight didnt matter to them and gremio and thisbe werent the only stragglers on the road nowhere near others were getting away from josephs army too civilians were fleeing the wrath hesmucets men were showing against palmetto provinceand the greater wrath those civilians feared he would show and blonds were on the road straggling seemingly just for the joy of straggling if they werent bound to their liege lords estates any more they would go wherever they pleased that was what their feet seemed to be saying anyhow both gremio and thisbe still carried crossbow and shortsword that made the other wanderers through the ruins of king geoffreys hopesand those of palmetto provincewalk wide around them which suited gremio fine what do you reckon karlsburgll be like thisbe asked you think anythingll be left of it at all i dont know was all gremio could say well find out when we get there thisbe nodded makes sense gremio wondered whether anything made sense the estate he and thisbe passed that afternoon made him doubt it serfs worked in the fields and garden plots there as if the war between the provinces had never started let alone taken this disastrous turn for king geoffreys cause he wondered what the liege lord had told his blonds whatever it was they seemed to believe it that would probably last till the first grayuniformed southron found the place it hadnt happened yet after tramping on till nightfall gremio and thisbe camped by the side of the road the sergeant made a little fire they didnt have much to eatonly some bread gremio had brought with him he hadnt wanted to take much for the men who stayed behind were every bit as needy as he was once theyd eaten they rolled themselves in their blankets on opposite sides of the fire and fell asleep two more days of marching and a little judicious henstealing brought them to the outskirts of karlsburg a troop of grayclad unicornriders trotted up the road toward them thisbe started to reach for a crossbow bolt then hesitated we cant fight them all sir the underofficer said what now lets see what they do gremio answered the southron unicornriders made no overtly hostile move they reined in just in front of gremio and thisbe their captain looked the two northerners over then asked you boys out of the war resignedly gremio nodded yes were out of it all right the southron said throw down your crossbows then and your quarrels you can keep the shortswords they dont matter go into town swear the oath of allegiance to king avram take off the epaulets and the stripes go on about your business no one will bother you if you dont bother anyone thunk thunk the crossbows so long carried so much used went into the roadway the sheaves of bolts followed they rattled as they fell gremio strode on toward his home town without looking back thisbe followed nodding the southron captain and his troopers resumed their patrol to them it was nothing but routine coming into karlsburg wasnt routine not for gremio his home town hadnt burned that was something anyhow but southron soldiers clogged the streets and most of the soldiers in gray in karlsburg were blonds they grinned and swaggered as they marched ordinary detinans stayed out of their way how many old scores had the blonds already settled maybe better not to know a businesslike lieutenanta detinan not a blondaccepted gremio and thisbes oaths of allegiance to king avram the promises and the punishments in the oath were both milder than gremio had expected the lieutenant offered a scissors cut off your emblems of rank he said they dont matter any more youre civilians again once the job was done gremio returned the scissors to him thank you he managed youre welcome the brisk detinan answered good luck to you out in the street gremio took thisbes hands this is the time gremio declared ive waited too long already i wont wait another minute confound it will you marry me sergeant thisbe smiled ive waited a long time too she said but you cant ask me that what gremio didnt know whether hed burst with fury or with mortification why the hells not because im not a sergeant any more thats why thisbe touched the spot on her tunic sleeve where the stripes had stayed for so long the lieutenant said so remember oh gremio felt foolish youre right of course well in that case will you marry medarling you bet i will thisbe said and if anybody found anything odd about two soldiers kissing on the streets of karlsburg he kept quiet about it a long time ago in a republic far far away advance and retreat is a work of fiction not one of the characters depicted herein bears any resemblance to any real person living or dead a good thing too says i some of the characters depicted herein arent the sort you would want in your drawing room even if you werent in there drawing at the time nonetheless i have been browbeaten into prevailed upon by my editors to offer up a note of sorts for that handful of stubborn skeptics who dont believe in disclaimers and to say shame on you too after losing atlantaand with it most of the civil war that matteredjohn bell hood skirmished with shermans men throughout northern georgia before withdrawing into alabama to refit what was left of the army of tennessee sherman went east toward savannah and the atlantic hood in due course went north hoping to get up into kentucky and at the very least create large amounts of chaos for the union in nashville tennessee with what sherman hadnt taken east on the march across georgia sat george thomas to oppose hood he needed to gather up garrisons in tennessee kentucky and missouri and to mold them into a cohesive force to gain time to do this he sent john schofield south with a detachment from his army to delay hoods northward progress hood forced schofield to withdraw from his position at columbia tennessee and got on his flank and in his rear as he retreated past spring hill something went wrong with the attack he planned though his subordinates said his orders werent clear he said they didnt obey properly schofield escaped and reached franklin on the south bank of the harpeth river yes i know the geography in the american civil war differs slightly from that of war between the provinces in the kingdom of detina see i told you you were reading fiction hood frustrated at the failure farther south ordered an attack at least as much from that frustration as for any real military reason especially since schofield intended to retreat anyhow hoods generals wanted to show how brave they were since his reaction to spring hill left them feeling insulted they paid for their bravery with their lives hb granbury of strahl states rights gist john adams and patrick cleburne died on the field while john c carter was mortally wounded confederate soldiers got into schofields position but could not break it he did pull out that night leaving his wounded in hoods hands it was technically a victory but a victory that wrecked the army of tennessee that army moved up to just in front of nashville anyhow and there could go no farther thomas had too many men for even hood to try to outflank him and get up into kentucky hood sat before the city hoping to make thomas attack him and to defeat him once he came out of his works which were the most formidable west of the appalachians thomas meanwhile waited to get all his scattered command into place and then had to wait further because of a nasty ice storm the delay did not sit well with us grant he kept ordering thomas to attack at once and thomas kept saying he would as soon as he was ready grant for once more jittery than imperturbable finally sent john logan to the west to take command if thomas hadnt attacked by the time he got there and then set out to follow logan himself logan had got to louisville and grant to washington when thomas did bestir himself hood got his wish and doubtless then wished he hadnt in the first days fighting in front of nashville thomas drove hoods army back to the ridge line farther south in the second days fighting union cavalry general james wilsons men got behind the army of tennessee and attacked it from the rear while thomas infantry hit it from the front hoods men broke and fled only a brilliant rearguard action commanded by nathan bedford forrest kept thomas from entirely destroying the army of tennessee as things were its fragments reassembled in tupelo mississippi for all practical purposes out of the warnot that there was much war left between the appalachians and the mississippi after that crushing defeat hood tendered his resignation which jefferson davis accepted richard taylor son of former president zachary taylor took over what was left of the confederate forces some men were sent east to help joseph johnston try to slow sherman in his march through the carolinas he had little luck grant still dissatisfied with thomas detached various elements of his commands and put them to other uses schofield was sent to north carolina to join up with general sherman who was storming north to join the army of the potomac wilson that spring smashed forrests cavalry and destroyed selma and other industrial towns in northern alabama the civil war was all but over some of you may note that john bell hoods memoirs are also entitled advance and retreat well so what that is of course just another coincidence
