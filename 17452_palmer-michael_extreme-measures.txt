michael palmer extreme measures epilogue june the sign painted in uneven black letters on a twofoot length of weathered side read charity utah pop it was pocked by bullet holes and wedged upside down between two dense juniper bushes marilyn colson would have missed the sign if she hadnt tripped over a root and fallen heavily onto the hard dusty desert ground the discovery distracted her from the newest in a growing array of bruises and scrapes and kept herat least momentarilyfrom another outburst at her husband their fouryear marriage was on the ropes even before they blew their vacation on this latest monument to richards selfcenteredness now as far as she was concerned it was down for the count the jeep he had insisted an renting for their fourwheel journey to nowhere and everywhere the jeep that richard said he could repair with his eyes closed had broken down godonlyknew how many miles from nowhere and of course the part that had gone was the only one richard hadnt counted on some psychologist the man could never see any point of view but his own marilyn picked several burrs from her tshirt whenif for christs sakethey ever made it back to la she was going to call mort gruber and tell him to go ahead with the divorce and that she decided as she pushed herself angrily to her feet was that she pulled the sign free blew some of the dust off it and held it up for her husband to see i give youshe swung the barnside around in a grand gesture to the barren roiling shrubcovered landscapecharity utah home of the largest most complete jeeprepair center this side of marilyn cant you lay off just this once i said i was sorry no you didnt i did dammit thats all i ever do with you here let me see that sign he studied it for a moment then tossed it aside and pulled a frayed sweatstained map from his knapsack its not here he said richard in case you hadnt noticed its not here either god you are snide no richard what i am is lost im lost and filthy and hurting and hungry and angry and and cold she glanced toward the hazy sun sinking into the horizon dammit she snapped suddenly i dont care what it takes im getting the hell out of here i work hardas hard as you do harder its my vacation too and i want to eat in a french restaurant and i want to sleep between clean sheets and take a fucking bath in a tub with a jacuzzl she turned and stalked up the stony slope of one of a chain of modest hills that seemed to stretch to the horizon on either side marilyn will you get back down here i tell you were not lost give or take a mile i know exactly where we are we can camp here tonight and then keep heading east first thing tomorrow by noon well be on highway fifty youll see marilyn the woman stood motionless at the crest of the hill then slowly she turned back to him richard she called out maybe youd better hike on up here i think i may have just found charity utah the town half a mile or so to the south was nestled in a valley ringed on all sides by hills it appeared to consistof an unpaved main street starting and ending at the desert and crossed by two or three smaller streets to the east and north fields of some sort stretched into the desert the buildings lining the streets glowed eerijy in the fading daylight looking more like a hollywood set than a functional village do you suppose its a ghost town richard asked as they dropped down the slope and into a dry arroyo out of sight of the low brick and clapboard buildings could be but there are people there right now i swear i saw lights in two of the windows god am i going to be pissed if they dont have a place with hot water you are really a princess marilyn do you know that and you are well lets forget what you are look couldnt we call some kind of a truce at least until we get out of this sure but youre the one who richard please they followed the and streambed for a while and then trudged up a gentle rise that ended suddenly in a small wellplanted field of cornperfect rows of stalks as high as their heads surrounded by closely strung barbed wire curiouser and curiouser richard mused marilyn had already reached the far end of the field richard come on she called back where in the hell do they get the water if youd hurry up you could ask them marilyn said gesturing toward the road where twenty or thirty yards ahead two men were walking casually away from them save for the men the neatly swept street was deserted no cars no bicycles no other people excuse me she called out hey you two up there excuse me the two men glanced back at her and then continued walking richard for crying out loud win you help me out without waiting for a response marilyn started after them at that moment a bell began chiming through a series of speakers mounted on poles along the street almost instantly people began emerging from several of the buildings to plod after the two men marilyn stopped short to her right a woman stepped onto an open porch from beneath a sign marked simply store she looked to be in her late forties although her stoopshouldered posture and unkempt jet hair made that only the roughest guess she wore a shortsleved print housedress over a pair of khaki fatigue pants a patch with the name mary embroidered in gold was sewn over one breast excuse me marilyn said the woman looked at her impassively my names marilyn colson thats my husband richard were from los angeles and we were on a camping trip and marilyn studying the blank expression on the womans face stopped in midsentence do you understand what im saying i understand you the woman said and can you help us out direct us to a hotel hotel yes a place to stay marilyn waited several seconds for a response then turned to her husband dammit richard will you come over here and help me out theres something wrong with this woman shes an addict richard said simply what look at the needle tracks on her armsshes probably stoned to the gillseither that or totally burnt out what should we do well for starters i think we should be a little less aggressive go to hell and next i think we should find someone else to talk to you can star by talking to me a voice behind them said the colsons whirled marilyn gasped standing not ten feet from them was a man tall and lean wearing jeans a plaid hunters jacket and a baseball cap strapped to his waistband was a twoway radio the doublebarreled shotgun cradled on his right arm was aimed at a spot just in front of them you go on in to dinner now mary the man said else youll get nothin to eat tonight without even a gesture of acknowledgment the woman shuffled off my my names marilyn colron marilyn said clearing the fear from her throat this is my husband richard we were lost she smiled inwardly at her husbands likely confusion with the direction our jeep has broken down about half a days walk in that direction we were hoping someone in your town might be able to help us get it towed in and fixed howd you get here i just told you we walked from where our no no i mean here the man gestured to the spot where they were standing we came from the north richard said stepping forward over those hills then down along an arroyo and up into your cornfield im amazed at how you can get irriga what do you want want marilyn echoed with a hint of anger what about someone to talk to who isnt pointing a gun at us the man lowered the shotgun a fraction and then we could use a place to stay and some help with our jeep isnt there anybody in this town who does cars this aint no town the man said spitting through a gap between his front teeth town i said this aint no town he spat again then added matteroffactly its a hospital a mental hospital richard okay if i move my bed next to yours sure im sorry for the way i talked to you today i was upset marilyn colson pushed her metalframe bed close to richards and lay on her side staring through the window of their bungalow at the infinity of stars spattered across the ebony desert sky slowly she slid her hand up her husbands leg and began stroking him the way he liked the day one of the worst in a marriage fun of such days had taken a marked turn for the better after a tense few minutes with the mental health worker as garrett pike the shotguntoting man called himself they hadbeen escorted to a low cinderblock buildingthe clinic and turned over to dr james barber the director of the charity project barber a psychiatrist was a balding cheery man with an open smile and manner and although he had explained little of the project beyond that it involved the reclamation of an old ghost town and was a federally funded experimental installation for dealing with the criminally insane he had made them feel welcome further he had promised assistance with their jeep as soon as his maintenance man returned from a trip to the city with the only fourwheeldrive vehicle the project owned his only requests were that until that timeprobably by the following monday stay within the confines of the clinic and its fencedin yard and that they ask no further questions about the operation now after a hot shower a meal of chickenfried steak and red wine and an after dinner conversation in which barber believed himself to be wellread and thoughtful in a number of areas they were alone in the guest bungalow just behind the clinic richard yeah dont you think this is sort of romantic i mean how many of our friends have ever done it in a mental hospital richard continued to lie on his back hands locked behind his head unresponsive to her touch somethings wrong he said finally what are you talking about just what i said somethings not right here remember after dinner when i mentioned stacksullivans theory on maturation inversion in traumatized children actually i dont no well i described it completely backwards you what i amprely for the sake of discussion and barber just agreed with what i said hes either an absurdly uninformed psychiatrist on richard let me get this straight heres this man being incredibly hospitable to us and youre running a goddam test on him she pulled her hand away i cant believe you yeah he whispered now i dont think we should talk about it anymore for all i know this cabin is bugged this is crazy richard he probably just wasnt paying much attention to you god knows i wasnt youre not exactly riveting when you get going with that psych theory shit of yours richards response was cut short by a fit of coughing he sat up on the side of his bed hands on knees until it subsided whats the matter she asked i dont know im having a little trouble catching my breath i had asthma as a kid but nothing for years maybe theres some mold in here or something or maybe its unexpressed stress im going out into the yard for a bit should we go see the doctor i tell you hes no once again a spasm of coughs cut him off he pushed to his feet and stepped out of the bungalow into the cool night air marilyn lay alone on her bunk wondering how she ever could have thought the two of them were the match for a lifetime well the hell with it she decided she had given it her best shot now it was time to move in other directions unable to get comfortable she rolled over and then rolled back she bunched the pillow beneath her head the air felt heavy and sweet finally she went to the armoire and brought back a second pillow which she bunched on top of the first better she thought as she lay back in bed much better one minute passed then another she began to feel calmer her eyes closed her breathing slowed and seemed to come more easily the last sound she heard before the darkness of sleep drifted over her was her husbands coughing it was seventhirty by her watch when the loudspeaker bell woke marilyn from shallow fitful sleep she had been up for most of the night in part from richards entering and leaving the bungalow several times in part from his spasmodic racking cough and in part from her own increasing shortness of breathbetter when she sat up more marked when she lay back she was alone in the cottage the morning sun washed through the east window highlighting a dense shimmering mist of suspended dust marilyn found the mist reassuring small wonder they had had such a difficult night she pushed herself off the aware of a persistent unsettling tightness in her chesta band that seemed to prevent her taking in a full deep breath richard she called his name waited a moment then stepped into the small courtyard he was seated facing away from her in a highbacked wicker chair richard you should see all the dust in the air in there its no wonder she crossed in front of him and stopped in midsentence her husband was awake and meeting her gaze but she had never seen him look worse his color was an ashen dusky gray his eyes hollow flat and lusterless his breaths drawn through cracked pursed lips were rapid and shallow it was as if he had aged decades in just one night im sick he managed to say i can see that richard im going to get dr barber before he could reply she hurried off by the time she had reached the clinic not fifty feet away she had to stop and catch her breath barber wearing a white lab coat over his sport clothes listened to her account with concern its almost certainly an allergic reaction he said last year a congressman who came out to check on the program had a similar reaction the mold probably im a psychiatrist but i have some training in internal medicine as well ill have a look at your husband some benadryl and maybe a little bit of adrenalin and hell be better in no time within a few minutes of receiving the medication richard did seem better although marilyn was not certain whether the improvement was due to barbers treatment or the news that the mechanic had arrived back with charitys land rover and was confident he could repair their jeep at barbers insistence she allowed herself to be checked over and dosed with two capsules of benadryl and a shot of adrenalin then after packing their knapsack and taking a supply of benadryl from barber they set off in the land rover to retrace the to the jeep indicated by richards careful notes and compass readings the mechanic a taciturn native american who gave his name only as john seemed to know the desert well nine mile he said that is how far you walked seemed farther richard managed before yielding once again to a salvo of violent coughing nine mile john said again marilyn reached over and wiped a bit of pink froth from the corner of her husbands mouth his complexion had once again begun to darken and his fingernails were almost violet still he sat forward gamely following his notes as one by one they passed the landmarks he had noted watching him marilyn sensed a rebirth of the pride and caring that had long ago vanished from her feelings toward the man john will you direct us to the nearest hospital she asked aware of the band once more tightening around her chest st joe the indian replied twentyfive six mile due east from where your jeep will be half a day maybe maybe more struggling to ignore her own increasing shortness of breath marilyn wiped off the sheen of dusty sweat that covered richards forehead richard maybe we should go back to the clinic no im okay he rasped coughing between words lets just get the jeep fixed and get the hell out of here marilyn washed another benadryl down with a swig from their canteen and then helped him do the same minutes later in spite of herself she too began to cough the ninemile drive over roadless terrain took most of two hours the repair of the jeep took considerably less than one richard tried to help but by the time john had finished richard had given and was slumped in the passenger seat leaning against the door bathed in sweat okay mrs john said start her up the engine turned over at a touch could you follow us for a ways she asked fighting the sensation in her chest with all her strength ten twelve minutes is all dr barber needs me back theres a dirt road nine ten mile due east impossible to miss turn south on it go ten mile more to highway fifty then right i hope your husband feel better soon marilyn thanked the man attempted unsuccessfully to pay him and then drove off as rapidly as she could manage trying at once to keep track of the compass richard and ruts in the hard desert floor strapped into his seat richard had mercifully fallen asleep after onehalf mile by her odometer john tooted gave her a thumbsup sign and then swung off to the south she hadnt driven another half mile when the tightness in her chest intensified relax she urged herself dont panic dont panic an audible gurgling welling up from her chest began to accompany each breath fear unlike any she had ever known swept her restive she stopped the jeep richard wake up she gasped i cant breathe i cant she reached over and touched his arm his hand drop to his side richard the name though she screamed it was barely audible she grabbed her husband by the chin and turned his face around to her it was puffed and gentian his eyes were open but sightless thick pink froth oozed from the corners of his mouth marilyn undid his web belt as she staggered around the jeep to the passenger door she felt liquid percolate into her throat she stumbled and fell heavily to her knees at the moment she pulled open the door richards body toppled from the seat and landed heavily on her pinning her to the ground she struggled to push him aside but her strength was gone soon her will was gone as well she slipped her arms around him and locked her thumbs in his belt loops directly above her the sun drifted into view and passed across the sky without hurting her eyes or even causing her to blink over what seemed minutes but might have been hours she felt a strange peacefulness settle in with that peacefulness came another feelinga connection to richard a sense of closeness to him more intense than any she had ever known and she was sure as she felt the weight of him lessen and then vanish that he was alive he was alive and he knew she was there with him marilyns breathing grew less labored inwardly she smiled outwardly the sun had set a chill evening wind rose from the west sweeping a film of fine desert sand over the jeep and the two inert figures locked in embrace on the ground beside it eight months later february it was just after two oclock in the morning outside of warehouse the east boston docks groaned eerily beneath a crust of frozen snow inside wedged in the steel rafters thirty feet above the floor sandy north made a delicate adjustment in the focus of his video transmitter and strained to catch the conversation below but even if he missed part of the exchange it was no big deal at this distance the soupedup granville pickup he had brought with him to boston could record a hiccup for nearly three months under the deepest cover north had been working the docks for the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms he was in essence on loan to them through an agency that specialized in providing such personnel and although his agency had no official name it was known to those in its employ and those who from time to time required its services as plan b north had been sent in to pinpoint the source of a steady trickle of weapons from boston to belfast in rthem ireland what he had stumbled on instead was drugsa shipment and sale of heroin that looked to be as big as any he had encountered on his several assignments with the drug enforcement agency and to boot from what he could pull from the conversation below one of the two men doing the selling was almost certainly a cop frustrated by his lack of progress on the weapons shipments and with no time to set up trustworthy backup north had opted to video the drug sale himselfof all the filth all the shit his work for plan b required him to wade through drug dealers were the most repugnant to him and the most rewarding to bring down at least he reasoned if he was pulled off his weapons assignment the months in boston wouldnt have been a total loss on the down side if something went wrong if by working on his own like this he blew the weapons operation his boss at plan b would have his nuts but nothing wouldgo wrong he had checked the rafters from every angle and had picked a spot that was absolutely hidden from view he had taken the sort of comprehensive and imaginative precautions that had made himyen among the highly skilled operatives at his agencysomething of a legend now all he had to do was keep filming and wait far below him the deal was essentially complete the cop and his partner had taken two suitcases of money and left the buyer who had arrived in a van with a chemist and three bodyguards was supervising the transfer of his purchase from shipping containers to the van he was small and wiry and nattily dressed and he issued orders to his men with the crispness of one who was used to power one of the gambone brothers north ventured trying to recall what he had once memorized about the powerful new england family possibly ricky the youngest north shifted his weight a fraction to get a better look at the man and felt something move beneath his thigh instinctively he reached down but it was too late a bolt probably wedged on the beam since the construction of the roof rolled off the edge and clattered to the cement floor below in seconds north was at the intersection of two powerful flashlight beams following the shouted orders of one of the men below he dangled his revolver in two fingers and flipped it down then cursing himself he inched across the rafter and down the narrow access ladder it was going to be one hell of a long night over godonlyknew how many dicey assignments north had been taken just twice before tonight one of those times in buenos aires he had intentionally allowed his own capture in order to free two political prisoners the other time in uganda he had endured two hours of torture before his backup arrived now he silently vowed to keep the physical punishment he had to absorb to a minimum he would have to be easy but not too easy frightened but not so much that hurting him would become sport one of the goons took his camera and another punched him viciously in the gut he dropped to his knees whimpering they pulled him up by his jacket and threw him into a chair then as he responded haltingly to their questions sandy north began one by one to take the measure of the five men who held him myself jjust myself theres no one else ive been wworking undercover looking for weapons the chemistfrail past middle agean be discounted it was just an accident i i stumbled on this i swear i did i heard two guys talking and thought id see if something was up theres rewards for this kind of thing you know gambone if in fact thats who he is clearly likes letting others get dirty he can be separated from his men in any number of ways look seriously i dont want to get hurt for this and i dont want to die i work for tobacco and firearms i dont even know anyone with dea two of the three goons are young and not all that experienced one mickey actually crossed too close with his gun drawn if the moment had been right for a mole mickey would have been truly astounded at how quickly he and his automatic could be permanently separated this here video transmitters powerful but not powerful enough to reach a satellite ive got a receiver hidden out there thats where the tape is the third goon donny is the real problem a beast six four or five twofifty careful moms uell look i dont care who you are or who you were dealing with i i just want to get out of this with my skin theres got to be some kind of deal we can make it took most of half an hour and several more almost gratuitous punches to his face and belly but finally north got the promise of a deal in exchange for turning over the receiver and tape he knew that the only deal he could realistically hope for was a painless death but he had precious few cards to play and what he needed most was to trim down the odds against him okay okay he said as donny wound up for what would have been another backhand across his face im beat the receivers in an empty oil drum ill take you there donny looked over at the natty buyer who nodded fuck with us and youre dead donny said jerking north to his feet after you get the tape bring him back here the buyer ordered he backed away from the cold as donny opened the warehouse door satisfied north led the three bodyguards out into the raw morning this better not be shit donny said as they passed first one warehouse then another cause im getting cold and impatient they turned onto a broad cluttered pier the receivers in there north said pointing to an oil drum one of fifty or so stacked lengthways in a huge pyramid the thin wire of an antenna barely visible protruded from a hole drilled in the top open it the three men moved back a step as north took a wloden mallet from between two of the drums and gingerly tapped off the cover its packed in an oilskin sack he said reaching inside its in a stop right there donny ordered now back away thats it you really are stupid if you think id let you put your hand on the weapon you have in there mickey get it out with the third mans gun still leveled at him north stepped away mickey pocketed his own revolver and reached into the drum almost instantly there was a loud metallic snap followed by hideous screaming mickey reeled backward pawing futilely at the jaws of a huge bear trap embedded to the hilt in his wrist the third bodyguards reaction was only a momentary drift of his revolver but for north that was enough he kicked him sharply in the groin and in virtually the same moment drove the heel of his hand upward into the mans nose an expulsion of air the snap of bone and the man was down not two feet from where his cohort lay screaming instinctively north spun and dived away from donny the maneuver kept the huge man from crushing norths skull with a sixfoot length of twobyfour the blow caught north on the temple dazed he stumbled to his feet just as donny swung at him again the board slammed him squarely in the back dropping him to one knee in the next instant the giant was on him his powerful hands working their way around norths neck his thumbs gaining purchase against norths windpipe using leverage and every bit of his remaining strength north rolled the man over and tried clawing at his face donnys grip did not weaken north felt a swirling nausea taking hold he needed air again he rolled this time his effort sent the two of them toppling over the side of the pier donnys deathhold lessened as they fell the twenty feet toward icy boston harbor it broke entirely as halfway down they struck a massive support beam jutting out from beneath the pier the beam hit north just above one ear a fearsome pain shot through his head followed by numbing cold as he struck the water then there was only blackness hes a fighter norma look at the way his lids are fluttering his random eye movements are gone too sir can you hear me squeeze my hand if you can hear me there i felt it he squeezed my hand sir try and open your eyes through an artillery barrage of pain the muffled voices of two women worked their way into sandy norths consciousness jean im going to check on some of the other rooms just page if you need me thanks norma youve been a big help sir youre in the hospital white memorial hospital my name is dr goddard im on the neurosurgical service youve been unconscious but youre going to be all right do you understand that i i understand north heard himself mumble colors spun like a psychedelic light show as he opened his eyes and tried to focus on the concerned face looking down at him one by one recollections of the mayhem on the east boston docks began floating back into place thats better much better the doctor said her reassuring smile warmed a long angular face framed by frizzy black hair what happened to you north looked at the iv draining into his arm and the overhead cardiac monitor you tell me he managed all we know is that someone found you unconscious soaked and freezing on some road in east boston and called the rescue squad it looks like you fell and hit your head or else somebody hit you it also looks like you spent some time in the water i dont remember thats no surprise amnesias common with concussion and youve got half a dozen bruises that could have caused one weve done a ct scan of your head thats negative and a bunch of other xrays also negative your temp was only eightynine its up to just about normal now whats your name trainor phillip lyainor north said without a hitch the lie came easily because on other assignments he had been phillip trainor on still others any of half a dozen meticulously documented aliases this time he had chosen to be sandy north it would he decided be the last time north seemed to get into more scrapes than the rest subtly he began to test his extremities each muscle when called on seemed to respond apparently sandy north had dodged another bullet almost nine am which day tuesday the twentyfifth of february good ive got to leave the physician patted his hand im afraid that isnt possible mr trainer why not well for one thing youve already been admitted she said cheerfully you might as well use up one day at least let us keep an eye on you then squeeze my hand if you understand that what time is it he asked page sounded summoning her to another room look mr trainer ive got a man with a fractured neck i have to check on do me a favor and just stay put ill have someone come in and talk to you the moment she had left the room north grabbed the siderails of the bed and pulled himself up just as quickly he sank back mortar fire barraging his temples seconds later he was lying again back from the dead my god what a recovery the woman behind the words a nurse in her early fifties entered the room and raised the back of the litter she was a trim officiouslooking woman with carefully styled silver hair and eyes that spoke of hard times north thanked her and leaned back against the support the mortars were beginning to let up my name is norma cullinet the woman said im the nursing supervisor for this shift trainer phil trainer ah welcome back mr trainer for a while we thought we might lose youim grateful to all of you you had no wallet when you arrived were you assaulted robbed i really dont know it sounds like i might have been now if youll pardon my abruptness i have to leave so dr goddard tells me she doesnt think thats such a good idea i understand ill be happy to sign out against medical advice the nurse turned off the monitor and removed the electrodes from his chest as a head injury victim you could be kept here against your will but neither dr goddard nor i think thats appropriate ill tell you what let me get some information for our records and then ill pull that iv clean off your scrapes and youre out of here deal north said fine norma cullinet picked up a clipboard name and date of birth one by one north answered the nurses questions with whatever lie he felt she would accept most readily occupation importexport health insurance blue cross ill phone the number in as soon as i get home next of kin none no one brothers sisters cousins none that matter aunts uncles business associates anyone we can call mrs cullinet please you asked i answered now how about keeping your part of the bargain there are some things i must get out of here and do very important things to my business believe me ill be fine sorry the nurse said heading for the door two minutes just give me two minutes and ill have you out of here ive got to get you some clothes anyhow yours are soaked in two minutes as promised norma cullinet was back she gently cleansed the scrapes on his forehead and back then gave him a set of disposable surgical scrubs tetanus okay she asked as she helped him off the bed up to date mrs cullinet thanks youve been wonderful its cold out there ill call a cab my apartments not far from here so you said well thanks again yes well see you around pardon nothing nothing just take care of yourself the nurse smiled briefly turned and left norths highcut shoes warming by a heat register were almost dry he glanced around and then pulled up the inner soles and extracted three hundreddollar bills and a twenty from beneath each shoe his parka was sodden but wearable he slipped it on and then carefully made his way out of the emergency ward through a back entrance if as he suspected a boston police officer was one of the dealers no place was safe he had hidden the video receiver as securely as time would allow but there was always the chance someone would stumble on it it was likely that two of gambones men had survived by now the docks would be crawling with men looking for him or his body still he had to find a way back the weapons missionmonths of planning and workwas blown to hell regardless he would have to answer for that but without the tape the sacrifice of his time and usefulness was absolutely futile he took a cab to the salvation army and bought a set of wellworn work clothes gloves an oilstained overcoat and a woolen cap next he stopped at a package store for a bottle of cheap wine in a nearby alley he sprinkled some on his coat and placed the bottle conspicuously in his pocket some carefully smeared grit a change in posture to that of a beaten man and he was ready the transformation which he checked in the mirror of a gasstation restroom was striking he hadnt shaved in two days as it was and the hollow fatigue around his eyes was genuine he hoped no one would take much notice of a derelict wandering about the east boston docks at least not until he had his hands on that video unwilling to return to his room he checked into a seedy hotel to await the night as he lay down on the musty mattress he finally began to appreciate the heavy toll the events on the dock had taken on him his headache was constant but manageable his legs were leaden although that feeling too he could cope with what disturbed him most and was beginning to frighten him was a bandlike tightness constricting his chest he endured several fits of coughing then sank off into a fitful sleep north awoke and fell back to sleep twice before he was finally able to leave the hotel and take a cab to a spot near the docks the tightness in his chest was constant now and every breath was an effort he moved toward the lot where the receiver was hidden and then he froze there were men everywheretwo that he saw inside the fence another across the road not far from the receiver and one more just cruising in a car with its headlights off biting almost through his lower lip to keep from coughing north backed away and headed toward east boston center he would have to wait for things to cool down a day maybe more just over a block away he stopped and leaned against a lamppost winded it was crazy he thought during a recent screening at plan b he had held his breath for more than two minutes now he couldnt seem to get enough air he forced himself to move on but again had to stop this time without warning he began to cough and for several minutes he could do nothing else you all right buddy north who was doubled over looked up a derelict dressed in clothes similar to his own was looking at him with concern i im fine thanks a cold thats all could i have a hit of that huh oh sure here north handed over his bottle the man took a long swig wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and headed off slowly north made his way down the street by the time he reached the downtown area he was doubled over again coughing mercilessly february white memorial this is medevac helicopter nurse specialist burns speaking we are enroute to your facility from interstate fourfive with a priority one motor vehicle

as the finest trauma center in boston in the state and according to many in the world before the radio report was complete the er team was in action arms folded eric najarian stood alone to one side of the gleaming receiving area savoring the immense pride and confidence of the technicians nurses and residents as they prepared for battle that february morning the image of the emergency room as a feudal castle under siege had first arisen in erics mind during his second year of residency and had grown in complexity and color over the two years that followed the techniciansekg respiratory and laboratoryhad become the support troops and intelligence agents gathering information and transporting arms and other gear to the militia the nurses the interns and junior residents were the officersthe lieutenants and captains and above them all watching more than doingwaiting for the moment when the encounter with death hung on a single major decision on one brilliant tacticstood the lord of the castle the trauma team leader over the years of his apprenticeship at white memorial eric had driven himself to the limit with thoughts of the day when he would hold that position now six months into his tenure as one of the two chief residents on the emergency service he drove himself even harder he had grown up in watertown not ten miles from the hospital and was the first in his family even to attend college let alone graduate school he had started way at the back of the pack but after eight years of schooling every one of them as a full scholarship student and five more years of the most grueling residency he was finally beginning to make his mark and reed marshall the other chief resident notwithstanding there were those who now regarded eric as perhaps the best that white memorial had ever trainedthe best in a hospital that had spawned years of the finest physicians anywhere tern dillard the charge nurse on the shift finished issuing a set of orders to her staff and then spotted eric were set for him in four she said crossing to him i told you wed get one today he responded smiling i want the crowd in there kept to a minimum tern okay have dierking get in a cvp line and handle the peritoneal lavage i dont want the other two yet and i dont want to have to worry june feldman can meet the chopper and do the intubation if necessary what did they say the guys pressure was seventy hmmm eric stroked the mustache he had grown and shaved off half a dozen times in the past three years he had no particular desire to have one but there were times when he felt his authority was compromised by his looking years younger than his age which on that day was a month shy of thirtyone what are you thinking about tern dillard asked your eyes he said absently i wish it would be a surprise she was thinking if eric najarian ever thought about much of anything except medicine during her nearly ten years as an er nurse she had seen all manner of residents come and goflakes and philosophers insecure jerks who needed to verbally abuse nurses brilliant thinkers who came unglued at crunch time softspoken young women to whom she would not hesitate to entrust her life but this man was one of a kind when he wasnt working killer shifts in the er he was in the library or the lab if the er was backed up at the end of his shift he would pitch in and play intern for as many hours as it took to catch up as a physician reed marshall was good very good but he seldom stepped down from the pedestal of his positionseldom got dirty eric was a barroom brawler and although tern knew nurses who had dated eric and even slept with him she knew of none who had been able to compete with medicine as the love in his life whys he in shock eric muttered asking the question primarily of himself a spleen a river aortic tear tern ventured maybe his voice drifted off its in his chest he said suddenly how could you know that i dont know it i just feel it god id love to know what the steering wheel of that car looked like the steering wheel listen i want you to do me a favor call dave subarskys lab extension foureightoneone and see if you can get hold of him ask him to come down here right away and tell him better still just get him on the phone ill talk to him he raced off toward the radio as tern picked up the phone she heard him raise the medevac helicopter and ask about the accidentparticularly about seat belts and the condition of the steering wheel she knew from five years of watching him work that with a priority one just minutes away from arrival eric najarian was operating in a zone few trauma specialists ever reached within seconds of the medevac choppers touchdown on the roof of the richter building the battle was underway june feldman the junior resident began her evaluation on the way to the elevator and had her report ready for eric by the time she and the rescue team exploded through the emergency room doors the prize at stake was the life of a man named russell cowley the president of one of the regions larger hightech firms erics pulse had speeded up a notch at that news this mans rescue and subsequent resurrection would be the stuff of frontpage headlines according to the medevac crew cowley had been speeding north on the interstate seat belt in place when the right front tire of his mercedes sl had blown the car had careened through a snowbank and then the guardrail sailed nearly fifty yards over an embankment and then crashed into the base of a tree the jaws of life had been needed to extricate him from the wreck the steering wheel bent almost in half had pinned him to his seat cowley russell cowley one of the residents had mused as they were awaiting the chopper i could swear hes a trustee of this place in fact im sure of it eric had taken in the information without reaction but the look in his eyes grew even more intense with craig norrells abrupt dismissal and subsequent disappearance the position of associate director of emergency services had suddenly come open and everyone from the secretaries on up knew that only he and reed marshall were in the running for the job now with the search committee struggling for justification to choose one or the other of them a trustee had been dropped in his lap you dont know it mr russell cowley he was thinking but there is no way that youre going to die from this absolutely none the corporate executive howled in pain as he was transferred to the hospital gurney crystals of windshield glass sparkled in his hair his face beneath the smeared blood from several lacerations was violet he flailed his good arm and screamed again as a nurse inadvertently jostled his left leg gradually he drifted off moaning softly the orthopedic resident set about stabilizing the obvious fractures eric did a rapid exam and then stepped back he had found nothing that argued against his notion that the impact of the steering wheel had bruised the mans heart causing pericardial tamponade blood was collecting between the cardiac muscle and the pericardial membrane that surrounded it the mounting pressure of that hemorrhage was compromising the filling and pumping power of the heart and causing progressive shock if that was in fact the case then a pericardiocentesisrainage of the constricting bloodwas in order the standard procedure involved the insertion of an ekgguided needle through the upper abdomen just past the liver then through the diaphragm and finally through the pericardiuma tricky potentially dangerous maneuver eric had other plans he glanced toward the doorway wondering what was taking dave subarsky so damn long films first films first he said forcing calm into his voice i need a good lateral of his neck right away have them shoot a chest and pelvis as well june i dont think he needs a tube yet but he might he looks like hell whats his pressure june feldman tried to find out with a cuff and doppler electronic stethoscope then shook her head as soon as bloods are off to the lab get an arterial line in him then a catheter eric ordered feldman set to work cannulating the mans radial artery while a second resident numbed a spot near his navel and thrust a tube into the abdominal cavity a flush of saline through the tube showed no evidence of internal bleeding eric nodded the test had ruled out a ruptured spleen or liver and had made an aortic tear less likely the possibility of pericardial tamponade as the cause of russell cowleys shock had just increased severalfold tern dillard rushed into the room hows he doing she asked breathlessly no better no worse eric said hes tamponading you sure not yet but almost and if its true hold on to your hat youre going to get to see something no one has ever seennot even me that is providing goddam subarsky gets down here in time well i hope whatever it is happens quickly tern said because we just got a call on the batphone boston rescue is on the way in with another priority onea man found in an alley in the north end no pulse no respiration theyre doing cpr a drift diver eric asked his concentration still focused on the residents and technicians the term referred to the derelicts pulled from snowdrifts throughout the boston winter most of the time they were well beyond salvation i think so terrf said the rescue people refuse to incriminate themselves over the radio but they did say there was a nearly empty bottle of thunderbird in the mans coat pocket is he warm i have my doubts rescue made it sound like they were only working on him because their protocol demands it ekg essentially straightline with an occasional agonal beat pupils dilated and fixed lord tern isnt there someone else around to work on him this is big stuff going on here this guys the president of a company a trustee of this hospital and hes got treatable injuries i dont want him shortchanged while i go through the motions with a wino who probably died hours ago terns eyes narrowed youre the only senior person around she said coolly if you need help dr kaiser is next door doing walkins tell him to take charge of the diver if this guy needs his pericardium drained im going to do it enc come on she said gary kaisers been here a year and a half and he gets flustered taking care of strep throats i think his father must have endowed a building or something theres no other explanation for his getting an internship here well just tell him its time to be a goddam doctor thats what he came here to be anyhow it sounds like this divers going to be just another doa tern for chrissakes dont make that face okay look ill be over to help him as soon as wait theres subarsky if things go the way i hope we may be done before the diver arrives dave subarsky lumbered into the room hauling a cart laden with complex machinery subarsky had a phd in biochemistry from mit but at six foot two or three with a full beard and massive gut he looked more like a professional wrestler he and eric had grown up just a few doors from each other in watertown and although they had entered grammar school the same year by the time eric graduated from high school subarsky was in his third year of college it was an unexpected perk of erics residency appointment to find his old friend doing independent research in one of white memorials labs ye david eric called out you have the right dye great run into your boss at all no perfect okay then set up right there were going to go for it june is that arterial line in yet right now she answered one more second and voila a low rapid wavetracing appeared on the oscilloscope beneath russell cowleys ekg pattern next to it were the numbers and systolic and diastolic pressures cowley himself had lost consciousness but his respiration remained steady and reasonably effective the violet in his face however had deepened call the or and have them mobilize the cardiac surgical team eric said if this doesnt work well try a needle but theyd best be ready to open this mans chest okay david this is it everybody listen up this is dave subarsky hes a biologist from mit and this is a new kind of laser hes helped develop were going to use it to open a window in this mans pericardium and drain the blood out from around his heart and into his chest cavity where it will simply get absorbed is it dangerous one of the nurses asked not in davids hands it was developed for vascula work but i got the idea to adapt it for pericardiocentesis i have total confidence in our ability to do this wedave and ihave been doing animal work with it for months mostly at three or four in the morning dave subarsky adjusting the dials on the machine smiled behind his beard as soon as it received fda approval for general use the combination xray and coaxial flashlamp pumpeddye lasers would eric hoped become known as the subarskynajarian laser first though the technique had to work i want you all to know eric went on that this procedure is virtually noninvasivefar safer and more accurate than the needle approach youre all familiar with in that lower machine there we are using a dye specific for the protein in the pericardium this upper component is an xray laser beam that will carry the dye laser beam through the intervening structures right to the pericardium what should we expect to see the same nurse asked well for starters a drop in his cvp and something a little more effective than a systolic pressure of fifty eric replied barely masking his growing irritation with the woman now if youd all just move back ai tern dillard hurried into the room eric the other priority one is in six gary kaisers working on him whats his temp ninetysix two ekg straightline with a rare agonal beat god tell kaiser to pronounce the guy if thats all hes yes but is the cardiac team on standby for this man eric we just lost his pressure june feldman said do you want me to start cpr the wave formation on the oscinoscope was a straight line the systolic and diastolic readouts both showed zero the heart rate began to slow cowleys respiration grew shallow damn eric whispered okay everyone this is it tern youll just have to tell kaiser to do his best then call the cardiac people and get them down here we may have to open his chest right here also get some blood they should have him typed by now tell them to forget the crossmatch on two units and get them over june keep a finger on his carotid ready david ready go for it dave subarsky hit one switch then another a faint blue beam shot from the upper laser followed almost instantly by a red one from the lower the beams intersected at a spot just above russen cowleys lowest left rib and disappeared into his chest for five seconds ten there was nothing eric shifted nervously and moved forward with the cardiac needle more power he asked i dont think so doc subarsky replied jesus okay im going in eric said someone page the cardiac people stat wait june feldman was staring down at her fingertips wait yes ive got a pulse ive got a pulse at virtually the same instant the central venous pressure level began to drop the arterial pressure monitor kicked in at over seconds later it read subarsky cool as snow nodded as if the wholeaffair were routine but two of the nurses began to applaud ive never seen anything like that in my life one of them exclaimed never neither have i eric muttered softly enough for no one to hear russell cowleys coloring improved almost as dramatically as had his blood pressure and cvp his breathing grew strong and steady and within two minutes his eyes fluttered open no one spoke eric studied the faces around him their expressions were a wonderful mix of awe and jubilation it was the prolonged silence of a concert audience who had just experienced the music of a master and eric relished every bit of it through the open doorway he saw tern dillard approaching no not yet dammit his thoughts hollered this is my moment not yet everything okay tern asked look for yourself he motioned toward cowley nice going eric the cardiac people are on their way down youve really got to come in and help kaiser lord any change in the diver no so whats to help eric please okay okay june have the cardiac service admit this guy to them with ortho as consult ill be back in a few minutes he glanced over at tern maybe sooner gary kaiser annoyed eric more than any resident he had ever known he was immature indecisive and nervous as hell in all but the most routine situations it was no surprise to see him running a full code on a derelict who looked as if he had been dead for hours gary what gives eric asked the scene was subdued in sharp contrast to the action and energy surrounding russell cowley a nurse was doing cpr while a respiratory therapist was ventilating the man through an endotracheal tube nursing supervisor norma cullinet was assisting another nurse in keeping notes on the code and administering meds kaiser a rosycheeked enlargement of the pillsbury doughboy glanced down at the ekg machine nothing he said nothing do you think this is the result of a coronary i i imagine so the ekg pattern showed a straight line with an ineffectual electrical pulse every ten or fifteen seconds it was the sort of complex that often persisted for hours after a patient was clinically dead who is this man reflexively eric motioned the nurse to stop her cpr while he checked the mans groin and neck for pulses there were none he motioned her to start up again a john doe kaiser said weve been working on him for almost fifteen minutes why why kaiser shifted nervously well he had those beats on his ekg those beats mean nothing more than a dead heart and and his temp was only ninetysix i i thought we should try to warm him up a bit before calling off the code as usual kaiser was performing mindless cookbook medicine it was a maxim in most hypothermic situations to warm the patient before calling off a resuscitation but ninetysix was hardly hypothermia and this man was clearly beyond help so eric said what do you want to do he checked the mans pupils which were wide and lifeless do no i i was sort of hoping youd take over here so i could get back to the walkins kaiser what branch of medicine are you going into well i ive just been accepted in dermatology residency for next year excellent i think thats a perfect spot for you you are excused what i said leave go back to your walkins ill take over here you sure its okay its more than okay gary its an order his moon face flushed with crimson gary kaiser backed from the room dermatology eric muttered as he turned his attention to the derelict thank god for dermatology the man unshaven and unkempt smelled of the alleys he was dressed in soiled long johns a frayed checked hunting jacket and tattered pants all of which had been cut away during his attempted resuscitation he had a scar on his abdomenpossibly from an old exploratory there was a tattoo on one hip and a bruise and healing abrasion on his forehead eric flashed on the corporation president lying two rooms away and wondered what the cardiac team was saying about the remarkable save eric do you want me to keep pumping the nurse asked huh oh keep at it for a few moments more while i get oriented thanks youre doing a great job did kaiser give him anything eric asked the second nurse the usual epinephrine atropine theres an isuprel drip running now right by the ol cookbook pardon nothing norma do we know who this man is john doe thats all we have well for my money this is an exercise in futility any objections if i call it off and we all go about trying to save the living good eric studied the endstage cardiac activity for a few more moments with the most vigorous efforts and a great deal of luck they might be able to reestablish some sort of more effective heartbeat but with no blood pressure and fixed dilated pupils what then the time for battle had passed probably well before the rescue squad had even arrived he sighed and then reached up and flipped off the monitor thats it he said thank you all norma i want to get back in with that other priority one can you take over and call the medical examiner about this guy no problem the supervisor said also see what you can do about finding a next of kin ill talk to whoever it is if you want eric turned and hurried from the room without waiting for a reply he wanted to be with his save for as long as possible before the cardiac team took the man away norma culfinet assisted one of the nurses in removing the derelicts iv and endotracheal tube then she wheeled the sheetcovered body out of the room you neednt worry about a next of kin dr najarian she was thinking you see i know for a fact that there isnt any april entering the crosswind leg of its landing sequence the delta banked sharply giving laura enders an expansive view of washington dc she had been there once as a tenyearold on the only trip she and scott had ever taken with their parents and had returned to their missouri farm determined to become someone of importance now she pressed her forehead against the plexiglas window and tried to remember exactly what it was she had wanted to be her flight from little cayman island via grand cayman and miami had been uneventful but the few days preceding itthe phone calls the trips to the bank on the main island the search for someone to replace her at workhad ranged from hectic to frantic for nearly three years she had been the scuba diving instructor and guide at the charles ray club the only resort on the tiny caribbean paradise it was an experience that had transformed her but nowat least until she found scottit was over when she had first arrived at the club as a guest she was pale holloweyed emotionally drained and physically flabby it took just ten days of vacation there for her to decide not to return for her fifth year of teaching special education at montgomery high school now at thirty she was in the best shape of her lifetanned and solid her psyche too had responded to the peaceful magic of the caribbean and in part at scotts urging she had sent off a couple of inquiry letters to graduate schools in the states but now all her plans were on hold after years of neatly weekly postcards and at least onceamonth calls from her brother more than six weeks had passed without a word from him she had waited to act perhaps longer than she should have she reasoned that his globehopping job setting up communications networks for a company in virginia could well have sent him to some inaccessible place but now that april had come and gone and delta had assured her that scott had not canceled his longstanding reservation for the caribbean on that april date there was no way she could remain passive her isolation on little cayman had been selfimposed but a byproduct of that exile of her commitment to learning who laura enders was before allowing herself to choose another career or to fall in love again was that scott was all she had he was twentytwo and she fourteen when a kid high on pills and beer had jumped a median strip and snuffed out the lives of their parents until that day she and her brother had never formed any real bond or friendship nevertheless scott had refused the offer of distant cousins to have her move to kansas city and had instead taken a hardship discharge from the special forces and returned home the next eight years of his life including lauras four years at the university had been focused on her an accident a prolonged vacation in some out ofthe way spot a romance a screwup in the mails for perhaps the hundredth time laura ticked through possible explanations for scotts failure to contact her none of them eased her foreboding it had been more than five months since his last vacation on little cayman and it was on the final afternoon of that visit that they had made arrangements for his april return then they had taken the clubs small skiff and motored around southwest point to dive the sheer coral wall at bloody bay the images from that day were still as clear in lauras mind as the water in which they dived it was a doubletank decompression dive to feet the day was sparkling and warm the visibility feet or more a pair of enormous eagle rays had glided by near enough to be stroked soon after a dozen or more curious dolphins knifed past and then returned again and again tumbling and spinning through the crystal sea it was as close to a perfect dive as laura ever expected to have the next morning scott had flown back home to dc and soon after his usual weekly postcards began arrivingthis time from boston ladies and gentlemen the captain has turned on the fasten seat belt sign in preparation for our landing at dulles international airport please be sure that all carryon baggage is securely stowed beneath your seat or in an overhead compartment that your tray tables are locked and that your seatbacks are in their full upright position the businessman who had spent the first half hour of the flight trying to impress laura with his attainments smiled over at her from the aisle seat and winked laura managed a thin smile and nod in return during three years of working at a resort she had been forced to hone her skills at being open and friendly to men without encouraging them in the least but this day she was far too worried to be cordial despite their frequent contact she realized now that scott had shared surprisingly little of his life with her he knew movies and music played chess well enough to beat her without paying much attention and read voraciously in a number of areas he occasionally spoke of royalty he had dealt with in various countries but had a selfeffacing way about him that warned against being impressed by anything he said or did he was a whiz with computers or so he had said and except for a brief stab at marriage he had apparently lived a life as solitary as her own he had a post office box in dc and a phone number that invariably was picked up by an answering service laura would not even have known the name of the company he worked forcommunistics international someplace in virginiahad he not mentioned it once in passing as the glided over the runway laura felt a knot of apprehension tighten in her gut there was so little for her to go on almost certainly she was overreacting scott had probably left boston weeks before and was now on the riviera sipping cappuccino with a beautiful model maybe she should just take the return flight to cayman and wait things out for another month or so make some more calls but in truth laura knew there would be no turning back and no calls as it was she had had to beg the operator to search harder for the number of a company called communigistics in virginia before the woman finally came up with one in the town of laurel lauras call was routed to the person in charge of personnel who was far less helpful denying that anyone named enders had ever worked there in fact when laura pressed matters the woman had actually become rude and finally as much as hung up on her laura had tried a second time and a third but her attempts to be connected with someone other than the personnel director were stonewalled now she decided communigistics international would find her someone else to talk with or deal with an allnight sitin at their offices the cab ride to laurel cost sixty dollars ten of which was spent trying to find communigistics after stopping twicefor directions the cabbie at last turned into an industrial park drove past several nondescript gray marble buildings and pulled to a stop before one that was indistinguishable from the others except for the number on a small sign in front then he offered to wait i may be a while laura said i got a meter okay she said heres twenty if that gets used up its okay for you to take off a weeks budget just for cabfare laura could see that some of her perspectives were about to undergo a change the world beyond little cayman clearly viewed money differently than she did even though the woman in the communigistics personnel office had denied that scott worked there laura felt certain of what he had told her it seemed strange now entering scotts world without his knowingit was like looking through his closet she crossed the sterile foyer to the directory of offices communigistics was on the fourth floor she tried to imagine her brother dressed in a suit and tie carrying a briefcase through the brassrimmed doors and across to the bank of elevators the image did not fit with the easygoing independent man who dived with her on little cayman and who cared so much about natural beauty and the nature of things it was easier to imagine scott as a professor someplace or perhaps a foreign correspondent communigistics international occupied the entire floor a trim receptionist was typing behind a huge solidfront desk with the name of the company emblazoned in gold across it im looking for my brother laura began i dont know what department he works in but his namesenders scott enders the woman checked her directory im sorry she said but i dont have anyone listed here by that name and you dont know him no im afraid i dont laura fished in her purse and brought out a photograph it was a picture the club manager had taken of laura and her brother dressed in wet suits getting ready to dive the wall at bloody bay this is scott she said its about five months old the woman shrugged and smiled politely how long have you worked here laura asked a year longer now and youve never seen this man im sorry this is crazy i know he works here he hes on the road a lot perhaps she was interrupted by the phone the receptionist answered it transferred the call and then turned back to her can i help you with anything else yes can i please see your personnel director i think her name is bullock thats right anne bullock shes gone for the day well whos here pardon the woman glanced pointedly at the work in her typewriter look laura said wrestling to maintain her composure i want to see whoever is in charge here im sorry thats not please ive come a long way im trying to be polite about all of this but i will not leave until ive spoken to someone who might know about my brother what seems to be the problem alicia startled both women turned a man tall and balding perhaps in his early fifties stood ten feet away im looking for my brother laura said quickly his names scott enders and he works here only i tried telling her that no one by that name please laura cut in please let me finish this is my brother she handed over the photograph it was taken about six months ago at the club where i work and wheres that the man said studying the photo little cayman island in the caribbean im a diving instructor at a resort there ive always wanted to dive you must love it i do now about my brother why dont you come on down to my office miss enders same name as my brother laura enders well im nell harten the man said im vice president here he extended his hand which was large and warm alicia this womans brother did work for us once but i believe he left before you arrived however he added looking pointedly at laura he called himself scott shollander then not scott enders now if youd like to come down to my office ill be happy to tell you what i know of him on the way to his office neil harten stopped at the locked personnel office and retrieved the file on the man he had known as scott shollander he poured laura a cup of coffee then settled in behind his desk his office was fairly large but not opulent certificates from a number of chambers of commerce service organizations and business bureaus were spotted on the walls along with framed advertisements for various communigistics programs and equipment harten who had a weariness about his eyes and deeply etched furrows across his high brow answered lauras queries with practiced patience yes he was certain that scott sholiander and scott enders were the same person no he had no idea why scott would have changed his name no scott hadnt been firedhe was very good at his job he had simply walked in one day and quit and no he had no idea where scott had gone or for whom he was working laura reached into her purse and handed over a stack of postcards here she said these are the cards ive received from scott for the past two and a half years there are nearly seventy of them from all over the world he missed a week once in a while but hes never missed two that i can remember now all of a sudden i havent heard from him since february harten flipped through the cards most of them contained just a line or two wish you were here hope youre okay casablanca is more mysterious now than it ever was in bogeys day your brother isnt the newsiest writer is he theres nothing in any of them about changing jobs harten shrugged i dont know what to say scott was a very private person but i guess you know that i can give you the address we have for him in dc and i can ask around but beyond that he held up his hands where are you staying staying nowhere i i just flew in and took a cab here ill be happy to call you another cab and make reservations somewhere laura wandered over to the window four stories below she saw her cabbie reading a paper behind the wheel thats okay my rides still here she said but i will take that address fine here it is win you be heading back to the caribbean from dc im not going back until i find scott well then i hope you do i will laura said ill stop by this address right now and then and then boston i guess the last few postcards came from there harten sighed and tapped his fingertips together for a time here he said this is my home phone i have business connections all over the country feel free to call me if theres anything you feel i can do to help i appreciate that its very kind of you mr harten im going to find him neil harten studied her face i believe you will he said laura took the elevator back to the lobby and paused by the directory nothing made sense nothing at all why would scott have used a false name why didnt he mention leaving communistics she thought about the years following the death of their parentsscotts emotional and financial sup port during her schooling the cards and calls the holidays spent together the nonjudgmental acceptance of her decisions through those years her brother had never asked a thing of her now he needed her she felt that with near certainty he was in some sort of difficulty and he needed her she stepped out into the graying afternoon take me to the city please this address she told the cabbie handing over the note harten had printed for her you got it he said they drove out of the industrial park and onto the highway moments later a dark sedan swung around the corner and followed by the time his bedside alarm sounded to wake him at am eric najarian had already completed twenty minutes of intense calisthenics and was skimming through a medical journal as he wolfed down two glasses of orange juice and a bagel it was rare that he ever slept past five and he would have reset the clock to an earlier hour had he ever thought to do so but invariably his thoughts were otherwise occupiedusually with medicine on this april morning absorbing a significant percentage of those thoughts was the selectior of the new associate director of the white memorial hospital emergency service the position carried with it an associate professorship at the medical school and it continued to be at least according to rumor a twoman contest between reed marshall and himself now after months of interviews and speculation the threeperson search committee was scheduled to meet at four oclock to announce its decision if eric was chosen he would become the youngest faculty member to be tenured in the history of white memorial in over a century and a half the youngest for years he had worked toward rewards and acclaim that such an honor would bring finally before this day was over he would know engrossed in an article extolling the value of placing portable defibrillators in airplanes and on golf courses he stumbled over cartons of books as he picked his way down the cluttered hallway to his bedroom the unpacked boxes sparse furnishings and unhung pictures gave the impression that he had moved into the beacon hill apartment just that week in reality it had been well over a year initially his friends had teased him about ignoring the place with time they had become more concerned eric however simply didnt care he turned off the alarm and opened verdis cage the macaw hopped out onto the bed then swaggered over to him for a dog biscuit which it devoured with the voraciousness of a german shepherd the bird had been a fixture in erics life for nearly three yearssince the day it was delivered by the uniformed chauffeur of a man whose son eric had saved from a potentially fatal gunshot wound it arrived with no note or instructionsno name no age no sexand spent its first month in erics company glaring at him eric initially named the bird hippocrates after the father of medicine but that was before it began singing opera from what eric could tell it could do snatches of a dozen or more ariasall italian there was no way it could be induced to sing on cue nor once it started was there any nonviolent way to stop it but sing it did sometimes for as long as ten minutes at a stretch and although eric had never held any great interest in opera he had listened to enough of it now to tell that verdi was not very good eric waited until the macaw had headed down the hall before shoving the box of biscuits back under a sweater in his closet then he checkedhis calendar and confirmed that marshall would be covering the e r that day eric had decided to pass the hours until the search committee meeting working in the lab with dave subarsky the prospect was bittersweet from all indications subarsky would be closing shop soon over the few months since he and eric had successfully introduced their pericardial laser the biochemists lab like many others at the hospital had fallen on hard times two government grants he had been counting ongrants that would have been automatic in the pasthad been refused a reordering of priorities coupled with a decrease in available funds was the explanation the nih and national science foundation people kept giving but everyone in science knew what they really meant finding a cure for aids had become politicized both within the scientific community and without pressure on the federal government had been passed on to the bin government research installations which in turn had responded with a demand for more authority to direct investigations and of course for more funding the reductions in universitycentered programs such as subarskys had gone from cuts to hatchet jobs a whole community of scientists were suddenly outsiders and for them the situation was desperate the professor with whom dave originally worked had given up basic research altogether and returned to fulltime clinical practice subarsky had begun searching for jobs in industry but even using the laser as bait he had been unable to attract any decent offers today unless some miracle had intervened over the few days since they had last spoken eric knew that he and his friend would begin dismantling and packing their work their laser project was for both of them a sideline they had proven its applicability in one rather unusual medical situation unfortunately sideline and unusual medical situation were not what the current washington funding sources wanted to hear in a month or two dave subarsky perhaps the brightest man eric had ever known would be unemployed eric sat on the edge of his bed and flipped through the classified ads in the back of the new england journal of medicine there were a dozen or so from various hospitals for emergency physicians but none for genius biochemists if the committee chose marshall eric would have no problem finding a job somewhereprobably a damn good one too such options were a luxury dave subarsky did not have yet not once had eric seen even a small crack in the mans quietly positive outlook why he wondered couldnt he get his own situation into perspective why for weeks had there been a persistent knot of anxiety in his chest the answer to both questions eric knew was the same he would admit it to no one and could barely admit it to himself but he wanted this position more than he had ever wanted anything in his life more than acceptance to college or medical school more than the appointment to white memorial more than the chief residency to his parents and much of the armenian community in watertown his accomplishments and degree already made him something of a hero but to the university peoplethe ivy leaguers who dominated most of the departments and residency slotshe was still a state school grad good at what he did but lacking the scope the sophistication to make it big in their academic world he wandered to the window the narrow street three stories below was deserted to the north over the tops of buildings cambridge was bathed in the sterile gray light of dawn thinking about what this day held in store was at once exciting and frightening of all the cities in the world boston was still the one most looked to in medicine and at the epicenter of the boston medical community was white memorial is it wrong to want to be acknowledged as the best of the best armenians had always been special had always risen to the top to positions of influence in their societies the turks had known and feared that uniqueness and over a million arnenians had been massacred on the altar of that fear now seventy years later the descendants of those victims were again being persecuted this time by the soviets is it wrong to dream the phone had rung three rings before the sound intruded on erics thoughts he glanced at the clock radio sixfifteen the call could only be trouble his father had retired from his maintenance job after his second heart attack his younger brother george a dropout from high school had already served two brief jail terms hello please listen and listen carefully dr najarian the voice probably a mans was monotonal and distorted a vibration machine eric thoughthe sort held against the neck by a patient whose larynx had been removed on one level he felt certain the call was a prank on another much more primal level he found the bizarre emotionless tone chilling who is this we are caduceus your brothers and sisters in medicine we care about the things you care about we care about you dammit who are you the chill grew more intense this was no prank in the days soon to come we may call on you for help what kind of help do as we ask and the rewards will be greatfor you and for the patients you care for so well rewards would you please our work is of the utmost importance and we need you we can also help you there is a position in your emergency service that position can be yours for the first time since the phone had rung eric felt some lessening of his tension youre full of shit he said the committee has already made its choice theyre announcing it this afternoon when we contact you the voice went on as if he had not spoken you may be asked to administer a certain treatment to a patient in a manner that is unfamiliar to you trust us do as we ask speak of this conversation to no one and you will have what you wish thats nonsense i told you the committee has already made its the dial tone cut him short the proctor building a thirtyyearold tenstory monument to the monolithic architecture of the late fifties held most of the research labs at white memorial the biochemistry unit filled the eighth and ninth floors at one time laboratory space especially at wmh had been at a premium now eric noted as he wandered off the elevator and down the dimly lit corridor several of the labs were deserted it was nearly ninethirty following the bizarre phone call earlier that morning he had gone for a prolonged walk along the charles over the massachusetts avenue bridge and then back by the museum of science part of him still clung to the hope that the eerie call was part of some elaborate spoof but he knew otherwise caduceus the staff and twin serpents symbolizing medicine he had looked up the word hoping that some aspect of its definition might give him insight all he had learned was that in mythology the staff was borne by hermes the wingfooted messenger of the gods patron of travelers and rogues conductor of the dead to hades known for his invention and cunning how it had come to signify the healing arts he had not yet learned throughout the walk just over four miles he had played and replayed the brief conversation in his mind it simply made no sense administer a treatment in a manner unfamiliar what sort of treatment to what end how could caduceus promise him the er appointment when that decision had already been made he had entered the hospital through a side entrance and stopped by the speech pathology lab the speech therapist a bright enthusiastic woman was pleased to demonstrate for him the voice device known as an artificial electrolarynx pressed tightly against a sweet spot beneath the jaw it transmitted impulses from themouth and worked whether its user had a functioning larynx or not the voice it produced when eric tried it was virtually indistinguishable from that made by the therapist on a whim he had asked her if anyone at the hospital had borrowed such a device or shown a special interest in it her response had been a predictable negative his sizethirteen sneakers propped on his desk dave subarsky was sipping coffee as he pecked with one finger at his computer keyboard greetings doctor eric said ive been sent here by the nobel prize committee to check on what youre up to ive been expecting you subarsky said hitting the return key convey my thanks to your committee and tell them that i and my trusty ibm are on the verge of proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that someone with no income eighteen hundred dollars in monthly expenses and three thousand dollars in the bank cannot stay out of the poorhouse for more than two months that bad huh its starting to look that way something will turn up maybe but it aint gonna be a grant from the sackett foundation you heard uhhuh this morning the cupboard is bare i tried telling them that a mind was a terrible thing to waste but they didnt buy it they said my work was too theoretical theyre nuts that stuff youve been doing withprogressive dna mutation has tremendous clinical potential maybe dave said his voice drifting off maybe so youll find a way subarsky flipped off his computer that i will my friend he said so todays the big day yes eric shrugged i think so i thought the committee was meeting this afternoon as far as i know they are but david theres something i want to tell you about but its got to stay between us no problem eric hesitated then recounted the eerie call does any of that mean anything to you he asked aside from suggesting that theres someone running around white memorial with a screw loose david i tell you the guy who called may be crazy but heor she i really couldnt tellsounded like he knew exactly what he was doing any thoughts at all subarsky drummed his fingers on his ample gut only one that stunt we pulled with the laser hardly went unnoticed tell me about it joe silver was thinking about reporting us to the human experimentation committee why didnt he well for one thing we saved the guys life minor detail and for another i convinced my esteemed boss that the only danger of the procedure was that it might not work and that my hand was poised with a cardiac needle ready to drive it home if that was the case he made it clear though that if we ever felt the urge to try out our toy again we had better have an okay from the committee and a release from the patient as if that dude was capable of signing a release whats the point youre driving at eric asked the point is that the whole goddam hospital knows what we did this caduceus may see you as someone who might be willing to bend the rules a bit in the interest of getting some stuff done around here something that hasnt been approved by the he committee isnt that what it sounded like sort of but that damn electrolarynx sure gave the whole thing a sinister cast regardless we should know whether or not the guy is for real in a few hours what do you mean well he said if marshall gets that job in the er i think you can safely say that caduceus is a bag of shit what if i get it subarsky lowered his skateboardsized feet to the floor in that case my friend he said i guess you wont really know the administrative wing of white memorial located on the ground floor of the drexel building was designed to impress crystal chandeliers overhung oriental carpeting and cracked ornately framed oil portraits lined the walls guarding the entry to the corridor a busty broad shouldered receptionist coolly appraised eric from behind a louis xiv desk im dr najarian he said im here for a committee meeting after spending several hours with subarsky he had returned to his apartment and changedfirst into the dark suit he had last worn at his med school graduation and which he ultimately decided was woefully outdated next into brown slacks and a tweed sport coat that turned out to have a twoinch tear along one shoulder seam and finally into gray trousers and his navyblue blazer it was fortunate he acknowledged that he wasnt any more nervous about the meeting because the search for the right attire had spanned his entire wardrobe still the receptionist seemed to approve of the result dr teagardens committee she asked smiling and pushing her shoulders back just a bit thats right well theyre just getting started she asked me to have you candidates wait down there in the sitting room um exactly how many of us candidates are there oh just two dr marshalls already there what hes been here for half an hour bad pardon nothing listen thanks thanks a lot no problem if you need anything my names susan eric thanked her again and headed down the corridor anything at all he heard her say so eric said as he entered the plush sitting area youre the other candidate the receptionist was talking about what a surprise just a second marshall said engrossed in a book which eric managed to see was something by john updike i just want to finish this page updikes some talent dont you think i havent read him in fact eric reflected somewhat wistfully he hadnt read anything outside of medicine in longer than he could remember well then marshall said with genuine enthusiasm youve got a real treat in store with his tortoiseshell glasses and aquiline features reed marshall resembled clark kent and in fact was called that in some quarters of the er eric settled into a highbacked oxblood leather chair and watched as marshall finished the two of them had known each other since internship and had shared many of the victories and much of the heartache that went with becoming a physician two years older than eric reed had a wife a son a circle of successful friends and virtually universal respect around the hospital initially eric had been put off by marshalls patrician roots and harvard education and by an aloofness that eric interpreted as snobbishness but one night as they sat sipping coffee after working side by side on the casualties of a multivehicle catastrophe reed confessed that he was envious of erics coolness under fire thats crazy eric had replied youre the iceman everyone in the e r knows it what i am reed said with deadly seriousness is scared to death of freezing up or of doing the wrong thing and even more terrified of having anyone know how im feeling in fact i cant believe im telling you this hey dont worry nothing you say win ever leave this room youre just exhausted right now thats all believe me im frightened at crunch time too how could anyone whos human not be i didnt say frightened i said terrified i want to laugh when someone says im as good at this as you are listen reed eric had said this isnt a contest we didnt select ourselves for this residencyall those professors did our job is just to do our best and believe me your best is damn good beginning with that night a mutual respect almost a tacit friendship had grown between them and over the years that followed not once had either of them mentioned the exchange again as far as eric knew reed had come to grips with his dragons eric believed that in terms of knowledge dedication and rapid response to lifethreatening emergencies he held a definite edge on marshall but there were other intangiblesmarshalls dry wit poise and eclectic intellectthat made any choice between the two of them difficult any idea why they sent for the two of us at once eric asked after reed had set his book aside nope all ive heard is that theyve made their decision knowing ol grendel teagarden well probably learn that some hardnosed woman from stanford has been recruited for the position and you and i are gonna be out of work teagarden the tyrannical chief of surgery was as renowned for her outspoken feminism and undisguised partiality toward female physicians as she was for her skill in the or her volatile capriciousness had made or broken any number of careers are you sure you want this job eric asked marshall grinned im sure carolyn wants me to want it youre not married so you dont know that thats quite enough he laughed somewhat wistfully oh i want it too eric he said finally itd be foolish to say i dont although even i cant say how much put another way my ulcer may be rooting for you but my ego is pulling for me still i see the whole question as moot because i have no doubt i didnt get it nonsense this from the man who not only is a legend at his work but who just happens to have saved a trustees life he never even sent me a thankyou note jesus well thats no surprise given the holier thanthou philosophy of this place speaking of which before we get called in there i want to thank you for doing your best not to make a big deal out of all this it was erics turn to smile you mean not openly he said of course the whole damn committee has been doing its best to set us at each others throats privately and in public the famous wmh pyramid exactly room for one and only one at the top survival of the nastiest we both deserve a pat for not taking their bait i know how much you want the position and the real truth is if it didnt mean so much to carolyn to stay around here i might have actually considered pulling out of the runningyou dont have to say that its true well at least it might be true i wonder what in the hell theyre doing in there eric said twoonone with grendel god what a prospect if so my moneys on teagarden say listen does the name caduceus mean anything to youaside from the obvious aside from the obvious reed marshall shrugged and shook his head no bells he said why nothing maybe later we can the door to the conference room opened and dr joe silver stepped out a ferretlike man in his late forties silver stood no more than five foot five in the twoinch lifts that rumor had it he wore even to bed he had been the chief of emergency services for five or six years and ran his office in an autocratic manner that would have made napoleon proud he was knowledgeable enough but he had no sense of peoples needs or how to deal with them straightforwardly and over their years of association with the man neither eric nor reed marshall had been able to develop anything approaching a warm relationship with him gentlemen silver said we apologize for keeping you waiting if youll both come in please both eric wondered why the committee would do something so insensitive surely after three months and interview upon interview it would have been more appropriate to speak with the losing candidate alone he thought back to the eerie call the caper whoever he or shewas seemed so confident of being able to affect the selection process was joe silver caduceus it was so like the man to play control games with people the committee was seated at a massive hardwood table with sara teagarden at the head she was a large androgynous woman with closecropped auburn hair and goldrimmed granny glasses that day she was dressed in a royalblue suit with a large pearlanddiamond broach on the lapel it was an outfit that somehow made her appear even more intimidating than usual as she welcomed them eric tried unsuccessfully to match the cadence of her voice with that of the caller joining the heads of surgery and emergency medicine on the search committee was dr haven darden the chief of medicine the highly publicized demise of craig worrell the former associate director of emergency services had bathed white memorial in an intensely unfavorable light and the highpowered makeup of the search committee underscored the hospitals determination to put the whole matter to rest silver teagarden dardeneric had not faced a panel such as this one since his internship application days he wondered if the triumvirate was about to take the wmh pyramid philosophy to the limit by engaging the two of them in a medical quizdown as if reading erics mind haven darden said now dont get worried you two were not about to start firing clinical problems at you of the three committee members darden a tropical medicine specialist was the one eric felt was least in his corner like reed marshall he had come straight up through the harvard system unlike marshall though he had risen from abject poverty his life from his illegitimate birth in a ghetto in portauprince haiti through his escape to the united states and his subsequent adoption by a wealthy black physician had been chronicled in various harvard publications there was a rumor that somewhere not far down the line darden was slated to become the first black dean in the history of the university his detractors and there were a number pointed to his inability to make any major research contributions to his field but his reputation for clinical brilliance kept all but the most vociferous enemies at bay and residents often jockeyed their schedules to be on the wards when darden visited dardens english was clipped and precise with just the hint of an accent and unless he could change his speech radically eric decided there was no way he could have been the caller he struggled to force thoughts of caduceus from his mind and to concentrate on the business at hand in a minute or two the committees decision would be known and the whole bizarre affair would most likely be exposed as a hoax gentlemen sara teagarden began we dont wish to drag this business out any more than you do however i am sure you know that we are trying to recoup some pretty heavy losses in the publics confidence in our hospital and in particular in our emergency service i would like dr silver to explain how and why we have arrived at our decision but first i would like to be certain that both of you are still interested in becoming his associate dr marshall im still in and dr najarian yes very well dr silver will you please explain our current position eric gripped the edge of his chair as joe silver straightened his notes and adjusted his reading glasses reed eric he began i first want to congratulate each of you for the impression youve made on this committee and also to thank you on behalf of president tertensen the trustees and all of white memorial for the marvelous years of service youve rendered here as you know the previous associate er director brought us more ill will and bad ink than any hundred other doctors who have ever worked here combined despite the tension of the moment eric and reed exchanged amused glances craig worrell had gone to the well of his perversion once too often and had been videotaped soliciting sex from a young woman emergencyroom patient in exchange for a hefty narcotics prescription he was arrested soon after in his bmw in the hospital garage as he urged the undercover policewoman to hurry up and get on with her part of the deal so that he could return to duty the entire boston press and tv corps seemed to have been present for the bust a month later while free on bail worrell vanished since then there had been rumored sightings of the man but nothing more silver continued we three are understandably i think youll agree reluctant to make a final choice if there is the slightest uncertainty we know that you expected a decision today and we appreciate that this may seem cruel but we have voted to ah put off making our selection for perhaps another two or three weeks if this decision puts either of you in a position where you need to withdraw your application please tell us at this time silvers pronouncement hit eric like an uppercut no decisionthe one option he hadnt considered but the committee had made a definite choice at least that was what silver himself had intimated not two days before what in the hell is going on eric stared at his chief and then one at a time at the others on the committee their faces seemed plastic unreal eric excuse me eric huh oh sorry silver looked at him oddly eric reed here has indicated that he is willing to put matters on hold for two or three more weeks were waiting to hear whether or not you can do the same eric battled to bring his thoughts together of course he heard himself say its fine with me to wait the plastic faces grinned approvingly excellent sara teagarden said dr darden have you any comments the internist looked first at reed and then at eric i would only beg you gentlemens forgiveness and understanding in this matter if it were possible i believe we would choose to keep both of you however things being as they are and with the trustees and press watching our every move there are a few more avenues we wish to explore a few more inquiries to make if either of you has problems or questions i am sure any of us would be happy to meet with you without further comment sara teagarden hoisted herself to her feet shook hands with the candidates and adjourned the meeting you okay eric marshall asked after the others had left you look green this is bullshit absolute insane bullshit eric wanted to holler instead he just shrugged sure im fine he said i i had just prepared myself for a decision today one way or the other me too i ran into teagarden just yesterday and she made it sound as if it was all over i even had the feeling from things she said that you had gotten the job i didnt want to say so out there but its the truth well listen im due back at the er so ill see you later its only another couple of weeks he punched eric lightly on the arm you keep your nose clean now ya hear you too eric said you never know when big brotheror big big sistermay be watching eric stood motionless as marshall hurried off the two of them had never spent any real time together outside of the hospital now as their time at wmh was nearing an end he wished they had susan the receptionist was watching eric as he approached howd it go she asked it didnt nothing happened well committees are like that ive taken minutes at some meetings and you wouldnt believe how little a group of mds can get done you said it well see you in a couple of weeks wait she said i have something for you she handed him a plain envelope dr eric najarian was printed on it in a meticulous hand erics kneejerk reaction was that the envelope was a note from her but he quickly realized from her expression that it was not a candy striper dropped this off for you a little while ago susan said she was real cute but a little too young for you i think eric was too distracted to pick up thewomans cue he fingered the envelope for a moment thanks he mumbled and headed off im here all day susan said eric turned into the main corridor of the hospital and then leaned against a wall and tore the envelope open the note inside was printed in the same hand as was his name wear this and we will know was all it said wedged in one corner of the envelope was something metallic his fingers stiff and cold eric pulled out the object and held it so that nopasserby could see it was a stickpin bearing a black oval stone possibly obsidian inlaid in the stone was a finely tooled gold caduceus april name laura enders i already told you that no maam i have your name i need the name of the guy whos missing oh its scott enders but hes also called himself scott shollander aka shoflander the desk sergeant mumbled as he pecked out the name on his typewriter laura was just a few minutes into her session with the boston policeman but already she wished she could leave although he hadnt introduced himself his name tag read sgt thos campbell he was a redfaced potbellied man probably in his late fifties obviously burnt out and totally unenthusiastic about his job and the more she listened to her own answers to his questions the more she knew there was no chance he would be of any help last seen well actually i havent seen him for five months five months the officer said as he typed for all the inflection in his voice he might have just mitten five days his manner made it clear that over his years on the force he had seen and heard everythingwhich was to say he had seen and heard enough i guess it doesnt make much difference what he was wearing when last seen he said no laura said her sarcasm illdisguised i think you can leave that line blank boston police headquarters was about as far from the clear crisp beauty of little cayman as she could ever have imagined a place could be the floor in the old building was filthy and the dim lighting succeeded only in keeping the stains on the walls from being definable but most unpleasant of all was the smell odors of peoplehundreds of them it seemedhung in the air like a miasma it was just half past four in the afternoon of a somber drizzly day a day before almost to the minute laura had left communigistics and taken her cab to the dc address neil harten had given her shed been unable to find anyone in the small apartment complex who had ever seen or heard of scott shed then checked into a downtown hotel and called il harten at home to find out if he or anyone he knew had ever visited scott at the apartment not surprisingly his answer was no finally after toying with the idea of trying to track down the landlord of the building she had decided she would get a good nights sleep and then stop by the closest police station to file a missingperson report after that she would head to boston to begin her search in earnest recent photo pardon do you have a recent photo oh only this one she handed over the photograph of herself and scott after barely a glance the officer set it on his desk no wait i need that wearily sgt thomas canpbell handed it back i ill have a blowup made of just scotts face and bring a copy to you okay whatever you say sergeant are you going to be able to help me find my brother or not the aging policeman looked at her for the first time laura saw response in his eyes realistically now miss enders he said if you were me how would you answer that question i i understand laura said gathering her things together im sorry the information youve given me is enough for us to put your brother in our computer but not enough to assigna detective to the case sergeant campbell i said i understood ill drop the enlargement of this photo over as soon as i get it thank you for listening to me she stood wait a second campbell said i really cant do much on what youve given me but i win at least check your description against um against unknown corpses its okay to say it against them he scribbled the name bernard nelson and a phone number on his note pad tore off the sheet and handed it to her this is the name of a decent private detective he said he works for himself not one of them big companies so his rates might be a little better maybe he can help you out and if i learn anything i promise ill call you wherere you staying the carlisle its downtown on stiles i know the place in fact everyone on the force knows that place miss i dont know exactly how to say this but um the carlisle isnt exactly the best place for what i mean is a lot of their trade is daytime forthehour stuffing pros prostitutes there are a few here but but im paying ninetyfive dollars a night for my room welcome to boston sergeant thomas campbell said bernard nelsons office was a tenminute walk from the police station on the way there laura stopped by a photo store and after sliding two twenties across the counter received the guarantee that her enlargement would be ready by morning rather than the seven to ten days the proprietor had initially promised welcome to boston laura muttered as she headed back onto the street over the phone nelson had sounded as if he would be in his thirties or forties in fact he was well beyond thatsixty at least and by no means a young sixty his office on the second floor of a tawdry four story brownstone consisted of a small reception area which was empty and a larger cluttered inner office nelson was standing in the doorway of that room as laura entered he was five foot nine or ten but must have weighed over two hundred pounds most of which was packed into a gut that made thomas carnpbens look trim he wore a ragged green sweater that barely reached his belt and had an unlit inchandahalf cigar butt clenched in his teeth laura immediately pictured the man in a smoky tavern seated elbow to elbow at the bar with sergeant campbell she fought the urge to turn and leave unlike campbell though bernard nelson listened to her story with some interest when she finished he pulled a sinisterlooking longbarreled revolver from his desk drawer halted it expertly in his hand for a moment and then used it to light his cigar that was very cute laura said birthday present from my daughter actually i have a real one locked up im afraid to keep it in my desk like they do on tv though for fear that one day ill mix the two of them up and blow my heador worse my cigarto bits after my coronary i promised my wife id only smoke one a day it would be a shame to waste one that way exactly he took a single puff tilted his head back and sent a cumulus cloud of smoke swirling toward the ceiling then he set the butt in an ashtray shaped like a putting green so tell me miss enders why do you know so little of a man you feel so close to i never thought about how little i know really she said at least not until the last few weeks scott is i dont know sort of private about some things i guess she felt a pang of guilt at using nell hartens assessment but by now it seemed appropriate you mean things like where he lived where he worked what name he was using laura drew in a deep breath and then exhaled slowly mr nelson do you have any older siblings she asked a brother he answered his expression suggesting that he already understood the point she was about to make five years older still alive and kicking did he have much to do with you when you were growing up no most of the time he acted as if i didnt exist and how did you feel toward him i idolized him bernard nelson said still do i guess well scott is to me what your brother was to you that and more hes my only family and has been since i was fourteen she looked across at the detective for a moment i couldnt begin to tell you all the things scotts done for me over the years and ive never had a chance to do much of anything for him point made and understood nelson said he glanced at the cigar butt but apparently decided to save it miss enders do you think theres a possibility your brother could have been involved in something shady shady forgive the tv talk but it was the best word i could come up with you must know what i mean though gambling whitecollar crime of some sort drugs impossible laura said why even john dillinger had family not funny what makes you think such a thing anyway iiwhat makes me not think it would be a better question miss enders people dont go around using false names and keeping their lives so private from their own family unless they have a damn good reason perhaps in most cases but i know what i mean is i feel that i have a good sense of scott and that sort of thing just doesnt fit now will you help me look for him i charge seventyfive dollars plus expenses sounds reasonable enough as long as your expenses arent too high bernard nelson stared across at her for a moment and then he smiled miss enders he said thats seventyfive dollars an hour an hour and starting from scratch not even knowing if your brothers in boston or not looking for hims gonna take a hell of a lot of them it roughs out to abouti just did the arithmetic tell me are you working on anything now it may not look it but the answer is yes several things at seventyfive dollars an hour no more and how many hours do you think it might take to know whether or not you can find scott maybe fifty maybe a hundred finding someone is fifty percent legwork and fifty percent blind luck its impossible to say i i have some money but not that kind i didnt think you did miss enders id like to help you really i would jim rockford always gets cases from beautiful interesting women and id love to do the same but ive got two kids in college and a mortgage the size of vada you need someone whos very good at this business who can do your job full and who charges considerably less than the going rate that person doesnt exist and if you make too many compromises in who you hire believe me youll just end up losing what money you do have all for nothing i appreciate your candor laura said making no attempt to mask her discouragement what do you think i should do you could give up and wait not a possibility well then i suppose i could get you started in the right direction if you get anything like a lead come on back and well talk that would be a very kind thing for you to do maybe but i feel like helping you probably its because you didnt complain about my cigar i wanted to i know but listen now and listen good before i tell you anything i want to be sure you know that this aint missouri and it aint some paradise island in the caribbean its a city and in cities more people are out to use you than to help you thats reassuring thats the way it is you have a nice way about you a nice trusting way thanks dont thank me in this business thats a criticism not a compliment do you get the point yes laura said briefly i get the point okay then to begin i think you should have a poster made up include the photo you told me about plus any information you can think of about your brother offera reward for information that leads to finding him but dont say how much and dont go meeting anyone in a nonpublic place to hear what they have to say take the photo to this guy and tell him youre a friend of mine he wrote the name and address down get oh a thousand printed offer him a hundred less than anything he asks for and then give him what he asked for in the first place if hell deliver the poster in a day ive already figured that maneuver out laura said where do you think i should distribute them start with hotels and motels and dont rely too heavily on the desk clerks or executives get to the housekeeping staff and to the hotel restaurants talk to people dont just shove the poster at them and leave next id hit the police precinct stations make sure they put it up on the wall someplace then stop by the papers take special pains to look real good when you go there if you can interest some reporter maybe theyll do a story and a picture if nothing pans out maybe itll be worth shelling out some of that cash of yours for an ad your brother drink some i guess then try some of the downtown bars scott sounds like a downtown kind of guy also hit the computer stores just in case hes still in that line of work oh and the hospitals especially the emergency rooms go to every one of them even in the suburbs again do whatever you have to to ensure that your poster ends up on the wall and not in the trash laura felt dizzy as she scribbled down nellsons suggestions this is going to be some job she said it could be worse really yeah you could be paying seventyfive dollars an hour to get it done get a good map of the city and keep track not only of where youve been but where youre going if you want to bring your map up here ill mark off the parts of town youre to stay away from its okay to take cabs around but i want you to keep the doors locked a few cabbiesnot many but somehave a scam going where they stop at a corner and some pals jump in and steal womens purses yes sir lock your doors you know im beginning to see why you might actually be worth seventyfive dollars an hour just remember to send me a deck of havanas when you get back to that island of yours laura stood and took his hand ill send them to your wife she said she can ration them out a cool damp evening had settled over the city by the time laura left bernard nelsons office and headed back toward her hotel the streets were already illuminated some by quaint gaslights the sidewalks were crowded with all manner of people many of them business folk hurrying home and by and large laura liked the feeling of the placeits oldness and understated sense of purpose she had been to new york twice and never felt as comfortable there as she did after just a few hours in boston she stopped at a small newsstand bought a good street map of the city and a copy of skin diver magazine and decided to take boylston street down to the public gardens she had just crossed dartmouth when in a slow motion nightmare two youth the black and one whitebegan racing up the sidewalk toward her it wasnt until she noticed the older woman walking just ahead of her that she realized what was about to happen with what seemed practiced precision one of the youths jostled the woman sending her off balance the other boy a step behind snatched the womans purse as she was falling to the pavement and then accelerated lauras reaction was pure reflex as he neared her she pulled her shoulder bag free and swung it as hard as she could catching the boy in the arm and sending the womans purse spinning across the sidewalk the youth stumbled and whirled about dont laura barked stepping between him and the purse the boy stopped short his eyes locked with hers dont do it she rasped hoping that the determination in her own eyes held even a fraction of the fury in his behind him she saw the other youth hesitate and then turn and run in continued slow motion several male passersby began to close in on the confrontation she saw a flicker of confusion replace the anger in the remaining youths eyes fuck you he spat then he bolted off shoving his way between two startled businessmen several people were mumbling praise and patting her on the shoulder as laura her pulse pounding in her ears retrieved the purse the old woman was being helped to her feet are you okay laura asked i i think so she said apparently unaware that she was talking to the woman who had helped her good heres your bag ththank you dear the woman still seemed dazed laura stepped closer to hand her the purse not ten feet away a tall man dressed in a windbreaker and jeans ducked quickly into a doorway out of her sight laura checked to be certain the old woman could walk then barely aware of the smattering of applause she headed off down boylston a beat later the man in jeans stepped out from the doorway and followed the pin was no bigger than erics fingernail but in its remarkable detail and craftsmanship it was a work of art set in black stone the caduceus was handsculpted in gold with fine enamel accents at the head of the staff and along the wings flaring out from just beneath it the intertwining serpents below the wings were etched so meticulously that under a microscope eric could discern their scales and even the facets in the flecks of ruby that highlighted their eyes we are caduceus your brothers and sisters in medicine we care about the things you care about we care about you the words had echoed in erics mind since the unexpected decision by the search committee to hold off for several weeks in making their selection and although he had been unable to recall with exactitude all the phrases spoken by that eerie electronic voice the sense of the message was clear some kind of secret work was going on at white memorial something arcane but important something that he could be a part of if he was willing to step beyond currently allowable medical therapies to administer an unusual treatment to a patient joe silver haven darden sara a gardenthey were the heaviest of the heavyweights at the hospital and at least one of them eric felt certain was part of caduceus at list one of them stood ready to assure his selection as associate director of emergency services over the four days that had followed the search committee meeting eric had kept the caduceus pin in his desk and although he had tried to ignore it to approach his job in a businessasusual fashion rationalizations for pinning it on his clinic coat reverberated in his mind like distant ocean waves he reflected on the physicians who made major breakthroughs by flying in the face of medical convention he reasoned that in point of fact by using the pericardial laser he had already demonstrated to others and to himself his potential for similar vision and action he argued that once he learned what caduceus had in mind he could always refuse to get involved but in the end neither the promise of the promotion nor any amount of rationalization was persuasive enough this was not the laser he had developed himself and knew so intimately it was someone elses worksomeone elses priorities the struggle within him was constant but again and again his inner voice kept at bay the urge to find out what caduceus was up to more than five years of study and total dedication to his work had proved as far as he was concerned that he was the better man for the er job and he continued to cling to the hope and the belief that ultimately that would be enough it was early evening the emergency room which had enjoyed a few hours of atypical quiet had suddenly begun to pulse again eric had signed out to reed marshall but an accident on the expressway had brought in two major casualties until things leveled off eric had volunteered to man the minor medical desk working with the triage nurse to screen walkins and treat those who did not need extensive evaluation he had three examining rooms going at once and several more patients waiting for laboratory results still the pile of charts in the tobeseen box on his desk continued to grow kristen would you give me a quick moon check he asked dashing off prescriptions and clinic referral forms for several patients at once full moon tomorrow the nurse said cant you tell eric glanced up at the waiting room which was nearly packed i can tell he said sefiora martinez he called out traiga a su padre aqui porfavor the woman cradling an infant in one arm helped her father limp over to the desk of all the courses elic had ever takenincluding all the biochemistry biology physics and calculusthe one that seemed the most valuable to him as a physician was his four years of highschool spanish es gout seftora la gota he said handing over two prescriptions and a referral slip es muy dolorosa pero noes grave the woman thanked him twice in spanish hesitated and then squeezed his hand and kissed him on the cheek that was very nice or should i say fue muy simpdtico eric turned to find dr haven darden standing just to his right thanks eric said i just wish id had enough foresight not to drop the language when i entered college it sounds as if you didnt make that mistake the internists round face crinkled in a smile we speak french in haiti remember he said starting from there the other romance languages arent too difficult to master eric remembered reading in some magazine that the white memorial chief of medicine had fluency in seven languages he chose not to comment on the fact over his years at the hospital he had spent some time training with darden but had never developed the closeness that he had with many other professors in fact eric had been a bit uncomfortable around the man since the time when he and reed marshall were both rotating on dardens service marshall had quite in passing mentioned the harvard connection and had let slip that darden had invited him and his wife over for dinner if a strong preference was held by anyone on the search committee for one candidate over the other eric believed it had to be dardens partiality to reed do you have a patient coming in eric asked darden meticulously dressed beneath his kneelength clinic coat nodded a physician friend is bringing his fifteenyearold daughter in with a high fever and a stiff neck possible meningitis i dont blame him for being worried exactly well if i can help just let me know darden glanced out at the waiting room at the moment eric i would say that you are more the one in need of assistance ill tell you what give me two or three minutes in private and then i shall do what i can to help you wade through that crowd out there wmh rule number one eric said never refuse help just let me explain to the triage nurse and have her do something to pacify that mob out there we can go to my office haven darden followed eric back to the small chief residents office that he shared with reed marshall thank you for taking the time darden said closing the door i wont keep you long eric have you spoken with any of the other committee members since the meeting last monday well joe silvers always around here so weve spoken several times yesterday i ate lunch at the same table as sara teagardenwhy im curious if either of them said anything about what happenedwhy we told you both that we had made a decision then announced that we needed more time not a word typical of the hospital grapevine though everyone around here seems to know what transpired i think the nurses have a betting pool from what i can tell they seem to be split about fiftyfifty so both reed and i get encouragement depending on which of them were working with darden said this may be an impropriety but i want you to know that had the committee made its decision dr marshall would have been chosen eric felt a knot in his chest at the news dr silver has seemed committed to him all along and dr teagarden had indicated she was leaning in his direction your use of that laser of yours did not sit well with them you however are my choice and that is why i am telling you this thank you eric muttered as surprised that darden would turn out to be a supporter of his as he was shaken by the news of how close he had already come to losing out he to factor in the information with what he already knew there was no way darden could have been the callerno way even electronically that he could have masked his clipped distinctive english that meant that one of the other two i have no strong sentiment against dr marshall darden went on but i believe he lacks your commitment and dedication to medicine i like the feel you have for your workthe flair if you will you have demonstrated a clinical aggressivenessa willingness to take chances to do whatever it takes to get a patient through a crisisthat appeals to me thank you again eric said can you say why reed didnt get chosen not really joe silvers the one who suddenly pushed for an extension you might not know it but it was joe who made craig worrell into that post a few years ago past a lot of strong objections around the hospital and he took a fair amount of flak when the choice went sour maybe he got cold feet about backing another loser maybe eric said distantly if we can sway either of those votes youre in weve decided that a twotoone vote will do it i appreciate your telling me all this eric said needless to say reed and i were both wondering what had gone on i wish i knew darden said eric i dont think white memorial can easily afford to lose a physician with your skill and committment and speaking for myself i would love to have another faculty member with a philosophy so much like my own the votes at staff meetings are always perilously close between the conservatives and those of us who believe this hospital must move ahead to stay ahead do you remember that aids outreach program i proposed a year or so ago i heard about it sure i had planned to volunteer to help man the clinic when it was set up in fact i signed up on that list you sent around i know it might not surprise you to learn that reed marshall did not well regardless what you may not know is that my proposal to the medical staff was defeated by just two votes that must have hurt to come so close eric said no idea is ever dead until those who behave in it say its dead darden replied craig worrell was one of the negative votes i see if i were you and i wanted that position as much as you seem to i would do whatever i could to sway the vote of either dr silver or dame teagarden in my favor can you think of any way you might do that no eric lied glancing inadvertently at the drawer of his desk no i cant well then i um i hope you understand that while i have great respect for reed marshallif there is anything you know about him that would help influence either of my comrades on the committee no eric said unable to conceal how startled he was no i dont he hesitated and then added dr darden i think you should know that over our years of working together reed and i have developed a pretty deep respect for each other even if i did know something damaging about him which truthfully i dont its doubtful i would be able to share that information with anyone even if it meant losing out on the job well said the chief exclaimed thats precisely the response i wanted from you and you have my apology for even bringing the subject up call it a final test if you want to and consider yourself to have passed with flying colors just keep up your good work eric ill do what politicking i can then well cast our chips on the table and let them fall where they may before eric could respond there was an insistent knock on the office door eric its kristen time to get to work haven darden said opening the door well talk again the nurse was breathless eric reed wants to see you in trauma two right away go darden said ill help misshe read the nurses name tagbaker plow through that waiting room eric hurried past the medical chief and down the hall to trauma two he could smell the blood and feel the chaos and desperation in the room the moment he cleared the door reed an intern named stuart spear and two nurses were clustered about a litter bearing a woman who appeared to be in extremis she was propped bolt upright and was gasping for breath through the blood cascading itfrom her mouth what gives eric asked noting reed marshalls pale wideeyed face reed motioned the intern over to the head of the bed and handed him the rigid suction catheter just keep sucking her out he ordered jill get me three units i dont care if theyre crossmatched yet or not ill sign also tell the respiratory therapist to get in here he hurried over to where eric stood she took the steering wheel in her neck he whispered at first there was just a trickle but all of a sudden she erupted shes drowning eric murmured her larynx has probably been fractured i tried calling ent down to tiach her but theyre in the or i dont think its wise to put her head back and cut on her neck just paralyze her and put a tube in but but what if i paralyze her and then cant see past the blood to get the tube in of course you can get it in ill work the suction i im not so sure thats the right thing to do reed said eric glanced over at the patient and the two who were working on her the respiratory therapist entered the room and began preparing his ambu breathing bag reed eric said softly it doesnt look like you have much time a trach win be dangerous messy as hell and probably take too long the balloon on the tube you put in will tamponade the bleeding call for the succinylchohne you can do it i know you can ive seen you tube a hundred people not like her you do it you can do it reed eric whispered ill be right there with you just order the sux marshall turned to the nurse give her sixty of succinylchohne iv plekse and have respiratory set me up with a sevenpointfive tube he looked back at eric who shook his head a fraction make that a sixpointfive reed said he crossed to the woman whose respirations were growing less and less effective mrs garber were going to put a tube in to help you breathe in order to do that were giving you medicine that will make it impossible for you to move try not to be too frightened youll be breathing better in just a minute moments after the rapidly acting paralytic was injected its effects began the womans muscles including those that were enabling her to breathe began to twitch writhing without coordination or pattern then in seconds they all went slack eric set the litter back flat instantly blood welled up in the womans mouth he took the suction and moved to reeds right hand the monitor pattern remained rapid and steady go for it he said hunching next to marshalls ear just think of the anatomy look for your landmarks and concentrate reed slid the broad blade of the laryngoscope along the edge of the womans tongue as eric stabilized her head with one hand and sucked the blood clear with the catheter in his other take your eric whispered craning to see what reed was looking at i i cant see wipe off the laryngoscope light and do it again its only been ten seconds out of the corner of his eye eric saw the monitor rate begin to drop reed wiped the blood off the light at the tip of the blade and inserted it again his left hand clenched about the laryngoscope handle was beginning to shake eric reached up and depressed the woman s larynx a bit there look he said thats her epiglottis right there just come up underneath it easy does it thats it thats it marshall began to nod excitedly ive got it ive got it he said slipping the polystyrene tube into place sweet jesus ive got it quickly the respiratory therapist blew up the balloon on the tube attached the breathing bag and began a series of rapid ventilations eric checked the womans chest with his stethoscope to ensure the proper placement of the apparatus then he looked up at reed and smiled hell of a good shot old boy he said almost immediately the flow of blood began to abate the womans color improved the relief and elation in the room were nearly palpable yes sir eric said patting reed on the shoulder one hell of a shot what gives the team turned toward the doorway where dr joe silver stood appraising the scene unable to contain her enthusiasm the nurse rushed over to him dr silver she gushed you just missed it reed just intubated this woman through a massive hemorrhage one minute she was dying the next she gestured at the patient who now was being ventilated quite easily nice going reed silver said striding to the bedside actually i dont think i could have done it without what was it steering wheel to the neck exactly gutsy move eric here was the one who does she have any other injuries ive only had time for cspines and a chest film but they were normal excellent reed really fine work well then why dont you get on with your secondary survey of her he turned to eric its a madhouse out there your standin dr darden has apparently forgotten how frantic our kind of work is he left to examine his patient after seeing about three people in the time we see ten ill get on it now eric said it doesnt look as if you ever had to leave eric started to respond then just nodded and left the room the flow of patients into the er slowed then virtually stopped with joe silver pitching in eric was caught up in less than two hours the er chief gave no indication that he knew of erics role in the garber woman s resuscitation instead he told almost anyone who would listen about reed marshalls heroics eric was sure that reed had spoken up for him but it was clear that silver had heard only what he wanted to hear with a few final words to the triage nurse eric headed down the hall to his office his back and legs aching from the long day he glanced back at the front desk where joe silver was orchestrating the care of what patients remained and tried to imagine what life would be like for him should he be forced to leave white memorial he entered the office and shut the door in almost a fugue state he pulled the envelope from the lower drawer of his desk and held the fine caduceus pin in his hand from beyond the door he heard the sounds of the hospital he deserved the promotion the events in trauma two merely underscored that truth he deserved it and yet it seemed more than likely that in a matter of days he would be looking for work he ran his finger over the pin putting it on would obligate him to nothing if the work caduceus was doing was unacceptable he could simply refuse to participate erics pulse was raging in his ears as he ignored persistent pangs of uncertainty and fastened the caduceus to the lapel of his clinic coat between diving once or twice a day and running five miles several times a week laura enders was in the best shape of her life even so every muscle in her legs ached as she left the subway and climbed the stairs from the charles street station to the white memorial overpass she had spent her first full day in the citytwo days agomaking countless lists of the places she would go and locating those places on her map then late that evening she had picked up the fliers at the printer and begun her search in earnest planning to work her way one at a time through the grids she had drawn on her map by eleven the next night she had walked at least twenty miles and had left posters with two hundred bartenders policemen hotel workers hospital clerks and receptionists the fliers standard by blackonwhite had come out reasonably well although the blowup of scotts face was grainy and flatter than she would have liked she had stopped by bernard nelsons office and left half a dozen with his frowzy receptionist who accepted them while barely missing a stroke in filing her nails it was nearing nine in the morning and for the first time since her arrival in boston three days before the sun was shining charles circle was alive with traffic ambulances joggers and streams of pedestrians headed from several directions toward the hospital on a whim laura stopped in at the charles street jail and left off a flier then she fell in with the crowd and followed a stretcher through the emergency doors into white memorial she had been to the emergency rooms of two hospitals the previous day and was impressed by how busy each had been but compared to white memorial they were serene everything and everyone in the broad fluorescently lit receiving area seemed to be in motion the scene reminded her of the teeming life above a coral reef three stretchers each with a patient and two ambulance attendants were lined up along one wall a group of what looked like medical students were clustered in a doorway listening intently to an older physician nurses and doctors in scrub suits crisscrossed to and from the broad semicircular reception counter dropping off charts picking up laboratory slips or just pausing to talk behind the counter two women and two men jockeyed past one another answering phones responding to questions and logging patients in and out of rooms diagrammed on a huge white acrylic tote board laura took a minute to gauge which of the four seemed the least harried she settled on a slight pale man with ming sideburns and an easy manner that suggested he was a veteran at his job then she timed her approach to coincide with his rotation from the tote board to the counter help you he asked i hope so laura pulled two fliers from her shoulder bag and set them in front of the man my name is laura enders im trying to find my brother scott i was hoping there might be a place where i could put up one or two of these have you checked to see if hes been a patient here the man said scanning the sheet with no sign of recognition no no i havent laura cursed herself for neglecting to do that at the two previous hospitals she had visited at the same time she pictured the posters she had left off crumpled in wastebaskets beneath counters similar to this one well why dont you let me call the record room and see if they have anything have a seat over there and take in the show relieved laura settled in a blue moldedplastic chair off to one side at first she focused on the patients some clutching wounded or aching parts some strapped to wheelchairs and some it seemed just hanging around gradually though her attention shifted to the doctors most of them especially those in scrubs were her age or younger and all of them men and women alike looked exhausted and harried still many paused for brief gestures of caring toward the patientsa touch or a word and within the shadows surrounding their eyes was a snap and intelligence that made laura feel she would enjoy working with these people several of the letters of inquiry she had sent out were to programs in physical therapy and rehabilitation at that moment heading her life in that direction felt right perhaps after she had found scott no luck huh the emergency ward clerk was standing beside her oh im sorry i guess my mind was wandering i understand the man said ive been working here almost twenty years now and sometimes i still find myself hypnotized by the whole thing but im afraid theres no record of your brother ever having been hereinpatient or out i checked both names on that poster of yours laura stood i really appreciate your help she said do you think you could put up the posters anyhow im pretty desperate to find him i can show the picture around but posting things out here is against hospital regs unless theyre approved by wait a minute the place you really want to put this up is in the residents lounge if anyone would remember seeing him it would probably be one of the residents he turned and called across to one of the doctors eric hey eric got a second the doctor seated at a desk near the triage nurse turned and looked over at them of ad those laura had been watching he was perhaps the most interesting and she acknowledged as he rose and came toward them the handsomest as well he was tallsix feet or a bit more his face was dark and sharpfeatured reminding her a bit of omar sharif and although laura usually disliked moustaches his seemed right but what had impressed her most about the man were the little things she had watched him do with the patientsthe warm smiles and reassuring touches eric the clerk said i think you might be able to help this woman here miss enders laura spoke up laira enders this heres dr najarian hes our chief resident and the best doc ive seen come through this place ill leave you with him thank you laura said the clerk looked from one to the other of them then his mouth turned up in a quick knowing smile before he headed back to his post eric najazian reached out and shook her hand pleased to meet you he said laura was staring at his face and actually missed a beat in her response his eyes were wide and dark and held a special attraction for her and in the moments that followed she realized why they were like scottseyes at once sensitive and intense eyes that spoke of caring and of wanting to know i um im looking for my brother she managed to say is he lost eric asked what i mean yes i mean hes missing sensing her cheeks beginning to redden she quickly thrust a poster at him i flew up here three days ago to try and find him from where eric continued studying the photo of scott for a moment laura thought she saw something in his eyesa flicker of recognition then just as quickly the look disappeared little cayman island she said its in the caribbean i know just south of cuba the best diving in the world i hear you dive as a matter of fact im an instructor thats what i do there do you dive i wish in fact there are a whole bunch of things i wish i had time to door at least try i was watching you with the patients a while ago believe me you do plenty thanks ifor a second there i thought you recognized scotts picture did you eric shook his head something about his face is familiar but nothing really clicks ill be happy to post this in the residentslounge though id appreciate that where are you staying before laura could answer a young resident came racing up to them eric he said breathlessly that gi bleeder in four has really opened up the stuffs pouring out of him and his pressures beginning to drop instantly the softness in erics eyes vanished is blood off he asked off but not crossmatched for another twenty minutes what is he bnegativei jesus okay have them continue the crossmatch and send up three units of typespecific use onegative if theyre short ill sign for them you coming back there the resident hurried off look eric said ive got to go let me leave you with someone who can help come on before laura could tell him not to bother he had led her to a nurse who was standing across the receiving area ive got trouble in four he said do me a favor and see what you can do to help this woman out nice to have met you laura good luck with your brother thank you she said but he had already hurried off the nurse a woman in her early fifties watched him go and then turned to laura now then she said im the shift supervisor here my names norma cullinet how can i help you it was all norma cullinet could do to maintain a lamade of detachment and to concentrate on what laura enders was saying her hands were shaking so that at one point the fliers she held in them actually began to rustle what did you say your brother did for a living she asked computers scotts a computer genius he worksi should say workedfor an international communications company he traveled a lot in his work the last time i heard from him was in february the last card he sent me and the few before it were mailed from boston im leaving these all around the city including the police stations and hospitals i see well ill be happy to put one of them up for you in our nurses lounge that would be great dr najarian also suggested the residents lounge do you think you could tack one up there as well of course najarian he was on that day he handled the code thanks a lot youve all been great no problem norma cullinet said no problem at all well im off to canvass some computer stores laura said i wish you luck norma turned away as laura was leaving and then turned back to be sure she had gone she stared at the face on the flier computer genius with a sister how could that be the man with this face was a burn with no family a wino perhaps she was wrong though it had been several months and the snapshot wasnt all that clear perhaps it was coincidencea marked similarity but nothing more two years and dozens of cases without a hitch now this did najarian make any connection hed given no indication that he had but he was distracted by the gi bleeder is there anything to do anyone to tell craig norrell would have known what to do he always knew why in the hell did he have to screw everything up so badly once again norma studied the photo there was to be sure a strong likeness to the man who had called himself phillip trainer but from what she remembered there were differences as well she was blowing things out of proportionthe way she always did blowing things out of proportion that was it pure and simple still she decided until someone had been found to take over vkrrells role she would refuse any further requests from caduceus her neck and underarms damp with sweat rrna cullinet folded the fliers and thrust them into her uniform pocket fourth units up and runnl eric two more are on the way from the blood bank what do you think eric watched the steady spatter of blood from their patients nasogastric tube into the suction bottle on the wall they had tried medication fresh clotting factors and direct examination through a gastroscope but nothing had slowed the bleeding which was almost certainly from an ulcer and possibly from an ulcer within a cancer i think we punt he said to the resident go ahead and get the surgical team thats up for the next case this guys reasonably stable right now and i know theyd rather take over while he is im going to take a break and get some coffee call me when the surgeons get here eric entered the reception area rubbing at a nagging stiffness along the base of his neck he couldnt remember how many days it had been since he had last worked out as with almost everything else in his life there simply wasnt enough time perhaps if he got the associates job life would begin to normalize absently he fingered the pin on his cliniccoat lapel this was his first full day in the er since pinning it on from what he could tell no one had even taken notice of it you sore charge nurse tern dillard five foot one if that looked up at him with concern she was a crack er nurse who spent her offhours instructing at a school of holistic healing eric had no real feeling for the things she knew and taught but it was common knowledge around the er that her massage and therapeutic touch often had patients diagnosed or actually cured before a physician had even entered the room accelerated aging he said she reached up and dug her thumbs into the muscles at the base of his neck spasm she said everythings all knotted up its tension me what do i have to be tense about well lets see she continued to dig youre waiting to hear if you got a big promotion youve got an active gi bleeder in room four and a dropdeadgorgeous brunette with an offseason tan just left before you could get her phone number hows that for starters dropdeadgorgeous how could i have missed that you didnt thats what these muscles are telling you are you a witch tern stopped her massage maybe she said whatd the lady want she was looking for her brother she had a bunch of posters with his picture on them and she wanted us to wait a second he noticed norma cullinet crossing from the waiting room and motioned her over hey norma he said did you put up those posters from that woman laura laura hub tern dillard murmured beneath the rouge on her cheeks norma cullinet paled i i didnt want to post anything without getting dr silvers approval she said that rule doesnt apply to the lounges eric countered do you still have one norma hesitated and then quickly pulled the folded fliers from her pocket and opened one up see tern said youre in luck laura enders theres her phone number right there she and eric continued to examine the photograph unaware of norma anxiously watching their reactions looks like hes wearing a wet suit tern noted its possiblehis sisters a diving instructor in the caribbean eric said tern glanced up at him and smiled i can see that you took no notice whatsoever of how goodlooking she was witch so any bells norma asked its a lousy photo yeah said tern but ive seen that guy i swear i have norma eric asked why dont you stick one up on our bulletin board and onein the nurses lounge maybe ternll think of where she saw him who knows ter maybe youll get the reward tern dillard pointed to the telephone number maybe you will too she said if you can get your head out of medicine long enough to make a call fat chance no norma said cheerily let me know if you figure out who this fellow is sure tern said but why no reason im just interested there was something about his sister that that reminded me of one of my favorite students at that moment the corridor doors flew open and a large group of surgical residents and medical students entered the er leading the entourage erect as a post was dr sara teagarden so wheres this bleeder of yours dr najarian she asked she was wearing a kneelength clinic coat over her scrubs and paper booties over her or shoes and as usual when she entered a room the idle chattering and random movement of people lessened dramatically although he didnt particularly like her eric had to acknowledge that grendel was a forceone hell of a presence hes in four dr teagarden he said teagarden motioned her team toward the room with a shake of her head how many units so far she asked nudging her goldrims back onto the bridge of her nose probably six by now we would have preferred being called at three i understand in spite of himself eric felt intimidated by the woman five units before a surgical referral was pretty much standard practice but he made no comment you called the gi fellow down to scope him we thought he might be able to get at the bleeding point eric responded already sensing the next volley he had under the stress of a lifethreatening emergency made certain decisions and now even though the patient had been skillfully stabilized those decisions were being challenged by one of the three people in the hospital he least wanted to confront wed rather scope our own patients teagarden said i thought id made that clear at the last residentsmeeting what can i say teagarden looked at him coolly what you can say dr najarian is that when a system is in place with established guidelines and you have contracted to be part of that system you are willing to follow those guidelines eric felt himself flush at the surgical chiefs rebuke to either side of him tern dibard and norma cullinet were statues he swallowed the urge to defend his actions and to point out how effective they had been teagarden knew as well as he did that he had given the patient good care then without smiling the surgical chief reached out a fleshy finger and flicked the pin on erics lapel thats a most attractive pin dr najarian she said the caduceussymbol of everything that is noble about our profession i would suggest that if you are going to continue wearing it you commit yourself to conformity with the rules now if youd care to accompany me we shall see what needs to be done for that patient of yours darden silve teagaden seated alone in the residents lounge eric doodled the three names over and over again on a blank patienthistory form circling each one then he crumpled the sheet up and angrily threw it into the wastebasket it was nearing three in the afternoon the er was in a rare lull ordinarily he could take advantage of such a spell by stretching his legs out on a folding chair and napping this day he couldnt come close for years the hospital had been a constant refuge for him for years problems outside of work money family womenwere all but banished the moment he entered the place but now thoughts of caduceus were making it hard to concentrate fully on anything else after the confrontation with sara teagarden he had followed her into room four and had watched as she guided her surgical team through the evaluation and treatment of the gi bleeder eventually as he knew she would the surgical chief abandoned attempts at medical therapy and called the or in just minutes an operating room had been readied as the patient was being wheeled from the room teagarden had turned and looked at him in a most peculiar way i know the choices we must make on this job arent always easy eric she said with a mellowness in her voice that he had never heard before then before he could respond she turned quickly and left thinking about that brunette eric stopped rubbing at his eyes and looked up tern dillard was standing in the doorway no as a matter of fact i was wondering whom i might call to take out a contract on a certain gargantuan surgical chief you might have to wait in line i dont know why she needs to behave like that there was no excuse for talking to you the way she did none at all eric shrugged ive been able to brush it off by imagining how hard it must be for her to standin front of a mirror after she showers he said ouch hey forget i said that i long ago vowed that when it came to nasty remarks a persons family of origin and body habitus were off limits forgotten although i have to admit the is sort of amusing thats not exactly the word i would have picked well guess what ive been looking at that poster and i think i remember where i saw that womans brother tern poured herself half a cup of coffee sat down beside him and smoothed the flier out on the table eric stared at the photo for a time then shook his head think back she said remember that day you and your friend used your laser sure remember the code ninetynine in the other room erics eyes narrowed this guy or a twin tern said i dont see it of course you dont you were only in there for a few minutes anddont take this wrong nowyou had other things on your mind tern that guy was beyond saving he said with more defensiveness in his voice than he had intended he was dead before he hit the door hey easy eric you know thats not what i was saying sorry that scene with goddam teagarden still has me on edge besides theman in this photo is a computer troubleshooter that guy was a drunk he had a bottle of tbird in his pocket im real good on faces tern dillard said she stood and i think thats the guy maybe eric muttered maybe so tern headed for the door just in case she said over her shoulder i sent for his chart it should be up in a few minutes for that womans sake i hope im wrong erics minds eye flashed on the scene by the derelicts bedside and on the slow ekg complexes he had chosen to disregard i hope so too carlisle hotel id like to speak to miss laura enders please one moment eric cradled the phone against his ear and stared down at the notes he had made describing the unsuccessful resuscitation of a patient known to white memorial only as john doe despite tern diflards confidence he had been unable to match the face in the poster with the unshaven derelict he had briefly worked on that day even if it was the wrong man he rationalized he might be of some help to laura enders tern had as usual been right he had noticed hello she sounded a bit breathless laura enders its eric najarian we met earlier today at white memorial i remember how did your patient do my patient oh the gi bleeder hes in the recovery room right now do you always refer to your patients by their diagnoses eric smiled at the womans perceptiveness the leg in seven the stroke in teni caution the medical students not to do it then when im not paying attention to what im saying i do it too please dont hold it against me dont worry i watched you work remember thank you sorry if i sound out of breath i just ran in to change before hitting the street for my evening rounds bostons only supposed to have half a million or so people but right now it seems like ten times that i guess i should be grateful scott didnt disappear in new york for a few moments there was silence eric was looking down at john does hospital record wondering if it would be cruel to hand the woman even an ort of information given the doubts he had so she said finally did someone at white memorial recognize my brothers picture i um no not that i know of oh there was disappointment in her voice but we put them up in the lounges thats great thank you ill see to it that some copies get posted in other parts of the hospital as well that would be good of you for a few interminable seconds there was only silence laura he said finally i i was wondering if you might be free for dinner tonight no im working and i dont ever know when im going to get out how about tomorrow well she drew the word out as if trying to find the most tactful way to turn him down well sure she said suddenly id like that very much i could be ready by seven thats great ill pick you up at your hotel any special kind of food my choice huh okay lets see do you know of a good annean restaurant armenian you are armenian yes yes but i grew up with a girl named suzy rupinian one of my favorite things about having her for a friend was eating over at her house the woman wants armenian the woman gets armenian eric said tomorrow night we eat at pariegam its in the neighborhood where i grew up so im not exactly invisible there can you handle that sounds perfect is it dress up dress down eric said the food at pariegam is of the gods but were talking sawdust on the floor not linen on the table i can do sawdust is pariegam someones name no its the armenian word for friendship good start laura said initial assessment found patient with no pulse respiration or blood pressure pupils midposition and nonreactive standard cpr with endotracheal intubation begun at am by dr kaiser later relieved by dr eric najarian treatment consisted of intravenous epinephrine atropine and isuprel per american heart assn protocol see nurses flow sheet for times and dosages throughout the resuscitation attempt patients cardiac rhythm remained agonal endstage beats at minute gee rhythm strips patient pronounced dead by dr eric marian at am transferred to morgue pending identification and notification of next of kin the cardiac rhythm tracing was as eric had remembered broad slow complexes that could not possibly have been electrically capable of generating contractions of the heart muscle certainly there was more he could have tried a pacemaker another series of drugs more aggressive attempts to measure and balance blood ph but even if by some miracle he had succeeded in restoring a pulse john doe was braindead the signs were all there and for that there was no therapy the choices we must make on this job are not always easy you said it lady eric muttered reflecting on sara teagardens uncharacteristically sensitive remark you said it in twentyfour hours he was going to have to sit across from a woman he wanted very muchto get to know and tell her that a nurse who was seldom wrong about such things had identified her brother as the derelict he had failed to resuscitate he put his notes and the ekg tracing aside and turned to the nurses notes at the bottom of them was a notation signed by trina cullinet dr t bushnell medical examiner notified requests transport of body to gates of heaven funeral home for his examination he will make out death certificate there and attempt to locate next of kin eric checked the receiving area to ensure that the triage nurse was keeping up with the crush of patients then he went back to his office and pulled out the boston yellow pages the gates of heaven funeral home donald devine director was located not far from white memorial he had opened this can of worms by calling laura enders now there wasnt much choice but to try to put the lid back on reluctantly he picked up the phone it was nearly nine before the er was quiet enough for eric to sign out to the senior on duty he undressed in the oncite room and then wrapped a towel around his waist and forced himself through a few minutes of stretching exercises it had been a long and hard fourteenhour shift and every muscle in his limbs seemed to be in some phase of contraction the exclamation point on the trying day had been a prolonged but unsuccessful attempt at resuscitating a fiftysevenyearold coronary victim brought in by ambulance in full cardiac arrest from a purely technical standpoint the code had been handled well enough but far more often than not efforts in such cases were doomed from the loss of blood pressure to the onset of effective cpr the window to prevent irreversible brain damage was only four to six minutes if that and at some point during most resuscitations physicians went from hoping they would get an effective heartbeat back to praying that they wouldnt intellectually eric had never had a problem with that reality emotionally though he still tended to take every failure personally how had he reacted to the death of the drift diver he wondered now as he showered and dressed he tried to reconnect with his actions and emotions that snowy february day he had been completely immersed in russell cowleys emergency and in the use of the new laser that much he remembered clearly but had he reacted at all to the death of the derelict in the next room distracted by the question he made a final brief check of the er then headed across the largely deserted lobby toward the library he had an hour before he was due at the gates of heaven funeral home and he wanted to review some data on the complications of using lessthanfullycrossmatched blood for emergency transfusions his call to the home earlier that day had been answered by a tape in which donald devine to the accompaniment of strings had introduced himself and promised to be back by ten the music and the mans unctuous telephone voice bordered on parody and eric had formed an image of him that included an elongated face sloping shoulders and a waxed mustache he had left a message outlining his interest in john doe and stating that unless he heard otherwise he would stop by the gates of heaven between ten and eleven he was entering the long corridor from the lobby to the bigelow building when dave subarsky fell into step beside him subarsky was dressed in jeans sneakers and an mit sweatshirt he had an armload of bound journals and textbooks wedged between his forearm and his beard library he asked where else subarsky shrugged at this hour how about home you mean this isnt my home damn now he tells me you look a little more tired than usual old buddy subarsky used his keycard to open the library door i am i guess eric said theres just been a lot going on tonight they brought in this fiftysevenyearold guy with four kids he was up and walking around one moment coughed and dead the next i explained to his wife that we were working on him but that he was essentially braindead she begged me not to call off the resuscitation so we tried for more than an hour we tried just about everything but there wasnt a damn thing we could do thats just the way it is subarsky said setting his pile of journals on a reading table god shoots he scores touchingly put david you are a true nonchnician but fortunately every so often if we do things right it hits the post mayhap subarsky said listen how about a beer after we finish here cant im going over to see a guy at the gates of heaven funeral home always planning ahead i like that in you eric im trying to track down a john doe we worked on back in february in fact it was that day we used the laser god i hope hes not still there subarsky held his nose he might be actually the me wont release a body until they have a signed authorization from a next of kin sometimes they hang on to them for six or seven months before they give up and have the commonwealth spring for a burial and unless foul play is suspected they wont ever do an autopsy theyre as terrified of lawyers as the rest of us i can see the headlines now pathologist botches autopsy gets sued for malpractice believe it or not it happens ive never been to a funeral home want company actually i could do with a little moral support on tape at least the proprietor of the place sounded mondo bizarre digger odell the friendly undertaker sounds like my kinda guy in that case youre on between the resuscitation we just called off and the gates of heaven funeral home i have a feeling im going to need a beer or two tonight my treat subarsky said the gates of heaven funeral home was hardly a place to inspire poetic thoughts about the eternal it occupied a shabby building on a dingy side street six blocks from white memorial the windowless place was painted black and the ornately lettered sign above the entryway was peering beside the door was a small wooden plaque handpainted with the ambiguous motto enter here in comfort go in peace d devine director several windows in what seemed to be an apartment on the second story were lit nice place eric said positively inspirational subarsky added makes one want to rush right out and die eric gestured at the doorbell want to do the honors be my guest but first check around your feet for any signs of a trapdoor eric depressed the small lacquered button setting off a series of six or seven chimes which were loud enough to echo down the empty street they were playing a melody he recognized but could not identify dr najarian i presume donald devines voice flowed forth from a speaker built in over the doorway eric swore he could hear violin music playing in the background thats right eric said i hope this isnt too late hardly hardly ill be right down perry como subarsky whispered and a damn good perry at that a pair of lights recessed beside the speaker flicked on and moments later donald devine opened the gates of heaven had there been a contest to design a mortician devine might well have been the winning entry thin almost cadaverous build sallow complexion round wirerimmed glasses coalblack threepiece suit thinning hair pomaded to his scalp he was at once prototype and caricature a man in his forties trying diligently to look sixty eric introduced himself and david devine led them inside the decor of the gates of heaven was baroque and musty and generic string music played through speakers in every room the air was heavily perfumed but through the bouquet eric could still detect the familiar unmistakable odor of formaldehyde can i get you gentlemen anything devine asked escorting them past a small chapel to a reception area some wine a little tea both declined devine pouredhimself a goblet of burgundy and then turned down the music from a panel on the wall pardon me for asking eric said but is devine your real name devine turned to him his fingertips touching to form a steeple donald devine is in fact my real name now i had it legally changed a number of years ago and it does go nicely with the job yes i think it makes a statement of sorts it helps put my clients loved ones at ease devine eric wondered if the misspelling was intentional donald devine motioned them to a pair of heavily brocaded love seats then he withdrew a file from the drawer of a small writing desk with glassball feet now then he said you mentioned in your message that you were interested in the ultimate fate of mr thomas jordan thomas jordan you did say the death of your patient occurred on february twentyseventh did you not thats right well then this must be your man devine flipped through the file but did not hand it over john doe caucasian male late thirties acute and chronic alcoholism probable cardiac arrest due to arteries arteri arteriosclerosis eric said glancing over at subarsky exactly how did you find out his name was thomas jordan fingerprints i believe the me does all that stuff dr bushnell donald devine looked up from the file and seemed momentarily startled then he smiled precisely he said dr bushnell getting along in years but still as sharp as any of them he made the id and located the mans sister inhe consulted the file againchicago the woman gave him authorization to release the body we did the rest doesnt she have to come in and view it in person eric asked not with a positive fingerprint id all she needs to do is get a notarized statement that she is who she says she is and she can do the whole thing long distance i think when she found out what her brother did for a living which apparently was to drink she lost her enthusiasm for a trip east eric felt a growing sense of relief for once tern dillard had been mistaken john doe was not laura enderss brother he was not a scubadiving computer wizard he was thomas jordan a downandout alcoholic with a sister who scarcely cared that he had died so what happened to the body subarsky asked donald devine flipped to another page in his file ashes to ashes he said reverently the body was taken to the crematorium in mist roxbury on march i would assume that the urn was sent to the deceaseds sister well then i guess thats it eric said i hope ive been of some help to you gentlemen donald devine said extending a hand that felt as if it had been kept in a meat locker youve been a great help eric said he was thinking of how pleasant dinner with laura enders was going to be now that he had no bad news for her devine again formed his phalangeal steeple think nothing of it he crooned at the gates of heaven service is our middle name nice slogan subarsky muttered thoughtfully service is our middle name i like that they thanked the mortician then to the strains of muted string music they departed although the lobby of the hotel carlisle was badly in need of refurbishing the lighting was so subdued that eric actually had an impression of opulence as he crossed the frayed oriental carpet in the lobby and settled into a cracked blue leather easy chair near the elevators he was ten minutes early and laura had asked him to wait the prospect of spending time with her was appealing for reasons even beyond his initial attraction she would be the first woman unassociated with medicine he had dated in longer than he could remember buoyed by thoughts of the evening he had enjoyed a day as peaceful productive and close to normal as any he had had in some time the morning which verdi had ushered in with an aria that might have been from madama butterfly had been spent paying bills and writing some longoverdue letters in the afternoon he had played racquetball with a friend and attended grand rounds at the hospital normal after thirteen years of study and training of ungodly hours and one sacrifice after another in his personal life he wasnt even sure he knew what the word meant what he did know however was that change was in the wind for him with or without the appointment as associate director of the er it had been a full week since the search committee meeting for three of those days he had worn the caduceus pin but so far no one had made contact with him still all three members of the committee had seen the pin on his clinic coat and he sensed that before much longer caduceus would make its requirements known to him a pretty blonde in spike heels and a skintight red dress caught his eye and sashayed over to him hi my names wendy you looking for a date she asked huh oh no thats a really nice invitation wendy but no thanks im waiting for someone she this hot the woman gestured to her body beneath her excessive makeup eric saw was a girl still in her midteens maybe not he said stifling the urge to ask her the whatsanicegirllikeyou question or to lecture her on the importance of safesex but tonight i think shes all i can handle the prostitute struck a pose and folded down her lower lip in an exaggerated pout your loss he said youre real cute i could give you a hell of a time at a hell of price thanks wendy but no thanks suit yourself she scanned the lobby and set her sights on a man who was buried behind a newspaper hi friend eric heard her say she pushed down the top of the paper with one finger and peeked over looking for a date beat it the man wearing sneakers and a tan windbreaker snapped the paper back over his face suit yourself wendy said the prostitute retreated to her post just as the elevators opened and laura stepped out she had on a long gmy sweater over jeans and carried a trenchcoat over one arm her sable hair was tied back with a clip and she moved with the ease and grace of a natural athlete she was even lovelier than eric had remembered sorry to keep you waiting she said no problem he stumbled getting up from his chair you look great thanks its amazing what twenty miles a day of tless walking can do no success not unless you count a hundred or so hey babys ten requests for dates and two proposals of marriage dont get discouraged im not at least not yet good you still up for a slice of armenia you bet the thought got me through half a dozen hotels two hospitals a few computer stores and a sleazy reporter who suggested that there might be a way to run a story about scott in his paper if i was willing to come by his place tonight for an interview never underestimate the power of the press tell me something laura with all these people coming on to you what made you say yes to me she thought for a moment actually i was quite surprised to hear myself doing that she said and to tell you the truth i really havent tried to figure out why i did but its better that way yes eric helped her on with her coat and they started across the lobby as they passed the reception desk windy winked at him gave him a thumbsup sign and mouthed the words not bad laura caught the exchange friend of yours she asked her names wendy shes been here every night shes so pretty it makes me sad to think of what she has to do they waved to wendy and then pushed through the glass doors into an evening that smelled and felt like spring behind them the man in the tan windbreaker quickly folded up his paper and followed pariegam was a gritty little place on a back street just off watertown square every month or two eric managed to stop by for dinner and invariably a significant proportion of the other patrons were relatives of his his parents each had three married siblings all still living in watertown each of those couples had children who in turn had inlaws and another set of aunts and uncles only once before had he taken a date to paxiegam and that night had been a disaster the woman a social worker at the hospital had been so intimidated by the crush of relatives fussing over him and unabashedly sizing her up that she had spilled a glass of wine in her lap bringing laura here was a calculated risk but he loved the place and suspected she would too theres still time to change your mind about this eric said at the door is it going to be that bad thats hard to predict at best i think you can hope that only half the patrons in there are related to me its highly doubtful well be able to slip in and out unnoticed im sure theyre proud of what youve done with your life and they have a right to be im glad you understand armenians have been persecuted as much as any people in the history of the world life is very precious to us and success in life means all the more because of what weve had to overcome to attain it and for the ultimate in success read physician thats the way a fair number of armenians feel especially those my parentsage well i promise i wont embarrass you she said shit im sorry i didnt mean to sound so pompous nonsense all youre saying is that being a doctor is important to you i hope someday i find acareer that makes me feel that way now if i dont get some dolma and yalanchee in me soon i could get mighty testy eric stared at her genuinely impressed you know i think i like you he said the restaurant which was always crowded and noisy was more so than usual this night the small bar was packed three deep and every table was filled at one end of the place on a small raised stage a second or third cousin of erics was playing the oud accompanied by a percussionist who was snapping out remarkable rhythms on dumbeg i think you chose well laura said i hope so tbecause from the look of things we may not get a table for a while hey doctor eric a short portly man with a checked apron pushed his way to them through the crowd hello arem eric said ench bes es not bad i hear youre going to be the director of your hospital congratulations god arem its just the emergency service not the hospital and its only the associate directors job and i havent gotten it yet otherwise your information is perfect hey thats exciting laura said if it comes through it will be laura this is arem bozian pariegam is his place arem this is laura the proprietor took lauras hand and kissed it this is quite a guy you have here young lady he said quite a guy the best doctor in the city of boston yesterday a man at the hospital told me the very same thing she said you a doctor too no im a diver a shadow of confusion crossed bozians round face she leads scubadiving trips in the islands eric explained its a good job arem believe me a very good job how long a wait is there for a table for you none bozian turned to a small table in the corner where two old men were sipping raki and talking hey tomas peter up he called out you two have been chattehng long enough the doctor here is hungry and so is his beautiful friend the diver the old men exchanged a few sentences in armenian and then drained their glasses and stood up in minutes the table had been cleaned and reset for two thats some service laura said as they settled into their seats it was you who got them to get up not arem or me me they talked it over and decided that even though you were an odar you were pretty enough to make way for an odar thats any woman who isnt armenian eric said they ordered dolma and yalancheestuffed grape leaves and stuffed cabbageand chicken with pilaf by the time their first course arrived two couples of cousins had stopped by the table for introductions laura heard the word odar several times as they spoke to eric in armenian youre a celebrity she said when they finally had some time alone nomlty might be a better word i understand this isnt anything im too proud of but when i was in college i entered and won a beauty pageant miss bain hocks or something like that for a time i was a celebrity everyone made a fuss over me i didnt like it very much well by now im used to it here in watertown eric said gut all the attention i get has been really hard on my younger brother theres just the two of you uhhuhgeorge dropped out of high school hes been in trouble with drugs and alcohol ever since thats terrible is he okay now eric shook his head are you two close he thought for a time no not really he said were just too different i guess our parents always held me up to him as an example of how he shouldbe and eventually he came to resent everything about me things can always change you know maybe they will some day i dont think about it much anymore but hearing you talk about the relationship you have with your brother made me sad that george and i dont get along better i owe a lot to scott laura said do you want to tell me about him two glasses of raki arrived at their table as laura recounted some of the background of her life and the events leading to her decision to leave little cayman she took a sip of the clear oily liqueur and sputtered you actually drink this her eyes began to water unless we can put it to better use like lubricating tractors tell me something do you have any evidence besides the postcards that indicates your brothers in boston laura shook her head nothing except youre probably going to think this is stupid but several times since i left cayman ive felt this really intense closeness to him once was in virginia at the company he used to work for once was two nights ago while i was walking across boston common and once was when you and i met in the emergency room that time was the strongest of all are you prone to that kind of experience psychic you mean not really never that i know of the feelings are so hard to describe and they never last longa minute two or three at the most but theyre very real and they help me know im doing the right thing id like to help you search for him eric said i could take over canvassing the hospitals that would be wonderful you know when i called you yesterday i actually thought i might have some information the picture of scott on your poster got a rise from one of our nurses laura stiffened what kind of a rise she asked eric motioned calm with his hands it didnt pan out he said back in february i tried but failed to resuscitate a derelict who was found face down in the snow in an alley one of the nurses who worked with me that nighther names tern dillardthought scotts picture reminded her of the guy a derelict that doesnt make any sense scott earned a really good salary besides i dont ever remember seeing him drink more than a beer or two i told you the guy wasnt him how do you know i know because i went to the funeral home where the body was taken and saw the identification papers drawn up by the medical examiner the death certificate and the order for cremation he turned out to be a guy from illinois named thomas jordan only then did laura sink back in her chair thanks for going to all that trouble she said i im relieved it wasnt him me too believe me eric flashed on thomas jordans ekg tracing and on the heart rhythm he had chosen to discount you dont know how relieved he thought listen laura if your brothers in boston well find him you said the police werent any help have you considered a private detective laura told him about her session with bernard nelson did he tell you what to put on your flier eric asked when she had finished as a matter offact he did why actually i think the poster is okay but i wish you had put a few more things on it like what like special interestssports he played distinctive hobbies or habits he might have had i i told you he didnt share that much of his life with me especially over the past few years was he gay i mean i dont really know i understand how about any distinguishing marksscars or tattoos no scars that i remember but he did have a tattoo well thats the sort of thing you might add to the poster if you do a second printing a tattoo huh somehow that doesnt exactly jibe with the image youve given me of your brother laura smiled wistfully he got it when he was fifteen she said our parents were very strict and scott was sort of not really wild but independentvery independent once after a big blowup he ran away and hitchhiked to st louis for three days they were absolutely frantic while he was gone anyhow when he came back he had a tattoo he had it done way up on his hip so our parents wouldnt see it when he had a bathing suit on the one time he showed it to me he threatened to cut off all my hair if i ever said anything to them it was seven or eight more years before they died and i dont think they ever found out isnt that funny eric eric had propped his forehead on the heel of his hand and was staring down at his plate slowly he looked up at her his eyes were cold and hollow the tattoo he said hoarsely what was it of roses why three roses thats right she looked at him strangely with writing underneath each one now laura paled mom dad and laurie she said eric whats going on eric ran his fingers through his hair it doesnt make sense he said what please eric what that derelict thomas jordan he had that tattoo im sure of it they left the restaurant without finishing dinner and walked in numb silence through watertown square and down along the charles river overhead through the hazy reflected glow of the city flecks of stars dotted the spring sky laura slipped her hand into the crook of erics arm and pulled him close to her youre really certain she asked finally i see a lot of tattoos many on people i would never have expected to have one they interest me so i remember a fair number of them anyhow and that one was unique because of where it was and also because it was beautifully done it struck me at the time because frankly there wasnt anything else the least bit appealing about the man who had it scott was one of the most appealing men ive ever known she said he has a wonderful face and the most expressive eyes couldnt the tattoo just be a coincidence of course it could you dont believe that i can tell eric shrugged helplessly tern dillard the nurse who felt she recognized jordan as scott is a pretty sharp person the scientist side of me is prepared to consider one coincidence but now this would be two but the funeral director the fingerprints the death certificate it doesnt make sense how could the medical examiner have misidentified the body i dont think he could have eric said grimly he lied either he did or donald devine but why i dont know ive heard that medical schools pay a hell of a lot for bodies maybe theyve got some sort of scam going how can we find out well for a start i think we should have a talk with dr bushnell the me they walked away from the river and found a diner with a pay phone bushnell md was listed with a beacon hill address its only eightthirty laura said do you think its worth trying to call him id rather try it in person if theres something weird going on i dont want this guy to have time to think about it should we go now she asked eric took both her hands and held them can you think of a better time he said there were two observation huts in charity utah one at the west end of the main street built atop what was once the miners bank and trust building and was now the laundry and one by the clinic in the east end set beside the water tower which still functioned quite nicely storing water pumped up from the spring deep beneath the town this evening garrett pike sat on a threelegged stool in the east end hut gazing out across miles of rolling desert at the sun now a huge copper plate dropping close to the horizon he was nearing the end of one of his threemonth stints at the hospital and was getting antsy to return to la for a threeweek break the setup which dr barber had suggested to him at his hiring nearly two years before was perfect three straight months of relative solitude in the desert was about all he could handle and three weeks of the smog and bullshit in la was just about enough as well pikes title was mental health worker and in fact he did speak to the patients from time to timeask them their problems and such but in truth since he had barely graduated from high school and had been given no formal training by dr barber he knew that he was more a caretaker than anything else and a caretaker was what the thirty or so patients living at any one time in the charity project needed they were so heavily medicated so sluggish thathaving one oversleep and miss a meal or a shift at work was far more likely than having one slip off into the desert or commit an act of violence initially when he had answered dr barbers ad in the la times pike had been reluctant to consider working at a hospital for the criminally insane especially one stuck out in the middle of nowhere but the pay was greatseveral times what he was making as a security guardand barber had assured him that the project had proven completely successful at keeping patients docile the key was a longacting tranquilizer which was itself being evaluated for more general use whenever the boredom began to get to him pike liked to think back to how it was before he took the job back to the days when he didnt have a pot to piss in and owed money to everyone and his brother now he had a car a decent little apartment in the city and even some money in the bank the secrecy bothered him a littlehe was barred from entering the clinic building and promised immediate termination should he speak of the charity project to anyone but he enjoyed feeling that he was doing something of value to society and as long as he could go hunting in the desert and drive into town every few weeks to get his rocks off with one of the girls at cathies place the bennies of the job far outweighted the drawbacks pike checked the hour and then took his clipboard and pushed himself to his feet it was time for evening rounds on the street below he could see the last of the patients shuffling their way from the dining hall to the barracks all in all he mused the government must consider the charity project to be a huge success besides himself there was john fairweather doing maintenance the old indianwoman jane in the kitchen and dr barber the rest of the jobs at the hospitalall menial and repetitive taskswere done by the patients themselves three workers and one doctor for thirty or forty patients talk about costeffectiveness pike clipped the twoway radio over his left hip and hung his night stick from a leather thong over his right there were shotguns locked on the wall in each hut but the only time he had needed one on the job was a year or so ago when a young couple from la had stumbled into the town by accident pike smiled at the memory of how tough he had acted and how frightened the psychologist and his pushy wife had looked facing the business end of the remington dr barber had given him a decent bonus for handling things so well pike started his rounds by checking through the fields and greenhouses it had been a while since he had last thought about the couple and he wondered as he usually did when that affair crossed his mind what sort of deal dr barber had struck with them to keep the existence of the charity project a secret a day or two after the pair had left charity he had asked john fairweather about them but the tighthoped navajo had just shrugged the store the laundry the gymnasium the showers the vitamin shop the womens barracks the maintenance shed pike worked his way down main street one building at a time as usual everything and everybody were in place except for the arrival of a new patient every two weeks or so or the departure or death of an old one at about the same rate there was never a change in the place pike assumed that those who left were transferred to a medical hospital or back to a regular prison but neither barber nor john fairweather had ever actually told him the mens barracks occupied the building that had once been charitys hotel twentytwo patients were currently housed there four or five to a room each patient was identified by a single simple namealmost certainly not his real one the names were sewn onto every article of clothing and were recycled when a patient left the hospital for whatever reason tonight as always the men were all accounted for some sat silently on their beds staring off at nothing a few were flipping absently through old frayed magazines and two were coloring clumsily with crayons on blank paper seeing them like this it was hard to hang on to the notion that each had been judged criminally insane pike studied the bland and expressionless faces as he ticked off the names on his list and he wondered about what horrible things each of them had done pike started each day at charity by picking up the roster from dr barber there were always asterisks beside three or four of the names indicating which patients were scheduled for examinations or tests this night dan charlie and bob were starred pike motioned the men to their feet and led them in silence from the barracks down the dark and chilly street to the clinic the clinic building a large new onestory cinderblock structure was surrounded by a high fence topped with barbed wire pike was buzzed through the outside gate and then deposited the three men in the sparsely appointed waiting area in almost two years he had never been any farther into the building than that room fairweather had the run of the place as did the doctor who from time to time came to help dr barber or check on the program but the clinic was off limits to everyone else pike handed his daily roster over to barber and left to wait in the east end observation hut in half an hour or so barber would notify him by twoway that the patients were ready to return to their beds if there was a problem of any kind barber would signal him by radio or by a panic button which would sound an outside alarm but in almost two years there had been no such emergency or garrett pike knew would there be one tonight as far as he could tell the charity project was functioning as close to perfection as any programgovernment or otherwisethat he had ever heard of dr james barber sat on the edge of the waiting room desk studying the records of the three men seated placidly before him he was wearing a white clinic coat dress shirt string tie with turquoise clasp and highly polished western boots in the pockets of his clinic coat were a stethoscope a reflex hammer an ophthalmoscope and a customized bonehandled beretta well bob he said it looks like just a onceover and an injection for you tonight no blood tests charlie danyou two just stay put while i check over your friend here and give him his medicine the two patients with patches reading charlie and dan sewn on above their breast pockets sat dutifully as the third man was led into a small examining room just off the waiting area after donning rubber gloves barber checked the mans blood pressure and temperature listened to his heart and lungs and then checked his eyes abdominal organs reflexes balance and response to light pain and vibration youre doing fine bob just fine he said your memory seems to be shot but otherwise theres not a hint of that viral encephalitis i think we can consider you a cure how does it feel to be part of medical history barber paused a beat for a response but knew there would be none if he had chosen to start the mans treatment earlier there was every reason to belie that not nearly so much mentation would have been lost he made a note to confirm that theory on the next patient with equine encephalitis virus but for now the best he could do was to continue observation on the man and with time perhaps reduce his tranquilizers he stepped back admiring his patient as if he were a hardwon tennis trophy another cure carditis fulminant hepatitis and now encephalitis and promising results with two leukemias and one of the aids patients caduceus would be pleased he thought the charity project was well ahead of the timetable they had set and of course that also meant that one dr james barber was closer than ever to the good thingsthe really good thingsin life barber took a filled syringe from the drawer beneath the examining table okay now bobby he sang just lower your trousers for your shot i dont want to the man said each word was forced my but you are a feisty one barber said maybe you still have some more recovery in you after all but understand this my friend what you want or dont want doesnt matter here weve told you that its what you need that counts and what you need right now is this shot now just do as i say i dont want to bob mumbled again shaking his head as if trying to clear it right now barber commanded still mumbling bob undid his trousers and let them fall to his ankles he was wearing no underwear barber clucked his tongue reprovingly bob bob bob how many times do we have to tell you we dont want our patients running around without their underwear nasty germs can get into places where they shouldnt and raise all kinds of havoc is that clear bob i asked is that clear he slammed his fist on the desk slowly bob nodded good barber said he opened an alcohol swab now turn around bob this goes in the behind bob hesitated then mechanically did as he was asked oh yes barber exclaimed i remember you nowthe one with the rose tattoo anna magnani burt lancasteri loved that movie well bob whoever mom dad and laurie are im sure theyd be very proud of the sacrifice youre making so here you go bend over and lets take another step toward your place in historyand mine on the riviera barber swabbed a spot just to the side of the tattoo buried the needle to the hilt and depressed the plunger the man named bob reacted not at all beacon hill largely pared down in the nineteenth century to fir in the back bay was overbuilt with brownstones and low apartment buildings set along a tangle of narrow streets and alleys its varied blocks were home to many of bostons elite but also to transients and virtually every class in between even though eric had a beacon hill residents sticker on his cehca the drive there from watertown took considerably less time than it did to find a place to park do you go through this every time you bring your car home laura asked parking is only half the fun eric said the other half is the excitement of wondering whether your car win still be there when you want to use it again that isnt much of a problem on little cayman there are only six cars and three pickups on the whole island the lines to get resident parking stickers must be very short they found thaddeus bushnells home with no difficulty it was a rundown structure on the lower portion of the hill the side farthest away from erics apartment there were three floors in the old brownstone but only one window on the first was lit howre you holding up eric asked as he scanned the place im upset and bewildered as hell youre certainly not the only one i promise were going to figure this madness out though i know it really helps to feel im not in this alone anymore eric im sorry if i keep harping back to this question but are you sure about the tattoo believe me i wish i werent im not sure why even but the memory of it is very clear to me much clearer than scottsi mean the patients face you dont have to watch your words with me remember i lived through my parents death i just cant believe this thats all when i left cayman to begin looking for scott i purposely began preparing myself for the worst but not something like this just hang in there a little longer for the briefest moment an ekg pattern flashed in erics thoughtswide electrical complexes spaced at eightsecond intervals gliding across an endless monitor screen the man was clinically dead he told himself there was nothing more that should have been done he chased the pattern from his mind and rang the buzzer they waited and then he rang again no ones home laura said eric rang a third time more persistently they heard the sound of someone moving inside what do you want the voice was thick and raspy dr bushnell what do you want dr bushnell my name is dr eric najarian im a resident at white memorial we need to speak with you go away the voice said dr bushnen please its very important nothing involving me is very important go away they sensed the man beginning to retreat from the door eric pressed the bell again it involves the gates of heaven funeral home laura called out a few seconds of silence and then the door opened a crack an old man peered out over the safety chain he was in his seventies at least and was dressed in a robe and slippers his silver hair was a disheveled mop and even from several feet away eric could smell alcohol please sir he said please let us in we wont take much of your time thaddeus bushnell checked them both up and down and then pushed the door closed and fumbled the chain free thank god laura muttered as the door swung open they stepped inside and immediately exchanged bewildered looks the foyer of the place was dark backlit by a dim lamp thaddeus bushnell looked even older than they had first thought he stood several feet away leaning heavily on a metal walker glaring at them now what is it he growled laura stepped forward to him and instantly eric saw the man soften my names laura she said gently laura enders may we come in and sit down for a bit the old man hesitated and then turned and led them into a living room that was as depressing as a mausoleum the furniture which had probably been elegant at one time was frayed and dusty on the cluttered coffee table were several vials of pills and a halffilled bottle of vodka there were empty bottles on the floor if thaddeus bushnell was conscious of them he gave no sign he maneuvered his walker to a worn floralprinted easy chair and sank down into an indentation that seemed permanently molded to his thin frame eric introduced himself again thank you for seeing us dr bushnell laura said taking a seat near him bushnell tapped a nonfiltered cigarette from a crumpled pack and lit it on the second try place needs a woman he said its gone all to hell since evie died your wife laura asked cleaning lady my wife died nearly ten years ago evie went a month or two after that i dont suppose you two want a drink no but go right ahead eric said the old man nodded and then nodded again eric realized that he was drifting off he leaned over poured bushnell a small drink and held it beneath his face shaking him gently with his other hand the nights get real lonely bushnell said taking the glass this stuff helps pass the time are you a pathologist eric asked hell no im a gp at least i was until i retired but youre still a medical examiner as far as i know i am he said for a time i kept trying to get my name taken off the goddam countys list but they kept telling me to wait until they found someone else who was willing to take over i tell you there are so many incoxhpetents in the government its a wonder goddam khrushchev hasnt walked right in and taken this whole place over long ago laura gave eric a sad look that said she hadnt missed the reference so you still do work for the county she asked white memorial that where you said you worked i do yes sir eric said glancing again at laura i work in the emergency room once more he could see bushnell beginning to nod off were you on the staff there the mans bloodshot eyes opened again thirty years or more he said if i could do it all over again id be a goddam vet but you still work as a medical examiner you cant believe it can you the old man said well neither can i he seemed suddenly to perk up i keep hearing how this states got one of the most advanced forensic departments in the country well im here to tell you that that is a bunch of hogwash theres no goddam money theres incompetence at every step of the line theres fancy equipment that no one knows how to use theres tests that get sent off and never get done and theres old farts like me still on the rolls because the state wont come up with the cash to pay anyone else do you actually do autopsies eric asked hell no if i suspect foul play in a death i turn the whole thing over to one of the state pathologists but theyre so damned overworked its a wonder one of them hasnt cut his thumb off during a post in fact for all i know one of them has he snorted a laugh at the notion and then broke into a fit of coughing as soon as he had calmed down he lit another cigarette do you get called in on a case often eric asked every few days maybe sometimes i dont bother answering my phone though it serves em right for not letting me retire dr bushnell laura said were trying to learn something about my brother his names scott enders but you would have known him as thomas jordan this past february you went to see his body at the gates of heaven funeral home from what we can tell you used fingerprints to identify the body and then signed the death certificate do you remember that drbushnell the old man had nodded off again his burning cigarette still dangling from his lips i cant believe he hasnt fried himself yet eric exclaimed pulling the cigarette free and dropping it into an alreadyoverflowing ashtray can you imagine him fingerprinting a case and searching out a next of kin laura asked i cant imagine him leaving this house is it worth pushing things further eric studied the man and then shook his head he may have signed a death certificate he said but its doubtful he did any more extensive research than peeking into a casket laura took a tattered afghan from the couch and wrapped it around the old physicians lap then quietly the two of them stood and left the house does this make any sense to you she asked as she closed the door behind them no he said but ill bet it makes sense to one donald devine something really ugly is going on here hand in hand they walked to where they had parked want to come up to my place for a bit he asked verdid love to serenade you another night maybe from what youve told me verdi sounds like my kind of parrot tonight ive got to be alone for a while to sort some things out i would love you to walk me to the hotel though if you want they worked their way up charles street then crossed beacon into the public gardens you know i havent traveled a great deal laura said but boston is the most beautiful city ive been in i havent traveled at all eric replied but bostons the only place i really want to live does continuing to live here depend on getting that promotion at your hospital if i want to stay in some area of academic medicine it probably does and your chances are good fiftyfifty he said well i hope you get it but if you dont then maybe its because something better is in store for you yes maybe they walked onto the footbridge over the small swancoat lagoon and leaned on the concrete railing below them the lights of the city reflected off the still water have you ever wanted something so badly you were willing to risk hurting someone to get it eric asked suddenly hardly my problems been never wanting anything badly enough to risk hurting myself to get it are you talking about the promotion its a hell of a jump right out of residency really a onceinalifetime opportunity and you have to hurt someone to get it not exactly but its a long story eric i hope you dont take this wrong but i believe life is a whole string of onceinalifetime opportunities some of them happen for us some of them dont the worst thing that will happen if you dont get the promotion is that something else will happen for you i guess dont you see that youve already accomplished something that has eluded most peopleincluding me youve found the thing you want to do with your life youve sacrificed and studied and worked like hell and youve made yourself a doctor wherever you go for as long as you live there are people who are going to need what you can do there are lives you will help change for the better the promotion is just a thing the skills youve mastered are much bigger than that maybe so he said no maybes you cared enough about it to grind through college and medical school and residency two weeks ago i wouldnt have been able to say these things because until then i hadnt ever experienced that kind of caring and commitment but now i know what it means to be willing to pay a price for something thats important to you you mean finding your brother yes i feel totally committed to that and id be willing to endure just about any amount of pain to see thing through but if it came to hurting someone else in order to accomplish what i want well i think id just find another way i appreciate your saying those things to me i really do he thought of the caduceus pin tell me he asked do you sense that the man i pronounced dead was scott laura tossed a pebble into the dark water do you she asked once again the scene at the mans bedside that february morning crystallized in erics mind there was no question that he had been distracted by the work he was doing on russell cowley and quite aware that cowley was a trustee of the hospital had his desire for the associate directors position influenced his decision making there was so much going on that morning if hed had just the derelict to think about would he have given up as quickly i dont know he answered i just dont know well then she said if you dont know for certain i guess we can still hope she moved closer to him and put her arm around his waist are you working tomorrow she asked actually no i was scheduled to but this afternoon reed marshall the other chief resident called and asked if i would switch days with him some sort of appointment the day after tomorrow that he couldnt get out of now good in that case how about letting me take you out for breakfast tomorrow afterward you can take me to the gates of heaven to meet your friend donald sounds divine he said she laughed and turned to him before he even realized what was happening they were kissing softly at first then with hunger its been so long for me she whispered her fingertips tracing the lines of his face so damn long eric slipped his hands beneath her sweater and explored the silky hodow at the base of her back the taste of her the smoothness of her skin the subtle scent of her hair one moment each sensation was distinct isolated in his senses the next there was only the woman he felt giddy intoxicated dont stop he begged as she lowered her head to his chest she pulled herself tightly against him please hold me eric she said for now just hold me for nearly half an hour they stood there holding each other as the reflected moon glittered off the water below then without a word she took his arm and they headed off toward downtown and the carlisle eric tell me something she said as they approached the hotel the man you worked on the one with the tattoowhat did he die of eric felt himself tighten i dont know he said exposure maybe in the end he was found in the snow the initial event maybe a coronary maybe just too much alcohol he had a bottle of cheap wine in his coat was there alcohol in his blood i i dont know there wasnt time to get a measurement to all intents he was gone before he ever reached the hospital there was nothing that could have saved him she said it was a statement to herself not a question no eric said too weakly there wasnt he could see tears beginning to shimmer in her eyes she reached up and kissed him lightly on the mouth thank you she whispered thank you for everything call me when you get up before he could respond she had turned and hurried inside eric followed with his eyes until the elevator doors closed behind her then he turned away feeling drained and empty yet at the same time as full and excited about life as he could ever remember being eric wandered home through the deserted downtown streets then past the golddomed statehouse and onto beacon hill his thoughts were a collage of images of laura enders donald devine thaddeus bushnell and thomas jordan in the morning he and laura would confront devine with their suspicion that he was involved in diverting bodies to medical schools and that he was using the signature of an alcoholic old man to authenticate his perfidy whatever it took they would break him down they would find the body of the man named thomas jordan and they would learn for certain whether or not he was scott enders it was well after eleven when he entered the building through the alley he took the back stairs to his apartment and went straight to his bedroom his clinic coat with the caduceus pin on the lapel hung over the door laura was right absolutely right he thought his years of obsession with work and now the promotion that he felt would validate that commitment had blanketed his perspective like a fog suddenly the mist was burning away he undid the pin wherever you go for as long as you live there are people who are going to need what you can do it was such a simple truth but over the years of his immersion in white memorial he had lost sight of it completely he studied the pin for a few moments then he took it to the small balcony off his living room and hurled it out into the night when he stepped back inside the apartment his phone was ringing he hurried to the bedroom hi he said assuming the caller to be laura dr najarian the distorted electrolarynx voice said were glad you made it home weve been trying to reach you who is this eric demanded sinking down on the edge of his bed who i amwho we arewill be disclosed to you when it is appropriate to do so the robotic voice was as chilling as before what do you want you have been wearing our symbol in three days the search committee will select you as the new associate director of white memorial emergency services but first tomorrow morning we will have work for you to do stop right there eric said ive decided not to participate in fact im not even on duty tomorrow you are on the schedule that was checked reed marshall switched with me im not on until the day after tomorrow then you must switch back erics ear was beginning to throb from the pressure of the receiver i dont think you heard me he said ive decided not to participate you have no choice the voice responded you put on the caduceus that was your choice now there is a treatment protocol which must be instituted by you tomorrow morning what kind of treatment protocol eric asked feeling panic begin to take hold on whom you will be instructed when you report for work tomorrow im not going to work three days dr najarian in three days you will get the appointment that you have been hoping for but only if you complete your part of the bargain we have that power believe me we do is that clear i want to know who you are you have not yet earned that privilege doctor and i i dont intend to dr najarian we know and you know what is at stake for you i hope you get it but if you dont then maybe its because something better is in store for you the worst thing that will happen if you dont get the promotion is that something else will happen for you look eric said with sudden intensity youre right i do want that position i want it a lot but i want it based on the work ive done these last five years not on whether or not i join some club caduceus is not a club dr najariap it is a group of dedicated people on the verge of the most important breakthrough in medicine in modern times this breakthrough will save millions of lives we need you i eric felt his resolve beginning to falter once again he heard lauras voice he thought about his decisions at the bedside of thomas jordan whether he had made the right choices that day or not his ambition had influenced his thinking thanks to laura at least now he could admit that much to himself well doctor the eerie voice urged what is it going to be i i cant help you eric said you dont understand i know i dont dammit you wont tell me enough to understand eric sensed growing strength in his voice well now i dont want to understand putting your pin on was a mistake you have my apology for doing it but ive taken it off just before you called i threw it away youll have to find someone else to help do whatever it is you want the dispassionate voice grew more menacing refuse to help us now and we guarantee that you will be off the staff of white memorial before the month is out if you have to do that to me thats your problem eric heard himself say ill get by you are making a grave mistake the voice said well im sure it wont be my last erics hand was shaking mercilessly as he set the receiver down in its cradle seated on a doorstep across the street from the hotel carlisle larry dexstall angrily stubbed out his cigarette and stared up at the darkened hotel windows it had been a long day long weekand he was desperately in need of a few hours of sleep laura enderss light had gone on and off several times suggesting she was having trouble drifting off once he had seen her at the window and twice he had seen the flickering light of her tv now it was nearly am at if the light stayed off he would go upstairs to the room he had rented and take his chances for an hour or two it would be a disaster to lose her at this point but thanks to neil harten starting at sunup he would have to be especially sharp from the moment laura enders left communigistics dexstall had been following her he had watched her save an old lady from a mugging he had followed as she went from store to store hotel to hospital refusing to sit down or even slow down for hours at a time he had watched her interact with people and had learned her habits and her ways tonight he had seen her meet a man over the week he had developed a lot of respect for the womannot a surprising reaction given that for nearly seven years he had been as close to scott enders as anyone in plan b he was certain neil harten had chosen to use him because of that closeness and his determination to learn what had happened to scott from the beginning dexstall had been against holding back what little information they had from the woman but harten had insisted maintaining that the less she knew the more vigorously she would approach her search and the more likely she would be to stir something up now suddenly impatient harten had decided to up the ante instead of being the guide laura enders was to become the bait it stank and dexstall had just hung up from telling as much to the man but neil harten had carte blanche to do whatever the hell he wanted and over the day just past he had taken the information his contacts had turned up and had started sending out the he that laura knew where her brother had hiaden a certain tape he had also ordered larry dexstall to be damn sure he was right there when someone responded dexstall waited a few minutes longer then trudged to an allnight coffee shop to write the note that was part of hartens new ploy if only scott had stuck to the goddam weapons assignment but dexstall knew that taking chances and thinking for himself were what made the man so good at what he did dexstall smoothed a piece of paper out on the table and began to write the words neil harten had given him for days he had done a decent job of keeping track of laura enders losing herjust once beginning at sunup he would be on her like glue april although eric was sure that like most people he dreamed almost every night it was rare for him to wake up with any notion of what the dream had been about this morning though the images were vivid and terrifying he was in the emergency room directing a resuscitation issuing orders to an army of residents and nurses then suddenly he was dressed in a tattered overcoat wandering across the common a bottle of cheap wine protruding from his pocket children passed by pointing and laughing a band of teenagers knocked him down and began kicking him shielding his face with his arms he rolled away trying to escape their blows all at once he toppled over the edge of a precipice and was plummeting through a heavy blackness screaming as he fell he twisted and turned hurtling through the void then suddenly he became aware of the hideous electronic voice droning over and over again refuse to help us now and we guarantee that you will be off the staff of white memorial before the month is out his alarm clock brought the dream to an abrupt end eric lay naked on his bed drenched in perspiration his covers and pillow on the floor beside him several minutes passed before he was able to sort the nightmare from the actual events of the night just passed one moment it seemed everythingwas in order in his life he was counting down the days until his promotion then just a beat later everything had changed it was as if a spell had been cast over him there was still time he thought time to get to the hospital time somehow to let caduceus know that he wanted in that he was willing to do whatever they asked he leaped out of bed toweled off and was frantically dressing when the phone began ringing thank you he thought whoever you are thank you for calling back for giving me a second chance he snatched up the receiver hello good morning laura said i hope i didnt wake you eric felt instantly deflated no no he said ive been up for a while he sank to the edge of his bed and rubbed at what remained of the sleep in his eyes he felt dizzy disoriented im sorry i ran away last night she said i really didnt want to leave you but i was getting so upset thinking about scott and i was caught completely off guard by what happened between us i understand but in spite of everything i did have a wonderful night me too you sound a little distracted are you okay im fine eric said sensing the ungodly tension in his body beginning to lessen theres been a lot going on in my life thats all ill explain when i see you then were still on for breakfast eric glanced over at his clinic coat hanging on his bedroom door the pin was gone and so in all likelihood was the future he had so carefully laid out for himself but in that moment he sensed relief sweep over him he had done what he had done and now as advertised his life was already moving on a new irrevocable path were still on he said with sudden enthusiasm terrific she said they dont have room service in this place but if you want to come over ill pick up some coffee and croissants or something ill be there eric said you can count on it najarian not working today he has revoked his commitment to us and will be dealt with until a suitable replacement can be found you must handle things just as you did with numbers and the enclosed is our way of thanking you for your continued efforts c the note was in a sealed envelope on norma cullinets desk when she arrived for work at seven included were ten bills the nursing supervisor read the note once and then again then she shredded it angrily and threw it into her wastebasket as much as she loved her involvement with caduceus as much as she delighted in living on the edge she detested taking unnecessary chances and now for the fourth time since the firing and subsequent disappearance of craig worrell ghe was being asked to take a fairly big one actually she acknowledged two of the three cases she had been forced to handle hadnt really been that risky the retarded teen on the ward on meniman had been pronounced dead by his resident and turned over to her without so much as an attempt at resuscitation and pitiful gary kaiser had been so flustered and incompetent in trying to revive the drift diver that he had no inkling the man was receiving ten times the adrenaline dose kaiser was ordering normas performance that day had been flawless still the arrival at the hospital of laura enders and her posters pointed out that the system devised by caduceus was not although it made little sense given the description of scott enders as a computer expert norma was almost certain that the derelict and the womans brother were one and the same and if that was so then clearly the patient had lied in every piece of information he had told her about himself given that surely no one in caduceus could criticize her for the break in protocol and now the whole business seemed to have blown over cullinet slipped the bills into her wallet a thousand dollars for less than an hours work she smiled at least someone was willing to pay her what she was worth she checked to be sure her office door was locked and then from her desk withdrew the xerox copy of an emergencyroom admission sheet the patient a woman had been treated at white memorial fortyeight hours before two items on the sheet were marked with a yellow highlighter age and next of kinnone nlorrna drew a circle around the womans phone number her pulse began to quicken as she dialed and then listened two three four five she counted each ring out loud seven eight nine ten four cases four thousand dollars she thought and that was just a token of what was in store for her if the work of caduceus proved as profitable as she had been assured it would be fourteen fifteen sixteen the twentieth ring norma hung up loretta leone was not going to answer her phone not now not ever she checked the boston directory took a deep carring breath and dialed the police hello police she said affecting the halting cracked voice of a much older woman ive been expecting a call from a friend of mine miss loretta leone thats leone i was supposed to take her to her doctors appointment later this morning but she hasnt called and i cant get an answer at her apartment she never misses an appointment but shes not well you know and im afraid something might have happened to no no i havent gone over there myself her appointments not uptil eleven and i have a terrible back condition that oh its threefifteen east harcourt street apartment six thank you young man youre very nice thank you very much norma set the receiver down just as the police officer was asking for her name she then straightened her desk and carefully destroyed the xerox finally she unlocked the bottom drawer of the desk and brought out a small metal box secured by a combination lock inside the box were some vials small jars of powder and a number of alreadyloaded syringes they were labeled normal saline but that was hardly what they contained norma slid one of the syringes into her uniform pocket if eric najarian wasnt on duty in the er then almost certainly reed marshall was and although najarian was more flamboyant and probably the better allaround physician of the two marshall was damn good and certainly more meticulous she would have to be exceedingly careful to keep everything looking smooth and steady for as long as he wanted to continue the resuscitation she replaced the strongbox and made a final check to be sure she had put everything away then she left the office to begin morning rounds it would be close to an hour before the police checked on her call the rescue squad did their thing and the priority one was called into the er her attention turned to reed marshall and the way he handled code resuscitations liked to direct things from near the ekg machine and to leave the actual cpr to the nurses and other residents who were assisting him she would have to maneuver herself into position to handle the med cart it would probably be worthwhile checking on the nursing personnel on duty that morning with luck the er would be busy or at least shorthanded lost in thought studying the staff listing left for her by the night supervisor norma wandered past the man from housekeeping and the low sandwichboard sign proclaiming caution wet floor she had taken one step onto theglistening surface when her foot slipped from beneath her she fell heavily first striking her shoulder against the wall and then pitching forward over the edge of a flight of stairs helplessly she tumbled down over and over again midway through the fall she heard a horrible snap and felt a searing pain shoot up from her elbow she landed heavily at the base of the stairs air exploding from her lungs at the moment her head snapped back against the linoleum floor instantly there was nothing the man from housekeeping rushed down the stairs to her but already norma cullinet was arched and stiffened in the grip of a grand mal seizure apartment at east harcourt street was a cluttered oneroom space below street level even at midday the narrow barred windows by the ceiling let in little light and throughout the winter a damp chill pervaded the place still for nearly twenty years loretta leone had been happy to call the room home happy in large measure because for most of the prior thirtyfive years she had lived in a variety of institutions and oftenhostile group houses when loretta first moved into east harcourt street her rent was a month and despite three changes in ownership of the building it remained she paid the rent and bought her food by collecting bottles and cans many of them saved for her by regular customers in fact she had been doing so well of late that she had plastic bags with three weeksworth of cans stacked against the back wall of her apartment she had a telephone a radio and a small black andwhite tv she had a table with four chairs and the bed that the workers at her last group home had given her she had a braided rug and a bulky chair that rifted up when she leaned back she had stacks of magazines that she picked up while making her bottle rounds and although she couldnt read them she liked looking at the photos she liked oprah and the price is right and on warm days she liked walking up and down the streets of the north end waving to the children and the people in the shops and every day she loved to call the weather machine and listen to the forecast but now loretta leone could do none of those things she lay face up on her rug unable to move totally exhausted from trying to breathe for a time she could seetrace the cracks in the ceiling with her eyes but now everything was black her arms especially the one with the new cast had gone from heavy to numb and now she couldnt lift them at all she could feel and hear the fluid gurgling up in her mouth choking her for a while she could cough the fluid away but now she no longer tried the phone began ringing again and again she tried to move to answer it but nothing happened then through the darkness loretta heard a pounding on her door she heard men calling out her name im here she wanted to cry out im here and im frightened please help me i cant breathe the pounding grewlouder suddenly there was a loud crash loretta knew that her door was being broken down hurry loretta thought hurry and help me okay okay reach in and open it she heard a man say there she is jesus look at this place no wonder the north ends so clean all the junks in here there were footsteps then loretta sensed a hand touching her on the side of her neck nothing one man said the hand probed again and then pulled away shes gone see that fluid looks like a heart attack it took several seconds before loretta understood no wait her mind screamed im alive i can hear you i can hear you do you want to mouthtomouth her hell no do you want to put your mouth over that just call the rescue squad let them do it if they want then call the station and report whats going on one man made a phone call while the other continued feeling along lorettas neck then he put his ear to her chest you know every once in a while i swear i can feel a pulse he said thats just the pulsing in your own fingers it happens like that all the time jesus this place billy check her neck tell me what you think loretta sensed the other man kneeling beside her and felt his hand on her neck his fingers were colder than the first ones nada he said the two men continued to alternate touching her neck all the while talking about her place loretta heard them and felt them through a paralyzing darkness soon there were more voices other hands have you done any cpr a womans voice asked a little well not much dammit billy you know the protocol full resuscitation on everyone except in cases of obvious traumatic death you mean like a beheading thats exactly what i mean the only one who can pronounce a patient is a doctor come on ray jimmy lets get moving suddenly loretta sensed a great deal of commotion around her heavy hands began to press on her chest again and again her head was tilted back and something was shoved into her mouth then deeper and deeper into her throat tubes in a man said give me some ohtwo okay now an iv this cast looks new get the monitor on her here billy you know cpr tae over this pumping sixty a minute thats it steve ventilate her once every few seconds monitors on what have yougot something wait a second yes shes in a very slow regular rhythm eight ten a minute complexes very wide billy you should have been doing cpr on this woman im sorry im sorry she looked dead she probably is but thats not your decision to make check her pupils win you loretta felt hands on her eyes for an instant she experienced a painful flash of bright white light dilated and fixed i told you she was dead just keep pumping ray get white memorial on the radio tell them weve got a monty one any pressure none no pressure no pulse dilated pupils jesus what in the hell was i supposed to think you werent you were just supposed to start cpr and call us im sorry im sorry get some epi in that line white memorial this is boston rescue paramedic driscoll speaking we have priority one traffic repeat this is priority one voices began to blend with one another in lorettas mind and although she understood almost nothing of what they were saying just the sound of them made her feel better the hands pumping on her chest hurt her but they too were reassuring do you want to shock her whats her rhythm the same eight a minute very wide complexes just endoftheline beating she needs drugs not current what she needs is a goddam priest cool it billy will you the people at white memorial say just proceed according to protocol and transfer as soon as possible move the stretcher over here over here stand back there maam someone will be with you to explain everything in just a bit it looks like heart failure i dont know if shes going to be all right right now it doesnt look good okay get set to transfer you two keep pumping and bagging her ready ray jimmy okay one two three lift loretta felt herself being lifted and then set down for a moment the comforting hands stopped pumping on her then they started again all right move back everyone were coming through coming through within the heavy blackness loretta leone sensed more than felt the movement out of her apartment and down the hall to the stairs help me she thought just help me i dont want to die the bell announcing wakeup in charity sounded at just after six garrett pike rolled off his cot and dressed he could tell the day was going to be another scorcher he studied the playmate on his calendar and decided as he crossed off april that the photo was a keeper once just once before he died he would like to spend the night with a woman like that he left his room which was on the floor above the mens barracks took his clipboard off the wall and began making his rounds checking off each patients name as he roused him and sent him toward the dining hall one of the men dick was clearly getting ill he had been bathed in a feverish sweat the previous evening but dr barber had merely examined him and sent him back to bed now his condition seemed worse pike walked the man to the clinic and turned him over to dr barber then he returned to the barracks he was used to illness among the patients and expected that the man would be shipped out before long it was not until the last of the male patients had been sent to the dining hall that pike realized his count was off in nearly two years this was the first time feeling the first twinges of panic he searched the barracks and then hurried to the dining hall a quick recount told him his survey was correct the man called bob was missing dr barber at first took the news calmly but as he pike and john fairweather began a systematic search barbers concern grew he hurried back to the clinic to ensure that the security network of photoelectric cells and cameras encircling the townwas working properly the system wasat least so he had told pikefoolproof and in fact following an adjustment made after the colsons surprise visit he had seen animals as small as jackrabbits set it off hes here someplace barber exclaimed ordering a repeat swing through the buildings theres no way hes not but minutes later john fairweather called them to a shallow arroyo on the west end of town he left through here the indian said pointing at some gouges in the dry earth thats impossible not impossible fairweather said happened to prove his point he flattened out on the ground and worked his way serpentlike along the narrow gully just beneath the intersecting photoelectric beams the alarm keyed to the loudspeaker system remained silent go through again barber ordered go higher this time on your hands and knees fairweather did as he was asked instantly the alarm began wailing i dont believe this i just dont believe this barber exclaimed his composure all but gone he raced to the clinic and shut down the siren then he brought out a detailed topographical map of the area and set it out for pike and fairweather to study who is he pike asked no one who could have done this on purpose barber responded angrily it was an accident a goddam fluke john fairweather shook his head no fluke he said that man was too doped up to find his way out of a paper bag someone had to have helped him hey dont look at me pike said well did you watch him swallow his pill like you were supposed to barber demanded did you i i thought i did was all pike could say barber just cursed he has fifteen sixteen mile of desert to cross before he reach a road fairweather said hard desert on days like this do you think he could make it barber asked doubtful very doubtful well i want you to find him dammit barber was nearly screaming now i cant believe this i just cant believe this two miles southwest of chahty the man named bob kicked off a branch of a small cactus crushed it with a stone and rubbed some of the sweet nectar within it over his lips yen when confronted with erics near certainty that the tattoo identified thomas jordan as scott laura could not shake the hopeand the beliefthat her brother was alive she lay awake for much of the night creating scenarios that would fit the facts as they knew them in the end though the feasibility of each one of them collapsed beneath the reality that somehow both eric and the nurse at white memorial would have to have been mistaken eventually with the help of a third or fourth trip through the same news on cnn she managed to slip into a fitful halfsleep she awoke after just an hour walked to the window and gazed out at the nightlit city then suddenly without screaming she was crying sobbing in the racking merciless way she hadnt since two days after her parents funeralthe moment when the reality of their deaths first truly sank in and she knew as she braced herself on the window ledge to keep from crumpling down that she was grievingnot oray for scott and whatever horrible things he had been through but for herself for the connections she had walked away from in her life or broken before they could grow strong for the chances she had chosen not to take for the isolation she had imposed on herself waiting until until what thirty years of living and what did she have to show for it what impact had she made she called eric to invite him over for breakfast half believing that their evening together had been a dream she was prepared for rejection prepared for him to tell her he had business to attend to at the hospital that shewould have to face the day alone and for a moment as they talked on the phone he seemed about to do just that she was afraid she had once again given out the keepyourdistance message so many men over the years had accused her of sending then as if a taut cord had snapped the uncertainty vanished from erics voice suddenly he sounded anxious to see her she put on a pair of jeans and a shakerkrait sweater and hurried to a nearby store for juice muffins and two cups of coffee she was crossing the lobby of the hotel heading back to her room when the desk clerk called her over and handed her an envelope with her name and hotel carlisle carefully printed on the outside she waited until she was settled on her bed to open it miss enders i saw your poster and the offer of a reward i know your brother and i knorw a lot about him he was working freight around warehouse on the east boston docks although i dont know what happened to him there are people working there who do ask around and be persistent they will try to lie to you i will be watching for you and will make myself known to you when i feel it is right to do so your brother is a good man i hope hes all right laura was preparing to go and question the desk clerk about the note when eric rang her from the lobby she took the elevator down pleased to sense herself so excited to see him again he greeted her with an uncertain kiss on the cheek she held him tightly eric glanced back at the empty lobby and then kissed her again this time with much less inhibition you okay he asked i am now at least im better the things we learned last night about scott didnt really sink in until about four this morning the hours since then have been a little rocky i understand well for what its worth i couldnt wait to see you again you know at one point while we were talking on the phone i thought you were going to beg off i almost did i was on the verge of getting myself into a situation at the hospital that probably isnt right some of the things you said to me last night helped me decide to get out of it before i drifted in over my head in that case im glad i said them eric sighed unfortunately he said a byproduct of my refusal win be that i wont get that promotion what do you mean he hesitated for a time and then briefly recounted his contacts with caduceus and his decision first to join their efforts in exchange for the promotion and then to let the whole business go i think you did the right thing she said after a time the whole idea sounds a little scary actually doctors use unauthorized therapies more than you might thinka drug or piece of equipment thats approved for one purpose but that theory or their own testing has convinced them is effective for another i did it myself once thoughts of the pericardial laser immediately conjured the scene at the bedside of thomas jordan and in that moment eric knew that for as long as he practiced medicine he would never again knowingly risk a patients life by using an unapproved therapy well for what its worth i think youve made the right decisionyen at the price you might have to pay i hope so you said last night that the worst thing that can happen if i dont get what i want is that i get something else instead i just hope that whatever that something turns out to be carries a paycheck that is a definite nottoworry she said we need doctors badly in the islands and id love the chance to teach you to dive hows that for a place to start you mean i can be a doctor and actually do something else at the same time she smiled and kissed him lightly lots of other things she said listen ive got some coffee thats getting cold up in the room but i wanted to speak with the desk clerk first look what he handed me a few minutes ago eric read the note where did this come from he asked thats what i wanted to find out the desk clerk a thin wiry iranian looked at the envelope then shrugged and handed it back i couldnt tell you maam he said i came on at sixthirty and it was right here perhaps the night clerk knows something could you call him laura asked i could but hes got a day job and i dont have any way to reach him why dont you check with him tonight all right she said eric stepped forward and placed a ten in view on the counter wed love it if you could try he said the man hesitated and then took the bill no guarantees he said youd think by now i would have learned laura said as the man headed to the back room actually i never did that before eric replied two minutes later the clerk was back malik says the note was dropped off by a guy with a tan jacket on forty or so dark hair he says hes seen him hanging around the hotel lately but he doesnt know who he is they thanked the man and headed for the elevators i saw him too eric said suddenly what the guy in the tan jacket im sure i saw him last night he was sitting right over there my friend windy tried to proposition him but he brushed her off just like that would you recognize him doubtful they entered lauras room and stretched out on her bed what do you make of this latest twist she asked setting the muffins out on a towel between them the note doesnt say anything about when scott was supposed to have been on the docks and it doesnt say anything that would prove the guy who wrote it actually knew him so whats your guess my guess is the guy in the jacket picked up on you somewhere in your travels and has been following you around but why didnt he try to set up a meeting and why the east boston docks surely there are more secluded places he could lure me to if he wanted to and why did he write what he did about people lying to me i dont know so what should we do next well i think we should go and poke around the east boston docks and be persistent because people will be lying to us what about donald devine we can hit the docks this morning before we leave ill call and arrange for us to enter the gates of heaven after lunch whats devine like he has muzak violins playing in his mortuary even when theres no funeral sounds creepy lets just say that when i go hes not the route i want to take laughing laura rolled over on top of him she stroked her lips across his and then kissed him deeply you know she said i really like you eric glanced down beside them enough to replace that half a muffin of mine you just flattened she pressed her body tightly against his and kissed him with increasing longing enough to make you forget you were ever hungry she said reed marshall glanced out at the crowded waiting room then he pressed his fingers against his temples and repeated the word serene over and over to himself he had started in mindbody treatment two years ago after the stomach pains he had been having were diagnosed as a slowly bleeding ulcer the abbreviated relaxation exercise which his therapist had taught him helped greatly in getting him through times like this in the er because of the scheduling change he had made with eric najarian it was his second straight brutally long shift and of course the volume of patients had been far greater than average every room was full in one of them still unconscious and awaiting a ct scan lay norma cullinet the nursing supervisor she had fallen down a flight of stairs fracturing her arm and the base of her skull now as if the fates had decreed that he hadnt yet been stressed to the breaking point there was a priority one on the way from his earliest days at harvard reed had carefully cultivated his unflappable facade besides himself his wife his therapist and perhaps eric najarian no one knew how inaccurate that image truly was ulcers migraines insomnia periods of profound depressionif not for the mindbody therapy he might well have come unglued long ago now though with the selection of the new associate er director due any day and carolyn so desperate for him to get the position reed knew he had to maintain it was ironic that the biggest edge he held over eric was his perceived coolness under fire more than once though following his cool handling of a particularly harrowing case reed had gone off to one of the mens rooms and thrown up in fact after nearly freezing up with the woman who had ruptured her larynx he had done just that theyre two minutes out reed the nurses voice and touch on his shoulder snapped reed out of his reverie everything ready he asked ready and waiting do we have a name leone loretta leone all we have for an old record is an er sheet from two days ago the orthopedists put a cast on a minimally displaced wrist fracture and shes already intubated uhhuh the rescue squad cant give us a down time but they think shed been out for a while when they arrived apparently the policemen who found her didnt do much in the way of cpr while they were waiting around whats the latest rhythm agonal idioventricular beats at about eight a minute no response to the epi or isuprel none the nearby radio crackled to life this is boston rescue seventyeight off at white memorial theyre here the nurse said reed pulled off his glasses and rubbed at the strain in his eyes is someone still in with norma dr teagarden came in about fifteen minutes ago and took over apparently she and norma have been friends for years shes got the whole neurosurgical service standing by waiting for the ct results did she have any complaints about the way we handled the case reed asked none that i heard okay then reed said more relieved at that news than the nurse would ever know lets have a look at this priority one the electronic doors to the ambulance bay slid open and the rescue squad continuing cardiac compressions and mechanical ventilation hurried back to the assigned major medical room reed met them at the gurney and assisted them in the transfer of loretta leone his initial assessment was not optimistic she was the dusky violet color of death her pupils were midposition and unresponsive to light get some ekg leads on her he said well un the strip off that keep the monitor going as well it doesnt look good not good at all this was the moment when reed had to make a decision as to whether they should proceed with attempts at resuscitation the rescue team leader judy kelly was one he had worked with many times she was perhaps the very best of a group of excellent paramedics any change reed asked judy shook her head this is the rhythm we found her in she handed over an ekg strip it looks the same as the one now do you have a good iv excellent reed listened to the patients chest to ensure that the endotracheal tube hadnt been pushed so far down the trachea that it was occluding one of the main bronchial tubes shes full of fluid he said full to the brim lets hang in there just a bit everyone give her an amp of bicarb and another amp of epi and send off a set of blood gases just in case i dont think were going to be at this too long though he glanced up at the monitor screen the womans rhythm remained the sameslow wide complexes at eight or so a minute call cology down here he said we may want to put in a pacemaker pupils fixed someone called out keep pumping someone check her femorals to be sure were generating a decent pulse judy give me your best guess at a time twenty minutes minimum before effective cpr was started the paramedic said what do you think honestly she glanced over at loretta leone and the team that was working on her i think its not fair to this woman to continue reed rubbed at his chin and wondered for a moment how far backed up the waiting room was getting anybody know if she has any family he asked next of kin the nurse said its right here on her last er sheet shes like a bag lady only with a oneroom apartment judy said the place was full of empty bottles waiting to be returned and junk in every corner jesus reed muttered give her one more amp of epi and call for those gas results oh and you might as well try an amp of calcium as well i want to keep going until the cardiologist gets here the cardiology resident an overweight abrasive man named jason berger entered the room with two medical students in tow one was an attractive young woman fucking place looks like a war zone out there berger said what do you have fiftyfiveyearold woman found pulseless on the floor of her apartment reed said no medical history except a broken wrist fixed here two days ago twenty minutes minimum before cpr was started theres been no change in anything despite isuprel bicarb and several amps of epinephrine berger looked up at the monitor did you give her calcium he asked yes berger pushed past the resuscitation team and listened briefly to loretta leones heart and lungs then he put his arm around the waist of the female medical student reed saw her stiffen as berger led her over to the monitor what do you see berger asked the young woman looked flustered and uncomfortable slow rhythm she managed very broad complexes i um i dont know what else what you see berger said theatrically is a dead heart x call that an agonal rhythmthe rhythmic flow of sodium potassium and calcium in and out of cardiac cells creating an electrical impulse it is unresponsive to drugs it doesnt generate a heartbeat and it bears absolutely no relationship to life as we know it what do you want me to do reed i dont know reed said i just wanted your opinion on a pacemaker before i made a decision berger laughed out loud have there been any signs of life in this woman he tried once again to work his arm around the medical students waist but this time she managed to spin out of his reach just what you see reed said so shes dead i can slip a wire into her if you really want me to but i promise you it win be an exercise in futility what does her family want she has none none at all apparently not reed said reed i have two caths waiting for me and a fun clinic this afternoon you really want me to put a wire in her what about that reed gestured to the monitor that berger said disdainfully my friend you know as well as i do that you could just stand here and do no cpr and watch that rhythm pop along for half the fucking morning theres no heartbeat under there thank you reed said then were free to go reed hesitated youre free to go he said finally thats it everybody thank you very much the cardiologist led his small entourage out of the room as the team backed away from the bed reed reached up and flicked off the monitor on the litter loretta leones open eyes stared blankly at the ceiling whos the nursing supervisor reed asked it was norma irene morrisseys taken over for her get her please have her call the me thank you once again everyone you all did a good job reed marshall felt the gnawing tightness in his gut begin to abate berger was an asshole but he was also right there was simply nothing to work with and even if they did somehow manage to generate a pulse all they would have created was a vegetable with no next of kin and nothing to go back to except a bunch of empty bottles he glanced at the motionless body there was a waiting room full of patients needing his attention and a member of the search committee camped out in the er probably already blaming him for the chaotic backup with a shrug he turned his back on loretta leone and left the room for as long as he had been in medicine he had hated this part of the job more than any other the crystal morning had the toyota off the east boston ir drive from the rearview mirror for any car that seemed to be following them but as far as he could tell none was although he had never been on the docks the area was one he knew fairly well at one time he and reed marshall had split a weekly moonlighting shift in the east boston satemte emergency clinic run by white memorial most of the staff at the clinic was hardnosed italian like east boston itself and the spirit in the place was the best of any such facility in which he had ever worked he smiled at the memory of one battlehardened night nurse named falano who had taken to referring to him and reed as dr hot and dr cool cradling the hundred or so remaining posters on her lap laura sat quietly in the passenger seat gazing out at the panorama of boston harbor and the city beyond after calling donald devine and making an appointment to see him that afternoon they had stayed in her room for more than an hour talking and holding each other in ways that made her more certain than ever that there was a future for them together she had expected eric as a nevermarried doctor in a large city to be experienced and worldly but in fact with most of his life spent getting himself educated and then trained he was in many ways still very young and tentative its ironic he had said as his shyness and uncertainty were becoming clear to her that they take a bunch of twentyfour or twentyfiveyearold kids who have spent most of our lives in school or summer camp present us with diplomas and pronounce us mds and suddenly were supposed to be qualified to help people with the most difficult and deepseated problems in intimacy and sex the most frightening moment i think ive had in medicine wasnt from some traffic accident or shooting it was two months into my internship when a bank president with a wife and two kids suddenly started unburdening himself to me about discovering he was homosexual in many ways laura began to realize the two of them had led similar lives countless people had passed through their worlds yet both of them remained isolated white memorial was no less a haven no less an escape for eric than little cayman had been for her whatcha thinking about he asked oh nothing everything she said i keep picturing scott and me as children working in the field by the house or running down to swim in the lake only all of a sudden i realize its not scott im with in my mind at all its you well just dont go in over your head unless youre sure its with scott he said im not such a great swimmer well have to work on that they drove along a high chainlink fence past a phalanx of huge oilstorage tanks and parked in a broad dirt lot not far from the main entrance to the dock area the lot was empty except for several tractor trailerstwo of them up on blocks and all in various stages of rust and disrepair how do you think we should do this she asked well if that note you got is valid i think were going to have to be a little pushy why dont we just find out where warehouse eighteen is and set about making pests of ourselves at the very least we can paste these fliers up all over eric opened the hatch of the toyota pulled out a blue woolen watch cap and put it on this is just so i wont be too threatening to the longshoremen he said warehouse was a huge corrugatedaluminum quonset hut surrounded by stacks of shipping containers pyramids of oil drums and loading equipment there were a few men at work around it and some equipment operating not far away but in the main the whole area seemed fairly quiet why dont we just wander around for a bit and sort of work up our routine he said laura she had walked away from him and was staring off down the row of freighters each tethered to a pier do you see something or are you just ignoring me he asked approaching her just thinking about scott thats all she said eric stood beside her his arm just touching hers overhead and as far as they could see gulls were crisscrossing through the cool morning air their shrill cries punctuating the background rumble of heavy machinery how old were you when he took over for your parents eric asked fourteen the accident was two days after my birthday eric im going to get to the bottom of all this im going to find out who he was and exactly whats happened to him well if he worked here eric said sooner or later someone is going to recognize this picture and not ten minutes later in the shipping office someone did the woman an attractive if overly madeup blonde paused in her gumchewing yeah i seen him around she said in a heavy boston accent his name wasnt scott though it was sandy something and of course he didnt look quite like he does in that photo whats that hes wearing a wet suit laura said he was scubadiving well here he wasnt any scuba diver the woman said tugging at one of her bra straps here he was just a grunt a grunt yeah a manpower guy you know a temp he started coming here i dont know a few months ago maybe more at some point someone mustve hired him full time though cause it seemed he was here every day then all of a sudden poof he was gone when eric asked i dunno january february maybe eric and laura exchanged concerned looks both were well aware that thomas jordan had died in february do you remember his last name laura asked the woman shook her head he bought me coffee once at the truck she said i hardly even got to talk to him you would have liked him laura said hey wait a minute brenda might have something on him in the personnel files she called over to the woman who was typing behind her take a look at this picture isnt this that guy sandy who used to work here the other woman darkeyed slim and perhaps ten years older than the blonde studied the poster for a moment and then shook her head no way she said thats not him at all you sure the blonde asked i could have sworn you asked i told you i know exactly who you mean sandy north this guy doesnt look the least bit like him trust me the woman turned and went back to her desk well i guess i was wrong the blonde said somewhat nonplussed eric and laura could think of nothing to say that wouldnt have been combative they thanked the woman and left you sure this guy aint sandy north the blonde asked after the door had closed debi brenda said i look at their faces you look at their jeans which one of us is right the brunette waited for a few minutes until debi started typing then she picked up the phone and cupped the receiver a guy and girl just left the shipping office she whispered the womans got a stack of posters with sandy norths picture on them that woman brenda was lying laura said im almost certain of it she did seem a little too forceful eric what would scott be doing working the docks under another false name i dont know but i think its time you faced the possibility that maybe his life took a downward turn after he left that job in virginia but why would he lie to me eric shrugged ashamed i guess maybe he was an alcoholic and it just got the better of him i dont buy it she said theres too much that doesnt hold together they headed back toward warehouse pausing now and again to question one of the longshoremen or to tack up a poster at the end of half an hour their enthusiasm was gone not only did no one recognize scotts photo but many of the men they approached refused even to speak with them finally they made their way to the warehouse the huge metal hangarlike doors of the place were shut eric peered through the thick grimy glass of the smaller entry door he could make out no movement inside he twisted the knob and then opened the door a crack failing to realize that all around the area the work noise had stopped we go in he asked if thats being pushy we do eric inched the door open a bit more are you two nosy or just stupid the two of them whirled three men two holding steel crate hooks stood in a semicircle around them trapping them against the wall beyond them eric realized the docks were suddenly deserted were were trying to get some information about my brother laura ventured we think he might have worked here she offered a poster but the men didnt move the center man of the three a bull whose head seemed to balloon up from between his shoulders eyed them for a time go around to the side of the building he ordered walk slow were not looking for any trouble shut the fuck up and move the man snapped with the three men maintaining the arc around them eric and laura sidestepped around the corner of the building and along the wall until they were screened from the rest of the dock by a mountain of oil drums okay the bull said thats enough now wheres the tape laura and eric looked at him blankly what tape eric asked we dont know what youre before he could finish the man stepped forward and hit him brutally in the solar plexus eric doubled over and dropped first to his knees and then on his side gasping for breath a bitter mix of coffee and bile welled in his throat his eyes were tearing and he tasted blood from where he had bitten the inside of his lip the bull pulled him to his feet just keep your mouth shut he said no talking to her now lady as you can see im not a very patient person your brother killed a friend of mine and maimed another its not going to take much for me to do something similar to this jerk here or to you laura could only stare at him in fear and disbelief now he went on word has it that you either have a certain videotape or know where it is you can save us a lot of time and both of you a lot of pain if youll just tell us where it is i i dont know what youre talking about laura managed suit yourself artie break one of his fingers dont please laura cried i dont know what you want i dont know anything about a tape please dont do this artie the man wearing a tshirt with the sleeves cut away to accommodate his biceps handed his crate hook to the bull and advanced on eric who was still too dazed to react with any force no laura screamed then from behind the mountain of oil drums the engine of a forklift rumbled to life please no she screamed again the three men stopped and turned toward the sound at that moment a drum came hurtling off the top of the pile it caught the bullnecked leader squarely in the chest slamming him against the wall as he crumpled to the tarmac the drum burst open drenching him with heavy black crude which also splashed onto laura and eric run a voice cried out from behind the barrels get the hell out of here the two men still standing were reaching for guns as laura grabbed erics arm and pulled him through the sticky pool of oil toward the far end of the building before they had gone ten yards there was a shot instinctively they dived to the pavement but behind them artie screamed and fell clutching his thigh he shot me he shrieked the fucker shot me run the voice shouted again as laura and eric scrambled to their feet they saw the two men flattened down in the oil glaring at someone behind the far end of the barrels heads down they sprinted toward the main gate behind them the shooting stopped eric glanced over his shoulder as they neared the gate far across the tarmac he could see groups of workers heading toward the commotion dont stop he gasped they dashed across the road thank god laura said when they spotted the toyota still parked where they had left it she held her breath as eric wiped crude oil off the key and slipped it in the ignition and didnt exhale until they were speeding toward the bridge and boston irene morrissey looked down at the peaceful face of norma cullinet and said a silent prayer normas ct scan had disclosed a subdural hemorrhage and the neurosurgical suite was being readied for her a white memorial graduate morrissey had stayed active in nursing through six children and now eleven grandchildren at one time she had held normas supervisory job but had given it up several years before to return to parttime work now it appeared she would be back for a while she stayed in the room until an orderly came and then helped the resident to transfer normas iv lines to the gurney god be with you norma she said softly as they wheeled her away youre too good a woman to die like this she watched until the gurney disappeared around the corner then picked up her clipboard there was business to attend tonamely the disposition of the body of a poor soul named loretta leone she went up to normas officethe office that once had been hersand set loretta leones chart on the desk when there was no next of kin her only obligation was to notify a medical examiner and turn the case over to him it took her a minute to find the m e oncall list which norma had tacked to a corner of her corkboard roderick corcoran and thaddeus bushnell were listed for that day irene smiled wistfully ted bushnell and she had known one another for as long as she could remember and had worked together on any number of his patients over the years she was surprised to see that his retirement from family practice did not include his position as medical exam ner but pleased at the chance to reconnect with him she dialed his number at the seventh ring just as she was about to hang up thaddeus bushnell answered hello his voice sounded weak and distant hello ted its irene morrissey who irene morrissey im the nursing supervisor well acting nursing supervisorat white memorial ted yes ted dont you remember me i dont remember anything bushnell said his words were slurred now what is it nothing irene said sadly nothing at all she set the receiver down then picked it up again and dialed dr roderick corcoran they picked up a change of clothes for laura at the carlisle and showered at erics apartment the stench of oil was weaker but still persistent equally frustrating was the lack of answers to any of the dozen questions they had been asking of each other eric called the east boston police then the globe and herald no one had heard anything about a shooting or any kind of disturbance on the east boston docks i think we should go to the police laura said she was sitting on the bed drying her hair and wondering what kind of an impression she was making on verdi from its perch at the foot of the bed the bird was watching her every move if no one has reported anything eric said what in the hell are we going to tell them i have a feeling those guys didnt even work on the docks what are you talking about im talking about drugs what well just look at what happened three thugs with guns who seem to know who wear or at least who you areaccuse your brother of killing someone and maiming someone else then they demand some sort of videotape what does it sound like to you he snatched up the phone dialed the white memorial er and asked about any gunshot victims or other injuries from the docks predictably nothing had come in several calls to other ers also drew blanks maybe artie only thought he was shot he mused do you think scott was selling drugs laura i dont know what on earth your brother was into but it sure wasnt communications networks who could have saved us out there hey no repeat questions allowed remember especially none with beats me as the answer so where do we go from here eric glanced over at the clock well unless you have another idea i would think that in half an hour we go to the gates of heaven hows your belly feeling lees just say that getting suckerpunched like that is not an experience i want to repeat however if theres one thing that five years of emergency medicine have taught me its how to take a punch ive been hit at work any number of times by any number of crazies she pulled him down and kissed him you know he said believe it or not theres an up side to all this for me for the first time in longer than i can remember im immersed in things that have nothing to do with medicine just with pain and confusion she said hey pain and confusion are my middle names speaking of which why dont we head on over to meet with don devine service is his middle name im getting a little antsy for some explanations just watch your midsection laura said donald devine was dressed in the same suit and blue tie that he had worn during erics previous visit to the mortuary as before he ushered the two of them to his office and turned down the background strings eric thought he caught a bit of the muzak version of sounds of silence now then devine said what can i do for you this time dr najarian najarian eric corrected noticing that the man seemed less at ease than he had on their first encounter mr devine we dont want to take up too much of your time but there are some things we hoped you could clear up go right ahead the little man said we have reason good reason to believe that the man i spoke to you about the other nightthe man you called thomas jordanis lauras brother thats impossible the mans response was nearly kneejerk is it of course that body was identified by the medical examiner signed for by his next of kin and cremated mr devine laura said we went to see dr bushnell last night so so he was drunk and barely able to make it from his chair to the door let alone do the fingerprinting and research you claim he did what dr bushnell does on his own time is no concern of mine devine said beginning to pace and avoiding any eye contact with her he did exactly what i said he did laura crossed to him and forced him to meet her gaze please help us she said softly we dont want to cause trouble for you but we are determined to find my brother and i hope you do devine said but it wont be here because i have nothing more to tell you he tried to hold her gaze but failed finally he forced himself past her and across the room to his desk mr devine eric said taking up the slack perhaps you dont understand were convinced somethings going on here something illegal nonsense is it i think i would like the two of you to leave if we go well be back eric said either with a court order to examine your records or with a reporter we promise you that do what you wish the mortician said pausing to mop at his brow with a linen handkerchief i have nothing to hide and nothing more to say to you except that if you continue to harass me i shall be forced to speak with the police a wonderful idea eric said lets do it now arms folded devine turned to him i think its time you left he said you have learned all there is to learn here mr devine please laura said no i have work to do now would you please go laura and eric exchanged looks and silently decided that this was not the time for a major confrontation you know well be back dont you laura said my brother is all the family i have and were going to find him or learn what happened to him i wish you luck donald devine said the two of them had started toward the door when eric turned back donald id suggest you go right out and get yourself some more handkerchiefs he said before were through youre going to need a bunch of them for nearly a minute after the door closed behind his two visitors donald devine stood statuelike by his desk you can come out now he said finally from the back room a tall man with broad shoulders and thick graying red hair emerged he wore chinos and a turtleneck that seemed to be stretched to the limit across his chest yyou see les devine said shifting uncomfortably i told you i could handle them yeah donald the man said you did great just great devine who barely reached the mans chin backed away you really mean that he asked course i do don the tall man said with a mirthless smile do you think theyll be back now why would i think that don i i dont know you stayed so cool that im sure they dont suspect a thing llook devine said ive done exactly what you all told me to do and been damn well paid for it i just dont want any trouble those people at the hospital told me this wouldnt happen the man reached in his pocket pulled out one of lauras posters and handed it to the mortician are your two visitors right he asked is this the man i i think so don thats not good enough this is the bastard who filmed us that night now the question is is he the man you brought to charity or not maybe the redhead grabbed devines tie and twisted it tightly around his fist nearly lifting the little man off the floor no maybes yyes yes its him devine croaked the man loosened his grip and went to the phone who are you calling who do you think don dr barber good guess if youre right and this is the guy then we dont have anything to worry about listen i have nearly two hundred dollars in phone bills and another two hundred in gas that no ones paid me for yet don just shut up the man picked up the phone and then he smiled how ironic he muttered sandy north almost blows our whole operation takes out two of gambones best men and then ends up shuffling around in pajamas at charity i guess there is a god after all he stayed on the phone for just two minutes then he slammed the receiver down the bastards gone he said escaped thats not possible is it i just said it happened didnt i so i guess its possible his face was crimson i dont like this devine said again beginning to mop his brow i i dont like this at all the man appraised him his lips pulled back in an odd icy grin i know you dont donald he said i know you dont dr roderick corcoran held appointments to the pathology staffs of all the medical schools in the city a medical examiner for nearly thirty years he was in the words of one police official long on experience but short on enthusiasm in fact the call that had brought him to the white memorial autopsy suite had interrupted a session with the architect who was designing his retirement home on cape cod now as he completed his notes on the external examination of the body of loretta leone corcoran wrestled with the decision of whether or not it was worth adding a set of solar panels to the south roof behind him the white memorial autopsy technician sang huang was preparing to make the huge y incision thatwould expose the womans chest and abdominal contents sang huang was nervous after a fourmonth apprenticeship in the department he was doing his first unsupervised case he was a superstitious man and not that comfortable around corpses but the job had nearly doubled his salary and for that kind of money he was willing to endure a lot he paced from one side of the steel autopsy table to the other wondering whether he should wait for the pathologists order or simply proceed on his own this was not the case huang wanted to start on the examiner was a man he didnt know everything seemed rushed and disorganized and the corpse was fresher than any he had ever dealt with he glanced down at the body the skin was waxen and uniformly pale there were none of the external signs of death that he was used tono fatal wounds no rigor mortis no dependent lividity involuntarily he shuddered excuse please docta he ventured you want i start here now whassat corcoran glanced over his shoulder oh sure kid sure get me six vials of blood from her heart then set everything out on the table ill be done with this goddam paperwork in a minute huang hesitated then shrugged and used a scalpel to make incisions from each of the corpses shoulders to the upper breastbone then down past the navel to the top of the pelvic bone at the touch of the blade the skin beneath it seemed to tighten before falling away again huang shuddered there was more bleeding from the incision than he had ever seen before much more he glanced over at corcoran who was still engrossed in his writing the last thing huang wanted was to look uncertain or incompetent he was nervous that was all with a resigned sigh he took the huge bone shears forced them through the thick intercostal muscles and snipped through the ribs where they intersected with the breastbone midway through the procedure he felt certain the woman had moved it took every bit of his courage to continue he worked his hand beneath the left side of the breastbone and then pulled it up exposing the heart instantly bile welled in huangs throat he vomited and collapsed to the floor roderick corcoran whirled at the commotion and rushed to the autopsy table loretta leones steadily beating heart gleamed obscenely beneath the bright overhead lights oh my god corcoran cried oh my god at that moment a dreadful gurgling moana cry that seemed to come from the very depths of hell welled up from the womans throat her body stiffened then went limp her shimmering heart quivered then stopped reflexively corcoran reached down to attempt cardiac massage but just as quickly he stopped with the chest cage mutilated and no help available there was no sense in it he bent down by his prostrate assistant and assured himself that the mans pulse was strong then bathed in a cold sweat his hands shaking he skimmed through the womans chart looking for a name after a final nervous glance at the corpse on his autopsy table he snatched up the phone page operator he said angrily get me dr marshall dr reed marshall eddie garcia stretched the stiffness from his neck and shoulders and dropped his rig into fifth for the climb into the rockies the night was coalblack and he was down to one staticfilled countrywestern station but thanks to a decent nights sleep at his mothers and a few tablets of truckers friend he felt keen and alert it was a good thing too because the man he had picked up wandering along a deserted stretch of highway hadnt spoken ten words in almost as many hours an independent trucker garcia was hauling beef from flagstaff to cleveland under contract to buckeye packing he took the run whenever he could because he liked the distance and the scenery and because he got the chance to visit his mother and sisters in mexican hat the downside of the detour home was that he was now half a day behind and would have to keep at it without sleeping until ohio he glanced over at his passenger who was propped against the window drifting in and out of sleep the man had the hollow gray sickly look of someone who had done time and if eddie hadnt known that there were no prisons in the area he might have pegged him as an escapee even if he had been it wouldnt have mattered much to eddie hey bob you hungry he asked the man sat up a bit but didnt look over you from these parts what parts utah colorado hey are you okay im okay well you dont look okay mind if i ask what your last name is bob continued staring out at the blackness ahead i dont know he said suit yourself garcia said for a time he just drove and rubbed at the stubble along his jaw look he said finally lets get one thing straight i picked you up because you were twenty miles from nowhere and looked like you were needin a ride and because i was wantin some company im not the type to pry into other peoples lives i dont give a shit who youre runninfrom or what youre into i did some time once myself if i ask you something then its just for conversation or cause i want to help you out if youre sick you got that the driver looked at him with concern you really dont know your last name do you north shollander trainer mkowski enders pullman scott enderss dark eyes narrowed as he tried to sort out the many names that kept swirling through his head no he heard himself say no i dont or where youre from scott shook his head when did you eat last garcia asked i dont know scott pictured a crowded dining hall someplace and remembered now that he hadnt eaten for days fearing the food was drugged but by whom and why he pictured the man named pike and he saw himself hiding the last capsule pike had given him beneath his tongue where did that happen there were snatches of other images as well but none that he could sort out well enough to understand what they represented well then the trucker said cheerfully at least you know that you dont know when you ate last now were getting somewhere theres a diner about ten miles ahead some coffee and a burger will do us both some good you got any money scott checked his righthand pants pocket but when he tried to reach into his left the fingers on his left hand which were bent in a stiff claw refused to move have they always been that way im watching you fumble around and im worried about you bob garcia said what happened to your hand scott merely looked at him and shrugged this is crazy absolutely crazy the driver said are you just puttin me on or can you really not remember anything how did you get to route onesixtythree someone leave you there i crawled under the photoelectric cells scott said realizing the fact only as he spoke the words whatthe i saw the photoelectric cells and i got down on my belly and crawled under them eddie garcia shook his head leave it tool eddie to pick up the craziest bird this side of san francisco he muttered they pulled into the truck stop which was nearly deserted garcia hopped from the cab and watched as his passenger worked his way to the pavement it was only then that he noticed the mans limp it seemed as if he couldnt pick up his left foot properly i know i know he said more to himself than to bob the photoelectric cells paralyzed you garcia ordered coffee regular and cheeseburgers for both of them and watched as bob tried then gave up trying to use his left hand the more he studied the man and the emptiness that seemed to envelop him the more sadness he felt he briefly entertained the notion of giving him a twenty and simply taking off but just as quickly he discarded the thought that wasnt his way you really dont remember anything do you scotts lower lip tightened not much he said i want to remember something but i just cant a memory flashed of kicking open a cactus and scooping out its moisture and he wondered how he had known to do that a succession of disconnected scenesmany of them quite violentflicked through his mind none of them brought even a glimmer of recognition or emotion eddie garcia bought some beef jerky and various other snack foods paid for their meal and then eased his semi back onto the interstate he felt as if somehow he had stopped on highway and picked up a child in a mans broken body now he had no idea what to do with him bob tell me something he said as they sped through glenwood springs and on toward denver do you have any family anyone you want to call a place you want me to bring you mrs gideons horse scott said suddenly what i need to go to east boston to find mrs gideons horse east boston mass yes scott knew that was true and important as well but he had no idea why bob whos this mrs gideon she a relative of yours i i dont know what im talking about he clenched his good hand in frustration dammit i just dont know well look garcia said well be in cleveland tomorrow night you can hitch from there to boston better yet you can catch a bus ill front you the money eddie garcia relieved to have even the semblance of a plan shifted into overdrive and the rig barreled on propped on one elbow laura lay in erics bed watching the gray light of the new day filter over the city it had been a year or more since she had last spent the night with a man and even though they had not yet made love she knew that she wanted to in a short time they had already shared so much she reached over swept erics hair from his brow and kissed him there he blinked and squinted up at her then without a word he drew her over onto him and held her for nearly half an hour they lay there her face nestled against his chest soon he asked reveling in the lines of her body and the smoothness of her skin she nodded and kissed him deeply i want it to be perfect though she whispered he rolled her over and caressed her breasts with his lips her nipples hardened to his touch i understand he said and i promise you it will be they showered and then shared juice and coffee on the balcony neither anxious to break the mood by speaking of the day just past finally laura stood and leaned against the railing gazing across the rooftops at cambridge do you have a plan for the day eric asked not really i think its worth going to the police and at least seeing what theyre willing to do about donald devine i agree but after yesterday morning im not sure i like the idea of your wandering around the city alone im off tomorrow if you can wait ill see at least wait until noon ill call before then the phone began ringing eric hesitated not anxious to deal with caduceus again finally he pulled himself up and reentered the apartment a minute later he was back ive got to go he said somethings happened at the hospitalsomething pretty bad reed marshalls resigned resigned that was my boss joe silver apparently reed pronounced a woman dead and sent her to the hospital morgue late yesterday they autopsied her and found her heart was still beating no is that possible i really cant imagine it but according to silver it happened we kid about such things all the time and there are always stories but this is the first time ive heard of its actually happening to anybody i know just the notion of it gives me a sick feeling in my gut reed called in this morning and quit it sounds like hes in a pretty bad way laura followed him into the apartment and sat on the side of the bed as he dressed eric how can that be how could a doctor with all that equipment make such a mistake i dont know as ive told you reeds about as good as there is will you call and let me know what happened ill call he said but im not sure well ever know what happened from the moment the doors of a hospital open for the first time and the first patient is treated the facility acquires a pulse and begins to develop a personality as unique asany individuals it fumbles and grows learning from its mistakes it stretches and explores reaching out more and more to the world around it its organs decay and need repair or replacement its moodsthe collective moods of its patients and employeesgrow more distinctive within minutes of arriving at the emergency room that morning eric could feel the uneasiness pervading white memorial it was the reflection of a great hospital confronting its own fallibility the autopsy of loretta leone had taken place late the previous afternoon the hospital grapevine while by no means always accurate was as swift as any communications system yet devised within hours everyone at every level in the institution had a version of the tragedy joe silver looking even more frazzled than usual met eric at the triage desk i just got a call from the goddam herald he said this sucks it really does they walked back to erics office where the er chief told him what he knew marshall blew it silver concluded he just blew it nonsense i refuse to believe that eric said reeds damn good at what we do and you know it anger prickled at the base of his neck and then began to burn joe it doesnt seem to me that youre showing a hell of a lot of loyalty to someone whos worked so hard for you for five years the least you can do is give him the benefit of the doubt until you know the full story silver glared at him benefit of the doubt a medical examiner named corcoran wants to have my department nailed to the wall some asshole from the herald is bringing up that worrell business again and calling me and my staff incompetent a woman got pronounced dead who wasnt and youre calling me disloyal youve got some goddam nerve nan his sallow complexion was nearly scarlet you just get out there and do your job and keep your mouth shut to any reporters he spat no wonder people dont want you in a position of authority around here youre just too damn arrogant marshall was overtired from working too many shifts in a row if you had been on duty yesterday the way you were supposed to be this would never have happened now just one minute eric started to say but silver had already stalked from the office eric sank to his chair nearly as furious with himself for not holding his feelings in check as he was with silver but what he had said to silver was true reed had his weaknesses but he was a hell of a doctor in all likelyhood whatever happened to him could have happened to any of them eric snatched up the phone and dialed reeds home on the tenth ring carolyn marshall answered im sorry eric she said reeds in bed hes not talking to anyone just tell him its me and see if hell speak with me for a minute she set the receiver down in the background eric could hear a baby crying he glanced down the corridor at the triage area the faces of the er staff looked gray and drawn not one of them he guessed wanted to be at work that day hey whaddaya say pal marshalls speech was thick and awkward reed have you been drinking not since i threw up that blood a few hours ago i havent besides valiums so much mellower jesus reed youve got to stop that shit why im still conscious can you tell me what happened i fucked up thats what happened we all fuck up all the time eric said thats the nature of this job and you know it as well as i do if we had all night to sit and debate and hold court we could do the right thing every time but the people we deal with are sick and we have to make decisions thats just the way things are well said mr amigo well said dammit reed i mean it now please just tell me what happened the woman had a rhythm and i ignored it i fucked up its as simple as that eric felt a sudden tightness in this throat what kind of a rhythm he asked eight ten beats a minute broad complexes looked useless at the time but i guess they were enough to generate a contraction cause thats what the m e said was happening now if that isnt fucking up i dont know re did you stick the tracings in her chart erics pulse was beginning to race course i did mr thorough thats me well listen get rid of that goddam valium and dont give up on yourself okay whatever you say doc well thanks for callin see you around ol buddy reed put carolyn on for a minute will you eric heard him fumble with the phone and then knock something over moments later his wife came on listen eric said reeds got valium someplace he does find it and throw it out okay ookay eric do you understand what happened nothing that should have caused all this trouble carolyn we pronounce people like this woman all the timebelieve me we do ive done it plenty the admission brought a sudden chill all eric could think about was the need to review loretta leones chart youre not just saying that are you carolyn asked no way joe silver nearly fired me just now for sticking up for reed i meant what i said to him and im not lying to you thank you she said will you keep in touch of course i will but for now just get all the booze and tranquilizers out of the house reed once mentioned he was seeing a therapist is he still why yes yes he is well call him i think reed might need to be hospitalized at least let his doctor decide by the time eric hung up he was damp with sweat it took nearly half an hour to track down loretta leones hospital record it was in joe silvers office but at first the er chief refused to allow him to see it eric persisted finally the man relented extracting the promise that it would go no further than erics officeand bediscussed with no one unable to wait eric flipped open the chart in the hallway from what he remembered the ekg complexes were identical to those of the derelict he had pronounced dead not similaridentical he spent an hour getting through the mounting backlog of patients and then sent to the record room for the derelicts chart he was right the mans cardiogram and loretta leones were interchangeable was the man who might have been lauras brother still alive when his monitor was shut off given what evidence he had eric knew there was little reason to believe otherwise the prospect sickened him trying desperately to make sense of things he wandered from the triage area to the deserted residents lounge and dropped into a battered easy chair could the similarity between the tracings be coincidence once in medical school when confronted with a confusing set of findings in a patient he had suggested to a favorite professor that the explanation might be coincidence the woman patiently allowed him to braid his own noose before turning to the class your cohort mr najarian has chosen coincidence as his solution to this problem she said i suggest to you all that while coincidence might from time to time exist in diagnostic medicine the concept is in the main gods way of placating the intellectually lazy eric managed a thin smile at the memory never since that dayhad he accepted coincidence as an explanation for anything without one hell of a fight he took the two charts to his office and locked them in his desk as soon as he could break from the er he would head for the library to begin the process of becoming an expert on metabolic poisons and deathlike states somewhere there existed an explanation for the findings in the derelict and loretta leone and until there was not a source left in boston he hadnt tapped eric vowed that there was no way he would settle for anything even remotely like coincidence soon after eric had left for the hospital laura floated back to sleep she awoke after nine bewildered and confused to find herself not in her cabana on little cayman across the room verdi was scuffing about beneath his cage cover laura set the cover aside and spent a fruitless five minutes endeavoring to coax the bird into a tgood e bed morning finally she sat on the edge of the bed trying to map out some sort of plan for the day ahead for the first time since leaving the island she felt restless and ill at ease gradually she began to see that meeting ericgrowing to care for him and to have him care for her seemed somehow to have blunted her sense of urgency in finding scott was her commitment that fragile it frightened and angered her to think that it might not be fear for her brother that had been driving her so but fear of losing the only real connection she had kept to life beyond the island had her life grown that thin she got dressed and walked downtown to the carisle the day was cloudless and a little overcast begging for the relief that rain would bring several times during her walk she tried without success to spot anyone following her just the notion that somone might constantly be watching was sickening the iranian desk clerk had no new messages laura went up to her room turned on some talk show and lay down almost immediately she could feel herself begin to drift off again the search for scott was so much easier with eric along to help she reasoned she could catch up on some sleep do some shopping and waituntil tomorrow to see the police the thought of another encounter with another bored condescending officer was not at all appealing besides there was little chance of their helping anyway her eyes closed and it is our belief as antivivisectionisis one of the programs guests was saying that the medical researchers and animal providers have a lobby going in washington that is as strong and wellfunded as any special interest group laura forced her eyes open pushed herself up and stared at the screen the speaker droned on castigating the loss of perspective in the medical world first mice and hamsters then dogs then primates then socalled volunteer prisoners she was saying and where do you suppose all this is heading laura snatched up the phone dialed information and got the number of the anatomy department at the medical school she was connected with a man named bishoff the administrator of the department mr bishoff thanks for speaking with me laura said my name is laura scott im doing some research for a novel and i need some information on how medschool anatomy departments acquire the bodies they use for students to dissect you a mystery writer the man sounded intrigued thats right published no not yet oh laura could sense the mans interest begin to wane but im under contract she said eagerly well then in that case congratulations are in order your first sold novel you know ive been planmng a book myself a medical mystery i havent quite gotten to the actual writing yet but i do have a title take two aspirins and call me in the morgue catchy dont you think laura wished she had decided on some other ploy it has potential she said glad you think so now then author to author what do you want to know well mr bishoff where do you get your bodies why theyre donated by whom by the only person authorized to do sothe deceased pepeople sign their bodies over in their wills thats right they are required to notify us of their desire when they are sound of mind and to sign a notarized form in triplicate a copy goes to their records a copy goes to us and a copy goes on their will do the police ever supply you with bodies never and you get enough that way more than enough actually we keep them on ice say wouldnt it be great to have a big chase scene that ends up in a body freezer it would be mr bishoff been done already but i think it may have oh tell me she said do you pay for them the bodies hell no only burial fees if the family wants to use the countys boot hill up on the north shore you never pay for a body absolutely not we cant make budget as it is does that wreck your plot it may in that case im sorry one last time just so i can be sure there is no way someone can profit from selling bodies to medical schools absolutely none thank you mr bishoff youve been very helpfull my pleasure now i have one question for you yes do you think i should get an agent before or after i write my book laura smiled i think after might be better mr bishoff she said she hung up and then dialed the number of the medical examiner thaddeus bushnell a recording told her that the line was out of order ten minutes later she was in a cab headed toward his lower beacon hill town house hoping that in midday she might find him a bit more sober and easier to talk to at the turn onto bushnells street she spotted the wooden barriers on the sidewalk in front of his place the building itself was gutteda burnedout shell the stench of smoke and charred wood hung heavy in the air she asked the cabbie to wait and walked to the barriers a uniformed fire inspector was standing beside what remained of the front doorway what happened she asked the man stared at her the house burned down he said his tone asking what do you think happened what about dr bushnell laura sensed ominously that she neednt have bothered asking the question you a friend i i knew him the man softened im sorry he said the old guy never made it out i knew he would do this to himself laura said pardon dr bushnell i saw him the other night and he was drinking too much and smoking i was frightened that something like this might happen to him the inspector looked back at the house and then at laura you a reporter he asked no why who are you im im visiting from the south why because im not supposed to talk to anyone until weve checked on a few more things please laura said suddenly apprehensive please tell me what happened it its very important the man sized her up for a few moments and then said simply the fire was set professional job from the looks of it but not the best the old guy was on the second floor the thing was put together in such a way that he probably couldnt have gotten out even if he wanted to miss you look a little pale laura pictured the frail little man wrapped in his blanket speaking of events long past as if they had happened yesterday im feeling a little pale she said there are some terrible things going on around here the man gazed again at the shell that was once thaddeus bushnells home yes yes i suppose there are he put his hand out and peered overhead rains startin he said except for the elegant county medical library on huntington avenue the hoffman medical library at white memorial was the largest in the city eric planned to start his research there with a screening of basic textbooks in the areas of toxicology metabolism and cardiology he would pay special attention to the bibliographies at the end of each pertinent chapter and set up a card file of the journal articles that would form phase two of his project his operating thesis was that somehow the two patients had encountered the same poison or environmental pollutanta toxin powerful enough to cause cardiovascular collapse and profound metabolic slowing it was just after four in the afternoon earlier in the day a light rain had moved in on the city floating a slick of embedded oil up onto the highways the resulta series of multivictim accidentshad kept him at work in the er longer than he had wished finally he had signed out to the senior resident joe silver had appointedto take reeds place and agreed to split shifts with the man each day until a more permanent arrangement could be made earlier in the day laura had phoned with a report of her call to the anatomy department and news of the probable murder of thaddeus bushnell hoping to come up with an explanation for the similarities between the deaths of john doe and loretta leone eric had battled back the urge to tell her right then of the horrible error he might have made very soon though they would have to have that talk with a growing sense of urgency he piled the texts on the corner of a table and began within an hour his list of toxins was at forty aconite curare botulin belladonna sapotoxin physostigmine tetrodotoxin cyanide arsenic acetanilide antimony barbiturates bee venom mandrake root muscarine amanita picrotoxin reptile neurotoxin strychnine one by one on index cards he fisted the substances their toxic doses routes of administration sources and principal symptoms each of them was capable of causing death by neurologic or cardiac paralysis and by inference specific doses of each might induce a marked metabolic slowdown the task of sorting them out seemed overwhelming but so too eric reminded himself were the hundreds of organic chemistry formulas he was once faced with memorizing an hour passed then another as he worked his way through his cards bit by bit the list grew smaller for a time one toxin or another would catch his fancy only to be discarded by the question how could both victims have been exposed or could the effect of the substance possibly stop after metabolic paralysis and before death amanita a mushroom poison was one of the leading candidates so for a time were strychnine and the toad poison bufotoxin but again and again as if daring him to refute it one substance kept cropping up tetrodotoxin a product found in certain species of puffer fish and believed by one researcher at least to be the longsoughtafter zombi poison in japan certain chefs were certified by the government in the preparation of fugu a pufferfish sashimi dish that straddled the line between food and drug the chefs some of whom occasionally died from sampling their wares sought to preserve just enough tetrodotoxin to cause flushing of the skin tingling of the lips and extremities and a mild euphoria but numerous cases of pufferfish poisoning had been documented the effects being in part pulmonary edema due to cardiac slowing respiratory failure and marked metabolic depression could loretta leone and john doe somehow have inadvertently eaten fugu the idea made no sense outside the library the gray evening gave way to ebony night inside the pile of journals on erics table grew amanita mushrooms fugu aconite plant alkaloid one by one eric pared his list until finally only those three remained each in the proper dosage seemed capable of inducing a state of metabolic slowdown that might be indistinguishable from death behind him the library door opened then closed eric did not look up moments later he felt a massive hand on his shoulder dr subarsky i presume he said as he enated strychnine once and for all from his prospects you are certainly a diligent little beaver the biochemist said surely you must have something more exotic to do with your free time he dropped a load of books on a nearby table settled in across from eric and scanned the books he was using journal of toxicology poisons of the world journal of ethnopharmacology see i am doing something exotic eric said realizing only then how much time had elapsed and what exactly is that subarsky leaned back and propped his gunboat sneakers on the table i im looking into the case of the lady that reed marshall pronounced dead yesterday eric said ah yes the talk of the town nasty mistake the man made nasty im not so sure it was a mistake res ipsa loquitur subarsky said what does that mean roughly the deed speaks for itself david how would you define death subarsky scratched at his beard the usual i guess cessation of cardiac and neurologic activitythat sort of thing what about all these reports ive been reading of people who had those findings for a time and then woke up i can find you reports of dinosaur sightings in the grand canyon subarsky said well ive been here for hours trying to put together a definition that fits all these reports and you know what i keep coming up with putrefaction thats what if it doesnt rot it aint dead i like it najarian i like it although i can see how it could make for a bit of a space problem from time to time seriously seriously well it seems to me that an md degree and thirteen years of higher education qualifies you to use going to rot as your standard but reed marshall used that and reed marshall was wrong a fluke subarsky said one in a billion i dont think so david because you see i may have made the same mistake eric pulled out the ekg tracings and went over the two cases and where is this john doe now subarsky asked i dont know do you have some time for you all the time in the world piece by piece eric recounted his meeting with laura their visits to the gates of heaven and thaddeus bushnell and their close call on the east boston docks subarsky chewed on a pencil as he listened when eric finished his friend whistled softly you have been into some shit my man ill say that david i have no idea whats going on but i think the derelict and loretta leone were poisoned how accident product tampering psycho define crazy any way you want and ill find you someone who fits the bill and you think you stopped too soon in resuscitating the guy who may have been your new flames brother its possible i dont buy it i dont expect you to yet thats what im doing here and what have you come up with lots of things but what i keep coming up with is this eric slid his notes on tetrodotoxin across subarsky scanned them in a minute so he said once again the zombi poison rears its ugly head you know about it some a few years ago there was a flurry of interest in it even a bestselling book but after a while articles began popping up in the scientific literature refuting most of the methods and claims i know ive read some of them and you still suspect the drug either alone or in some kind of combination can a good toxicologist detect it probably what about amanita and aconite probably well then tomorrow im going to the pathology department to see if they can screen loretta leones blood then i think ill try to set up an appointment with dr darden ah yes white memorials resident haitian good idea if anyone around here would know about the tetrodotoxin myth he would agreed but do you know if hes ever been near haiti since he came to the states actually i do eric said theres a clinic in portallprince that he helped set up from time to time he takes a resident down with him in that case he may well be the man who can put you straight what do you mean well im no expert in this particular area but i cant believe any drug could do the things youre concerned about as an armenian you have this overdeveloped genetically inbred sense of responsibility thats what makes you such a terrific doctor but along with it goes your equally inbred armenian sense of guilt and right now that sense is saying that you might have been able to do something to prevent the death of your friends brother well ive known you for a long time eric and i know that if something wasnt right about that case you would have spotted it maybe so eric said but right now my inbred armenian intuition is telling me that im onto something in that case if you need my help in any way just ask subarsky scratched at his beard for a few seconds and then added however i am willing to wager a pitcher of heineken that you are orbiting mars on this one eric gathered his notes ill take the bet he said and believe me i hope you win tomorrow ill hit darden the pathology department and the county library ill keep you posted do that subarsky said just let me know if i or my trusty computer can be of any assistance and in the meantime ill keep my telescope trained on mars im at the hotel call if you get in before if not call before you go to work in the am have not been to the police yet but plan to do so tomorrow am hope your library work went well thank you for all youve done love l ps refrigerator and cupboards have been restocked hope i didnt disturb any great bacteriology experiment by discarding the milk carton the note was on erics pillow when he arrived home along with a volume of exquisite photographs entitled diving off the caymans he flipped through the pages wondering what it might be like to live in such a place for so long his life had been on automatic pilot locked on a single unerring course now there was only uncertaintyuncertainty and a woman he set the book aside and spent a few minutes flipping through his notes he had expected to find laura waiting in the apartment and now felt some relief to discover she was not he had much to work through there remained little doubt that the man he had assumed was a derelict the man he had pronounced dead and sent off to the gates of heaven funeral home was lauras brother now there was reason good reasonto believe he should have pressed on with his efforts that day at least for a while longer and although the quality of his patients life had been a major consideration eric knew that his order to stop the resuscitation had been based at least in part on his judgment of the value of that life as well it was a judgment he like reed would have to live with for the rest of his career it was a bit after ten so lauras note left him an outan excuse to delay sharing his conclusions until morning but the more he thought about it the more he wanted to get it over with to tell her everything and to hope for her understanding both scott and loretta leonehad been somehow poisoned either by a psycho or an inadvertent exposure to some toxin despite dave subarskys doubts that much seemed clear to him now he hoped laura would see that although he might have made essentially the same mistake as reed the deck had been stacked against them both he paced the apartment for a time wondering if other patients in other settines had suffered fates similar to their two cases finally he called the carlisle the phone rang half a dozen times beforeit was picked up no othe spoke hello he said laura her sigh was audible oh thank god she said eric i just got a call from some man who threatened me all he kept saying was its not over we want the tape i screamed at him that i didnt know what he was talking about but he hung up i dont know whats going on but if his aim was to frighten me he did a very good job ill be right over you dont have to do that i want to i was sort of surprised that you werent here im sorry i thought itmight be better if i spent some time alone i just started feeling as if i was growing to depend on you too much laura he saidim depending on you too believe me i am therere some things i need to tell you about when i do i think youll see that in some ways i have as much at stake in getting to the bottom of all this as you do id really liketo come over now what things face to face she hesitated ill be here she said finally laura sat crosslegged on the bed and listened impassively as eric recounted in detail his actions and thoughts on the morning the derelict was brought in i knew she said when he had finished that first night we were together i could see a shadow cross your face every time you talked about that resuscitation for what its worth im sorry we see so many cardiac arrest so many people brought in essentially dead after a coronarythat unless a case is strikingly different from all the others we dont have even the slightest suspicion that something other than natural causes might be involved should you well i guess if were perfect we should i didnt mean it like that and you know it she snapped eric please i just want to understand he looked at her sheepishly sorry he said let me think how to explain this okay theres a concept in diagnostic medicine called index of suspicion put in simplest terms means if you dont think of it index of suspicion and it the better a physician is the more youll never diagnostic possibilities he considers and sifts through in a case if you think every case of middleaged cardiac arrest had a coronary occlusion youll never diagnose a cocaine overdose in a fiftyfiveyearold corporation president believe it or not the worst physician can usually do the right thing or at least not do something harmful or even eightyfive percent of the time its that other five or ten percent that separates great from runofthemill in our business most of us think of doctors so differently from that know and the misconceptionsthe lofty expectations that the public has of usare largely our own doing for we as physicians have fostered the notion that things are or arent simply because we say so and the public buys into itor at least a large segment of it doesbecause people want the security of knowing that theres someone they can turn to who has all the answers but please dont think im copping out or trying to make excuses for my actions last february im just trying to help you understand what was ahead i i just didnt have a clue or suspicion that something might might be going on she ached to hold him to tell him that she understood but she felt unable to get past the life had been in his hands that brother that the man whose winter morning was in all likelihood him suddenly she found herself thinking she had once been in with a diver whose skill and competence she had misjudged he ended up wedged in a narrow tunnel with his air supply all but used up luckily she had sensed trouble and located him just a minute or two from disaster she was able to buddybreathe him up to the surface but the outcome could easily have gone the other way she wondered how her life would have changed how she would have responded had he not made it out of that tunnel affve the manager of her club people diving with her day after daythey had more interest in seeing her as human as fallible than she did eric when she finally turned back to him tears glistened in her eyes i wish you hadnt stopped trying she said i know i wish he could have that morning back believe me i do and i know it doesnt help scott but im determined never to make judgments on the value of anyones life again and never to ignore the possibility that what seems ordinary may not be true that too she put her arms around him and touched her lips to his ear fair enough she whispered there it is pal cleveland ohio eddie garcia swigged down the last of a thermos of coffee and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand he was glad to be nearing the end of the run but was anxious about his passenger soon he would have to drop bob off in the econ of the dirty bus terminal and go about unloading his rig the man was no more prepared or equipped to strike out on his own than a kindergartener for a time during the journey eddie had tried to help him remember something anything but beyond recurring references to east boston a woman named gideon and her horse he got nowhere he pressed questions about bobs limp and about his family his service record and he asked about other things minor connections to his past he guided the semi off the interstate an working his way through darkened successively narrower streets he would springfor one last meal and give him directions to the bus terminal hed also give him forty bucks to get him to east boston you feel okay eddie asked uhhuh scott squinted as his mind tried to put together the images swirlin but nothing connected nothing at all they turned onto a side street barely wide enough for driving a man was waving a stop sign at them he was dressed in work clothes and a plaid hunting overshirt garcia brought the semi to a stop and rolled down the window mornin he said whats up the man husky with closecropped hair walked to the window pulled a revolver from his waistband and held it pointed at eddies face open the door he growled no sudden moves a second man brandishing a shotgun appeared by the passenger door and a third stepped just in front of them hey wait a minute eddie said im just hauling beef theres nothing of any we know what you have the man said now just get out or youre dead eddie turned to his passenger bob he said evenly were being hijacked just open your door and do what these fuckers say without this rig and this load im busted but i dont know what the fuck else we can do goddam it slowly the two of them opened their doors and dropped to the pavement the man who had stopped them clearly the leader of the three motioned them together and then pointed to an alley between buildings in there he ordered do as i say and neither of you gets hurt hey look one of the others said this guys a gimp what are you some kind of war hero scott merely looked at him do what the man says bob eddie whispered hey guys please this rigs all i have in the alley the man barked for eddie garcia the halfminute or so that followed was little more than a blur it began with bob bending over ostensibly to tie his shoe suddenly and with vicious force he swung his arm backhand catching one of the hijackers across the throat and dropping him like a stone in virtually the same motion he whipped his good leg around sweeping the second man to the ground and stunning him with a glancing right palm up under his chin the shotgun clattered to the pavement but the man not immobilized lashed out with his feet knocking bob over the leader of the group a beat slow to react was raising his revolver when eddie kicked him in the groin the man doubled over as eddie kicked him again catching him on the upper arm and sending him sprawling to garcias left the first man hit was stumbling to his feet while the second had grabbed bob by the throat and was beginning to pummel him in that instant eddie saw the look on his passengers face it was an expression he would never forget as long as he livednot one of panic or rage or fear and certainly not the blank stare he had grown so used to over the miles rather bob appeared almost serene removed from what was happening to him oblivious to the pain he seemed to be completely ignoring the man on top of him in order to focus in on something else before eddie realized what was happening bob had reached out with his good leg and swept the shotgun several feet in his direction eddie dived for it rolling over and over again as he fumbled to cock it one hijacker had already started to run the second realizing what had happened shoved bob aside kicked him hard in the ribs and was racing toward the alley as garcia fired the shot seemed to hit him but after staggering a step he barreled on moments later he disappeared into the alley by the time eddie brought the shotgun around the man he had kicked was up and sprinting away he leveled and fired but the hijacker was already well out of range in seconds the street was quiet again shaken and gasping for breath eddie stumbled to his feet bob was on his knees holding his left side you okay bob garcia asked scott coughed and felt the seating crunch of broken bone in his chest he had had fractured ribs before he knew but when and how im okay he managed garcia helped him to his feet you sure he asked you want to go to a hospital the word brought a barrage of images to scotts mind none of them pleasant no he said hoarsely no hospital eddie garcia stopped back a pace and looked at him ive never seen anyone move like that he said who are you scott looked at him sadly and shook his head i dont knoweddie i dont know anything i didnt even plan on attacking those guys it just happened he coughed again and had to forget the pain to keep from passing out im takin you to a fuckin hospital garcia insisted scott shook his head ive got to get to east boston he said its important for what i i dont know mrs gideons horse something i dont know what garcia opened his wallet and pulled out a hundred dollall the money he had but ten here he said the buckeye people owe me big bucks for this run thanks to you im gonna collect can you make it back into the cab i can make it scott said wincing with each step well find the bus terminal then garcia kept shaking his head in amazement as he started up the rig i dont believe what i just saw you do with your hand and your leg like that i just dont believe it fifteen minutes later they stood outside the darkened greyhound terminal you sure you dont want to just stay with me for a while garcia asked we can do my cinciphoenix run together and then maybe get you to a doctor find out why you cant remember nothin ill be okay scott said well here this is a number you can call in utah its my mother she always knows where to find me if you ever need anything anything at all just call thanks i owe you bob i owe you bigtime no you dont behind them the lights of the terminal flicked on moments later the doors were opened eddie garcia wondered if there was something elseanything elsehe could do finally he simply shrugged held the mans hand for a time and then walked away when he reached his rig he turned back bob was still standing there railthin and rumpled and badly needing both a shave and a bath looking at the shape he was in garcia simply could not fathom what he had seen him do you sure you know whats what in there bob he called out boston bus i know well i hope you find yourself my friend and that womans horse too i really do the man in obvious pain managed something of a smile i hope so too eddie he said with no animation whatever i hope so too garcia hauled himself up behind the wheel when he glanced back his passenger was gone the pathology unit at white memorial was a fluorescently lit windowless place located in the basement and much of the subbasement of the main building it had been newly decorated with a mix of marimekko cloth wall hangings and artificial plants which eric found not the least appealing although it was not yet eight in the morning the day shifts in chemistry hematology blood bank cytology and histology were in the swing wearing scrubs and his clinic coat eric passed by each section on his way to the cubicle that housed the hospitals toxicological unit it amazed him that even after five years there were still so many mite memorial employees whose work he depended on day after day case after case yet whom he didnt know although he was operating on precious little sleep he felt charged and invigoratedexcited not only for the discoveries he hoped the day ahead would hold but by the magic of the night just past he and laura had at last become lovers in every physical sense they made love on her bed and in the shower on the easy chair by her television even on the carpet they loved each other in the frantic gtoping way of teenagers and inthe prolonged imaginative gently touching way of old friends and finally toward dawn they slept wrapped in each others arms both sensing their lives beginning to join the white memorial toxicologist a man named ivor blunt could not have been more aptly named a crusty veteran of nearly thirty years at his craft blunt had earned a reputation as much for his eccentricities as for his brilliance his primary area of research involved the chemical dissection and adaptation of snake venom and rumor had it that he kept more than one hundred different species of poisonous reptiles in a single huge solarium in his house blunt was still smarting at having not been invited to get involved in the loretta leone case as he phrased it to eric the toxicologist had been reluctant even to see him about the case eric persisted though and was finally granted a fifteenminute appointment it was his plan to break from his er shift long enough to see blunt and later haven darden and then to leave for the county library as early as possible meanwhile laura would file a complaint against donald devine and the gates of heaven and also report on the threatening phone call she had received whether she told the police about the shooting in east boston would depend on how much credence they seemed to be giving her story blunts office was set at the far end of the corridor from the autopsy suite the door with ivor t l blunt phd painted in black on opaque glass was ajar just a crack as eric was about to knock he heard the toxicologists raspy voice from within come on you pigheaded rascal blunt was exclaiming its under the chair under the chair uncertain eric held back from knocking for a few seconds and then gently tapped on the wooden margin of the door the door creaked open an inch no blunt shouted eric could hear him race for the door at the moment a brown mouse darted out over erics shoes and down the corridor damn blunt said there was a scuffling behind the door finally it was opened blunt looking every bit the mad professor with a frayed tweed sportcoat disheveled gray hair and cokebottle glasses stood in the doorway with five or six feet of python draped over his shoulders that was breakfast for dr livingston here he said without the faintest trace of humor im sorry sir i didnt mean from somewhere down the hall came a shriek then another i know i know blunt growled save your apologies for those women out there as if i didnt have enough problems around here he lowered the snake into a large wiremesh cage and motioned eric to a seat the office had the cluttered active disarray of an academicians retreat a huge periodic table of the elements covered one wall and excellent african safari photos another the rest of the space was crammed with books and journals above blunts desk was a sign that read if it looks like a duck and walks like a duck and quacks like a duck cook it thank you for seeing me eric said im a professor im supposed to see you so im seeing you i wanted to ask your opinion about a problem that leone woman yes sir eric laid out his sets of ekgs and as quickly as he could reviewed the theories he had developed and the research he had done the night before ivor blunt listened quietly although he continually tapped his fingertips together as if to say get to the end please because i already know the question and the answer here eric concluded are the three toxins i came up with as possible agents in these cases i wanted to know what you thought of any theories and also whether you could detect these substances in loretta leones blood blunt studied the list for a bit amanita aconite tetrodotoxin he murmured nice stuff nice stuff well sir the answers to your questions are no no no and yes yes yes pardon no i dont believe any of these three drugs can cause the kind of picture you describe and yes i could detect any of them if they were there and i knew what i was looking for but what about those accounts of simulated death in tetrodotoxin poisoning scientific swiss cheese what far too anecdotal no blood sample testing no levels that sort of thing these are bigleague toxins doctor ill grant you that and nanogram for nanogram tetrodotoxin may be the nastiest and most fascinating of them all but i dont see it slowing metabolism enough to fool a competent doctor with modern diagnostic tools two competent doctors with modern tools were fooled eric wanted to say but the toxicologist seemed impatient and anxious to get on with his day i understand eric said one last question if i were to obtain some of the leone womans blood would you test it for me completely off the record i might as i told you before the medical examiner has not chosen to involve me in this case the word i received was that he suspected incompetence on the part of a certain physician but had absolutely no suspicion of foul play i think hes dropped the matter altogether thank you dr blunt eric said backing from the office thank you so much for doing this for me just tell these women out there that mouse was your fault blunt said eric left the office and went directly to the autopsy suite he began with the secretary and over the next half hour worked his way through the technicians the residents and finally the director of anatomic pathology there was no physical evidence whatever that loretta leone had ever been autopsied no dictation the medical examiners office must have the tape he was told no body no blood and no tissue samples either in formalin or in wax blocks awaiting sectioning and s he tried calling dr roderick coreoran but was told by the medical examiners office that corcoran was on vacation for two weeks the m e who was covenng him had no information on the case although she was certain that any tissue or blood samples that had been taken would still be at white memorial totally dismayed eric pressed on interrupting one person after another to help him search through samples of frozen blood and bottled organs everyone he dealt with named someone else as probably responsible for the material he wanted finally as he stood by the department secretarys desk trying to make an appointment to see the chief he was paged to the er to help deal with a mounting backlog at the triage desk as he left the office a wellgroomed man in his twenties who had been sitting in the waiting area stepped into the hallway and called to him excuse me dr najarian but i was waiting to speak with dr pollard and i couldnt help overhearing your conversation with his secretary youre interested in loretta leones autopsy thats right eric said assuming the man was a resident why can you help me that depends on what youre looking for what im looking for are some tissue or blood samples he said and you cant find any nothing people at the mes office think theyre here thats strange the man said par for the course i would say eric glanced at his watch listen ive got to get upstairs maybe i can check with you on this later where will you be in say an hour or two probably atmy paper what i work for the herald my names call loonies loomis reached out his hand but eric ignored the gesture why didnt you say who you were in the first place he asked loomis smiled you never asked me he said now if its possible id like to talk to you in more detail about these missing specimens go to hell eric said he turned and hurried off down the corridor it was after nine before laura forced herself out of bed and into the shower for years she had listened to men tell her how beautiful she was but eric najarian was the first to make her feel that way she felt reluctant to dressto end the night that had brought so much pleasure to both of them finally she chose an outfit of slacks and a light pulloverthat she felt would not make any particular kind of impression on the police and headed off she was crossing the lobby when the desk clerk motioned her over excuse me miss enders he said but you have a visitor hes been waiting quite a while i told him you probably wouldnt mind his waiting but he wanted to wait he gestured toward the front windows where a uniformed policeman stood watching the passing scene his expression gave no indication that such a visitor was anything but commonplace at the carlisle the officer turned as laura approached him he was a young man somewhere between twelve and twenty was lauras impression his hat seemed a size too big and she smiled at the fleeting thought that his service revolver might be something his parents gave him for christmas im laura enders she said youre waiting to see me yes maam im officer mayer captain wheeler asked me to pick you up and bring you down to headquarters to meet with him something about your brother have they found him i dont know maam i was just asked to pick you up laura wished he would stop calling her maam she followed him to the patrol car which was parked out front is captain wheeler involved with missing persons yes and no maam mayer said hes a captain hes involved with anything he wants to be but if your brothers missing and captain wheelers interested i would think you have a good chance of finding him wheelers that good the best id say certainly the toughest thats nice to hear its a coincidence your being here i was just on my way to station four to file a complaint against a funeral parlor owner sure maam laura saw amusement flicker across the young mans face and sensed that she might be in for a long day over the short ride to police headquarters laura learned what she could about the man who had sent for her wheeler was according to officer mayer a man who had come up through the ranks and earned his reputation primarily with vice and narcotics not too long ago there had been an organized demonstration of protest by a number of uniformed officers when he was passed over for the commissioners job wheelers office was located on the third floor of the building laura had visited on her first day in the city as the patrolman led her to the elevator she spotted sergeant thomas campbell taking a statement of some sort from an elderly black woman and looking every bit as indifferent to her story as he had been to lauras as she stepped into the elevator she silently prayed that the encounter with wheeler would amount to something more than just another set of forms if youll wait here please maam the policeman said nodding to a bench in the thirdfloor hallway he knocked at and then entered wheelers office moments later he returned told laura to wait and disappeared down the back stairs laura tried unsuccessfully to keep her excitement and expectations in check her experience with the police both in dc and boston had been so uniformly unrewarding that just the thought of meeting with a captain who was interested in scott had her imagination soaring several minutes passed during which she played through any number of scenarios testing her reaction to revelations ranging from proof of scotts death to his involvement in some sort of criminal activity at last wheelers door opened a tall uniformed man whose shoulders nearly spanned the doorway smiled at her and motioned her over he looked about fifty with thick reddishgray hair and a confident weathered face thank you for coming miss enders he said extending a beefy hand im captain lester wheeler laura followed him into the office and settled in across the desk from him as wheeler pulled one of her posters from his drawer ive been meaning to get in touch with you about this for a couple of days he said sorry to have taken so long do you know something about my brother do you he asked im not sure i understand miss enders do you know your brothers occupation ive been sensing for a while that what i know is wrong she said hes not in computers is he the policeman shook his head and smiled at the notion no he said no hes notor i should say wasnt i dont mean to be blunt miss enders but i have good reason to believe your brother is dead despite all her preparation laura felt herself sink at the news go on she said your brother was an agent for the government and a damn good one i might add he worked for a group out of washington that i frankly dont know too much about except that they supply undercover people to other agencies such as the fbi and dea communigistics laura said pardon nothing i just think i know who he worked for perhaps you do well this past winter your brother was working undercover on loan to us he was trying to break a drugsmuggling ring operating through the port in easc boston its our belief that he filmed a very big deal involving some people weve been trying to nail for a long time a videotape laura could feel puzzle pieces dropping into place exactly wheeler said we believe that scott was taken somehow andim sorry to say it this wayperhaps even tortured its an occupational hazard your brother lived with this is all so hard for me to believe if it was easy for you to believe wheeler said then your brother wouldnt have been very effective at what he did i understand go on our sources have convinced us that whatever they put scott through he didnt crack in fact he nearly escaped do you know for certain that hes dead if you mean do we have his body the answer is no he probably drowned in boston harbor he may not have laura said she recounted erics resuscitative attempts on the derelict and their subsequent visits to the gates of heaven when your man picked me up i was actually on my way here to file a complaint against donald devine she concluded interesting wheeler said very interesting miss enders im not sure what to make of your story about this devine but i cant begin to tell you how badly we want that tape i im afraid i cant help you your brother never communicated with you however innocently never except for an occasional phone call these postcards are all ive ever gotten she handed him the small stack of cards from boston theres one other thing i havent told you yet she said when wheeler had finished scanning the postcards the day before yesterday eric and i received a message to check the east boston docks for news of my brother she handed him the note and described the events that followed do you have any idea who saved you wheeler asked i was hoping you might know the policeman shook his head obviously the feds are playing their own game here he said they probably sent you as a way of speeding things up perhaps they knew that scott had been working around this warehouse the man who saved your bacon had probably been following you miss enders excuse me for pressing but this is so important you have no inkling whats over of where your brother might have hidden the video receiver absolutelynone well then wheeler said suppose we leave things at this as soon as i have time ill see what explanations your friend mr devine has regarding this whole business with that body you really think it was your brother i do all right ill look into that mean while if youre going to stay in boston id like you to keep me aware of any developments such as that note but let me say this if i were you id catch the next plane back to your island some very bad people think you know where that tape is and if theyre who i think they are they dont stop until they have what they want things could get real ugly laura did not respond right away she stared down at the floor biting her lower lip as an enormous sadness settled in her breast the confusion and uncertainty had lifted but in their place was a heavy gloom she had no remaining doubt that scott was dead nor did she question how he had died clearly the derelict disguise he had adopted was part of his undercover work and equally clearly the escape from his captors had led to his deathperhaps from exposure perhaps from internal injuries erics theories about a poison no longer made much sense the similarities between scotts cardiogram and that of reed marshalls patient were in fact coincidental now as far as she was concerned there remained only the side issue of donald devine and exactly what he was doing with bodies and at best captain lester wheeler seemed only passingly interested in that situation she promised her full cooperation thanked the policeman for his help and left vowing that if nothing else she would see her battle with the gates of heaven through to the end laura left police headquarters and wandered along tremont street toward the common she had no particular destination in mind and no particular desire other than to walk until her legs ached too much to continue she thought about her parents and actually smiled at the notion of their reaction had they arrived to learn what profession their son had finally chosen at one point they had pushed scott into the local h club and insisted that he begin grooming himself for farming she skirted the common and wandered past the combat zone to chinatown on a whim she stopped at a phone booth and tried calling eric at white memorial she hung up when the operator asked for an additional deposit while she was still on hold there would be plenty of time to fill him in later that night she crossed the turnpike on harrison avenue and drifted away from the downtown area she felt drained deflated her search for scott was to all intents over what remained was no more than the thankless struggle to expose what had been done with his body it helped her to think naively and romantically of what he actually did in his job the lives he had saved by intercepting drug shipments of the assassins he had eliminated a group of youths sitting on an outside stairway whistled and made a number of lewd requests laura was not even aware of them she glanced over at her reflection in a shop window scott had accomplished so much in his life made such a difference she had spent years struggling just to connect with herself perhaps it was time she explored her capabilities her capacity for helping others there were a number of excellent physical therapy programs in massachusetts if by some miracle eric managed to stay on at white memorial they could continue their relationship while she went to school she noticed a cluttered secondhand store across the street and cut diagonally across toward it the roar of the accelerating car engine was no more than the faintest background noise to her until she caught sight of movement in the corner of her eye by the time she sensed danger the chance to react properly had passed laura watch out the shouta mans voice from somewhere behind heronly further confused her and kept her from effective action she was frozen dead center in the intersection the car a large black domestic model was bearing down on her with terrifying speed lining her up for impact with the very center of the grill she turned to run but the driver needed only a minuscule adjustment to keep her locked between the headlights her last thought was the totally irrational impulse to avoid the impact by jumping up and over the hood before she could do anything though she was hitnot by the car but from behind a pair of hands shoved her viciously in the small of her back sending her sprawling to the pavement away from the autos path he whirled as she fell landing heavily on her shoulder at the instant the speeding car hit the man who had pushed her his body careened upward off the hood hit the roof line just above the windshield and sailed a dozen or more feet in the air it landed with a sickening lifeless thud as the dark sedan screeched off down the street gasping for breath mindless of the scrapes on her legs and elbows laura scrambled across the road on her hands and knees the man lying on his back was shattered a pool of blood expanded obscenely from beneath his head which was bent at a grotesque angle to his neck bubbling crimson rivulets trickled from each ear laura battled an intense dizziness and nausea as people rushed at her from all directions it was then that she realized the man lying therethe man who had called her by name before givine up his life for herswas wearing a tan windbreaker lie down into leave her be are you all right did anyone call an ambulance shit look at this guy did anyone get a license number look man i know dead and this guy is dead dont move dear everythings going to be all right hey look man this guys packin see hes got a piece in his waistband im all right laura heard herself say please help him if you can im all right im fine lady no ones gonna help that dude except a priest laura glanced over at the gun in the dead mans belt and knew that it was he who had fought off the attackers on the east boston docks over the protests of several people she forced herself to her feet gingerly she tested her arms and legs please leave me alone just leave me alone she begged she knelt by the mans body and after finding no pulse checked his jeans for a wallet the thin billfold she withdrew from his right front pocket identified him as roger ansefl of ocala florida laura knew the identification was false she studied his pallid face you knew scott didnt you she whispered youve been trying to help me find him all along gently she reached up and closed his eyes in the distance she could hear the wailing of sirens she stood and walked slowly through the crowd which was now a circle at least ten deep far down the street she could see the flashing lights of an approaching patrol car the last thing she wanted was any kind of publicity unobtrusively she worked her way around the mob no one seemed to realize that she was the one involved in the accident then she slipped away down a side street through an alley and hailed a cab she ordered the cabbie just to drive and leaned back in the seat trying desperately to sort out what had happened and why she wanted so to believe that the hitandrun driver was some sort of madman someone insane on alcohol or pills but no amount of reasoning could convince her of that someone wanted her deadsomeone who had been following her at the same time as had roger ansell surely whoever it wasknew where she was staying did they know about eric as well she stopped at a phone and once again called white memorial this time she was told that eric had signed out and could not be reached for the rest of the day she had the cabbie drive for another twentyfive minutes then ordered him back down harrison avenue a patrol car parked on one corner near the accident scene suggested there was still perhaps some questioning going on but otherwise the street seemed as normal to her as the horrible events that had occurred there seemed dreamlike after considering and then rejecting sevibral possibilities laura paid the driver off on boylston street and mounted the grimy stairs to bernard nelsons office thirty minutes later she was seated beside the detective in his volvo wagon on the way to his south shore home nelson chewed on his cigar stub as she brought him day by day through her stay in boston youve come far child nelson said and in a very short time i dont impress easily but you have impressed me say listen ive been considering taking on an apprentice perhaps youd be interested in applying for the position ill consider it laura said uncertain of the seriousness of the offer so nelson said what do you want to do about all this im not sure i dont see that theres much to be gained from going back to captain wheeler neither do i at least theres no big rush i guess its worth calling that man harten in virginia maybe but i wouldnt expect him to admit anything thats the way those people operate my guess is hes the one responsible for sending that note to you i would bet he was using you as bait to flush out whoever had killed your brother the man who died back there was probably assigned to make sure you werent hurt thats terrible expediency is the name of their gain specially when one of their people is missing or dead so whats left well i dont know about you but i certainly find this devine character intriguing id like a chance to visit his establishment what makes you think hed talk to you who said anything about talking to him you mean break in hey easy with those terms we call it searching for the truth he nodded modestly its sort of my specialty may i come id prefer you didnt but considering that you might sign on as my apprentice i suppose i could work you in when as soon as im certain hes not home maggie will clean up those scrapes of yours and fatten you up with some of her lasagna then after dinner well give devine a call if necessary well send him off to pick up a body somewhere in the suburbs your usual fee actually nelson said swinging off route onto the exit ramp searching for the truth runs a bit higher haven dardens office and laboratory filled most of the fifth floor of the proctor research building eric found the medical chief hunched over a microscope a whitecoated technician was at work nearby but otherwise the huge space was deserted darden glanced up at him nodded a greeting and then returned his attention to the scope this is pig work he said i could train a high schooler to do it unfortunately i couldnt pay him so hee i sit moneys tight i should say darden made a few final notes and then pushed himself away so it would appear that dr marshall has placed himself into some sort of treatment facility and out of the running for the er position i would say things look very good for you im not counting on anything i have reason to believe that certain people in this hospital will do whatever they must to see that im out of this place as quickly as possible would you like to expand on that soon soon i would very much like to do just that but right now i have more pressing matters on my mind such as such as getting reed marshall well and back at his job you mean that i do well from what i understand dr marshall has made one hell of an error im not so sure explain eric leaned against the slate edge of the laboratory bench dr darden ive come up here because i was hoping you might be able to tell me something about tetrodotoxin dardens dark eyes smiled so its zombies youre after is it he said eric set the ekgs on the counter this one is from the woman reed pronounced dead and this is from a man i pronounced dead in february i assume he did not subsequently awaken actually i cant tell you for sure his bodys disappeared excuse me ive been able to trace the mans body to a funeral home near here but i have reason to believe the mortician is into some sort of diversion of bodies fascinating darden said he folded his notebook so would you like to discuss this rogue mortician or would you like to accompany me to my office for a crash course in voodoo ill take the lesson for now eric said but i hope i can discuss this other business with you soon of course you may im a bit cramped for time right now so i shall have to give you a pareddown course thats fine but let me say in advance that what you shall learn is not what you want to hear they walked down a row of slate benches covered with thousands of dollarsworth of idle equipment and incubators and entered dardens spacious office overlooking the charles i prefer this space to my office in the department of medicine he explained i can see why looking down on the passing scene has such a calming effect dont you think he gazed out at the river for a moment then turned back to eric so now we must talk some voodoo do you know it well darden smiled enigmatically does anybody i suppose there are those who would consider me something of an expert although i left haiti as a child i have a small clinic in portauprince and much family in the city of caphaitien on the north coast my wife and daughter and i return there frequently and do you believe there are zombies in haiti i do i have no doubt whatsoever certain people usually those who have committed some sort of offense against their fellows are found guilty by a peoples court usually presided over by a houngana priest the offenders learn that they have been condemned to a living death so strong are their beliefs in the haitian way and in the powers of the houngan that they are quite literally powerless to stem their fate they are caused in some way to cgme in contact with a coup poudrea mystical powder soon after they fall into a helpless trancelike state are buried for a time and then are brought back to this world usually in a state of diminished mental and physical capacity and the zombi poison this coup poudre darden shook his head i believe in hypnosis and the power of the mind he said i believe that those who believe in the very fiber of their being that they are cursed to die can make themselves do so and those who believe they are to lie in the state of the undead can also do so i have seen men told under hypnotic trance that they are to be touched with a hot poker and then raise a blister at the site where they are grazed by a pencil eraser i have seen yogis sealed in caskets for many hours without apparent adverse effects but as for a poison that can accomplish the transformation from living being to zombi im afraid not so you see all this as psychologically baseda cultural phenomenon and not something biochemical tetrodotoxin is an awesomely toxic substance highly trained japanese chefs can prepare fugu dishes with a far from lethal dose but there is no way a houngan grinding fish in an earthen bowl or tin can then applying the substance to a victims skin can approach the line of death without consistently going over it perhaps he might augment the strength of his hypnotic suggestion with a bit of biochemical tingle but not with anything like what you are suggesting there is no controllable metabolic toxin so there is no true zombi poison it is as simple as that are there any studies you know of reviewing the cardiovascular effects of tetrodotoxin poisoning ah your ekgs i would suggest that if you sit down with one of our cardiology friends you will learn that this pattern is not at all uncommon in terminal hearts we just dont bother to take the tracing all that often perhaps eric said you dont sound convinced theres a lot at stake beginning with reed marshalls career well i can only tell you what i can tell you a few years ago a harvard ethnobotanist created a stir surrounding tetrodotoxin and zombies since then there has been a flood of letters and articles refuting his claims thats what dr blunt said you spoke with him then yes and he concurred with what i have told you yes he did then when will enough be enough for you eric stood and gathered his notes not just yet he said i assure you eric in this area there is a sharp dropoff around here after dr blunt and myself well sir i have a free evening and my county library card if nothing else maybe i can close that dropoff a bit maybe you can at that haven darden said looking at him thoughtfully maybe you can from the day eric first set foot in the county medical library the airy regal structure with its wide circular stairways and glassed study carrels had been a special retreat for him whether he was working deep in the stacks or in the silent coccoon of a carrel hours often passed like minutes at one stretch while researching a particularly interesting case he had been the last to leave the place so many nights that one librarian had called him an academic barfly it was early evening eric spread his notes on a reading table near the card catalogue and began to work his way through the file caras containing the extensive bibliography he had drawn up the approach which would save time and trips into the stacks was one he had worked out over his years of study in the place he noted down the library number and location of the volumes he would need while organizing his cards by stack section the indian journal of medical research toxicon caribbean quarterly many of the references were so obscure that only a facility like the county in a city the size of boston could house or quickly borrow them eric started with aconite and then amanita the filtered light of day yielded to the fluorescence of the library as he worked his way through various sections of the stacks lugging armloads of musty volumes back to his worktable within two hours he had read enough to eliminate both toxins as likely possibilities only the reference cards pertaining toteotoxin remained pharmacologic reviews kyusha university medical news ethnopharmacology stretching the stiffness from his neck eric began the final phase of his search within half an hour he was sitting on the edge of his table bewildered many of the volumes in his bibliographyfar more than halfwere missing from the stacks with memories of the missing specimens of loretta leone still fresh in his mind he checked with a librarian and assured himself that none of the volumes could be taken out of the library they had either been stolen misplaced in the stacks or were in use somewhere in the library theft eric was told while certainly a problem was less of one in the county than at many other libraries so together he and the librarian rechecked the stacks and then began working their way toward each other from opposite sides of the building checking each table and study carrel in just a few minutes the young librarian much relieved hurried over to him the volumes every one of them were in use she pointed across the library to a worktable that was set apart from the others along the edge of the table stacks of bound journals formed a wall obscuring the person using them from view eric thanked the librarian made his way past the card catalogues and tables and peered over the wall of books a black woman her jet hair pulled back in a tight bun was taking notes on an article in the journal of tropical diseases eric waited a few seconds to be noticed then cleared his throat the woman finished writing a sentence before she looked up she was in her early or midtwenties and was absolutely stunning her wide dark eyes graced a face that was as smooth as perfectly shaped and sensual as any he had ever seen and her ornate gold earrings and agate necklace quite possibly picked off a vendors tray on boylston street or harvard square looked priceless on her hi eric managed ive been searching for you for me her expression was less open than it might have been and beneath her remarkable beauty eric sensed an intensity that made him a bit uneasy she pushed back from the table her jeans and loose beige sweater failed to hide a figure that was at once slender and fullbreasted actually what ive been searching for are these he said gesturing to the volumes and wondering if the sudden dryness in his mouth and thickness in his lips and tongue were noticeable in his speech the woman eyed him curiously for a moment and then said simply take whichever ones you want just bring them back when youre done thanks i appreciate that eric tucked several of the books in one arm and the woman returned to her notes are you a med student he asked reluctant to leave phd she said without looking up oh he waited for more then shrugged and turned away im sorry he heard her say i didnt mean to be rude im just under a lot of pressure to get this work done i understand he said turning back is your thesis in toxicology sort of she ran her finger absently down one pile of volumes im in the department of anthropology at bu my work is on the use of pharmacoactive substances in the religious rites of certain third world countries well youre incredibly beautiful eric stopped himself at the last instant from saying the words he would hardly have been the first to say themthe urge to do so was almost kneejerk well thanks for sharing these he said instead ill bring them back for an exchange when im done are you going to be here long probably until closing see you later then once again eric had to force himself to turn away from her he was very happily in the process of falling in love with laura enders but he suspected that no man however committed would have reacted differently over the hour that followed he made two more trips to the womans table to exchange books with each visit he learned a bit more about her her name was anna delacroix she had finished her required course work at boston university and was just beginning the writing phase of a thesis probing the connection between certain african and new abrld cultures as manifest through their ritual use of psychoactive drugs she had traveled extensively first through europe and asia as a highfashion model and later on her own through africa and the caribbean basin erics initial impression of her intensity was it seemed quite on the mark the life youve led sounds exciting he remarked as he made his third exchange of journals i have seen many things on my travels that you simply would not believe she said with no particular emphasis such as fascinated now eric circled to her side of the table anna delacroix stopped what she was doing and eyed him as she had when they first met perhaps deciding whether he was someone worth sharing such stories with then she said simply i have seen a man fly by this time eric knew far better than to be flip with her and there was nothing in her manner her voice or the almost mystical glow in her eyes to encourage him otherwise tell me about it please he said are you really interested yes yes i am sit then do you know of the country gabon she asked her focus was now locked on his face and whether unsettled by her beauty or the deep commitment in her eyes eric had trouble holding her gaze i know its in africa he said west africa actually on the coast i heard of a priest in the central highlands of that country who could levitate himself and i sought him out you traveled alone to these places when necessary i assure you dr eric i can take very good care of myself i found the village and grew to know the man we spoke for hours each night still it was nearly two weeks before he would show me what he could do one evening just after sunset while there was still much light in the sky he climbed to the top of a tower made of bamboo the topmost platform of the tower was i was told nearly thirty metersninety feethigh for several minutes the priest stood right on the edge of the platform his arms stretched straight out like wings from where i sat he was a black crucifix against the deepest blue sky you could imagine it was an incredible incredible sight then he simply leaned forward and floated free of the platform eric tried to remain expressionless but he knew she could read the incredulity in his eyes in answer to the questions you are too polite to ask she went on no i did not take anything at all and yes he did although he wouldnt tell me what it took perhaps ten minutes for him to drift to the ground it could have been much longer i was so mesmerized by what i was witnessing that i lost all track of time tricks she shook her head no tricks she said at least not the kind you mean photos he wouldnt allow it and frankly i had no desire to take them it was neither his wish nor mine that i go out and convince the world of what he could do he knew his people knew and i knew and that was quite enough well nowi know eric said yes but you dont believe it its written all over your face not that long ago you would have been right i wouldnt have believed your account but what you see in me now is astonishment mixed perhaps with skepticism not disbelief im a good doctor anna and yet im here plowing through these volumes because of a growing belief that both i and a friend of mine who is also a fine physician have each recently pronounced patients dead in our hospital who were in fact very much alive the woman glanced at the volumes then she nodded and smiled knowingly as if the pieces of a puzzle had fallen in place tetrodotoxin she said almost reverently exactly do you know much about it i do for one thing it will most likely be a full chapter in my thesis if not more and for another some of my roots are haitianmy father i have been told though i never knew him was born there do you believe the drug has the power to slow metabolism without stopping it to take a body to the line of death without crossing over do you i i dont know what to believe once again anna delacroixs eyes held fire the drug can do what you ask and more she said eric felt her energy her heat he ran the edge of his hand across the sweat on his forehead how do you know he asked hoarsely is there proof proof a scientist could not refute for more than a minute she said nothing eric studied her exquisite face her perfect mouth and silently prayed that she would at least share with him what she knew finally she took one of her file cards carefully printed an address on it and passed it to him this place is in allston she said can you find it he glanced at the card i can find it ten oclock tonight then come alone and meet me there dr eric and you shall have your proof she stood perhaps when this night is over you will know in your heart that there are those who can fly and those who can die without dying she turned quickly picked up her notes and her jacket and moments later was gone shielded by a newmoon darkness laura and bernard nelson made their way from the alley where he had parked down several more alleys and finally across the street to the entrance of the gates of heaven funeral home for two hours they had placed periodic calls to the mortuary each time reaching only donald devines answering machine finally nelson had shrugged and said simply i guess we go the detective carried with him a small black medical bag containing what he called his tools of truthtwo powerfulpenlights various exacto knives screwdrivers tape a crowbar pliers a voltage meter and batterypowered soldering iron wire suction cups a ring of keys and other odly cut pieces of metal and one littman cardiosonic stethoscope if were stopped by the police he said as they set off you had better do a damn good job of convincing them that im your family doctor making a house call on your ailing aunt if they ever open this little kit of mine were cooked the wooden shutters on the upstairs windows were pulled closed nelson checked the windows on the alley side of the structure and reported that they too were shuttered they rang the doorbell several times listening each time to the melodic chimes echoing from within what tune are those playing laura whispered the detective smiled it would appear our mr devine has a sense of humor he said theyre playing tchaikovsky a snippet of the death of odette itfrom swan lake you could tell that from seven or eight notes maggies a ballet nut after six or seven years of being dragged i finally gave up and got interested youre amazing tell me that after were inside nelson said tossing his cigar stub aside as he scanned first the edge of the doorjamb and then the windows youre sure you want to do this she asked thats still up to you how committed are you to finding out what this mysterious mortician is up to very committed in that case stay in close to the building in the shadows and keep your eye on the street im going back into these and nd to the rear listen for a t si you oor tap from he de of e d if its clear for me to open it tap back twice if not tap once and then head back to the car ill meet you there nelson reached in his medical bag and withdrew щ nip of jack daniels to the truth he said to the truth laura echoed she took a small sip and in a single quick gulp bernard nelson disposed of the remainder he then slid along the side of the gates of heaven and disappeared down the alley over the long minutes that followed only one car drove past the darkened mortuary laura zipped up the thin black leather jacket bernard had given her and pressed herself tightly against the building she had tried calling eric any number of times since the nightmare on harrison avenue but without success in a way she was grateful he almost certainly would have insisted on coming along and if for any reason they were caught in their illegal entry the negative publicity would doubtless kill whatever chance he still had for the white memorial promotion a couple holding hands crossed the narrow street just two doors away laura froze easily holding her breath for more than a minute until they had let themselves into their building she glanced down at the doorknob what is taking so long she thought about the man who had called himself roger ansell he had probably once stood somewhere right on this street watching as she and eric paid their visit to donald devine did he have a wife children first scott now him regardless of the reasons it seemed stupid and senseless and sad the tapstwo of them from inside the mortuarywere barely audible laura responded with two of her own bernard nelson opened the door and she stepped into a darkness that was so complete so palpably dense that she instantly relived the moment when her flash failed during a night dive in a massive undersea grotto called the sultans cave wait a minute she whispered ive got to let my eyes adjust theres no light for them to adjust to nelson said here he passed her a pair of surgical gloves and then a slim penlight which cast a narrow but surprisingly potent beam just keep it low away from our faces hey i dive for a living remember theres no verbing eighty feet down so we live and die by using our lights the right way sorry sorry i took so long too the security system in this place turned out to be rather sophisticated are you sure its deactivated thats the weird thing the system wasnt on in the one of the keys on my inside in two seconds iin the air here to grar t ey moved carefully from the foyer to devines parlor laura keeping her flash fixed on the floor while nelson swept his beam along the walls what are we looking for laura asked shelves bookcases drawers a wall safethat sort of thing if this devine is the meticulous little mouse you describe id be amazed if he doesnt have records of whatever hes into i wish i felt comfortable turning on a light but frankly thats a risk im not willing to take except as a last resort if our divine friend happens to return even a sliver of light through a window could warn him and cost us escape time bernard pulled a tool from his kit popped open the drawer of devines imitation chippendale desk and rifled quickly through its contents scanning sheets thencarefully replacing them pull every book off those shelves laura carefully he said moti orang to one wall check to be sure each is what the binding says it is and then set it right back where it was it took twenty minutes to finish with the room and another ten to search the small chapel adjacent to it this is tougher than i thought it was going to be laura said as they picked their way through the rear door of the chapel into the casket room it gets even more difficult if the proprietor of the establishment walks in on us laura squinted trying to adjust her vision to the new room which was smaller and if possible even darker than the others there seemed to be four or five caskets displayed on stands of various heights the walls were overhung with maroon velvet drapes which emitted a mustiness competitive in intensity with the formalin laura attempted to ignore the odors by breathing through her mouth as she scanned the floor trying to get some sense of the space she stepped forward bumping against one of the caskets she put her hand out to steady herself and set it down on the waxen face of a man laura gasped recoiling against another casket as her penlight clattered to the floor immediately nelsons flash sought her out that casket she struggled to clear the sudden hoarseness from her throat theres a body in there bernard played his light down her arm past her pointing finger into an ornate velvetlined coffin and finally onto the face of a man laura gasped thats donald devine the mortician his hands resting peacefully on his vest stared sightlessly upward in the center of his forehead just above his wirerimmed spectacles and just below his pomaded hairline was a single small bullet hole surrounded by a halo of dried blood less than a day id guess bernard murmured touching the back of his hand to devines pallid cheek and then halting the corpses arm which seemed stiff and plastic but im really not very good at that sort of stuff i can tell you for certain that he didnt do this to himself this is horrible maybe but it tells me that you were right your friend here was into something shady and whatever it was he was obviously in over his head should we keep searching i doubt well find anything that whoever made this little hole didnt find but you never can tell besides with the danger of mr devine walking in on us lessened considerably i think we might even risk turning lights on as we go if you think its all right do you mind if we skip this room though not at all i you know i think he lived upstairs maybe it would be worth looking there maybe it would at that bernard nelson said the staircase to devines apartment was off the back hallway the apartment itself consisted of an eatin kitchen a tv room and two bedrooms one of which was a small museum overfilled with a startling collection of medieval weapons and armor including maceandchains broadswords crossbows lances daggers and several helmets the mouse that roared nelson mused this place is truly creepy laura said how about i do the bedroom and you do camelot just be sure there are no unshuttered windows before you turn on any lights nelson cautioned check behind the drapes and pictures and under any throw rugs mark my words this guy kept detailed records of whatever he was into and he kept them in a safe say you wouldnt have an extra cigar on you by any chance sorry but listen if we find the safe you predict ill buy you onewhatever kind you want what a sport only one though and only if we find that safe just ten minutes later they did laura was trying to move a large oil paintingsome sort of rural scenewhen she backed against a black spokebacked chair set on a small oriental rug the chair did not budge laura dropped to her knees and lifted the edge of the rug the legs of the chair were bolted through it to the floor between the bolts she felt a small recessed latch releasing the latch she tipped the chair backward the rug and a hinged portion of the oak flooring tilted upward with it the strongbox a foot or so square with a dial lock and heavy metal handle was concealed in the space below bingo she cried mr nelson you are truly a prince of your profession i hope youre still considering that apprenticeship offer of mine he said first examining the lock then rummaging through his medical bag for his stethoscope he spent the next fifteen minutes pressed against the floor listening to the tumblers of donald devines safe theres a gizmo that does this electronically he muttered but im just too damn cheap to invest in it besides half this business is the challenge right laura sat on the dead mans bed trying to draw some sort of connection between devine and the drug dealers who had killed not only her brother but almost certainly roger anseu as well ansell and devine two men violently dead on the same day and both of them connected in some way to her she shuddered at the thought easy nelson was urging easy easy and voila he grasped the handle and slowly swung it down ninety degrees at the moment he pulled the small door open they heard the sound of voices beneath the window quick the lights bernard gathered up what he could from the safe as laura shut off first the bedroom light and then the others upstairs stygian darkness returned to the apartment as the front door was unlocked and opened to the stairs nelson whispered up here were trapped they felt their way to the stairs and tiptoed down reaching the firstfloor rear hallway just as the light snapped on in the front parlor reflexively nelson opened what appeared to be the basement door the two of them stepped onto the staircase beyond it and pulled the door closed save for a sliver of light beneath the base of the door they were once again enveloped in blackness they huddled on the staircase laura midway down and bernard near the door listening as what sounded like two men moved toward them can you hear what theyre saying she whispered one of thems furious because the other didnt get devines records before he killed him the other wants some sort of apology do you have your gun what do you think what are they saying now i think one of thems headed upstairs the other one may be coming here youd better move down a few more stairs in fact go all the way to the bottom if he opens this door im going to need some room to help him make a rapid descent just be careful its pitchblack down here i cant see a thing shhhh from upstairs they heard one of the men shout something ill be right up the second voice called back from just outside the basement door im sorry boss they heard him say i didnt understand what you wanted me to do honest i didnt several minutes passed laura remained motionless in the darkness on the bottom basement step above her she could faintly discern the bulky silhouette of bernard nelson pressed against the door whats happening she whispered they may be leaving or looking for us i cant tell not another sound until im certain theyre gone his voice dropped off suddenly laura could hear muffled footsteps and voices then she saw shadows moving in the thin slit of light beneath the door her heart skipped as a shoe scuffed against the wood bernard nelson remained still finally after what seemed an eterrity the footsteps began to recede to another part of the house fifteen silent minutes went by the light beyond the door was turned off another fifteen minutes passed then still another finally laura could stand the tension no longer whats going on she asked beats me i think theyre gone she worked her way up several steps do you want to risk opening the door i think so first see if you can find a light down there maybe theres a way we can get out of here without going through the house laura backed down the stairs and felt along the wall until she found a switch after an hour of near total darkness the bright overhead fluorescent lights were blinding bernard nelson made his way down to her as laura blinked and rubbed her eyes into focus then the two of them stood side by side staring incredulously at the space in which they had been hiding the room was perhaps fifteen feet square painted gleaming white and equipped with a stretcher a cardiac monitor and other sophisticatedlooking medical equipment one wall was filled with shelves of linens bandages medications and solutions against the wall opposite the stretcher were a small desk and chair and hanging just over the desk a set of metal and leather limb restraints well ill be damned nelson muttered its like an intensive care unit not like one child it is one they walked about the room looking over the equipment and checking in the wastebasket and desk drawer im no doctor nelson said but this stuff looks like stateoftheart to me i agree look at this medication there must be fifty different drugs here this place frightens me id be worried if it didnt nelson held up the folders and ledger he had taken from devines safe maybe these will give us a clue from what i could tell our friendly visitors found the safe so theres no sense going back up there whether theyre upstairs or outside watching the house i dont know but i vote we try to get these out of here are you game the sooner we get out of here the better they turned out the lights tiptoed back up the stairs and then ever so slowly opened the door you sure therere no messages for me najarian eric najarian no you dont understand im not registered at the hotel laura enders is but she might have left a look forget it when she does get in just leave her a message that eric called and that ill call back later whats eric na the desk clerk had hung up ird eiver back in place and wan eric sn p the recap dered across the virtually deserted street he was in one of the seedier areas of aflston just half a block from the sproul court address thatanna delacroix had written down for him for nearly two hours he had been calling laura both at her hotel and at his apartment from what he could determine she had phoned him at the hospital at least twice during the day but had left no message other than that she had called he was beginning to worry but not unduly so it was only a quarter of ten he would finish his business with anna elacroix and then go straight to the carlisle a city within the city allstons crowded tenements and triplexes were home to many college students as well as to ethnic pockets of vietnamese thais ifispapics haitians pakistanis and firstgeneration migrants from various eastern european countries sproul court itself was a dingy poorly lit deadend side street filled with wooden threestorystructures most of which had porches off the second and thirdstory flats all of the buildings it seemed had a shop or store of some sort on the street level the posters in the windows of the businesses suggested that the main clientele in the area was black with some time to spare eric wandered the length of the street past the grocerette and the package store craissous tailor shop and the treasure island used clothing boutique there was little that was quaint about the decaying buildings sooty windows and trashcluttered alleyways and he found it difficult to connect the street in any way with the enigmatic exquisitely beautiful woman he was to meet there still he felt tense and excited if she was true to her word anna delacroix would provide the proof he could use along with the fruits of his library investigation to convince some of the powers at the hospitaland even more importantly to convince reed marshallf the validity of his tetrodotoxin theory he would then gain some allies and his efforts could shift from determining whether such poisoning was possible to why it had happened and how although he had not yet found a specific description of the cardiographic pattern in tetrodotoxin oxin poisoning he had catalogued a number of accounts of the clinical presentation all of which included the classic signs of rapidly progressive heart failure shortness of breath intractable coughing cyanosis first of the lips and fingertips then later of the face hands and feet frothy fluid building in the chest and weg into the throat air hunger leading to panic leading to even worse air hunger and finally somnolence loss of consciousness and death dr eric over here anna delacroix was standing in the shadow of a storefront not far from one of the few lampposts on the street she was wearing a wide floppybrimmed hat and had a bandanna of some sort tied loosely about her neck did you believe id come he asked of course i did you have doubts and you are desperate to have those doubts assuaged can you assuage them not i but there is a man inside this store who has some things to say that you will find most interesting she gestured at the window behind her which was filled with the trappings of a hardware or dry goods store the uneven handpainted letters on the glass said simply benets beyond the display a dark shade was drawn i had to convince him that you would never divulge his name to anyone she went on you will honor that pledge of course good because as you will see any indiscretion could cost either him or me our lives she looked at eric gravely anna led him into the alley knocked once on a side door to the shop and entered inside seated on a stool was a gaunt willowy man with silvering hair and a face that spoke of illness or perhaps merely of a life of too much pain he shook erics hand with no firmness anna introduced him as titus mennilard her mothers brother and once the proprietor of benets which was now run by his family titus mumbled a greeting his speech was slow and thick and his accent which eric assumed was haitian was so dense that eric had to concentrate to understand the mans words benets was a cluttered melange of tools fabric electrical supplies canned goods and grain it was illuminated by a single lowwattage bulb suspended beneath a metal reflector whether intended or not the effect of the subdued lighting the drawn shade and the hushed tones was dramatic and mysterious you wanted proof of your suspicions anna said well my uncle here is that proof look into his eyes as you listen to us and you wig know that what we share with you is the truth once he was the most vigorous and vibrant of mena musician and a poet a leader in our community now he is a shell our troubles began several years ago when word began spreading around our community of the arrival here from haiti of a most powerful houngana priest with the power and knowledge of vodoun the houngan we were told was to be known only as mr dunn at the mention of the name titus memmilard seemed to stiffen evil and pain he said the houngan brought evil and pain anna patted the mans hand what he brought she said was the coup poudre the magical powder eric said exactly anna looked impressed with his knowledge death powder mystical powder take your pick in haiti the coup poudre is the sword of the houngans there are government courts and officials but the houngans are the real judges and a living death is their only punishment this rogue priest this mr dunn is known only to the group of thugs with whom he has surrounded himself he is a criminal in every sense of the worda mobster it is rumored that in haiti he was one of the tnton macoutes franqois duvahers secret police he preys on peoples weaknesses and superstitions he extorts money from our businesses and sells narcotics to our children two years ago after several attempts to enlist the aid of the police my uncle attempted to organize the merchants to fight back one of dunns collection men was beaten up another was robbed of his stash of drugs before he could sell them it came from mr dunn that my uncle was to be made an examplethat he had been marked for living death his family tried to protect him but several of dunns men came with guns and took him away uncle are you able to tell this doctor what happened next eric turned to the old man please try he urged i received the coup poudre from the evil one himself titus said weakly clearing phlegm from his throat across my mouth and under my arms he demonstrated by drawing his hand across the areas eric remembered reading in several sources that absorption of tetrodotoxin was nearly as rapid and complete through the skin as through the gastrointestinal system did you see the mans face he asked it was the face of hell eric looked to anna who shrugged and shook her head perhaps a mask she said go on uncle they tied me down but soon they cut me free there was no need to bind me for i could no longer move you remember all of this some things he remembers clearly some not at all anna explained what we do know is that two days later this man who now sits before you was found lying on a bed in this very room cold and quite dead his eyes were taped shut a note by his body warned against moving him or calling for medical help over the following two days though he was watched constantly not once did anyone see him take so much as a single breath my wife mourned over me titus said hoarsely i could hear her and feel her hand when she brushed it over my face you were awake eric asked i was eric saw himself staring down at lauras brother as he pronounced the man dead and felt a painful queasiness churn in his gut after those two days dunns men came again anna said and once again they dragged my uncle away a day later he was found wandering down an alleyway near here retarded in mind and body and quite incapable of caring for himself when he could tell us he claimed that his captors had forced some sort of powder into his mouth and then injected something into his arm finally they beat him with their fists and set him free his senses have returned somewhat over these years but he remains a man without a soul and no one outside his family will have anything to do with him thats very sad eric murmured and very terming he had not the least doubt that what he was hearing was true he gazed across at the broken old man and then reached out and held one bony hand in his i am very sorry for what has befallen you sir he said and i am very grateful that you would share your story with me as you might guess anna said my uncle served the houngans purpose well the beast has met little resistance since then the merchants pay and the children buy his drugs and we have no more idea who he is now than we did when he first appeared on the scene at once fascinated and fearful eric tried to create a scenario whereby scott enders and loretta leone would have been intentionally poisoned both were street people perhaps they had seen something or learned of something that threatened the priest and his operation anna is there anything i can do he asked anything at all perhaps she said after thinking over his request perhaps there is dunns payment demands have been increasing steadily once again there is a small group who is willing to stand up to him if they can i am part of that group eric we have begun meetingsecretly to try and form a plan but we are still frightenedvery frightened dunn is as ruthless and sadistic as a man can be he has many spies and informants and may already know us but we do not know him we have no one to strike at and no support from outside our community and worst of all he has the terror of the coup poudre talk to people eric see if you can get some of your doctor friends or better still someone in the police department interested in this she wrote a number down and handed it to him please be careful and do not return to this store without calling me eric glanced at his watch it was twenty of eleven i need to think about all this anna he said then ill call you whatever you decide to do or not do will be understood she promised uncle you can go upstairs now they waited until titus mennilard had shuffled off and then they left his shop sproul court was deserted and totally silent save for the faint rumble of traffic from the thoroughfare several blocks away do you need a ride anywhere eric asked no thanks i dont live too far from here and i need the air that was a terrifying story your uncle just told i hope you believe it how could i not and i hope you will find a way to help us i sensed in the library that you were the sort of man who might that is the real reason i chose to share this with you anna looked at him in a way that made his mouth go dry i call you he managed at least i can promise you erics words were cut short by a hand clasped tightly over his mouth from behind his head was pulled back and a long razorlike stiletto was set against his throat at virtually the same instant a tall black man pulled anna back by the hair and slipped the broad blade of a hunting knife beneath her chin not a word he ordered not a fucking word or youre both dead erics heart driven by a sudden flood of adrenal e in began pounding mercjlessly the powerful hand across his mouth pulled even more tightly eric felt his lip split then he felt the dagger break skin please he rasped shut up eric sensed blood beginning to trickle down his chest he tried to look over at anna but the hand held him too tightly then without lowering their knives the two men halfdragged halfshoved them several doors down the street to the only storefront on the block that was boarded up iso the man holding anna said in a rich island accent word has it that you are interested in challenging the power of the spirits and their priest and the coup poudre why my beautiful friend perhaps you are about to get that chance in response to a tap from the mans boot the solid wooden door opened and eric and anna delacroix were shoved rudely onto the floor inside not in his worst nightmares had eric conjured a situation more terrifying than the hell he was living through this night he and anna delacroix were gagged their arms and ankles lashed to their chairs in a room heavy with incense and glowing with the flickering light of several dozen candles two decapitated chickens hanging from a rafter dripped blood onto the floor between their feet forcing them to keep their knees spread apart to avoid being soiled around the dingy room hung bones some of them humansizedfluidfilled glass jars containing the bodies of toads and snakes and carelessly tied bunches of what appeared to be dried weeds and wild flowers on two sides of the room surrounded by candles were bizarre altars each featuring a cluster of a dozen or more cheap plastic or ceramic figurinesstatuettes of women and cowboys clowns and madonnas cupids and dogs resting on a dish at the center of each cluster was the head of a recently slaughtered chicken the two men who had captured them at knife point had changed into loose bloodred robes smeared white greasepaint around their eyes and now knelt across from each other hammering out rhythms on broad handhewn drums every two minutes or so they paused to smoke what smelled like hashish from a dualthroated hookah with the gag pulled tightly between his teeth eric had to struggle just to breathe his torn lower lip was throbbing was his right elbow which had slammed against the floor when he was thrown down beside him anna delacroix stared stoically ahead unwilling to give the men the pleasure of seeing her fear initially after the two of them had been secured to their chairs the men had teased hertouching her face and breasts and making lewd remarks after a time though her silent contemptuous glare seemed to spoil their sport ten minutes had elapsed since they were tied down the two men for all their gestures andthreats had done little else and seemed to be biding their timewaiting for something or someone suddenly without any obvious signal they stopped pounding on their drums the taller one stood before them the holy one the voice of the spirits approaches he said i shall remove the bonds around your mouths but only if you promise that not a word will be spoken by either of you unless asked for by the holy one do i have that promise eric nodded but anna continued to stare straight ahead do i the man yelled at her still she would not respond erics gag was removed hers left in place he ran his tongue over the slice in his lip he tested the tightness of the clothesline that was pinning his arms to the chair without help he knew there was not a chance of freeing himself not in a thousand years he began calming himself forcing himself to concentrate on the situation it was a process he had used hundreds of times in the er over the years but there he was always in control the pounding in his ears and the spasms in his belly refused to abate he glanced over at anna she remained quiet but below the fetters on her wrists her fists were tight and bloodless despite his promise of silence eric could not contain his fear please he said please listen to me the tall man stood poised to replace erics gag then he stopped as the door to the back room opened and a man stepped out actually eric realized it was impossible to know for certain the new arrivals gender or for that matter his race he wore a flowing hooded white robe gloves and an intensely frightening fullfaced mask with a deathshead painted on it but even more terrifying than the priests appearance was the large ceramic bowl cradled in his left arm using a heavy wooden pesde he continued to grind down something in the bowl as he glided to a chair facing them and sat eric knew what that bowl contained please eric said rapidly youve got this all wrong please listen to me the tall man looked to the priest for guidance as to whether he should replace the gag almost imperceptibly the deathshead turned once each way the priest continued grinding llook eric said im a doctor shes a student a college student were just trying to learn not to harm anyone you must believe that the tall man glanced at the priest then he faced the two captives and said with unsettling pleasantness and learn you shall he crouched by his drum and the pounding began once again the counterpoint building in loudness and tempo candlelight shimmered off the smiling whiteandblack death mask as the priest stood still working the pestle through the powder in the bowl please eric screamed trying to be heard over the cresc ndo of the drums it please dont do this he looked over at anna the angry scorn in her eyes had now given way to undisguised terror no he screamed as the priest approached her eric watched as a gloved hand dipped into the bowl and withdrew a mound of moistened chalkygray powder anna began to squirm in her chair her eyes widening then as the hand neared her cheek she began thrashing her head wildly about the drums intensified until it seemed as if the room were exploding nooo eric shrieked as the hand laid a broad swatch of powder across one of annas cheeks please no the moment the coup poudre touched her cheek the drums abruptly ceased anna stopped moving the room was silent and still it was as if with the brush of the first grain she had resigned herself to having been poisoned eric wondered if perhaps she knew as he did that struggling now would only speed the absorption of the tetrodotoxin once again the hand dipped this time slowly painting annas other cheek the priest turned away and for the briefest moment eric thought he was to be spared then like the rumble of distant thunder the drums began to build once again the leering deathshead turned back to him the gloved hand extended slowly three fingers coated with powder eric snapped his head from one side to the other screaming at the priest to stop to understand he hurled his chair over backward then twisted onto his side and when he could move in no other way he slammed his head against the floor mindless of his struggling the priest bent over and swabbed the gritty poison across first one cheek and then the other please dont do this eric moaned again and again as his chair was pulled upright please dont the priest knelt and ceremoniously dipped one finger into the pool of blood by erics feet there will be no return for you from this trip the tall man said punctuating each word with a drumbeat the deathshead priest pressed a disk of blood onto the center of erics forehead and then annas then without ever having mid a word he shuffled from the room totally helpless and drained eric tried once again to regain his composure this time he focused on what he had learned of tetrodotoxin and the ways of reducing or reversing its toxicity depending on the dose they absorbed they still had an hour or two before the effects of the drug began and as much as a day before they would be helpless if they could get free they nlight have a chance get calm he begged himself if you ever needed to be alert and focus in you need to now if you dont youre going to die he turned to anna but before he could speak a broad band of adhesive tape was pulled tightly across his mouth then the cloth that had been used as his gag was pulled over his eyes and tied briefly for perhaps twenty minutes or half an hour he sat that way the only sound he heard was annas labored breathing are we alone have we been left to die carefully he began once again to test the bonds on his arms dont bother man the tall man mid from nearby youre out of here now with that erics hands were cut free and relied behind his back then his ankle ropes were severed and he was pulled roughly to his feet nod goodbye to your foxy friend mr doctor were not too interested in what happens to you anymore but weve got some high ol times in store for her yes sir some high oltimes the two men dragged him out the back way tied his ankles together again checked to be sure his pockets were empty and then shoved him onto the metal floor of a van that smelled as if it had been used for hauling rotten fish for the next halfhour or more they drove initially eric tried to make some sense of the turns and straightaways but he quickly gave up at last the truck jounced onto what seemed to be a dirt road and stopped its engine still running eric was pulled from the back and thrown to the ground the bonds on his ankles were cut but his gag and blindfold were left on and his hands left tied behind his back just stand right there man listen carefully and dont move theres a nice sharp knife lying on the ground about four feet away from you i wont tell you where wait until you cant hear this truck engine no more and then go for it could use that knife to cut your throat mr bigshot doctor but were not to you know why because man we really dont give a shit about you weve got the one we want shes business youre sport and whether you make it or you dont the disbe eyers get the message we want to send he will eric heard the two men laughing as they jumped into the van it sprayed sand and gravel on him as it roared away moments later the night was silent as a tomb working blind eric spent what seemed an eternity finding the small folding knife and longer still positioning it to saw through the clothesline binding his wrists during the process he cut himself at least half a dozen times finally he shook his arms free he ripped the blindfold from his eyes and the tape from his mouth and used them to stem some of the bleeding from his hands and wrists he was on a dark wooded dirt road with no sign of a house in any direction the cool earlymorning air smelled and tasted like country eric felt himself still on the edge of panic but he was steadied a bit by the realization that at least he was no longer helpless if the only drug on his face was tetrodotoxin someone somewhere had to know of a way to blunt or negate its effect the key for him now was clear thinking and aggressive action he knew that a paved road was not far off and he was fairly sure of the direction the van had taken to increase his circulation too much by running he strode quickly that way in less than five minutes he was walking down a deserted twolane country highway he sensed that he was north of the city but it was only a guess through some trees around a curve in the road he could make out a dim light and a structure of some sort he cut across the woods and found himself standing beside a small mobile station which was darkened for the night but obviously in current use there was no sign on the building that gave even a clue as to where he was eric scanned the narrow buildings he peered in the window looking for a metal desk he spied something he needed even more at that moment envelope above the desk an stp wall clock told him that it was perhaps two hours had passed since he and anna were poisoned he felt desperate to get the death powder off his face in the weeds alongside the building he found a brick as he stood poised before the window he noticed the thin metallic strip of a security system it was just as well he thought with any luck he could get at the envelope and summon the police with the same maneuver he stepped back a pace and hurled the back with all his strength the spectacular implosion of glass was accompanied instantly by the wailing of a siren eric kicked away a few large shards and stepped into the office he grabbed the envelope and hurried to the restroom trying to ignore the bloody apparition in the mirror he carefully used the small knife to scrape as much of the powder as possible from his cheek into the envelope when he felt certain that ivor blunt could make an identification from a fraction of what he had saved he scrubbed his face with soap rinsed it and then scrubbed it again still with his eyes lost in dark hollows and his lower lip split and stiff with clotted blood he looked very much like precisely what he was at that momenta man who was dying the pay phone behind the desk required a quarter even to get a dial tone if the wailing alarm wasnt somehow connected to the police eric knew there was no telling how much time he would lose waiting for someone to respond he searched the top of the desk for a coin but succeeded only in learning from several bills that he was in bob kuypers country mobile in waylanda rural community twenty miles or so west of boston he huddled over the desk using his knife to work on the lock okay asshole get on the floor the harsh voice from not ten feet away drove erics heart into his throat his service revolver leveled a rugged young officer stepped through the shattered window and motioned eric away from the desk behind the policeman eric could see a second officer undoubtedly this mans backup wait officer please im not a thief im a doctor and shut the fuck up and get face down the man younger than eric seemed quite tough but also a bit nervous eric knelt in a spot away from the broken glass and then prostrated himself on the oily floor the policeman circled him warily finally positioning himself against a wall safe from any attack from behind please listen to me eric begged its a matter of life and death believe me it is put your hands behind you youve got to do it eric did as he was ordered the policeman knelt roughly against the small of his back and expertly snapped a pair of handcuffs into place pain from the knife cuts seared up erics arms hes cuffed sarge the man called out keep him there the other man responded im going to check around out here the policeman stood up okay then he said im officer carney thats sergeant clarkson out there youre under arrest you have the right to remain silent please please eric begged i know all that i waive all my rights youve got to listen to me sit up slowly eric did as he was told will you listen to me now he asked the young policeman nodded for the next three minutes he listened without saying a word then he helped eric to his feet and crunched across the shattered glass to what was once the plateglass window hey sarge he called out i think youd better get on in here west valley regional hospital was a tiny fairly new facility located about five miles from the station house where eric had been taken and booked for breaking and entering plus malicious mischief it was am with officer carney keeping watch a nurse was bandaging the lacerations on erics wrists two of which had required suturing the blearyeyed physician on duty was a moonlighter a senior surgical resident from worcester named jennifer farrell trying mentally to place himself in her position eric had dropped a few names from her training program and then cautiously and calmly recounted the events of the evening using enough jargon to convince her that he was in fact a physician finally he showed her the envelope of powder and begged her to contact white memorial for verification of his identity and to get the home phone number of dr ivor blunt the nurse had just finished her work when sergeant clarkson and jennifer farrell reentered the room apparently you are who you say you are clarkson said thats a relief tell us again what you want us to do now well first of all i want someone to get over to auston and see if they can find anna delacroix thats already being done we called the metropolitan police from the station thank you now id like to call dr blunt and have him meet us at white memorial who is he again hes a toxicologist and probably the only one in the city who has the equipment and knowhow to identify this poison do you agree with that doc clarkson asked the resident dr farrell shrugged i know of dr blunt she said and i know that we cant do a thing with this powder here how does our friend here seem to you right now jennifer farrer rechecked erics eyes heart lungs and blood pressure no problem she said dr najarian are you sure you dont want me to sew that lip of yours im sure eric said unable to keep impatience from his voice okay clarkson said after some thought dr farrell do you have a phone with a second extension she nodded dr najarian im going to listen while you talk to this dr blunt if it sounds on the upand up ill drive you in to white memorial just remember youre still under arrest any crazy stuff and youll be back on the floor i understand ivor blunt was outraged at the early hour eric quickly found himself squirming in his seat as the crusty toxicologist questioned his every statement let me get this straight blunt said you want me to get up shlep into the hospital turn on my equipment and analyze some dust that was put on your cheek during a voodoo ceremony in downtown auston icorreci x najm are you crazy what i am is poisoned dr blunt eric said evenly please youve got to help me doctor try to see it my way you come into my office asking if i can analyze a womans blood for this toxin thats never been found in massachusetts then not twentyfour hours later youre calling me from some podunk hospital claiming to have been poisoned with the stuff thats right sir you sick now nof yet no if these men wanted you dead why didnt they just put a bullet between your eyes be i lieve they wanted to make a point to the people theyve been terrorizing eric said errorizink with tetrodotoxin thats right there was a prolonged silence during which eric rattled off what prayers he knew i think youre crazy ivor blunt said finally but since youve already got me wide awake and since ill never get back to sleep over my wifes snoring im going to do what you want thank you eric sighed thank you sir we can be at your lab in fortyfive minutes take your time bring me your powder and four redtop and one greentop tubes of blood ill have them drawn here fine do you have a personal psychiatrist on the staff no no i dont thats too bad ivor blunt said dont like this bernard laura said listening as erics apartment phone rang a ninth then a tenth time i dont like this at all for nearly three hours they had sat in bernard nelsons office drinking coffee sorting through the material they had brought with them from the gates of heaven and trying to locate eric there was a message from him at the carlisle which had come in some time around ten but since then nothing five calls to his apartment and one to the hospital had gotten them nowhere the nervous energy generated by their breakin at the funeral home and their grisly discoveries was wearing off and laura was beginning to feel desperate for some sleep bernard nelson was bearing up even less well and had already taken a prolonged nap on his couch they had decided at least for the night that she should steer clear of her hotel if someone had tried to run her down there was good reason to avoid anyplace she might be expected to be their escape through a back door of the mortuary had seemed unnoticed but still bernard had driven around for nearly an hour making absolutely certain no one was following them finally they parked in the alley behind his building and entered through the basement only when they were in his office with the curtains drawn did they begin to examine what they had gathered from donald devines safe before they did however bernard placed a brief anonymous call to the boston police suggesting that someone stop by the gates of heaven where could he be laura asked concern shadowing her face as she set the receiver down where did you say his parents lived watertown maybe he went home and stayed over why wouldnt he have left the number at my hotel or at least have called back i dont know laura nelson rubbed at his eyes listen i hope you dont misunderstand what im about to say i know you think a great deal of eric and i suspect from what youve told me that those feelings are not misplaced but people are not always what they seem to be you havent known him that long there are any number of things he could be into that he hasnt let you in on maybe laura thought for a moment and then added but i dont think so i think we should go over to his apartment bernard nelson massaged the back of his neck and once again stretched out on the couch laura a couple of days ago in east boston some heavies nearly tore the two of you apart yesterday afternoon someone probably tried to kill you theres every reason to believe that whoever they are theyre watching his place as well as yours if theyve already got him the best thing we could do is wait until they contact us its you and your brothers tape theyre after not him if they havent got him well then the best thing we can do is wait anyhow he forced a smile besides one breakin a night is my limit i have a key bernard looked up at her and softened are you sure his phones working the operator says it is well i still think were better off getting a couple of hours sleep and at least waiting until its light its just too dangerous really it is trust me on that im very worried about him i know you are listen the couch in my waiting rooms a foldout give me just a couple of hours oh okay what about all of this she asked gesturing to the piles of notes receipts and ledgers laura our late friend generated and squirreled away more paperwork than the department of defense if we couldnt makeany sense of this stuff at two am our chances are even less at three theres something buried in there thats going to shed some light on the man and his basement im certain of that but frankly at this point i can barely remember my own name i understand laura said good in that case you remain the leading candidate to become my apprentice bernard before you sleep i want to tell you again how grateful i am for what youve done cigars woman talk in terms i can relate to she smiled i havent forgotten listen why dont you use the foldout ill stay up for a while longer going through this stuff then ill try eric one more time if we havent connected with him by say six or seven we can try his place good enough groaning with the effort bernard nelson pushed himself up grabbed a pair of old army blankets from his closet tossed one on the couch and then lumbered into the waiting room with the other in minutes laura heard the sonorous breathing of exhausted sleep then with a sip of cold stale coffee she settled in behind the desk bernard had estimated that in their haste to get out of donald devines bedroom he had gotten perhaps half the contents of the safe before they left the mortuary he had slipped back to the upstairs apartment and verified that as they suspected whatever they had left behind had been taken and the apartment ransacked undoubtedly the police would put robbery at the head of their list of motives of course there was still the intensivecare room to explain away laura set aside the folder of correspondence and contracts and concentrated on two ledgers one of them dating back six years and replete with names addresses payments and various abbreviations seemed to be a record of the considerable number of clients devine had tended to the other held closed with a heavy rubber band was also a list of names and abbreviations however between the last page and cover this one was stuffed with receipts fromvarious gas stationsat least a hundred of them and possibly many more than that laura set the pile in front of her made some room and one at a time smoothed each one out arranging them by date at with the first light of day mtering through the curtains laura could no longer keep her eyes open without even trying to make sense of what she had found she shuffled to the couch and was asleep almost as her head touched the pillow resting on the desk was a calculator a pad scribbled with figures and the rand mcnally adas she had extracted from bernard nelsons eclectic collection of novels and reference volumes the atlas was open to a map of the mountain states tucked in the cleft between pages was the pencil she had used to circle a small sparsely populated area in southeast utah n barred from the spectrophotometry lab by ivor blunt eric paced about the pathology departments waiting room from time to time he swore his heart had skipped beats at other times a breath or two seemed to be heavier than normal he flexed his fingers and rubbed his hands wondering if the tingling in them was the first sign of progressive neurotoxicity or merely the result of his lacerations the sergeant from wayland had turned out to be something of a godsend after driving eric to white memorial and getting a positive recommendation on him from the head of hospital security clarkson had decided to void the criminal charges against him in exchange eric gladly promised to pay the mobile station owner for repairs to his window and security system after clarkson left for wayland eric had stopped by the emergency room for a confidential talk with the senior resident assigned to reed marshalls shifts as he rechecked erics vital signs and physical exam the bewildered resident did his best to appear to understand what had happened but eric knew he was being patronized nor was that reaction surprising until ivor blunt confirmed the identity of the teotoxin eric was resigned to being very much on his own he sat on the arm of a chair and thumbed through a dogeared copy of people like grotesque neon the leering deathshead face glowed in his mind extortion murder narcotics preying on the weak and superstitiousthe man or woman behind that mask was a monster he wondered where anna delacroix was what horrors she was enduringif in fact she was still alive his thoughts were interrupted by voices and a commotion of some sort in the hallway outside the waiting room no dammit he heard a man say you all stay out here well handle this when we have something to say to you well say it you have no right a womans shrill voice cried we have every right now just stay back here before i bust you for interfering the glass door to the waiting room was pulled open and two metropolitan district policemen entered dr najarian one of them asked he was a thin black man with a creased forehead and kind eyes thats right have you found out anything about anna the policeman whose name tag identified him as patrolman medeiros flipped a note pad open behind him the other officer younger and huskier than medeiros turned as several people pressed against the door the natives are restless tony he said goddam cannibals medeiros muttered brian just dont let em in here who are they eric asked medeiros looked up at him reporters he said a couple of them were at the station when the call came in about this delacroix woman and your voodoo ceremony one of them recognized your name mine thats right apparently the herald is about to hit the streets with an article about you and a missing body of some sort oh jesus eric said remembering the stern faces of the selection committee as they discussed the hospitals campaign against negative publicity what about anna twelve sproul court in allston that the address of the store you went to thats right benets its like a hardware store you sure this manthis titus memmilardwas the owner of course im sure he said it and his niece said it eric felt confusion and a tearing emptiness beginning to set in well doctor number twelve sproul court is a hardware store named benets all right but the benets who live upstairs and who we woke up and scared half to death have owned that store for more than five years and theyve never even heard of anyone named titus memmilardor for that matter anna delacroix either thats thats impossible but even as he said the words eric knew he was hearing the truth and that other place medeiros went on wearily glancing at his notes the place three doors down where you claim you and this delacroix woman were taken at knife point and allegedly poisoned yes eric felt ill you said it was a boardedup empty store that had been turned into some sort of voodoo temple thats right well doctor i dont know how to tell you this but therere no boardedup stores on that whole street on the first floor of the building three doors down is a candle shop are you sure you were on sproul court eric could tell now by the way the two officers were looking at him that they felt certain he was quite mad oh we were on sproul all right medeiros said were you of course i was officer contrary to what youre thinking im not crazy everything happened exactly the way i said it did did you go inside the candle shop no after what we encountered down the street we werent too excited about trying to get someone to let us in but theres a whole window filled with candles and a bunch of other little knickknacks and we could see inside perfectly well not a headless chicken in sight doc not one eric sank back in his chair desperately trying to sort out what he was hearing this is insane he said now there were in agreement what about the woman what about her officer medeiros youve got to believe me i met anna delacroix in the county medical library shes a grad student at bu she asked me to meet her on sproul court and we were abducted by two men at knife point and poisoned in a very frightening ritual you know what we think doc think you were pledging some sort of fraternity or club and the whole thing got carried away thats ridiculous you take any drugs tonight only the one that was put on my skin theres a toxicologist in there right now after you hear what he has to say maybe youll believe me as if on cue the door to the laboratory slammed open and ivor blunt stalked into the room his expression a strange mix of anger and bemusement talcum powder he said the two officers exchanged smiles eric could not even speak plus a little dirt a little lint and a smidgen of oil of some sort blunt went on maybe olive oil dr najarian you are one crazy son of a bitch and at this moment i wish you nothing but ill dont you see eric pleaded looking from one of the men to the next the whole thing was a setup to discredit meto make you all thinkexactly what youre thinking im telling you it all happened just like i said it did im going home blunt said if you get poisoned again please dont call he stormed back into his lab i dont think he believes you officer medeiros said in pointed understatement dr najarian youve caused a lot of people a lot of trouble tonight eric couldnt remember the last time he had broken down and cried but he knew that if he tried to speak that was precisely what would happen he had been hadmaneuvered step by step by anna delacroix into an abyss of humiliation and discreditation from which he would never recover he bit at his swollen lower lip and slowed his breathing until it seemed safe to stand and confront the policemen listen he said my lip these cuts on my wristim not making these up hey split lips and slashed wrists we see all the time we dont doubt for a moment that youve gotten yourself messed up in something tonight but were just as certain that something isnt what youve been telling us then what medeiros shrugged drugs women some other kind of sex doc look were really not bad guys and we do have feelings but were also cops we listened to you we checked your story out and we found nothing nothing believe me you are far from the first m d weve dealt with who got himself into a jam shit just a few months ago there was that guy from your emergency room who got arrested for i know i know but this is not like that believe me it isnt doc the people upstairs in the er tell me youre a damn good doctorone of the best they say but they also tell me youve been pushing yourself real hard lately now i dont know you but until something comes along to convince me otherwise i have to think you got big problems and that maybe you ought to get some help before you get hurt any worse than you already are i dont need any help except to find someone who can recognize the truth when he hears it hey suit yourself you want a ride home no thank you i can manageh shit what whoever did tus to me took my keys my wallet everything i cant even get into my own place anyone else got a set yes but i dont know where she is in fact if you want to know the truth with everything thats happened to me im getting damn concerned about her i may need your help in finding her but i cant do a thing until i get into my apartment medeiros looked athis partner do you think we should help him out the other man shrugged and then nodded we dont like people to know this but we got ways of getting into places eiros said come on and as for your girl he added unless you have evidence of foul play wed suggest you wait fortyeight hours before filing a report in your case better make that seventytwo hours he put his hand on erics shoulder and guided him through the door in the hallway five reporters crowded up to them one of them begging eric to wait until her camera crew arrived shoved the microphone of a portable recorder in his face all of them were firing questions doc tell us about the voodoo priest are you dying how does it feel who is this mystery woman why isnt she registered as a student at bu what did the analysis of the poison show are you going to be hospitalized do you want to talk to them medeiros whispered eric shook his head out of the way the policeman ordered brian run interference hey be fair someone yelled doc tell us about the missing bodythe one who got autopsied alive what is it with this hospital anyhow another reporter asked first that weirdo doc dealing drugs for sex now this with eric between them the two officers pushed past the pack and hurried down the corridor a minute later eric was in the back seat of their cruiser i can get into the building he said my downstairs neighbor keeps a set of keys hidden in back for his various women to use we love hearing that sort of thing the officer named brian said listen thanks for doing this for me it seemed like you were having a bad night medeiros responded eric almost managed a smile he knew that his careerat least at white memorialwas to all intents and purposes over and if as he suspected his neararrest was reported to the board of registration and discipline in medicine his career as a physician might be in jeopardy as well anna delacroix had certainly served her masterswhoever they were with distinction they entered erics building from the alley and went up the back stairs officer tony medeiros knelt by the door examining the lock this should be nothing more than a credit card job he said he tested the knob which turned easily it appears you forgot to lock up doc he said pushing the door open mcgruff the crime dog would be very upset with instantly the three of them tensed through the doorway they could see that the apartment was in shambles medeiros and his partner loosened the holster guards of their service revolvers as they stepped inside drawers had been pulled out and thrown on the floor book cartons were spilled open papers strewn about a lamp was smashed they made their way through the place checking erics closets which had been treated as rudely as the rest of the apartment then in the kitchen sink they found verdi the parrot was dead itt neck apparently snapped at the sight of the bird eric moaned and sank onto a chair his face buried in his hands he was now beyond tears any idea who might have done this medeiros asked or why or for that matter how they got in theres no sign of a breakin anyplace they took my keys i told you that eric said without lifting his face hey ibm the other officer called out just then im down here in the bathroom you ought to come down here i think i may have just found an explanation for everything with eric close behind the policeman hurried down the hall brian stood to one side of the bathroom his arms folded covering the sink was erics oval bedroom wall mirror on top of it were a razor blade straw and tiny spoon several thin lines of white powder were laid out in a row and there was the suggestion that several more in the row had been already ured on the toilet seat was a plastic bag containing what eric suspected was at least a thousand dollars worth of cocaine if he felt any shock at that moment it was at the realization that he was not the least surprised whoever had pulled anna delacroixs strings did not want him deadthey wanted him publicly and personally destroyed drugs can make people do some pretty bad pretty weird things tony medeiros mused as if he were speaking to a nineyearold even if those people happen to be doctors believe me you shoulda just said no he reached back and pulled his handcuffs from his belt without a word eric turned and put his hands behind his back do you really think i trashed my apartment killed my own pet and left this stuff here then came backwith two cops he asked when the manacles were m place there was a numb calm in his voice doc ibm medeiros said the minute we see something like this all we get to do is act someone else gets to do the thinkin brian call this in will you the doc and i will wait in whats left of the living room as he sat on his couch surveying the wreckage of what had once been the simplest most focused of lives eric felt a strange surreal peacefullness settle in whoever had done this to him was frightened and threatenedeither by something eric was about to discover or something he already knew well they had beaten him and broken him down they had terrorized and discredited him but they hadnt killed him and that they vmre going to find was their mistake from far in the back of his mind a melody began to sound at first eric could tell only that it was there but soon he was nodding the tempo to himself and softly humming along he was still immersed in the tune when they led him down the stairs and into the squad car it was the chorus from kris kristoffersons me and bobby mcgee freedoms just another word for nothin left to lose you know mr najarian the two of you are needing to be getting your acts together first you call and leave a message that you called and that you are all right then she calls and leaves a message that she called and that shes all right then you both do the same thing all over again but neither of you leaves a number get it what i am saying yeah eric said picturing the iranian desk clerk slithering along behind the hotel carlisle desk i get it so you would like to leave a number yes eric looked across the corridor of the station four jail at the officer who was waiting to take him to court for his arraignment on charges of possession of a class b controlled substance and possession with intent to sell no he said just tell her i called and that im all right ill call later he hung up and then allowed his hands which had been cuffed in front of him once again to be secured behind his back he winced at the now familiar electric pain that shot up from his wrists and wondered how jennifer farrells suture lines were holding up he also wondered for perhaps the hundredth time where laura was and why she hadnt stayed in her room that might according to the carlisle desk clerk the last call from her had come in about am now it was nearly eleven eric gave silent thanks that at least she had not chosen to sleep at his place and hoped that wherever she was she had spent the intervening hours more pleasantly than he had still the more he thought about things the more certain he became that something had happened to frighten her or atleast alert her to potential danger she had made a point of leaving the message at the carlisle that she was all right but still she would not leave a phone number possibly she recognized the desk clerk as one who would at any given moment be the devoted servant of the highest bidder as it was the man had sounded pretty damn eager to put together some information perhaps eric speculated somebody had gotten to him already perhaps laura had seen one of the men from the docks watching the carlisle or been accosted by someone and escaped now she was probably registered in another hotel wondering where he was eric cursed himself for not being available to her you got a jacket erics guard asked as they approached the front doors of the station no but it looks pretty nice out i dont think ill need one suit yourself i just asked because some of em like to have jackets to pull over their heads pull over their eric never had the chance or the necessity to finish his question two more officers joined them as they pushed through the doors into a mass of bodies microphones and clicking camerasa group at least five times larger than the one at the hospital and many times more jude eric shielded his eyes from the flashbulb assault and tried to ignore the barrage of questions the kindest of which were in thoughtless bad taste suddenly over the din a hoarse highpitched voice called out rapidly to the crowd move aside move aside we have no statement whatsoever to make at this time other than to affirm that this man is innocent of any wrongdoing and win be found so when all of the facts become clear now please give us room and let us pass eric stared over at the source of the voice a rumpled man in an illfitting suit carrying a scuffed briefcase who are you one of the reporters called out who the hell do i look like gandhi the man said im dr yossarians lawyer najarian eric whispered connolly the man said felix connolly you okay im okay why are you doing this i owe a certain private detective a favor connollly whis ered i i understand eric said remembering lauras account of her meeting with bernard nelson and knowing now where she was considering her description of the detective and his office the appearance of the lawyer who owed him a favor was not that surprising he could only hope the man knew what he was doing lauras all right he asked the attorney nodded lets keep names to a minimum just in case he said she had some problems yesterday but shes okay now our mutual friend has her keeping a low profile ill tell you what i know when were alone youll have to go over to the courthouse in the cruiser ill take my car and meet you there he nodded at the battered volkswagen beetle parked directly behind the police car a mercedes might inspire a bit more confidence eric said dont worry felix connolly said looks can be deceiving believe it or not from time to time ive gotten even bigger baddies than you off with a surprising mix of calm bombast candor and legal acumen felix connolly cut a swath for eric through the brier patch of a district court criminal arraignment along the way he succeeded in persuading the assistant district attorney to drop the charge of possession with intent to distribute and the judge to lower by percent the ball recommended by the prosecution finally after the date was set for a hearing to determine probable cause and the case was remanded to the suffolk county superior court connolly rushed eric out of the building past the screeching gaggle of reporters and into his vw nice going eric said as connolly inched through the crowd and into the flow of traffic youre very good at what you do connolly acknowledged the compliment with a nod in case you dont know it he said bernard nelson is too your friend is lucky she found him i still cant believe what shes been through you havent done too badly in that department yourself i guess well i think were past the last of the damn reporters dont bank on it the lawyer said reaching behind erics seat for a newspaper and handing it to him i suspect some of them are following us right now youre big stuff this is the early edition of the herald take a look at it and then ill show you the extra they came out with a few hours ago the early edition contained a fourinch double column bylined story on page dealing essentially with the crusade of one brave doctor to locate the body and tissue specimens of a woman rumored to have been autopsied ahvelexcept for a brief bit of biographical material about eric the story consisted entirely of no comments and absolutely untrues from hospital officials and the medical examiners office a quote from joe silver denied the rumors about the living autopsy and added dr najarian has beenat this hospital for five years and knows better than to speak to the press about any hospital business especially when he has none of the facts as damaging as the early edition was to erics hope of a continued career at white memorial when compared to the extra it was a ringing endorsement zombi doc chases the undead the frontpage article complete with a picture of a dazed eric being led from the pathology office by two policemen would have been at least a nine on any tenpoint scale of sensationalist journalism wherever the truth had eluded the reporter or in certain spots where the facts had not jibed with the rest of the article fabricated pieces had simply been thrown in interviews with ivor blunt the wayland police and several staff members of the hospital painted the picture of a highstrung overworked young man who had recently been turned down for a promotion to associate er director and had turned to cocaine to keep himself going his obsession with the poison tetrodotoxin it was suggested by blunt and others was clearly the result of a cocaineinduced paranoia charles manson move over eric muttered as he scanned the article a sidebar replacing the original article on page resurrected the arrest and subsequent disappearance of craig worrell whom the herald had dubbed sex doc the reporter who eric mused was probably a department chief after this piece of work had not missed the fact that the position zombi doc had once been the leading candidate for was the one sex doc had vacated eric wondered if even hoary white memorial would be able to survive this latest assault on its reputation itll pass connolly said at this point i almost dont care i just really want to see laura thats all are we headed there we most definitely are not like i said there are probably a few reporters and who knows what other manner of vermin following us bernard nelson is worried about your friends safety and take it from someone whos known him for a long time bernard nelson doesnt worry without cause so what do we do well and please dont take this too personally the first thing we ought to do is find someplace for you to shower eric smiled ruefully and buried his face in his hands no offense taken he said i dont know what shape my place is in but i picked up my spare key before they arrested me so at least i can get in there id go up with you connolly said my iou to bernard isnt paid off until i deliver you to your friend with no one following us howre you going to be sure of that connolly smiled enigmatically for right now lets leave that one between me and the bug he said mindless of the chaos in his apartment eric hurried to the bedroom and called bernard nelsons office laura had learned of his arrest from one of the allnews radio stations you made the tv news as well she said i couldnt believe what i was hearing that makes us even i couldnt believe how close you came to getting killed eric did connolly tell you about donald devine he did yes i think you were crazy to take such a chance you dont really he said no i dont really i just wish i had been in the crazy place you were instead of the crazy place i was i want to hear all about it has the lawyer told you to be careful coming here me what it is great because eric something very weird is going on and donald devine isi mean wasright in the middle of it what do you mean well id rather tell you all the details when i see you but one of the ledgers we took from his safe has a long list of clients listed only by initials and dates after each set of initials there are several other abbreviations and names yes weve been able to piece together that shortly after each date devin or someone else driving his hearse from boston to somewhere in southern utah dozens of trips i really want to see that book you will and eric theres more the last entry in the book was never completed its just a date and the initials ll ll eric its the date when reed marshall pronounced that woman dead loretta leone devine already had her initials in his book it appears so laura did you check the date in february when theres an entry for that date too she cut in the initials are pt well figure out what that means eric said excitedly hold tight ill be there soon im glad youre okay eric said goodbye and gently replaced the receiver sounds like some things are beginning to happen the lawyer observed they are that eric said hopefully mr connoley by the time were done there are going to be some people at white memorial who will be in need of your services at least as much as i was i dont know whats going on yet but what they did to laura yesterday and to me last night suggests that were jabbing at an exposed nerve between what ive learned and what laura and your friend bernard have got i think we may already have a lot of the pieces and somewhere out there is the glue that will help us put those pieces together felix connolly pulled a small silver flask from his suitcoat pocket and unscrewed the top in that case my man he said i drink to glue rocky dinucci slipped his hand into the pocket of his tattered oilstained chinos and assured himself that nothing had happened to the sixteen dollars he had been paid for sweeping out two warehouses and emptying barrels along the east boston docks he was headed for stellas package store where he planned to treat himselfto some decent zinfandel a couple of hardboiled eggs and maybe even his favorite a prosciutto and genoa sub with the works rocky was being especially careful knowing that as often as not his money seemed to find a way to disappear before he could spend it once a promising middleweight dinucci had absorbed far too many punches over the years and had done further damage to his nervous system with cheap wine still he prided himself on being a good joe who never done nobody no harm and he delighted in showing anyone who would look the cracked photographic proof that he had once been a sparring partner of middleweight champ carmen basflio rocky spent the cold months in any of a number of shelters around the city but for most of the year he lived in a makeshift shanty of wood cardboard and sheet metal tucked beneath an elevated stretch of route half a mile from the waterfront he could read decently and even write some and he still knew the fight game well enough to help out at cardarellos gymn when they asked him to and from time to time over the years he had tried to pull his life together to get detoxed and put together enough money to get a yearround place but always within a short time he was back at the bottle and back under route rocky left stellas with two packs of cornels half a dozen boiled eggs two halfgallons of cribram zinfandel and nearly six dollars in cash he gave all of his changeseven eight cents to the small boy who asked to see his photograph then he headed home thinking about how he would spend what remained of his pay and where he could safely hide it until he did the artem day had gone from sunny to gray rocky was sure a storm was on the way he stopped at a vacant lot near the crossover to the highway and poked around until he had picked up several pieces of scrap metal to patch his roof then he crossed the road to his hut that the plywood door was partly open didnt bother him too much older kids were always playing war and u his place for a fort and since he kept the thingssgagt mattered to him in the canvas shoulder sack he carried everywhere getting robbed was never a worry hello rocky called out as he approached anybody in there there was no response he set his package aside and inched open the door with his foot there lying faceup on the pile of old blankets he used as a bed was the body of a man it wasnt until rocky knelt beside the motionless form that he realized it wasnt a corpse the man was merely asleep rocky poured himself a glass of wine settled down on a wooden carton and studied his guest through the dim light he could just make out the details of the mans face it was a face he felt certain he had seen beforea face he knew but from where after nearly an hour and two more glasses of zinfandel rocky cleared his throat then he cleared it more loudly finally he reached out with his foot and nudged the intruder on the thigh the man sighed then woke with great effort he pushed himself to a sitting position with the first good look at the mans pale thin facehis cracked lips caked with dry blood his glazed empty eyesthe name of a fighter flashed into rockys mind it wasnt that this man and jesse kidd looked alike but that they had the same look it was the look of deaththe look on jesse kidds face as he struggled to get up from the canvas during a sixround prelim against rocky one friday night in a smoky newark arena kidd never did make it to his feet and ten minutes after the knockdown he was dead hi pal dont be afraid my names rocky this heres my place you okay scott enders stared at him for a time and then shook his head i think i have some broken ribs he said it hurts to breathe you from around here no from cleveland cleveland huh i could swear i seen you before whats your name scott pointed at the tag sewh on his shirt bob huh pocky sniffed x assat some kind of prison shirt or something i dont know scott said you want a drink yes rocky started to hand him the bottle but then changed his mind and passed over the halffilled glass keeping the bottle for himself you got any money he asked some scott pulled out what remained of the bills eddie garcia had given him crying out softly at the pain that exploded from where the hijacker had kicked him in the chest several times during the trip from ohio he had coughed up blood in the bathroom of the bus now every breath was an agonizing effort after he arrived at the terminal in boston a cab driver had taken twenty dollars of his money and had dropped him off somewhere in east boston the next thing scott remembered was being nudged awake rocky dinucci eyed the money well bob he said if you want to pay me a few bucks rent ill be happy to share this place with you ive got to find mrs gideons horse right sure you do scott knew he was making no sense to the man he wanted very much just to head offto try to find whatever it was mrs gideons horse represented to try to find himself but the long journey and the unremitting pain in his chest had sapped him dry he felt at once hot and terribly cold and all he could think about was sleep he handed the bills over and then lay back on the blankets hey thirtyfive bucks is too much he heard rocky say here ill keep ten and you keep the rest you sure youre okay maybe you should go to the hospital well suit yourself maybe youll feel better after a little sleep you sure you havent been in these parts before i could swear i seen you well no matter if i seen you before ill figure out where people make fun of me sometimes but they dont know that ol rocky dinucci has the memlory of an elephant if i seen you before ill figure out where yessir bob ol rocky the elephantfl figure out where the odometer on felix connollys limegreen beetle had been frozen at miles when he bought the car in and at it remained still during their drive through the chaotic late afternoon traffic eric was impressed with the bugs clan he was also relieved that the attorney had returned his flask to his suitcoat pocket after a single drought and had shown no inclination toward another toast there was too much at stake at this point to have to question the mans judgment if connolly was concerned about being followed he showed no sign of it staying essentially in one lane and seldom if ever checking the rearview mirror or did he offer eric any explanation as to why they were headed into the roxbury section of the city directly away from bernard nelsons boylston street office imist the bug was all he would say before leaving his apartment eric had called joe silver at white memorial the er director coolly suggested that it would be in everyones best interest if eric voluntarily removed himself from the staff until the whole matter of his arrest on drug charges was resolved eric intimated without giving any details that there were some illegal and dangerous practices going on at white memorial which he would be in a much better position to ferret out on the active staff if silver was part of caduceus he hoped that his tacit threat might provoke some telltale reaction or remark the er director seemed not the least influenced by any of erics concerns he tersely gave him until the following afternoon to remove himself voluntarily or be summarily suspended after hanging up eric carefully wrapped verdis body in newspaper and set it on the balcony hoping that before long he would be in a position to do something more appropriate connolly had set as the time they would leave over the few minutes remaining eric propped himself against the balcony railing gazing out across the rooftops he took stock of himself in the light of joe silvers demand for his suspension he was apprehensive about his future and angry at silvers lack of confidence but most of all he ached for the shame his parents would be feeling earlier in the day during a lun at court he had called them and tried to impress on them his innocence not unexpectedly they took his difficulties quite personally and were unable to see far enough beyond their own bewilderment and humiliation to find the words that would have indicated they truly believed him the very worst things he had ever done in his life were far too mild to prepare them for dealing with events like these his being forced out of white memorial would hurt them even more than his brothers arrests had silently he renewed his vow to see things throughto find those who had decimated his world and lauras and to absorb whatever punishment was necessary to bring them down afterward assuming he was still alive he would pick up what pieces were left and make some sort of new life for himselfwith laura a part of it he hoped gray cougar and blue volvo felix connolly said what dont look back but there are at least two cars working a tail on us theyve been at it since we left your apartment reporters that depends on how lucky youre feeling not very eric said then i dont think theyre reporters tighten that seat belt and feel free to close your eyes any time you want connolly pulled out his flask and took a small gulp then before eric could comment he shifted down a gear and floored the accelerator the vw shot forward past two startled drivers into a tight skidding rightangle turn and down a side street eric glanced behind just as the cougar screeched around the corner followed a second or two later by the volvo the side street was typical of many in this most rundown part of the city with trash and broken glass lining the gutters dilapidated red brick buildings were separated from the curb by threefoot sidewalks and from one another by narrow alleyways the pursuers whoever they were had made up considerable ground by the time the vw was halfway down the street it was unlikely they would reach the next cross street without being overtaken then suddenly even that concern was meaningless ahead of them hood up a disabled old chevy was parked at an angle that completely blocked the street shit eric said glancing back once again what do we do now at that instant connolly slammed on the brakes and spun left into a cluttered alley that was so narrow eric had not even noticed it the vw cleared the buildings on either side by barely two inches bernard insists on calling this nelsons alley connolly explained as they crept along even though im certain i told him about it he and i bought this little chartreuse beastie just for days like this so it doesnt get driven much although actually its sort of a pleasant change from my wrcedes that junker back there with its hood up belongs to a friend of ours whos probably in some bar down the street right now it weighs a goddam ton if our pals cant get past itand they canttheres no way they can reach the street were heading to eric turned just as two men entered the alley on foot and began sprinting after them but he knew they were too late after just a few yards they stopped apparently realwng the same thing clearly enjoying the whole scenario felix connolly eased the bug onto the roadway and accelerated back toward boston any questions he asked wy one eric said do you have anything left in that flask felix connolly drove eric to the back bay and pulled up in front of an old elegant brownstone on the river side of beacon your friend is in apartment threeb he said if you need anything heres my card that numberll reach me day or night he leaned over and shook erics hand youre a class act doc he said youve handled yourself well through all this thanks for saying that youre something of a piece of work yourself felix hang on to that flask the name slot next to the bell for apartment b read simply ring once and wait erics finger had barely left the doorbell when laura spoke to him through the intercom and buzzed him in she checked over the safety chain and then pulled him inside the apartment and held him tightly he could feel the tension in her body and in her kiss im okay he whispered stroking her hair everythings going to be all right he waited until some of the tightness in her muscles had lessened and her breathing had slowed and then stepped back and surveyed the small apartment the space was beautifully apportioned with scanavian furniture and oriental area rugs set on a polished hardwood floor on a loft eight feet above a double futon abutted a halfmoon window overlooking the charles this place is beautiful he said whose is it he didnt say so outright but i have to assume its bernardsor maybe someone he knows very well he dropped me off here a while ago gave me a set of keys for each of us and told me we should make ourselves at home here for as long as we need to where is he now his wife drove up here with some clothes for him and then took him to the airport assuming the plane left on time he took off about an hour ago for salt lake city business ourbusiness eric but utah with all thats going on shouldnt he be hey slow down i want to lay all this out for you in order are you sure youre okay thanks to that lawyer i am he said im really exhausted thats all and im desperate as hell to get back at someoneanyonefor what weve been through you know i wasnt even able to bury verdi i left his body on the balcony she kissed him once again and then led him to the oak table in the dining alcove youll get the chance she said for what its worth bernard and i believe that whoever killed verdi broke into your place looking for what we have right here she motioned to the pile of ledgers and papers on the table this is some stuff eric wait till you see it a lot of it didnt make sense to us but we have feeling it will to you are you up to looking at it now im exhausted but im not dead he said lets do it they began by scanning donald devines two ledgers but quickly discarded the larger of them as being pure mortuary business the other book was much more of an enigma there were in all seventy entries spanning more than two years the first entry read re rx by w transf by carr gob dpt cost to gob transp costs bt dep hal due pd you have gasoline receipts that correspond to this pf eric asked laura retrieved a small stack and placed them in front of him there are some i cant find but fiftynine of the seventy entries match a set of these she said theyre all round trips from boston to somewhere around here she pointed to the circled area in the atlas what in hell was he into laura turned his face to hers eric dont you see the man had an intensive care unit in his basement why would he have that if he only dealt with corpses he was transporting bodies all right but i dont think they were dead ones lets see if we can break one of these entries down he said when they had finished they rewrote the item filling in as much information as they could pf march treated by w transferred by c arrived gates of heaven march departed march cost to gates of heaven transportation ca ecei on costs s or pts plus meals btal balance due advance payment paid april the initials heading each entry were different but the abbreviations w and c were present in every item except for the last four three of those four including pt were treated by c and transferred by c the fourth coded ll was incomplete as they studied each item other patterns began to emerge as well each case spanned four or five days from the initial date through transfer to the gates of heaven two days later and ending with transport presumably to southeastern utah two three days after that this is incredible eric muttered over and over this is absolutely incredible these people listed here werent dead were they i dont think so what could devine have been up to im not sure he was up to anythingat least not on his own he was a strange little duck but unless he was an absolute jekyll and hyde its hard to imagine him doing anything but taking orders from someone and getting paid i agree she walked across the room and back eric she asked finally do you think devine could have had anything to do with caduceus he pushed away from the table and looked up at her since their earlier conversation and her description of devines macabre basement chamber that notion had been drifting in and out of his thoughts as well if all of these initials correspond to wmh patients i think you may have something he said with these dates it shouldnt be too hard to check outspecially if i can get into the record room or at least tap into the record room computers wouldnt that be something he pounded his fist into his hand goddam but wouldnt that just beat all lauras face was glowing eric she said i think he was part of them i really do at eightthirty they packed up donald devines material and opened the bottle of chardonnay that laura had picked up for them tell me something eric asked why do you think someone tried to kill you yesterday i dont really know she said bernard thinks the people scott was after still believe im a threat because i can locate that tape if they thought i already had it theyd have tried to capture me then kill me later now he says i shouldnt leave this place until he gets back from utah but eric i wont last a day cloistered in here youve got to do what he says i dont listen im the one who started this by coming here its my brother were after i need to do something look just give me till tomorrow morning im going to find a way to screen the files in the record room afterward depending on what i find well make some sort of move and well do it together what if the people at the hospital know youve been suspended and dont let you have access to the records it wouldnt surprise me if caduceus has already seen to that he said but im not planning on going anywhere near the record room if im correct the whole systems computerized explain give me a minute he said picking up the phone laura listened as he called the white memorial emergency room and spoke to a nurse who was obviously a good friend in just the minute he had promised he hung up having obtained the access password to the wmh records its filerite he said cute huh the passwords all over the hospital because every floor and nurses station needs access to the records you mean anyone from anywhere can call in and get anyone elses medical record its not that easy theres probably a callback built into the security system to prevent unauthorized outside callers from getting in it requires the caller to type in his phone number and then checks it against an approved file and either hangs up or returns the call so youve got to use a computer inside the hospital exactly for how long dunno it depends on how complete the user menu for the records department is if its real completeand i think it isi may need only a couple of hours to do what i have to but here in the hospital can you work that long without somebody seeing you he pulled her to him remember my friend subarskythe one i built the laser with the one you grew up with in watertown exactly he has an ibm thats connected to the hospital system and hes probably good enough with computers to fill in the million or so blanks in my knowledge well i promise to stay put if you promise to be careful he traced the lines of her perfect mouth with his fingertip and i promise to be careful if you promise to let me at that smooth little place just below she cupped her hand to his lips as she undid the top few buttons of his shirt then suddenly she pulled away and raced up the ladder to the loft before eric could react her sweater floated down onto his lap seconds later her jeans followed can you make it up here with your injuries she called out i can he said in fact if this meteor shower continues i may not need the ladder he left his clothes at the foot of the ladder and climbed up to the loft laura lay naked on the futon her chin resting on her hands as she stared out the halfmoon window at the river beneath the soft glow of light reflected off the ceiling her slim long body was like a sculptors masterpiece she turned to him does it frighten you that im falling in love with you she whispered the only thing that frightens me is realizing ive never let myself feel anything until now he said for an hour they made lovedesperately at first then with such slow exquisite tenderness that before long it seemed neither of them could survive another touch finally locked in each others arms they slept their breathing and their bodies working in gentle perfect harmony six miles away in east boston rocky dinucci shuffled into a phone booth laughing to himself crumpled in his hands was a poster he had torn off the side of a warehouse on the docks rocky the elephant he cackled they call me punchy but what do they know yessiree yessiree rocky the elephant thats me he dropped a coin into the phone smoothed the poster out and dialed it at five thirty enc was up alternately pacing about the apartment and ponng over the ledger taken from donald devine after a peaceful hour in lauras arms visions of anna delacroix the deathshead mask and verdi lying dead in his sink began intruding on his sleep surviving as an emergency physician had meant becoming somewhat inured to the ugliness and brutality in the world to the sad results of mans capability for violence selfdestruction and a myriad of unfeeling acts but nothing had prepared him for the evil he and laura were confronting he shuffled to the bathroom and studiedhimself in the mirrorthe bruises the tension in his jaw the strange metallic anger in his eyes it was like looking at a total stranger he had been battered and pushed beyond the limits of his tolerance by faceless men and women who seemed ready to kill and maim without hesitation and now he knew that if he was to survive if he was to spend his life in the profession he had chosen and with the woman he was growing to love he had to be ready to fight by their rules laura and bernard nelson had taken the first steps toward reprisal now it was his turn and waiting for him in dave subarskys lab was the weapon he kould use to begin his counterattack against the faceless onesa computer leaving a note in case laura awoke he slipped from the apartment and made copies of the ledger pages at an allnight convenience store on berkeley he returned to find her up and cooking breakfast she was wearing only a mans dress shirt and the sight of the full length of her wonderful legs immediately began diverting erics thoughts from the task at hand bernard said to make full use of the place she said you dont think hell mind that i borrowed one of his shirts do you if he learns where its been i dont think hell ever wash it again you got the copies uhhuh im going to wait another fifteen minutes and then call dave with luck well be able to screen the er visits on the days listed here looking for people with these initials i want to come eric shook his head i know waiting heres going to be harder than what i have to do he said but you cant take the chance of someones recognizing you but what if they recognize you she asked if they wanted me dead they could have done it no they want people thinking im crazy so no one will pay any attention to what i have to say theres no way they could know how many people ive spoken to about my tetrodotoxin theories so their best approach is simply to discredit me altogether killing me would only add weight to the possibility that i was onto something i hope youre right i just keep wondering how that woman knew to be at the medical library he looked at her startled you know he said with all thats happened i hadnt thought about that at all well go and please be careful he kissed her on the back of the neck i will i have too much to live for to cash out now okay then she said reluctantly ill stay here and catch up on the soaps its only been two or three years so i shouldnt have much trouble damn i dont like being made helpless i know but after what happened yesterday we should try at least to pick and choose when we take chances just do me one favor then start with that pt person you think that was scott the dates match okay i will but laura please dont hold out too much hope when i see his body ill stop hoping she said setting spanish omelets and a dish of hashbrowns on the table and when i see you back in this apartment in one piece ill stop worrying eric broke from their meal to call dave subarsky five minutes later he was back were in luck he said excitedly helping himself to seconds dave feels theres a good chance we can get into the recordroom system just be careful she said again he flexed his muscle does a man with these biceps need to worry eric im serious eric pulled her to her feet slipped his hands beneath her shirttail and held her tightly damn right he said eric took the river walk to the hospital the flat gray morning was chffled by a steady wind that whipped at him from behind and sent a heavy chop across the dark water an occasional bundled jogger chugged past but otherwise he was alone he tried to focus on the computer search he was about to attempt but his thoughts were continually sidetracked by the question laura had raised just how did anna deoix come to find me at the county library he had assumed that her interest in him had been triggered by his interest in teotoxin and that her perception of him as a threat to her cult had subsequently arisen as a result of the information he had shared with her about the white memorial cases but what if she had been at the county because of him what if her people had already known of his growing suspicion of the arcane poison how could they have found that out when i didnt really speak to anyone outside the hospital he turned the questions over and over in his mind considering first the likelihood that anna or someone connected with her had been following him all along and then the possibility of whether the deathshead priest could have purposely sent her to make contact with him while they were arranging the whole sproul court nightmare the questions were still gnawing at him as eric entered the hospital through the outpatient department and quickly took the stairway down to the tunnel connecting all the wmh buildings he passed no one who showed any particular notice of him along the way dave subarsky was waiting in his office with coffee and doughnuts so he said public enemy number one surfaces man who kill our women rape our buffalo he set his beefy hands on erics shoulders you holding up okay there was no mistaking the concern in his eyes ve been better i should hope so here have a chocolatecovered i understand theyre a special favorite of the criminal element im about as much of a criminal as you ri are careful what company you put yourself in ive been known to pull a few labels off mattresses in my day subarsky hoisted his size thirteens onto the corner of the desk and tugged absently at his beard i take it then that every phantasmagoric thing youve been telling the press and the police is true everything and the cocaine do you know a straighter arrow about that stuff than i am eric asked but why would someone set you up like that that my furry friend is what i was hoping you might help me figure out well then that being the case my computer is at your disposal along with my somewhat limited knowledge of its applications but first how about telling me what were looking for eric set the copies of donald devines ledger on the desk settle back big fella he said this aint gonna be pretty starting from the day in february when he failed to resuscitate the man named john doe eric took the biochemist stepbystep through his initial meeting with laura their encounters with thaddeus bushnell and donald devine and finally to the tiein with the horrible events surrounding the death of loretta leone subarsky listened thoughtfully and without comment when eric finished describing lauras breakin at the gates of heaven and the conclusions suggested by devines notes and the basement intensivecare room dave whistled softly through his teeth you have gotten yourself into some shit my man he said i will say that lauras in even deeper than i am some organizedcrime types think shes a threat to unearth this video showing them in a drug deal apparently her brother did the filming while he was undercover yesterday the bastards tried to run her down they actually killed a guy in the process she doesnt know anything about the video nothing like i said you are really into some shit subarsky crumpled a sheet of paper and lofted it into the wastebasket ten feet away so he said where do you want to start look at this list dave if we can find wmh patients whose names correspond to these initials well have at least forged the link from devine to the hospital and you think one of the three bigwigs on that search committee is part of this caduceus thing and whoever that is tried to recruit you and may be at the bottom of this whole business eric shrugged maybe at this point im only guessing well then don quixote subarsky said booting up his terminal lets have at it using the filerite password dave quickly worked his way into the main menu of the recordroom computerized data system as eric had suspected white memorial had gone into electronic data in the most comprehensive way the menu of available functions and maneuvers was exhaustive subarsky retrieved from his desk a manual describing in detail the hospitals computer capabilities and codes here he said handing the manual over you do the brain work ill do the grunt work eric studied the screen and then the book type retrieve he said with eric issuing the commands they moved like mice in a maze from one menu to the next into deadend alleys and then back out again their goal the reward waiting at the far side of the maze was a lista compilation of those patients seen in the emergency room on february the first date noted beside the initials pt twenty minutes passed we could always just call the record room and ask them what were doing wrong subarsky said not unless we absolutely have to i dont know for sure if caduceus is behind this but if they are theres no telling whos with them and if someone from the record room just happens to be and we alert them weve lost everything pardon me for saying so laddie but youre startin to sound just a wee bit paranoid eric held up his bandaged wrists make that a whole bunch paranoid he said please dave just bear with me a little longer its your dime subarsky said polishin off a custardfilled doughnut in three bites its a good thing vm spent all those late nights together locking horns over the laser cause i can always fall back on those one or two times when you were actually right try synthesize again eric offered werejust gonna end up the same place as last time no i dont think so dave the commands coming aftey the date this time just try it subarsky typed in the word and then hit the return key alphabetized or sequential the screen asked weve got it eric cried were in he hunched over the biochemists broad shoulders tell the beast to alphabetize our list seconds after the command was typed in a list appeared headed by the date february and set in computerperfect alphabetical order the name trainor phillip was on the screen with his birthdate s ll al and hospital number was he scott enders they scanned february the day of the actual resuscitation but could not find a phflhp trainor dont worry eric said he probably was entered as john doe he wrote the name phillip trainor next to the initials pt and then had dave call up an image of trainors er sheet near drowning hypothermia contusions david this was lauras brother i just know it was he was here two days before i pronounced him dead can you print that sheet given half an hour maybe never mind eric said excitedly ill take notes were onto something dave just watch eric noted down all the information he could and then began searching for the other initials on devines list in minutes the pattern began to come clear over the past twoplus years certain patients were seen in the white memorial emergency room for problems varying from colds to broken bones within fortyeight hours those same patients were brought back to the hospital essentially dead on arrival every one of them was signed out as acute heart failure secondary to myocardial infarction and every one of them was transferred to the gates of heaven funeral home pending examination by the medical examiner and in every case that medical examiner was thaddeus bushnell why didnt someone ever pick up on this eric asked sooner or later a nurse or doctor he stopped in midsentence and began flipping rapidly through his notes what is it pal subarsky asked what it is david eric said grimly is the answer to my question look look here except for the last three cases craig worrell and norma cubinet were involved with every one thats mbrreu as in w and cullinet as in cthe abbreviations in donald devines record book the reason mbrreh wasnt part of the last three cases is that he got arrested and then disappeared im impressed subarsky said i really am but we still dont have the answer to the sixtyfourdollar question why what would anybody want with a bunch of corpses thats the point they werent corpses they looked dead enough to get pronounced dead with no one raising an eyebrow but dave dont you see thats the tiein thats the goddam tiein with everything what eric paced across the room and back can i take over there for a second he asked the ekg department records are totally computerized we call up tracings all the time help yourself subarsky said pushing himself up listen ive got a little experiment going on in the lab next door that i need to rerun with some new reagents give a holler if you need me otherwise ill be back in ten or fifteen minutes by then i expect you to have all the answers for me david keep all this between us okay that goes without saying my friend congratulations on unearthing all this nice choice of words subarsky eric said summoning up an ekg real nice subarsky lumbered off as the first tracing appeared on the screen it was the ekg taken during the resuscitation of patient rea fortyeightyearold woman erie now felt certain was named pamela fitzgerald the pattern was one eric knew all too well broad slow complexes at the rate of six to eight per minute checks of two other cases showed the same eric set the keyboard aside on a sheet of paper he wrote the questions how who why beside the first he wrote er or inpatients with no next of kin tetrodotoxin administered by c resuscitation attempted by w or by unsuspecting resident transfer to g of h for further treatment in basement by possible antidote given death certificates presigned by t bushnell mortuary records forged transportation of drugged subject to utah by d devine beside the second crai worrell norma cullinet donald devine sara kagarden joe silier best bet haien darden deathshead priest anna delacroix and finally by the third he could write only a large question mark sickened and frightened by what he was discovering eric wandered out into the corridor through the high plateglass windows he could see the ambulance parking area far below and the entrance to the emergency room everywhere it seemed business was as usual patients and nurses uniformed emts and whitecoated physicians bustled in and out of the buildings proud or relieved to be associated with the hospital considered by many to be the worlds best and no place was there even a hint of the terror their august institution had spawned eric felt unsettled and anxious about what lay aheadabout the possibility of making a mistake that would alert the wrong people too soon timing was everythingtiming and an airtight case his credibility for the moment was all but destroyed in everyones eyes except he hoped dave subarskys if caduceus realized how far he had come there was no telling what countermeasures they would take already they had seen to the removal of loretta leones body and tissue samples that move in itself spoke of resourcefulness and power just as surely as the deaths of thaddeus bushnell and donald devine spoke of the lack of moral boundaries the worst thing he could do would be to tip his hand too soon records could be removed as easily as had leones specimens pepeople could be bought off or silenced altogether incriminating evidence could be planted and of course he and laura could simply disappear give up dave subarsky moved in beside eric and stared down at the er lot hardly im just deciding where to head next and the nurse i kept mentioning norma cullinet uhhuh shes a patient on the neurosurgical service she fell and fractured her skull so so i dont know what shape shes in but i think im going to try and talk with her neurosurgery huh well i hope shes better off than most of the neurosurgical patients ive seen most of those you couldnt communicate with at all unless you had an englishvegetable dictionary nottrue and not funny eric said sorry you know menothings sacred i know sorry for snapping its just that this stuff is so damn ugly i cant handle any sicko humor right now even yours i understand subarsky said sometimes my mouth just has a mind of its own well listen pal ive got a slew of errands to run in town let me shut off my terminal and ill walk you down the two of them were headed down the stairway toward the tunnels when eric looked back at subarsky i appreciate your help this morning david he said now i want you as far away from all this as possible okay sure i mean it i dont want to be the cause of anyones getting hurt especially a friend okay but you know im here if you need me eric hesitated and then stopped and handed over the xerox ledger sheets and his notes david if anything happens to me i hope youll try to break this thing open he said nothings gonna happen but if it does you can count on me doing just that thanks eric said thanks for everything once in the basement the two men shook hands and headed in opposite directions five floors above in dave subarskys office the telephone was ringing it rang more than a dozen times before it stopped dammit eric where are you where the hell are you laura enders listened as the phone in the office where eric was supposed to be continued to ring finally she set the receiver down and finished dressing her hands were shaking and she could barely focus on what she was doing five minutes she decided she would try once more in five minutesthen she had to do something it was only boredom really that had led her to check in with the desk at the carlisle now she wondered if the force at work was something much stronger than that the message which she had copied down verbatim after three repetitions by the iranian desk clerk had come in during the early morning your brother scott is with me to find out where to get him and where to bring reward call every hour on the hour until you reach me rocky it was nearing nine oclock laura struggled to keep her hopes in check more likely than not the call was a hoaxor worse a trap under no circumstances would she give anyone the number at bernards apartment nor would she go anywhere alone at two minutes before the hour she tried dave subarskys office once more once more there was no answer she watched the seconds march off on her watch until another minute had passed and then dialed a man answered on the first ring this is rocky he said rocky this is laura enders she held the receiver with both hands to keep it steady i got yer brother at my place you still offerin a reward lauras immediate sense was of an older man with not much education in the background she could hear traffic noises yes rocky she said if you really have him ill pay how much first tell me is he all right hes not so good no whats the matter how should i know i aint no doctor now how much are we talkinhere his voice had the deliberation and thickness of a drinkers five hundred dollars laura heard herself say sixll okay okay six but i no deal until you tell me something my brother has a tattoo on his left hip describe it if i have to go back and check itll cost you another fifty thats fine ill call this number in five minutes better make it ten rocky said he hung up without waiting for a reply during the minutes that followed laura remained by the phone moving only twice to try the number at the hospital at ninefifteen she called once again mom dad laurie three flowers rocky said immediately laura felt the muscles in her body go lax she struggled to keep from dropping the phone where are you she demanded do we got a deal yes we have a deal now where are you sixfifty yes yes now please just tell me where to go east boston theres a big vacant lot that starts on bow street youd see a couple a rusty barrels in one corner be there in an hour with the money and come alone ill have to have a driver just keep him the hell away from me once i get the money ill tell you where you can find yer brother dont fool with me neither lady i aint no dummy i wont i promise it could still be a trap laura tried desperately to think through the possibilities of how the man could have learned of scotts tattoo finally she knew there was no choice but to go and see she opened the yellow pages to taxis then just as quickly she stopped and put the book aside there was a better safer way after writing a lengthy note explaining to enc everything that was happening she picked up the phone and dialed my name is laura enders she said i must speak with captain wheeler captain lester wheeler its an emergency the neurosurgical service occupied the eighth and ninth floors of the fox building the newestand in erics opinion the most appealingof white memorials twelve buildings the broad welllit corridors pastel decor and airy rooms seemed as perfect a setting for recovery as a hospital could offer eric had done two rotations on neurosurgery and knew the floors well norma cullinets room according to patient information was quite far from the nurses stationdown a separate corridor in fact the location suggested that she was quite stable at least as postop neurosurgical patients were measured still wary of his uncertain status in the hospital eric stopped by the laundry in the subbasement signed out a kneelength clinic coat and made his way up the staircase he remembered as opening almost across the hall from as he climbed he tried to sort out what he had come to know of the woman over the five years of their professional association she had always impressed him as being conscientious enough but now that he thought about it there had always been a hard edge to her a distance that kept many of the nurses and residents from calling her by her first name still a hard edge was one thing murder quite another and the evidence eric had amassed left little doubt in his mind that norma cullinet had administered a powerful metabolic poison to nearly a hundred unsuspecting patients and then had calmly waited for them to be brought back to white memorial clinically dead hard edge or not it was difficult to imagine her doing the things he suspected but then again it was difficult to imagine anyone in the healing arts doing them as eric neared the eighth floor a plan began to take shape if in fact caduceus was behind the pseudodeaths and if in fact norma was one of them it was reasonable to assume that she knew he had been approached to join their cabal if he could now convince her that over the days since her accident he had undergone a change of heart and signed on there was every reason to believe she might slip up what he wanted most from her was confirmation of his theories about caduceus and its makeup and some kind of affirmation that one of the search committee members was the powerful central figure in the secret society and of course what he also wanted desperately to learn were the reasons whywhy a group so totally empowered by society would callously destroy the lives entrusted to them once on the eighthfloor landing eric paused to catch his breath and compose himself if as was possible norma cullinet was unwilling or unable to provide the information he needed so be it there would be other ways the important thing was he was finally on the offensive he opened the heavy door a crack and peered out except for an aide engrossed in her linen cart the corridor was deserted a final deep breath and he crossed the hall there was a sign in red on normas door no visitors please check at nurses station eric hesitated a beat and then slipped inside and closed the door behind him the room was in near darkness the only light leaking through a small gap in the drapes norma cullinet her head swathed in bandages lay on her back asleep eric cleared his throat loudly and then took two steps toward the bed norma he said softly norma its eric najarian in that instant as his eyes adjusted to the darkness he noted the unnatural tilt of her head and the wide static opening of her mouth oh jesus he cried racing to the bedside norma norma wake up he simultaneously pulled the light and nurses call cords as he checked her neck for a pulse oh damn he heard himself murmur he checked her airway with his finger shoved her pillow down between her shoulders to throw her head back and gave her chest a quick thump then he gave her two mouthtomouth breaths help code nineth nine in eightfourteen he screamed as he began cardiac compressions code ninetynine in eightfourteen he did a cycle of compressions and another pair of breaths and then reached for the phone with one hand as he continued closedchest compressions with the other the operator answered on the fifth ring this is dr najarian he rasped code ninetyrune fox building room eightfourteencall it he slammed the receiver down and once again screamed for help he heard the commotion and footsteps in the hall at the moment the operators droming voice began sounding through the overhead page code ninetynine fox eightfourteen code ninetynine fox eightfourteen a nurse rushed in followed moments later by another with the crash cart the overhead lights were turned on dr najarian the nurse exclaimed what are you she coded eric cut her off get a line in her you give me an ambulance bag please a third nurse arrived now eric had all the hands he needed in less than a minute an iv fine and breathing tube were in and the defibrillator was charged threesixty eric said ordering the voltage he wanted everybody clear a breathless resident raced into the room as eric holding electrode paddles on the side of normas breastbone and beneath her left breast depressed the red button on the paddle in his right hand normas body arched off the bed and her limp arms shot upward like a puppets resume compressions please he ordered this womans my patient the resident said could you please tell me whats going on i came here and found her dead in bed eric said could someone please get the ekg hooked up i need an amp of epi now everyone get backwere going to shock her again what were you doing in here the bewildered resident asked eric ignored the question and twice more administered highvoltage shocks keep pumping please he ordered give the epi have we got a tracing yet several medical students the respiratory therapist and a medical technologist added to the crowd that was building in the room seconds later joe silver raced through the door najarian what the hell eric raised his hand trying to calm his chief while at the same time scanning the ekg tracing there was no cardiac activity whatever give her an amp of bicarb please he said there was an edge of panic in his voice joe silvers eyes were blazing as he pushed through the crowd to the bedside eric felt a suffocating tightness building in his own chest what in the hell are you up to silver demanded i came here to see norma found her dead in bed and called a code she was checked less than an hour ago and she was fine a nurse offered what are you doing in that silver said gesturing at erics white coat around the bedside there was a mounting air of confusion the nurse kneeling on the bed continued her compressions and the respiratory therapist continued manual ventilation but both of them as well as the nurse drawing meds were staring at the two emergency physicians awaiting instructions to eric the entire scene seemed like a grotesque tableau then joe silver inserted himself between eric and the bed dr gordon he said to the neurosurgical resident take over the resuscitation at the bedside ill handle the ekg dr najahan please wait outside ill deal with you when were through he checked normas pupils then turned his back to eric and checked the ekg shes fixed and dilated and straightline everyone could i have a milligram of atropine iv keep pumping there but switch if youre tired youre doing a nice job but things dont look good not good at all has anyone notified her family if shes catholic better call a priest too eric stared at his chief at another time just a few short days ago he would have felt totally lost and humiliated now he felt only anger heedless of the many eyes still fixed on him he turned away from the bedside and stalked from the room the resuscitative effort lasted another twenty minutes although eric had correctly sensed the futility of it from the moment his fingers touched the side of norma cullinets neck he stood in the hallway listening to the riuitless battle within room and wondering whether normas death was a postoperative complication or in some way the result of her connection with caduceus he also began debating whether it was worth waiting to face the almost certain onslaught against him by joe silver or whether he should simply march across the hall to the stairway and leave he was on the verge of selecting option two when room began to empty most of those leaving pointedly avoided looking in his direction those who inadvertently made eye contact with him either shook their heads or quickly looked away the upshot of this latest chapter in his nightmare was going to be badvery bad that woman was one hell of a nurse joe silver his eyes about level with erics chin stood hands on hips glaring up at him she was a murderer eric wanted desperately to say are you one too but he knew that until he held proof far more irrefutable than the notes that were folded in his hip pocket any attempt at attacking norma cullinet would merely be adding joe silvers shovel to those already trying to bury him im sorry she didnt make it he managed yeah you seem all broken up silver said you gonna tell me what you were doing in there or do you want to wait until after the pathologists tell us why she died it happened just as i said it did eric responded holding on to his rage by only the finest of threads i came up here to talk to norma about some things and found her dead and i did my best to resuscitate her i dont think i did anything to deserve the kind of treatment i just received from you in there silver looked as if he were about to spit in erics face your indignation doesnt even deserve a response he said acidly but let me lay it out for you first youre involved in a series of very bizarre disruptive events all of which suggest that you are drugaddicted crazy or most likely both next you are told by me to stay away from this hospital until this whole business is straightened out yet here you are dressed up like a goddam professor in the room of a woman whose door says no visitors and shes dead youve got it wrong eric said simply joe silver glared at him damn but youre an arrogant son of a bitch now you just listen up najarian i dont want to see your face in this hospital again until the pathologists report on this woman is in if her death is on the up and up youll get your chance to explain all the other madness youre into but if she was murdered i plan to be at the head of the line of those who win want to see you hung up by your goddam crazy armenian heels and stoned without waiting for a reply he whirled and stormed down the eighthfloor oriidor well fuck you very much dr silver eric said courteously ill try to be worthy of your understanding and confidence furious he ran down eight flights of stairs to the basement threw his lab coat in a corner and then took the tunnel to one of the side exits a chilly mist was swirling down from the heavy latemorning sky and although it was twenty minutes by foot to bernard nelsons apartment eric had no inclination to do anything but walk he crossed over cambridge street and wandered up charlesthe same route he and laura had taken on their first night together it was a night that seemed several lifetimes ago he had come so close so damn close now rather than putting an end to their nightmare he had only intensified it if as seemed quite possible norma cullinets autopsy showed her death to be murder his unauthorized presence in her room coupled with the other suspicions surrounding his sanity and drug use would quickly vault him to the head of any list of suspects one step forward two steps back perhaps the najarian could become a new dance craze he picked up a copy of the herald wondering what new absurdities they had chosen to print about zombi doc what he found instead was a frontpage teaser and page spread on the robberymurder at the gates of heaven according to the writeup there were no signs of forced entry leading police to suspect the murderer was known to the victim investigators were currently focusing on names in an appointment book recovered from donald devines desk nowhere in the article was there mention of the macabre treatment room in the mortuary basement did the police choose to withhold that find or had the room been dismantled before they even arrived on the scene those questions were troubling but not nearly as much so as the possibility that among the names in devines appointment book would be one dr eric najarian one step forward two steps back eric folded the paper slipped it into his jacket pocket and leaned against the corner of a building physically and emotionally spent across the street three stories above a chic italian bistro two workmen undaunted by the rain were washing windows from a suspended platform eric was musing on the possibility of his one day earning a living in such a manner when the door to the cafe opened and anna delacroix stepped out arm in arm with a man she wore a rich kneelength leather coat and her hair unpinned billowed to her shoulders but there was not a whit of doubt in erics mind that it was anna nor he suddenly realized was there any doubt as to her companion he concealed himself behind the corner of the building and watched as haven darden walked the spectacular woman around to the drivers side of a smart gray alfa convertible embraced her fondly and blew her a kiss as she drove off then the white memorial chief of medicine straightened his tie checked himself in the mirror of a store window and strode off toward the hospital eric moved to follow but then quickly halted haven darden was not going anyplace where he couldnt be found at last there was no need to make any move until he was absolutely ready absolutely in control so much made sense nowso many disconnected pieces had suddenly converged and meshed he had reached the center of caduceus now all that remained was finding a way to break dr haven darden down and this time there would be no steps back to laura enders the drive to east boston through the callahan tunnel seemed interminable in point of fact somethingan accident or breakdownhad stopped traffic in one of the two tunnel lanes locking her and captain lester wheeler in a snarl that already spilled well back onto the expressway on the boston side last time we went eric and i took this beautiful very high bridge over to east boston she said wheeler wearing jeans and a blue irishknit fishermans sweater beneath his windbreaker nodded the mystic river bridge we could have taken that but i thought wed go this way so we can come up behind that bow street lot not on the side your man rocky wants us to why just in case its a trap the first thing we teach our detectives is where possible never play anyone elses game i understand that mans voice sounded honest to me though i dont think were headed for any trap and i think scott is somewhere just on the other side of this tunnel i hope youre right wheeler said inching toward the east boston side of the harbor they were in an unmarked police car which had a blue light on the dash and a metalmesh screen separating the front and back seats im sure you read in the papers where we found that funeral parlor owner donald devine in permanent repose in one of his caskets yes yes i did read that im not surprised i told you the last time we spoke that he was into something shady you did in fact the question is what laura just shrugged she and bernard nelson had decided to tell no one not even the police of her role in the hitandrun death on son avenue or of their breakin at the gates of heavenat least not until the nature of devines business dealings became clear or someone was arrested for his murder in addition the policeman had already asked her pointedly about eric and his wellpublicized misadventures it seemed unwise to say anything just yet that might raise further questions of her reliability beats me was all she said listen captain wheeler in case i forget to say so later i really appreciate your coming with me today i dont think i would have felt completely comfortable taking a cab it was pure luck you caught me in wheeler replied technically i have the week off i was just in the office catching up on paperwork when you called now do you want to go over our strategy again youre going to hang back but keep me in sight if theres no sign of trouble i should just pay up and bring scott back to the car if there zs any problem ill raise one of my hands over my head and youll fly to my rescue perfect i also want to caution you not to get your hopes up too high there are a lot of nut cases around this town along with some pretty resourceful folks who would like to ensure that you never lay your hands on that tape your brother made well as i told you i cant produce something i know nothing about and as for my hopes being too high the only thing that will snuff them out is seeing scotts body do you have family me hell yes and no my wife took off years ago with the guy who taught her painting class she took my two boys with her theyre grown men now but i havent heard from either of them for eight or ten years thats too bad i manage okay wheeler said they broke free of the tunnel and wheeler maneuvered the sedan through traffic to a side street you sure know your way around laura said i should twentyfive years on the force he turned on the windshield wipers i hope scotts not standing outside in this she said rocky made it sound as if he was sick wheeler turned down another narrow street and then pulled to a stop by what appeared to be several abandoned building lots behind the lots was a low hillock that extended for most of the block the steep slope composed of shrubcovered sandy soil was an eyesore it was littered with rusting pieces of automobile discarded bottles flattened milk cartons and the like the faded peeling threedeckers bordering the lot on each side seemed to sag under the weight of neglect nice place laura said wheeler glanced around nervously bow street is down the other side of this rise see those two trees right at the top there uhhuh ill be right between them watching you head up over there take a second once you reach the top to size things up if this rocky character is for real hell be down on the other side waiting for you to come in on bow street at the first sign of trouble i want that hand in the air got it got it laura said now weve just got to cross our fingers and hope you cross them for both of us wheeler said i want to keep my hands free they exited the patrol car together and then split up laura walked to the far side of the lot before starting up the slope while lester wheeler worked his way directly up to the pair of scraggly oak trees on the left side of the crest fine sheets of rain swept down the hillside at them come on scotty laura prayed as she trudged upw through the wild blackberry bushes and scrub oak be here please be here she checked the pocket of her jacket to ensure the was there she had tucked another in the back pocket of her jeans just in case at the top of the rise she paused and looked across at where lester wheeler was kneeling behind the two oaks when their eyes met the police captain nodded to direct her attention to the broad littered field below them to one side of the field a makeshift leanto possibly a play fort for the neighborhood kidswas propped against a rusting chainlink fence squatting beside the leanto trying to shield himself from the rain and remain hidden from bow street was a man the street beyond him looked deserted lauras pulse had already skipped several beats before she realized the man was not her brother he was dressed like a hobo but even at a fairly good distance laura could make out enough of his bearing and his weathered face to sense that he was no threat to her with a final nod to wheeler she picked her way over the damp soil down the gentle slope toward the man she assumed was rocky she was still some fifty yards away when she sensed beyond a doubt that her brother was down there as wellalmost certainly within the small rickety structure only the total of her selfcontrol kept her from bolting down the hill and into the leanto instead she forced herself once again to stop and survey the field looking for some signany signof a trap behind her and far to her left wheeler gave her a thumbsup sign and motioned her ahead she was just twenty yards away when rocky turned and noticed her rocky im laura enders she said quickly yeah well whaddaya tryin to pull he exclaimed youre supposed to be coming up that street is my brother in there im not telling you where he is rocky said unaware that his expression had already answered her question until i see the color of your money six hundred and fifty in case you forgot now im here to tell you that ol rocky didnt hes got the memory of here laura said she threw the bills on the sand at his feet as she hurried past him to the leanto and threw back the oilskin flap oh god she gasped racing inside scott was there sitting on a small pile of rags his back propped against the fence his breathing was shallow and labored and his complexion dusty laura threw her arms around him but then just as quickly pulled away when there was no reaction rocky appeared in the doorway he dont seem to know much of anything he said not his name not where hes from nothin all he keeps talking about is a horse rocky do you have any water nope not here i dont jeswine theys some at my place but its a walk from here thats okay the wine will do weve got to get him to a hospital i told him id call him an ambulance but he wouldnt have no part of it all he wanted to talk about was that damn horse get me the wine please laura took her brothers face in her hands can you hear me okayshe asked i can hear you his voice was grainy and his speech dry and thick but there was still strength there laura could feel it do you know who i am scott studied her then shook his head do you know who you are i i dont know anything oh god laura murmured she wined herself not to break down and then said calmly your name is scott scott enders im your sister my names laura does that help the man with her brothers face as it might be at age sixty shook his head once again can you stand she asked my legs are okay got kicked in the chest though ribs are broken well get you help dont worry rocky entered the leanto with his wine and laura forced a few drops between scotts lipshelp me get him up she ordered dont need help scott said crawling from the hut and then painfully pushing himself upright laura immediately noticed his limp and the clumsy way he used his left hand tell her about the horse buddy rocky dinucci urged tell her about that damn horse laura duckwalked out of the leanto and then looked up at the twin oaks on the crest of the hill lester wheeler was either well hidden or gone what horse laura asked she supported scotts arm with one hand although she was encouraged to see that as he had promised he could stand quite well on his own mrs gideons horse scott said with no emotion ive got to find mrs gideons horse our mrs gideon laura asked incredulously marjorie gideon a feisty spinster who wore cowboy boots and wranglers at age seventyfive had owned the farm nearest to their parents small spread in missouri she was also reputed to be one of the wealthiest people in the county as far as laura knew she had died years before i dont know scott said scott where did you come here from i dont know he answered haltingly i was in a town in the desert i saw the beams and found the way to get beneath them eddie garcia picked me up and brought me to cleveland lutah uura said scott you were in utah you werent i dont know he shook his head in frustration as if trying to clear the mist from his mind ive got to find mrs gideons horse laura struggled to understand marjorie gideon had owned several horses and had been happy to let scott and laura go riding in exchange for mucking out the stalls but that had been so many years ago scott tell me something laura asked suddenly trying to keep rocky from hearing does the horse have anything to do with a tapea videotape scott looked at her impassively maybe he said maybe it does think scott youve got to think what it means she studied her brothers face but knew he was nowhere near putting his thoughts together dont worry about it right now i have a car and a man to help well get you to a hospital everythings going to be all right laura turned toward the top of the hill there was still no sign of lester wheeler she raised her hand just in case but at that instant she realized the gesture was unnecessary wheeler had somehow made his way around and was approaching them along the fence from the bow street side captain wheeler she called come quickly it is scott but hes hurt hes hurt badly well then the policeman said well just have to get him some help he was just ten feet away when laura sensed a change in her brother the muscles in his arms tightened and his body seemed to tense his hollow eyes were riveted on the policeman scott are you all right she asked the moments that followed were a slowmotion nightmare with a guttural cry scott pulled free of her and lunged at wheeler his arm sweeping down m an awkward karate stroke aimed at the mans neck the attack was too slow and far too weak wheeler who seemed prepared for the onslaught parried the blow easily with one hand while he pulled his other hand from beneath his jacket laura saw the gun and recognized the long silencer attached to it at the same moment wheeler slashed the barrel across scotts face sending him sprawling to the wet ground dont laura screamed charging the man wheeler whipped her across the cheek with the back of his gun hand the tip of the silencer gashed her skin and she spun down almost on top of scott hey just one minute there rocky dinucci said bringing his hands up in a semblance of his boxing stance without hesitation the policeman pointed the ugly silencer at the hobos midchest and fired there was a soft pop and a puff of smoke from the muzzle rocky flew backward as if kicked by a mule slammed against the leanto and collapsed beneath a heap of plywood scrap metal and canvas wheeler whirled and in seconds had handcuffed laura and scott together and pulled them to their feet move he growled and not a word not a fucking word without a glance at the man he had just killed he shoved his two prisoners down along the chainlink fence to his cruiser heedless of the throbbing wound on her cheek laura pressed the sleeve of her jacket against the gash on scotts face their handcuffs still in place they were in the rear of the unmarked cruiser heading through the back streets of east boston toward the harbor scott was awake and responsive but his breathing was even more labored and twice he had coughed up small amounts of blood please laura begged through the metal mesh cant you see hes dying weve got to get him some help dammit what kind of monster are you lester wheeler did not respond he eased the cruiser through the narrow streets and onto the road that paralleled the docks laura recognized the area just a week before she and eric had parked in a spot not far from where they were how are you doing she whispered scotts bloodied lips pulled back in something of a smile hes one of them he rasped the men in the tape you remember that yes and do you know who i am now scott looked at her but shook his head no he said flatly thats okay scott its okay he let her reach across and squeeze him gently suddenly she stopped and leaned forward staring through the screen and out the windshield ahead of them was the lot where she and eric had parked she recognized the rusting tractor trailers resting on piles of railroad ties it was the trailer nearest them that had caught her eye painted on its side was the depiction of a greek goddess and enclosing the painting in large red script were the words aphrodite moving and storage aphrodite marjorie gideons favorite horse laura brought her lips close to her brothers ear scott look she whispered that trailer thats where the tape is isnt it almost imperceptibly scott enders nodded it wasnt supposed to have happened like this eric thought as he searched once more through bernard nelsons apartment for a note or some sort of explanation as to why laura had left and where she had gone he was supposed to have returned to her in triumph having not only solved much of the mystery of caduceus but also quite likely having identified the deathshead priest as well then after toasting their success with what little remained of lauras wine they were to formulate a plan for breaking down haven darden and finally they were to set about doing whatever was necessary to implement that plan desperately eric flipped through every magazine he could find lifted every vase and dish and even looked in the oven searching for some sort of clue fueling his urgency was the faint but defibrillator odor of cigarette smoke which had hit him the moment he entered the place unless laura had a smoking habit she had never shared with himand given her concern with fitness and health that possibility seemed remotesomeone else had been in the apartment he checked in with dave subarsky who had returned to his office but dave had heard nothing from her either subarsky promised to remain at his desk until one of them had word from her calls to erics apartment and bernard nelsons office were no more fruitful finally he phoned the carlisle but the unctuous desk clerk who had been on duty only since nine had nothing at all to offer eric left a message with the man for laura to contact him at the apartment or through dave subarsky then he climbed to the loft and lay downto wait and to think through a thin spatter of rain he gazed across storrow drive at the charles and at cambridge beyond laura was out there somewhere he reasoned and she was almost certainly in trouble what other conclusion could be drawn from the cigarette smoke and the absence of any note from her was it scotts tape that had gotten her into difficulty or perhaps haven darden had decided to use her as insurance against erics getting any closer to caduceus one scenario flowed into another in his mind each one more disturbing and frightening than the last fueled by anger and helplessness eric began to focus on darden the one variable he might yet be able to control the one person he still might be able to take by surprise the ming was not what he would have chosen and the idea that began to take shape was rough but there was no way he could just sit around and wait to hear from her in minutes he felt ready to act his call to white memorial was quickly put through to the medical chief there was trouble serious trouble at the hospital he told dardentrouble involving sara teagarden and a clandestine society called caduceus darden coopy responded that the only trouble at white memorial of which he was aware involved a resident named najarian eric stressed his innocence and begged for dardens forbearance he said enough just enough he hoped to whet the mans interest without making him suspicious tetrodotoxin was being used at white memorial and patients were being harmed he had proof of that nowirrefutable proof several people involved with the secret society had already died violently he had proof of that as well gradually but oh so skillfully darden suspended his facade of cynicism and doubt and expressed a mild curiosity to learn more his hand clenched on the receiver eric suggested meeting at dardens lab at four at which time he promised to present proof of every allegation in response to erics concern about being seen in the hospital darden gave his assurance that no one else would be around eric you have generated a great deal of ill will around this hospital in an amazingly short time darden said i am trusting that what you have to say to me will be the truth supported not by your speculation but by hard facts please do not give me any reason to join those who have closed ranks against you you have my word on it eric said by the time im done you will believe me i promise you that eric waited until darden had hung up before slamming the receiver down sleazy smug bastard he said he paced the apartment marking time in case laura called and trying to sort out his approach now that haven darden had taken the hook assuming the man honored his promise to have his lab deserted by fourand with that assumption eric felt reasonably safethere remained only one more detail to see to a weapon by three eric had conceived of a solution to that problem as well he left the apartment and walked quickly to where his cefica was parked he had a full hour left but with traffic beginning to build it would be at least a ten or fifteenminute drive to and from the metropolitan hospital of boston bernard nelson tightened his seat belt for the fourth time stnce takeoff and silently prayed that the huevos rancheros he had been foolish enough to have for breakfast would find some sort of quiet resting place within his body the cessna was patched in places with duct tape but its owner and pilot a man named chippy seemed interested enough in his own survival to dispel the most strident of nelsons misgivings it would have helped bernard acknowledged if he had a better idea of what they were looking for in the craggy desert west of moab but what he did know was that the late donald doe had made any number of trips to moab and had filled up twice in the area almost every time the man had to have driven somewhere he also knew from an hours experience that asking the laconic residents and gas station attendants of the town if they had seen a hearse cruising off into the desert was not the quickest way to make friends or gain confidences how much fuel do we have left chippy he asked another hour mbe the pilot said how far we go ontpends on the wind chippy was a dark weathered man in his fiftiesindian or part indian bernard guessed he flew with effortless confidence and spoke in a patois that was at times almost unintelligible it seemed as if he left out almost as many syllables as he pronounced bernard checked the detailed map he had bought in town in that case he said lets fly to hanksville and then over to st joseph can we do that we can aint nothint either place though thats okay try to stay around three hundred feet if you can itd help if ya knew whachas looking for i know it would bernard thought for a time then decided to chance adding one more name to the list of those who thought him crazy chippy someones been driving out here at least once a month from what i can tell he was driving a hearse im trying to figure out where he was going and what he was up to the pilot who seemed unsurprised by the revelation drummed his fingers on the control wheel then he put on his earphones and motioned for bernard to do the same moab thiss cessna two one papa delta he said into his radio dya copy repeat thiss two one papa delta calm moab air we hear you chippy a voice crackled morton put marianne on will ya he turned to bernard jeshad me a thought he said hi chippy its marianne say beautiful hows it going you coming back soon nother hour mbe were out here bout twenty miles north of hanksville do you member a ways back tellin me bout some ghost town near here thatd be charity it aint no ghost town though its a hospital of some sort now a mental hospital if you can believe that set up oh two or three years ago but the head doctor there sent a notice around forbiddin any overflights bematd nodded quickly jes wonderin thassall chippy gaid whobouts ist anyway twenty or twentyfive miles west of st joes dont you cause no trouble now chippy smith for all i know theyre listening to us right now hey do i cause trouble well well jes be swingin by hanksville an back see you in a hour papa delta out can you find it chippy nelson asked i kin try bernard gazed down at the vast ruiz ed terrain rocky and barren of all but the simplest vegetation yet in its way serenely beautiful of primary interest to him though were the dirt roads and tire tracks that from time to time skimmed past they had flown northwest for twenty minutes when bernard caught the flash of sunlight off something metal or glass chippy there over there he said did you see it the pilot nodded and banked to the east it took another five minutes of circling before they spotted the jeep which was largely covered with dust and from the air by a rocky to feet and made a was an elongated mounof dirt protruding from the mound were what looked like shoes and pieces of clothing can you set us down bernard asked if i do the takeoffs gonna use up our remaining fuel can we still get back to moab probly go for it smith shrug ed and pulled back up to feet minutes later he dropped down over what might have been a roadway or driedup creek bed and neatly set the cessna down in a cloud of dust and pebbles youre a hell of a pilot bernard said chippy smiled i try he said they located the jeep with little difficulty its canvas roof was intact although covered with half an inch of fine sand together they walked around to the mound they had seen two skeletons locked in each others arms lay in the shadow of the vehicle their tattered sneakers and the bleached white stalks of their legs protruded obscenely from beneath the covering dust you can wait over there for me if you want bernard said im going to try and figure out who they are aint much that upsets me chippy smith said they used a rag from the jeep to brush the dust away from the bodies the flesh had largely rotted or been eaten away from the two skulls but from the ragged clothing jewelry and what hair and gristle remained they were able to determine that what they were seeing had once been man and woman bernard knelt beside the two forms and caught a whiff of the fading scent of death he noticed the bulge of a wallet in the jeans of one of them and reached for it the pocket fell open at his touch richard colson santa barbara california he read sadly looking from the sniffing face in the drivers license photo to the grotesquely grinning skull chippy found a purse on the floor of the jeep and from the wallet inside they learned the name and face of colsons wife nicelooking couple he said any idea how they died none except i dont think they were shot how close are we to that charity place ten miles mbe bernard slipped the wallets into his jacket pocket think you could keep this a secret for a while he asked you police private he fished his id from his wallet and flashed it along with a hundreddollar bill that aint necessary chippy said pointing at the money ill jes take whacha owe for the flight an keep quiet bernard handed the bill over anyway i promise these folksfl get taken care of properly he said i just dont want anybody at the hospital alerted yet until i get a look at what theyre up to these two may not be connected at all with what im looking for but then again they just might the two men stood in silence for a time gazing down at the ghostly remains then they turned and headed back to the plane as the engine roared to life a scorpion crept out of the eye socket of marilyn colsons skull and scampered across to the safety of a nearby pile of rocks except for a single tiny window built at eye level into the steel door the room at the rear of warehouse was like a vaulta hollow cube of concrete perhaps twelve feet on a side in one corner of the room were a plastic bottle of water and an empty metal bucket presumably for holding human waste and along one wall was a stack of four quilted packing blankets for more than an hour laura enders had been alone in the room with her brotheror rather with what remained of his mind and body after whipping the two of them down with his pistol and coolly murdering the hobo named rocky lester wheeler had driven through a side gate at the docks and then around to the front of the warehouse the huge hangarhke doors had opened for them without a signal allowing wheeler to drive straight down a long aisle between packing crates to the back room there two menwhom laura recognized from her close call on the docks with ericundid the manacles binding her to scott and shoved her alone into the bleak cen several times over the hour that followed she heard her brothers sickening screeches from somewhere in the warehouse she pounded at the door screaming until her hands and voice could do no more then she sank down on the foulsmelling blankets and cried finally scott was thrown in with her moaning and barely conscious his breathing was even more labored than before and his face and hands were bloody when laura knelt to tend to him she realized that several of his fingernails had been torn off now as she paced from one side of the narrow prison to the other scott slept at times moaning at times crying out softly like a child she ached for his pain for his crippled body and memory and for the hopelessness of their situation and she struggled to ignore the gruesome fleeting wish that his breathing would simply stop outside the small window she could see men working as if nothing were amiss one of them drove a forklift transferring crates from one section of the warehouse to another several others wandered by laughing or talking or drinking beer one of them actually looked over at her and smiled damn you she muttered damn you all to hell she tore off a piece of her shirt dampened it and gently wiped scotts face his eyelids fluttered and then opened he focused on her with an ease that surprised her have they hurt you he asked no she said not yet did you tell them what they wanted to know i i dont think so right now that videotape is keeping us alive you do remember the tape then yes so much is still missing for me but i do know that the receivers locked in that aphrodite trailer just as you said and how much else do you remember scott winced as he propped himself up on one elbow some little scenes or details clear as day most things not at all i wish i could say i remember you but i really dont mire we close laura stroked his hair from his forehead yeah she said hoarsely we were very close he pushed himself up until he was sitting and leaned against the wall his eyes seemed to hold a remarkable power if anything he seemed stronger than when she had found him in rockys leanto weve got to get out of here he said what that cop is either going to use drugs or hes going to do something to you in front of me whatever it is we cant wait around to see scott there are a bunch of men out there and this place is like a fort theres no chance he pushed himself to his feet grimacing at the pain but refusing to cry out theres always a chance he said he tried unsuccessfully to stifle a thick cough laura stood in front of him can you move enough to do anything i made it this far didnt i laura heard the new forcefulness in his voice and knew that he had summoned it for her he was still so lost and in such pain they had taken nearly everything from him and yet he seemed able to reach within himself for more scott you know what you did for a living now dont you she said he forced a thin smile and touched the clotted blood on her cheek maybe he said maybe i do he peered out the window at the workmen tell me those big doors we drove through did they open upward or to the side to the side i think yesyes im sure of it they folded open in sections on a track scott glanced out the small window and then knelt by the door and studied the keyhole laura had to help him up bring that over he said motioning to the bucket she did as he asked do you have a belt on she pulled off her belt which was fairly wide and fastened with a metal buckle that had some heft scott tried undoing his own but his clumsy hand and torn fingers made the task impossible laura undid it for him what are we going to do she asked first were going to get this door open how i hope with that he said motioning to the metal bulb protector overhead theres a forklift out there weve got to get to it if we do ill drive jut dont depend on me to turn the key okay ookay scott i dont know if i can do this he looked at her for a moment then shrugged and said i think you can here hook these belts to each othet and then to the handle of the bucket then practice swinging it around in a way that will knock off that metal guard the bulbll probably shatter but thats okay well have enough light when that metal guard falls down grab it he peered out the window following the progress of the forklift start practicing and ill tell you when spread these blankets out beneath you in case the bucket hits the floor laura set the blankets in place dangled the bucket for a moment and then began swinging it in front of her in increasing circles like a lariat she found that if she held her arm at shoulder level she could just reach the light without hitting the floor while she was practicing scott coughed and spat some brightred blood onto the floor laura started to protest but he waved her off please he said we dont have much time before wheeler gets back and in this shape i dont think i can take him even if he gives me the chance he checked outside the window again now do it now and try to hit that thing hard if the bulb breaks without that guard falling down we may not have enough light to get at it laura started with a few slow arcs then she began whirling the bucket around increasing the speed and the length of the belts each time thats it thats it scott said the bucket grazed the metal keep going keep going lauras upper arms and shoulders began to cramp her smooth swings became weaker and more erratic dont stop he urged find the strength come on you can do it she bit into her lower lip and grasped the belt tightly with both hands increasing the speed of her swings her arms quickly grew numb and heavy the cramps worsened then at the moment when she felt she had to stop the bucket slammed against the metal guard popping it free and sending it clattering against the wall the bulb sheared off spraying small shards of glass across the room laura let the bucket drop soundlessly onto the blankets and then raced over and retrieved the protector that was good scott said pausing between words to breathe that was real good he studied the metal piece by the right of the window stamp on this as hard as you can i need a piece of it about this long laura set the guard on the concrete floor and stamped it flat the welds holding the stiff wire broke apart yielding several pieces of the length scott had indicated she snapped one off and passed it over he studied it briefly and then handed it back with scott directing her she pinned the metal beneath the lip of the bucket and bent two right angles into it and a loop handle at one end now put it in the keyhole with this end down and turn it slowly until you feel it catch laura knelt by the door as scott kept watch i dont feel anything she said push it in farther use both hands to hold it and use that little handle you built i cant feel anything wait wait a second the makeshift key turned half an inch keep going keep going i think youve got it there was a muffled click from inside the door laura released the wire and sank back on her hands smiling up at her brother nice job he said opening the door a fraction of inch theres a crowbar resting on some cases over there i need it youre going to carry that bucket you may have to hit someone hard with it can you do that laura glanced over at his hands i can do it she said she stood up and moved beside him carefully he eased the door open the area around them was deserted the lift is somewhere down there he whispered gesturing with his head well go straight across to where that crowbar is and work from there lauras heart was pounding in her ears as they slipped out the door closing it behind them and stepped quickly across the narrow aisle scott who had looked fairly solid while leaning against the wall stumbled and pitched heavily against the crates you okay she asked he slipped the crowbar free and halted it gingerly in his one functioning hand better now he said from somewhere to their right they could hear voices staying flat against the cases they worked their way toward the sound at one point they passed not ten yards from a pair of workmen without being seen scott moved painfully at times dragging his left leg even in the shadows laura could see the pallor of his face and the flecks of drying blood that dotted his lips and chin the voices were close nowvery close scott peered around the corner of a stack of crates and held up two fingers im going for the forklift he whispered head straight for the man in the cap and use that bucket he pointed to a spot just behind his ear thenhe reached up with his crippled hand and gently touched her face ready she put her arm around him and for a moment held him close ready she said they broke around the corner and headed straight for the two men one a heavyset black man was seated on the forklift the other wearing a woolen cap was several feet closer he turned at the sound of their approach and was fumbling beneath his jacket when laura swung the galvanized metal bucket with all her strength connecting solidly with the side of his face he cried out and fell heavily pawing feverishly at the gush of blood from just beneath his ear the man on the forklift had no chance at all scott lunged across the seat thrusting the beveled edge of the crowbar upward through the soft tissue beneath his jaw and then on through the bone of his palate the man slumped forward before toppling off the seat and onto the concrete floor scott fell back with the effort but just as quickly laura had him back on his feet she helped him onto the seat took her place beside him and turned the key the forklifts electric engine whirred to life at the moment they heard the cries and footsteps of approaching men scott spun the wheel to the right heading at full speed across the aisle by their cell and then left into the corridor leading straight to the huge front doors laura glanced over her shoulder just as several men rounded the corner behind them stay low scott yelled crouching behind the wheel the forklift sped ahead toward the doors as several shots were fired not there asshole someone screamed those are the goddam ammo crates his screaming was punctuated by a rumbling from within one of the crates suddenly the entire wall exploded showering the forklift with debris another explosion followed and then another the warehouse instantly filled with hot black smoke scott hunched over the wheel staring intently ahead ill be damned laura heard him say they were here they were here all the time she glanced over and saw him actually smiling they were less than twenty feet from the door behind them the exploding maelstrom continued then directly ahead of them lester wheeler stepped into view his pistol ready get down and hang on scott ordered the sound of wheelers rapid volley of shots was lost in the explosions but bullets clanged off the forklift an instant after the last shot they slammed against the warehouse doors at top speed the two central panels flew apart ripped free of their supports and crashed to the pavement black smoke billowed out from the gaping opening and moments later lester wheeler raced through stay down scott demanded looking back over his shoulder at the scene at that instant his head snapped oddly to his left and he pitched forward onto the wheel the forklift swerved right then left laura steadied the wheel with one hand as she pulled her brother free with the other his body was limp although his foot remained pressed on the accelerator then laura saw the holea small black rent in his forehead just above his right eye a trickle of blood had already begun to seep from the margins of the wound beneath the hole scotts eyes were glazed and unseeing no she screamed god no the forklift had skidded past an oildrum pyramid and out onto the long pier scott was totally lifeless except for his hands which still clutched the wheel and his foot which held fast on the accelerator behind them with the rumble of a hundred freight trains warehouse blew apart still steadying the wheel laura looked back a fireball of pitchblack smoke was rising from the destruction lester wheeler who had stumbled during the blast was scrambling to his feet you bastard laura screamed you goddam fucking bastard wheeler stopped leveled his gun at her and fired at the moment the forklift careened off the end of the pier scotts body lolled off the seat as the heavy machine yawed in the air and plummeted the fifteen feet to the harbor it landed on its side nose first hurling laura ahead as if she were shot from a cannon she skimmed several feet across the surface then hit the chilly water with dizzying force laura felt herself sinking beneath the weight of her sodden clothes but the icy chill almost instantly cleared her head and she struggled back to the surface scott was nowhere to be seen above her lester wheeler appeared at the end of the pier fixed his weapon on her once again and fired she ducked back beneath the surface as first one bullet then another skimmed past her face she had instinctively taken a decent breath and now she desperately forced herself to calm down and concentrate she was about four feet below the surface and was being maintained in calm perfect buoyancy against the salt water by her clothes this was her world she realized her element above her was the man who had just murdered her brother when it seemed he had nothing left scott had reached inside and found enough to save her now she had to do the same for herself she had to move then breathe then move again if she could just hold out and fight the cold she could beat him she could beat him ignoring the overwhehning chill and the air hunger burning in her chest laura forced herself down another two feet and kicked back toward the pier not yet she screamed to herself as she pulled ahead not yet not yet not yet water seeped through her nose and into her lungs still eyes closed she swam finally with her head pounding and her chest screaming for air she kicked to the surface the original buildings of metropolitan hospital of filled most of two blocks between the south end and roxbury sections of the city in the days before medicare and medicaid it was the busiest of all the boston hospitals at times running as many as five hundred patients a day through its emergency room now with a progressive drain to many newer facilities its patient load had dropped off and two of its three medical school affiliations had pulled out still with its location near the poorest section of the city there were plenty of severe trauma cases and medical crises with the er at white memorial inaccessible to him eric had chosen to use the frantic pace of metro to provide him with a weapon he could use to break down haven darden the ride there took fifteen minutesprecisely the same amount of time it took him to find a place to park he set the material taken from donald devines safe on the floor of the celica and entered the hospital through the main entrance the key to moving unnoticed about any hospital eric knew was simply to look and act as if one knew precisely what one was doing he also knew that the bigger and busier the facility the less precise one had to be his first stop was in the house officersquarters located on the fifth floor of a crumbling red brick building named for a nineteenthcentury surgeon and probably built not long after his death about half the doors on the floor were unlocked there was nothing of use in the first two rooms he checked opening another door he had actually stepped inside before realizing that a nurse and resident were on the narrow bed locked in flagrante delicto their uniforms in a heap on the floor the couple glimpsed him just as he was slipping back out the door pulled a sheet over their heads and giggled in the next room he tried eric found what he needed he undressed there and emerged wearing someones discarded surgical scrubs and a white clinic coat next he headed to the er he crossed the waiting room and entered the treatment area every room it seemed was in action a nurse hurried past taking no notice of him a second nurse smiled at him as she entered the room of a new trauma victim purposefully he continued down the busy corridor and into the med room which was deserted in less than a minute he was out his hand was buried in his clinic coat pocket concealing a filled cc syringe hooked to a inchlong gauge needle then casually he strolled from the emergency room back to the house officers building to change the game was on the drive from moab along unmarked dirt tracks took bernard nelson nearly three hours in his land rover before college nelson had spent six years in the marines most of those with a wilderness survival unit once during his training at camp pendleton he had been flown far out in the mojave desert by helicopter and set loose by himself with enough rations and water for two days the trip back to civilization had taken five days but the things he had learned about survival and about himself had proven well worth the danger he was sure the skills he had stored away were still there after finding the bodies of richard and marilyn colson he and chippy had flown to within distant sight of charity following their return to moab smith had drawn up a remarkably detailed map including sketches of varioos distinctive rock formations and arroyos now according to bernards compass and watch he was close enough to go on foot his safety net was chippy who had promised to fly out with help if twentyfour hours passed without word from him in addition to warm clothing was fuel and some food bernard had brought along his smith amp wesson and a new nikon with a telephoto lens with luck he could get close enough to the town to take pictures without ever having to go in it was midafternoon by the time he found a large overhang beneath which he parked his land rover and prepared his gear he slid his wallet and those of the colsons beneath the front seat and made his way toward the fields shielding charity near the top of the hill he crouched down and moved forward on his hands and knees he believed he had followed the pilots map to the letter but there was always the chance something had gone wrong flattening out even more he held his breath and peered over the crest below him perhaps a quarter of a mile away was the town using his telephoto nelson could make out several people working in a remarkably robust cornfield the village beyond seemed neat and well maintained staying low he dropped intoa dry creek bed and worked his way down at the edge of the field he knelt and watched as three men in work clothes trudged in slow silence back and forth from the tall stalks to a wheelbarrow loading it one ear of corn at a time through his lens bernard studied the mens faces each of which bore the expressionless mask of heavy tranquilizing medication fearing he was too close to chance the noise of a shutter he crawled along the dusty margin of the field and crouched down in a gully not twenty feet from the rear of the first structure the air was still and hot the town eerily siltnt carefully nelson withdrew his revolver and released the safety at that instant he heard a soft scraping noise behind him he whirled to see the butt of a shotgun flashing down from the dazzling blue sky it connected joltingly just above his right ear his teeth snapped together and pain exploded through his head then amidst an overwhelming flood of nausea he toppled face first onto the dry ground by the time his consciousness began to return bernard was face up in a wheelbarrow awash in his own vomit his head was tilted backward giving him a view of a mans groin his fingers scraped along the dirt roadway as they moved ahead dont move the man warned nelson choked briefly on some food and stomach acid and closed his eyes against the overwhelming nausea his spine pressed against the metal rim of the wheelbarow felt as if it were about to snap in two im not a threat to anyone he heard himself say shut up please listen to me the dirt changed to pavement nelson opened his eyes a crack he was being wheeled along a walkway through a gate in a chainmetal fence and up to a low cinderblock building please let me up he said get up yourself the man barked he dropped the handles and stepped back nelson tried rolling to one side but the wheelbarrow instantly tipped over pitching him heavily onto his chest waves of dizziness and nausea washed over him once again can i get up he asked do it slowly nelson propped himself on one elbow im not here to hurt anyone he said i know thats why youre carrying this the man waved bernards gun in front of the detectives face he was tall and angular probably in his early thirties and he had on cowboy boots jeans and two shirtsa black t and an unbuttoned flannel with the sleeves cut off stepping away he slid his shotgun out from beneath his belt you dont need that nelson said sitting up gingerly ill decide what i need and dont need get in there he motioned to the nearby doorway bernard stumbled to his feet went inside and sank heavily onto a metal folding chair the place sparsely furnished and undecorated smelled like a hospital what is this he asked ill do the asking the man said the moment his vision had cleared nelson had begun sizing up his captor his first instinct told him the man was not in any position of authority now he felt fairly certain of it my names nelson bernard nelson he said rubbing at the expanding egg behind his ear you surely know how to hit a man mr pike garrett pike he tossed over a towel and let nelson wipe himself off whatre you doing here i want to speak to whoevers in charge pike checked his watch youll get your chance in just a little bit he said do you have some ice i can put on this you dont need no ice i barely touched you some touch nelson said what is this place anyhow what does it smell like a hospital then thats what it is now what are you doing here bernard continued sizing up the man and liked what he saw garrettpike was slow but he wasnt dumb nor nelson decided was he any great threat im looking for someone a man he said can i reach in my pocket slowly bernard pulled out the flier with scott enderss picture and handed it over this man garrett pike did not respond but bernard could see recognition spark in his eyes and he knew his search was over never seen him before pike said youre a lousy liar mr pike but i like that in a man pike seemed flustered by his candor he glanced at the door as if hoping his boss would appear and relieve him of this responsibility he settled down in a chair across from nelson suppose we just wait n let you answer to dr barber hes in charge uhhuh tell me garrett bernard said anxious to take the offensive before dr barber or anyone else arrived do you really think this is a hospital i know it is then what are you doing holding this man here who just happens to be a government agent who disappeared in boston several months ago youre out of your mind i this place is for the criminally insane if he was herewhich he aintitd be because hes a danger to society and your being here with this gun tells me you were trying to bust one of our patients out nelson shook his head sadly garrett garrett he said have they really taken you in that badly you just shut up pike checked his watch once again nelson felt desperate to win the man over before anyone else showed up he thought about the gruesome discovery he and chippy smith had made he was grasping at straws but still listen he said do the names richard or marilyn colson mean anything to you there was a moment of telltale hesitation before pike said no why sensing the mans confusion bernard bored in i found their bodies out in the desert thats why you killem i i dont know what youre talking about i think you do i think they stumbled on this place and you killed themtook them out in the desert and shot em both dead i never heard of them pike listen to me my land rovers parkedjust over those hills there right behind the cornfield the colsons wallets are under the front seat along with my id im a private detective from boston tomorrow morning whether i show up in moab or not this placell be crawling with cops believe that help me now and i promise youll get a break i dont believe a word youve pike was cut short by the sound of car doors slamming a minute later two men entered the room bernard managed one last furtive look at pike but the guard just turned away dr barber pike said im glad youre back i found this guy spyinon the town takinpictures he says his names bernard nelson and he claims to be a private detective from boston he had this on him he handed over bernards gun he hesitated for a beat and then reached into his pocket he says hes here looking for this guy barber scanned the flier then clucked disapprovingly weve been expecting occasional attempts to break our patients out of here he said but nothing as crude as this good job garrett you can expect a doublesized bonus in your next check pike looked as if he were about to say something then he simply nodded and walked out take him in the back john barber ordered use the straitjacket the man named john a fullblooded indian from his appearance pulled nelson to his feet and shoved him rudely down the hallway into a twobed infirmary there nelsons legs were bound together and his arms forced into the sleeves of a canvas straitjacket that barely fit over his middle barber followed them into the room thats good john he said dont go too far the indian grunted a reply and left so then barber said what have we here an old fat man who carries a gun and a poster and claims to be a detective but instead he goes and gets himself caught by a bohunk with the iq of a rabbit its over for you barber nelson said evenly im not the only one who knows whats going on here barber looked around then where are they all he asked he paced about the room for a time then sat down on the bed nearest bernards chair so then suppose we start with the basics bernard nelson that really your name no nelson said its thumb first name tom nelsons initial read of the man was not encouraging there was nothing in his eyes but a flat sadistic coldness as if verifying the impression barber stepped forward and with one pudgy hand squeezed nielsons cheeks tightly against his teeth dont fuck with me he said pulling bernards face up ive given a good chunk of my life to this project and i expect to spend the rest of it enjoying the rewards so you better believe me when i say that i dont have the least hesitation in causing pain to someone like you who wants to make trouble for us now who are you and what are you doing here bernard waited until barber had released his grip look how about we trade he said you tell me what the hell is going on here and ill tell you how many dozens of people will show up here if i havent returned to moab by tomorrow youre bluffing my fat friend i can see it all over your face if anyone besides you was interested in this place they would have been out here with you today and as for the folks in moab they know this place is a hospital for the criminally insane and they dont care to know anything more nelson searched desperately for a soft spot in the man all he could come up with was the sense that he was confronting a fanatic with an enormous ego it was not much of a card to play but unfortunately it was the only one he held your man pike called you doctor he said is that a sham too like the hospital story md phd as a matter of fact barber said proudly there i did my bit now who are you really who sent you bernard nelson is my name im from boston im working for the sister of the man on that flier scott enders never heard of him i think you have maybe not by that name but i think hes here and i think he was brought here by donald devine barbers attempt to mask his reaction was too slow and he obviously sensed that very good he said good timing decent delivery im impressed what else do you know i know enough to tell you that the best thing you can do is come clean about whats going on here and hope that i believe enough of your story to help you deal with the authorities you help me barber began pacing again talk about chutzpah you sit there trussed up like a goddam thanksgiving turkey offering to help me then let me tell you something friend this is no flyby night operation youve stumbled onto theres more at stake here than you could ever imagine and minds a hell of a lot sharpef than yours have worked out a response for every contingency he took a small strongbox from a locked metal cabinet and withdrew a vial of powder and a pair of rubber gloves and right here just happens to be our response for this one the mans eyes were growing wider and wilder bernard had read the account of eric najarians night of horror and had no trouble making the connection to what he was experiencing it wont wash dr barber he said too many people know where i am i dont think so barber replied i think you came here snooping around because nobody knows anything for sure if anyone does show up we have certification for our facility and perfectly documented files on all of our patients you see weve been very very careful about that sort of thing now then what else do you have to tell me he slipped on the rubber gloves amazing stuff this he went on active if taken orally active if just rubbed on the skin absolutely amazing is that what you fed to the colsons barber stopped momentarily then he smiled and shook his head no good content decent delivery poor you found their remains somewhere out there in the desert and now youre pissing into the wind and hoping you wont get soaked he withdrew a small spatulaful of the powder from the vial moistened three of his gloved fingertips and carefully spread the powder on them better try something else im telling you nelson said desperately clinging to his crumbling facade of control too many people know they know about you about donald devine about the little room in devines basement everything the physician brushed the glove close to nelsons face bernard closed his eyes and instinctively pulled his head away i listen to you and i still hear bluff barber said you had better come up with something more pithy or i promise you youre in for a longor perhaps i should say a shortafternoon he glanced at his watch times run out mr nelson either you have shot your wad and you dont know anything more about us or youre not taking me seriously enough well sir let me tell you how this stuff works im primarily a research phd but as i said i am an m d as well and a very well trained one at that so i know what im talking about at this dose you will have about oh one or two hours before the air youre breathing starts to feel like molasses after that its just a matter of time your arms and legs will go numb and your guts will stop moving youll start coughing your lungs out finally your heart will slow to the point where your bloods hardly moving at all the only thing that will be working is your brain and that will keep working right up until near the very end at that point if i want to keep you around for say a little work in our cornfield i can stop the process and start you on the tranquilizers we usehat is if you even require them otherwise ill just get you a mirror and let you watch yourself terminate sound okay give it up barber nelson said but he heard the fear in his voice and could tell that the madman holding him could hear it too it was all happening too fast he hadnt expected it to be this way there has to be something i can do anything suit yourself barber said yes okay okay youre right i dont know whats going on here or who is involved beyond donald devine thats better mr nelson much better but people do know where i am as i said we can deal with that perhaps you can but then again perhaps not listen to me please if the work youre doing here is as important as you say im sure you dont want to jeopardize it ive got friend important friendsin politics and on the police force tell me whats going on here and what youre doing if you can help me understand whats at stake ill do everything i can to get the right people to understand barber continued pacing as he thought about the proposal then quite suddenly he kicked a folding chair close to bernard and sat down resting his gloved hand palm up in his lap mr nelson every day thousands of people are dying unnecessarily from dozens of socalled incurable diseasesdiseases like hepatitis influenza encephalitis and many forms of cancer and of course we both know that the world is on the brink of an epidemic that in just a few years will make the horror of the black plague seem like a cartoon detective what youve stumbled into here is a project which at this moment is this close to having an answer he held up his thumb and forefinger for emphasis what do you mean i mean a universal antiviral antibiotic thats what i mean the ultimate cure he nearly shouted the words then deflated noticeably when he saw the lack of comprehension on bernards face im sorry if i look confused bernard said trying not to glance at the mans hand i always thought penicillin was a pretty decent antibiotic barber groaned his impatience pearls before swine he muttered first of all penicillin is effective only against bacteria not viruses and second of all like the dozens of other antibacterial drugs on the market its useless against most organisms because they become resistant about as fast as you can get the stuff home from the pharmacy our drug not only kills the little beasties but changes in the body as fast as they do ergo no resistance it will save millions of lives and be worth hundreds of millions to you nelson thought he tried to appear impressed with what he was hearing but he couldnt shake the sinking feeling that barber was prolonging this purely out of boredom and the need to assure himself of his own importance in the end nothing bernard could say or do was going to move the man one iota tell me more he said barber smiled and stood up shaking his head i think not mr nelson he sang moistening his lips with his tongue i think not please wait bernard said gquinning in his seat i have some questions id like to ask you ah i had hoped youd be a little more intellectually stimulating being from boston and all i dont mind telling you youre a great disappointment in that regard a great disappointment sir i suppose you win simply have to find another way to amuse and educate me dont do it barber please listen to me this dose is roughly ten times what your friends the colsons received will it work ten times as fast will it work the same way will little nell find true happiness will e continue to equal mc squared continuing a stream of nonsense questions barber reached out grabbed bernards hair viciously with one hand and meticulously smoothed the damp powder across both his cheeks with the other at the mans touch bernard felt his heart stop and truly believed it was going to end for him right there moments later it began to beat again whether or not im here to see it youre through barber he rasped will the south riseagain the man went on in his chilling singsong voice will there be peace in the valley someday he turned scooped up the strongbox and left the room gripped by fear unlike any he had ever known bernard first tried to rub his cheek against his shoulder then he hurled himself to the floor attempting to scrape the powder off on the linoleum some of the poison did come off but he knew it was not nearly enough for a time he could only lie there silently praying that barbers performance was a rusehis version of the hideous charade that had been played with eric najarian but as minutes passed and he began to feel a heaviness settling into his chest he knew better im sorry maggie he said softly im sorry for being so damn stupid he struggled to his feet threw himself on the bed and rubbed what more he could from his cheeks onto the cotton blanket finally totally winded by his efforts he stopped im so damn sorry he said again helpless now bernard closed his eyes listened to the pounding of his heart in his ears and waited carrying donald devines ledgers eric entered white memorial through a littleused side door and took the subbasement tunnel and back staircase to haven dardens lab tucked carefully in the pocket of his jeans was the loaded syringe as the medical chief had promised the entire floor was deserted through the darkness of the lab eric could see light spilling from dardens inner office he paused by the outer door trying to solidify his composure and his resolve he thought about scott enders and loretta leone about lauras torment and reed marshalls shattered career about all those others who had suffered and finally he conjured up the images of the obscene makeshift voodoo shrine and of the deathshead priestquite possibly haven himselfleering down at him through the candlelight the man was fully deserving of the terror he was about to experience no mercy eric whispered as he opened the door no mercy at all he walked between a row of incubators and then turned left toward dardens office the medical chief natty as usual in a customtailored shirt silk tie and black suspenders met him at the door eric was pleased to see that he wore no suit coat come in eric come in darden said i was relieved to get your call im sure it comes as no surprise that your friends here at white memorial have been most concerned about you i didnt really feel i had any of those left eric forced himself to say oh you do you do darden sat down behind his desk but eric remained standing his hand cradling the syringe in his pocket he imagined the man making love to anna delacroix and sensed his anger and disgust grow even stronger haveia darden had a family children the womanhalf his age if thatwas beautiful enough to have any man how much was he paying her for her services what did he lay out for her assistance in destroying eric najarian no mercy sit down sit down darden said i dont mind telling you that the things you alluded to in your call have me most intrigued dont fool around dont wait id like you to look at this eric said setting devines ledger on the desk it was taken from a safe in the gates of heaven funeral home as darden opened the cover eric stepped behind him and slid the syringe out im not sure what im supposed to be seeing here darden said suddenly swiveling around to face him eric thrust the syringe back into his pocket it its the list beginning on the second page darden pulled open his desk drawer and reached inside its a gun erics mind shrieked mow dammit mole before he could react the medical chief pulled out a pair of reading glasses and slipped them on perhaps id do better if i could see the words he said turning back to the desk once again eric eased the loaded syringe free he focused on dardens left trapezius the heavy muscle just at the base of his neck a final deep breath and now in synchronized motions he shoved dardens chair in pinning him against the desk locked his left arm tightly beneath the mans chin pulled the plastic needle guard off with his teeth and drove the needle down to the hilt in the spot he had chosen darde cried out at the pain and tried to squirm free but eric held him fast he spat the needle guard onto the floor move again and youre dead he said i mean it what are you doing darden rasped this syringe is loaded with succinylchohne eric said two hundred miligramsenough to paralyze you totally in a matter of fifteen or twenty seconds at the slightest provocation im ready to give you every bit of it and you had better believe that yyoure crazy you bet i am doctor itll help us both if you remember that it would also help if you think about what its like to be paralyzed and unable to breathe while youre still wide awake surely youre an expert on that now first youre going to tell me where laura enders is and then youre going to tell me about caduceus i i dont know what youre talking about dammit eric rasped forcing the needle down harder i dont have for this the only person in the world i care about right now is missing and you know whats happened to her now i know who you are i know about donald devine and norma cullinet and that goddam place in utah i even know about anna delacroix my fuse is really short right now so im suggesting you stop playing games with me eric felt the tension in the mans muscles let up still he continued to hold him fast his thumb poised on the syringe eric listen to me darden said with sudden calm i know youve been through a lot you may think that what you believe is right but i promise you that i know nothing of what youre saying nothing and i suppose it wasnt you who called me the morning of the committee vote and promised me the position if i joined caduceus eric i have been your supporter in that matter all along i told you that several weeks ago it was dr silver who changed his mind and asked for an extension of the vote i swemto you it was i i dont believe you eric said feeling the first sickening doubt begin to take hold and i suppose i was just an in s when i saw you in a tender little just im m g g acroix clinch with anzdel i assure you eric i know no one by that name no one i am a happily married man now please pull that needle out of me before you do something youll regret for the rest of your life no youre a liar and a goddam monster theres no telling how many people have died because of you anna delacroix or whoever the hell she is set me up and i saw you with her on charles streetjust a few hours ago now i want the truth dammit where is laura shes dead doctor and dont move dont move a muscle eric barely managed to maintain his grip as his head spun toward the voice the tall man standing just inside the doorway was wearing a police captains unfforin and holding a gun leveled at erics chest suddenly his words registered what do you mean shes dead he asked a horrible emptiness swelling in his chest please officer haven darden cried this mans crazy please get him to pull this needle out hes trying to kill me oh i know what hes doing lester wheeler said why thanks to the miracle of modern telecommunications i knew what he had in mind almost as soon as he did you really should have paid more attention to the two men repairing the phone line outside that apartment you were staying in doc erics eyes narrowed wheeler he asked at your service now if you would be so kind as to administer that drug no wait you dont understand darden pleaded i understand exactly wheeler said unfortunately the good doctor has already shared far too much with you dardens not caduceus eric said loosening his grip around the mans neck before darden could respond wheeler leaped forward and with animal quickness slammed his fist down on the top of the syringe emptying its contents into him darden screamed in pain as the policeman whirled and jammed the muzzle of his pistol up under erics chin not a move he ordered jesus eric said you just killed this man no doctor wheeler said smugly you did he glanced at his watch and then looked down at darden who sat staring numbly up at the two of them fifteen or twenty seconds isnt that what you said i i dont know eric said now forced to his tiptoes by the gun barrel succinylchohne is the most powerful anesthetic we have but its onset of action is unpredictable i i never really intended to use it now please if youll just let me get to some equipment i can save him haven darden tried to rise but wheeler reached out and shoved him back into his seat please darden whimpered please help me already his speech was beginning to thicken and slur in just another ten seconds his arms and hands began to tremble no he cried oh god no wheeler forced eric several steps back as the medical chiefs body jerked spasmodically his head twitching uncontrollably then suddenly he pitched from his chair onto the floor his legs snapping and kicking in less than half a minute it was over the hideous contractions in his limbs vanished as quickly as they had appeared his head lolled to one side and stopped moving his cheek pressed helplessly against the linoleum spittle oozing from the corner of his mouth wheeler quickly manacled erics hands behind him then he knelt down and peered at darden for fully half a minute assuring himself that the drug had done its job okay now doc he said standing you and i are going right out the front door of this hospital to my cruiser if you want to scream and kick thats okay with me i want everyone who will listen to know what youve done and why im taking you in they all think youre insane anyway what happened to laura oh yes sweet laura well im afraid she and her brother discovered that the water in boston harbor wasnt to their liking she found scott she did they were even together at the end now lets get out of here you cant possibly get away with this eric said wheeler grabbed eric by the back of the neck and shoved him over haven dardens inert body and out the door wanna bet he asked yu have the right to remain silent lester wheeler said as he halfshoved halfdragged eric into the elevator of the research building if you choose to speak anything you say may be used against you in a court of law or other proceeding he pushed eric out of the elevator and into the bustling main thoroughfare of the hospital what happened to laura what did you do to her you have the right to consult with an attorney before answering any questions and you may have him present with you during questioning dammit wheeler give it up youre not taking me out of this hospital eric said increasing his resistance as they approached the main lobby do us both a favor and make a break for it wheeler whispered he continued in a voice loud enough for everyone around to hear if you cannot afford a lawyer and you want one a lawyer will be provided for you by the commonwealth without cost to you you understand what i have told you okay move aside folks please move aside the crush of bewildered earlyevening visitors parted like the red sea to allow the policeman and his prisoner to pass eric recognized several of the nurses and residents who were watching find dr silver for me please he called out as wheeler hurried him past youve got no friends around this place wheeler said least of all dr silver earlier today he had the hospital attorneys file a restraining order to keep you out face it youre finished he tightened his grip on erics arm and continued loudly you may also waive the not to counsel and your right to remain god damn it im not going with you eric screamed as they entered the busy main lobby instantly the huge reception area was silent a hundred or so people stopped miwng about and froze as one a security guard who was standing off to one side spoke quickly into his radio and began moving toward the two men eric stumbled forward and fell to his knees shouting words of protest wheeler grasped the handcuffs and pulled him to his feet by jerking his arms straight up behind his back eric hollered out in pain twisted his body to one side and fell heavily to the tiled floor bystanders tripped over one another trying to move away the guard reached them just as two more security men raced into the lobby can we help he asked wheeler the captain flashed his shield ive just arrested this man for the murder of dr haven darden he said his body is up in his lab several in the crowd gasped a woman cried out we know dr najarian the guard said he was alone with one of our nurses when she died this morning theres a restraining order out against him weve been on the lookout for him all day please eric begged still on his side on the floor youve got to help me i didnt kill anyone he did he did the two other security men arrived and spoke briefly with their colleague one of them immediately sprinted off for dardens office the remaining pair helped wheeler pull eric to his feet at that moment joe silver and two residents arrived im this mans chief of service he said what on earth is going on now he looked stonily at eric as he spoke captain wheeler bpd the officer explained calmly ive just arrested this man for the murder of dr haven darden by some sort of lethal injection haven is a personal friend of mine he called me a short while ago and told me najarian here had phoned and threatened him i hurried over to escort him home but when i got there i was too late i found this man with an empty syringe in his hand standing over havens body damn you najarian joe silver said i didnt do anything eric pleaded it was this man hes crazy hes working with dr darden craig serell was involved with them too theyre responsible for everything for norma for loretta leoneverything eric just shut up and get the hell out of here silver said come along now wheeler ordered and do it quietly i didnt kill anyone they did why doesnt anyone believe me i believe you haven darden said loudly the crowd fell away revealing the medical chief standing calmly beside the security guard now you must believe me that i had nothing to do with this caduceus or any other plot joe silver totally bewildered stared at the man what in hell is going on he managed as soon as you called sulcinylcholine an anesthetic eric darden went on i knew it was water captain wheeler is a criminal dr najarian meant only to frighten me this man tried to murder me and confessed to murdering someone named laura sir you are an animal before anyone could react lester wheeler drew his pistol and fired darden grabbed at his left shoulder as he reeled backwards and dropped to the floor people screamed falling over one another as they scrambled to find cover wheeler managed to get off another shot this more wild before the security guards were on him groaning loudly with every step he dragged the three guards toward the main entrance like a fullback hauling tacklers toward a touchdown two muscular young men raced from the crowd and helped wrestle him down suddenly itfrom within the melee wheelers gun sounded again immediately the struggling stopped the guards moved back the policeman on his knees toppled over in slow motion and lay wideeyed and motionless blood was rapidly soaking into his shirt from a dollarsized hole in his chest call a code ninetynine joe silver screamed at the receptionists someone get to the er and bring back two stretchers he raced over to where haven darden lay while the residents hurried to tend to wheeler the keys to these handcuffs eric said scrambling to where the policeman lay theyre in his shirt pocket the residents were already stripping wheelers clothes away the wound eric could see was almost certainly mortal even with immediate surgical help one of the guards retrieved the keys and freed erics hands a stretcher arrived and wheelers lifeless body was transferred to it and rushed to the er for a few frozen seconds eric stood alone trying desperately to sort out what had happened what had been said laura and scott both dead was wheeler telling the truth about that and dardehhow could he not be caduceus numbly he crossed to where haven darden lay joe silver had already ripped the mans shirt away exposing a wound that entered and exited through his shoulder darden though in obvious pain remained completely conscious and surprisingly calm you thought very quickly eric he said i always admired that in you i im sorry i had to do what i did eric said i was desperate and do you now believe that i am not part of this caduceus plot i dont know what to believe a stretcher arrived and eric and joe silver gently lifted the medical chief onto it perhaps darden said it would help if i told you that i know who your mysterious anna delacroix is dr silver if you could id like a minute alone with eric joe silver looked about uncomfortably perhaps id better stay he said i need to hear this too the battle to save the life of lester wheeler was shortlived eric stood by the doorway of the trauma room watching the monitor and the furious efforts of the thoracic surgical team and hoping against hope for the miracle that might save the one person who could tell him lauras fate in a room just down the hall joe silver was attending to the father of rebecca darden known to silver as ariel dumonde and to eric as anna delacroix haven darden would in all likelihood be silvers last case at white memorial as soon as he was certain the medical chief was stable silver had promised eric he would drive to the private psychiatric facility where reed marshall was being treated and offer marshall what help he could he would also strongly recommend that the hospital keep him on the emergency staff in some capacity then in the morning he would submit his resignation to the hospital administrators explaining to them how he had been seduced by a beautiful woman and later blackmailed by herinto changing his vote on the search committee he knew nothing of the reason he had been ready to delay the vote but with his own career marriage and children at stake he had made a choice he would now have to live with for the rest of his own life eric felt his heart sink as the surgeon working on wheeler shrugged stepped back from the table and flicked off the police captains monitor the lone spark of hope he had nurtured was gone at a loss for what he could possibly do next eric wandered down the hall to haven dardens room the medical chief alone save for a nurse was sitting up on his stretcher an iv draining into his wrist heavy bandages swathed his wounded shoulder is he dead he asked he is darden motioned eric inside and then asked the nurse to leave rebecca was always too beautiful for her own good he said she is that sir im sorry for what youre going through and i for what you are going through obviously as far as my daughter is concerned things are going to get much worse she has a great deal to answer fori hope she can shed some light on whats happened to laura i hope so too darden said his voice was husky and distant you know my wife and i began worrying about rebecca when she was still in grade school when we found she was getting other childrenboys mostlyto do things for her or give her things in exchange for kissing her or touching her or just being her friend we we brought her to haiti with us any number of times in hopes of breaking through her narcissism and insdmng in her some sort of social conscience she seemed like a different person thereso interested in everything so anxious to know the country there was no way to know that she would just take what we were giving her and he began to weep eric took his hand and held it youre a good man and a great doctor he said i dont know what to say except that you deserved better thank you is there any more you can tell me about what rebecca was involved in what those people were doing not precisely but when i amp know i promise you and i will sit and talk about it i would be grateful im very sorry about your friend i hope captain wheeler was mistaken about her i hope so too dr darden but i fear he wasnt do you think rebecca might be home now id like to call her she might she doesnt have a job you see never seemed to need one i should have asked her about the sports car and the furs and all the other things but please sir try to get some rest youve lost a fair amount of blood eric left the emergency room and headed through the crowded corridors to the proctor building and dave subarskys lab remarkably the hospital seemed perfectly normal as if the violence hed witnessed had never happened it was unlikely that dave had heard anything at all from laura but there was always the chance if there had been no word from her at least his friend could help him decide whether it was better to call rebecca darden immediately or try to confront her at the cambridge address haven darden had given him the research floor was largely deserted and the door to subarskys lab locked eric found one researchera young biochqkist named jessica marshlocking up for the evening excuse me he asked have you seen david he left a while ago the woman said do you have a key to his lab dave must have assumed i had mine but i left them at home i have keys to all the labs on the floor she said but im not allowed to please jessica eric implored dave was supposed to meet me here im sure hes left a note for me inside theres a call that might have come in on his phone that ive got to know about the woman hesitated please its very important eric urged listen youve seen me working here alone dozens of nights you know dave and i are friends reluctantly she pulled her keys from her purse and opened the door i shouldnt be doing this she said thank you jess you wont regret it as she was turning the key the phone inside began ringing eric raced inside slamming his thigh against the corner of a lab bench as he rounded it to the inner office he snatched up the receiver hello yes im trying to reach dr dave subarsky eric felt his pulse leap laura eric yes its me oh god ive been worried about you youve been worriedi thought you were dead i almost was eric its captain wheeler the policeman i told you about hes behind everything i know i know laura wheeler shot himself here in the hospital hes dead you dont have anything to worry about anymore where are you im at a house in east boston eric i found scott he wheeler killed him jesus oh laura im so sorry listen just tell me where you are ill come and get you you can tell me all about everything then im at this couples place not far from the docks they picked me up by the road i spent some time in the water and i was chilled to the bone but im okay now tell me the address he said feeling through the top desk drawer until he found a pen ill be right over you dont have to i spoke with your friend dave an hour or so ago i thought he would be here by now i was just calling to make sure he had left well hes not here thats strange maybe the traffic waswait a minute the doorbell just rang he might be here now yes yes its him eric

get this the tape is in an old tractor trailer right in the lot where we parked that day we went to the docks we were right next to it amazing were going to stop by and get it on the way back to boston where will you be i dont know how about bernards apartment perfect ill see you there in an hour or less and eric yes eric i love you i love you too kiddo eric hung up and leaned back in his chair his fists clenched his arms stretched upward the nightmare was over a few moments of quiet and absolute exultation and then he pushed back from the desk and stood up below him in the partially open desk drawer something caught his eyewmething that he must have pulled forward in his search for a pen he picked it up and halted it in his hand for a moment his mind i unwilling to accept what it was and what it meant but he knew what seemed a lifetime ago he had stood beside the occupational therapist as she demonstrated an electrolarynx for him his heart pounding eric pulled on the other desk drawers both were locked using a letter opener he forced the first of them open and spilled its contents onto the desk tucked among the computer printouts and lab reports was a fivebyseven color photo clearly taken in a tropical setting dave subarsky wearing a baggy surfers bathing suit stood leaning against a palm tree nearly dwarfed inside his arm her perfect body glistening in the sun was rebecca darden barely able to breathe eric forced open the bottom drawer and withdrew something enclosed in a brown paper bag his hands were shaking as he set the bag on the desk and ripped it open lying there glowering eerily up at him in the dim light of the desk lamp was the deathshead mask with a cry of pain eric snatched up a phone book paolini paretti what in the hell did she say their name was did she even say the name of their street he spent half a minute staring at the columns of names before shoving the book aside then he grabbed the hideous mask and bolted from the lab erics cab ride through the heavy evening traffic was an agonizing exercise in frustration beginning with a tieup on the mystic river bridge that stretched back almost to the hospital to make a bad situation even worse within minutes of his leaving white memorial a furious winddriven thunderstorm erupted sending torrents of water cascading down the access ramp and instantly flooding the roadway beneath overpasses strobes of lightning flashed through the taxi as the cabbie pawed at the thickening film of condensation on the windshield after three fruitless attempts at convincing the man that this was an emergency worth taking risks for eric forced himself back into his seat fidgeting constantly as he stared out through the pounding rain if as he suspected subarsky and lester wheeler had coordinated their efforts laura was in a situation as potentially lethal as his had been except for the question of why the final pieces of the caduceus nightmare had fallen into place and now through the twentytwenty vision of hindsight eric cursed himself for not seeing his friends involvement sooner the biochemists insistence on accompanying him to the gates of heaven his appearance in the hospital library at just the right moment his knowledge that eric would be at the county and finally his convenient disappearance just before norma cullinets deaththe signposts were all there clear as fucking day it had undoubtedly been daves idea to try to enlist him as craig worrells replacement in caduceus and daves finger that had been on his pulse ever since why hadnt he seen it why hadnt he at least considered the possibility the cabbie inched along the bridge and then stopped unable even to change lanes eric gauged the distance across to east boston and knew they had no chance it was perhaps half a mile to the exit and another half a mile to the docks leaving the deathshead mask on the seat he shoved a tendollar big into the plexiglas scoop raced from the cab and dodged between cars to the narrow sidewalk before he had sprinted even a dozen yards he was soaked to the skin rain lashed at him as he bounded up the steep grade toward the crest of the bridge far below the harbor and city flashed like white gold beneath sharp volleys of lightning by the time he reached the downward slope of the span he had slowed to an awkward trot pulling in the moist exhaustfilled air with desperate gulps a stitch of pain became a knife cutting into the side of his chest every stride seemed the last he could take every breath a hand twisting the blade still he ran down the narrow exit ramp and over the mcardle bridge across the chelsea river finally as he stumbled onto meridian street on the east boston side he had to stop propped against a telephone pole he gasped for breath begging the pain in his side to abate the parking lot was just a few hundred yards away if laura and subarsky were there he had to be ready gradually the stiff ache in his chest subsided his breathing grew steadier he pushed himself away from the pole and walked quickly along the dark side of the street cars and trucks sped past showering him with street water as he neared the lot he began casting about for something he could use as a weapon subarsky was inches taller than he was and perhaps seventyfive pounds heavier erics main advantage in any match with the man would be surprisethat and the mounting rage he was feeling for all he and laura and so many others had been put through the best his brief search could produce was an empty whiskey bottle still it was something the lot was just ahead it was cut into a tree and brushcovered slope that paralleled the roadway and was dimly lit only by a streetlamp diagonally across the road near the dock area eric crouched low and made his way to the edge of the trees through the persistent driving rain he could make out the two decker hulks propped up on railroad ties at the farside of the lot otherwise the place appeared deserted cursing the situation and trying to sort out what his next move should be eric slogged through the muddy puddles to the waers one had only a faded shield and the letters d amp e painted on the side the other at least at one time had been the property of the aphrodite moving and storage company both the trailers were rusted well beyond any practical use other than storage perhaps the rear doors were gone from the d amp e trailer and its wooden floorboards were splintered and decaying even from several feet away and through the rain eric could smell the odor of stale urine coming from inside the aphrodite trailer which was intact and in much better shape was secured with a bulky padlock eric halted the surprisingly heavy hardware in his hand as he weighed the possibility that he was in the wrong place against the likelihood that he had somehow beaten laura and subarsky to the spot there was of course a third optionthat the two of them had already been and gone but he refused to allow himself to consider that he checked beneath the trailer searching for some sort of trapdoor and was walking around to the front end when twin spears of headlight swung into the lot and stopped not twenty feet behind the trailer eric flattened himself against the side and inched along to his right until he was concealed from view even through the gloom he could discern the distinctive silhouette of a saab mirbosubarskys car eric had been in the saab a yeardd convertible any number of times why had he never even wondered what a man constantly scrambling for research grants was doing with such elegant transportation he slipped around the railroad tie supports and ducked under the trailer from that vantage on his knees and elbows in the mud he could make out only the lower half of the saab he wondered if laura was inside five minutes passed with no movement from the car and no sound other than the steady rumble of rain on the metal roof eric began to shiver from the inactivity he grasped the neck of the whiskey bottle and was trying to formulate some sort of plan when the car door opened and closed a man in a kneelength poncho stepped out into the downpour and approached the trailer from his walk and the size of his boots eric could tell it was dave eric edged to his left and was nearly out from beneath the trailer when he was transfixed by the beam of a powerful flashlight hey amigo subarsky called out down the full length of the trailer how nice of you to be here to welcome us eric shielded his eyes against the glare is laura with you he shouted back she is yes but when i caught sight of you scampering around as we pulled in i decided that perhaps i might do well to truss her up a bit i assume you know by now that you werent really supposed to be in any condition to get here wheelers dead so your beautiful friend here told me nice going buddy damn fine work i told him outthinking you wasnt going to be that easy but hes always been an arrogant son of a bitch he was arrogant when he busted me for dealing at mit and then he was arrogant enough to suggest he become my business partner ill bet dollars to doughnuts he died arrogant too give it up dave eric said now that i dont even have to split the profits with supercop you cant be serious i wish i could consider taking you on in his place caduceus and the charity project could still use a guy with your panache but now i fear i just wouldnt ever be able to trust you whats the charity project the beam of light went off in the seconds it took for erics eyes to adjust it was shining on his face once againthis time from just a few feet away its the key to the kingdom thats what subarsky said dsnineteenthe drug that time and the fops in washington forgot the dnabound antibiotic i thought you gave up on that oh no my friend the shortsighted pawersthat be did i always knew they were wrong so i just stepped back and retooled put me together a quality team with vision and set about making dsnineteen a reality now then why dont you just wriggle on out here and well find someplace a little drier to continue our basic science seminar without hesitating eric swung the bottle as hard as he could the glass exploded against the flash shattering its lens and bulb and sending it flying out of subarskys hand hey race move subarsky cried but i thought you wanted to hear about my antibiotic eric had already spun around and scrambled out from under the trailer on the other side he splashed back to the saab laura her mouth sealed beneath a broad piece of adhesive tape stared out at him helplessly she was lashed by her wrists to the steering wheel and a single piece of rope across her throat pinned her back against the headrest eric was trying to kick in the passenger window when subarsky stepped up beside him please he said dont do that dont do that i have a fivehundreddollar deductible that doesnt coven eric took a roundhouse swing at his face subarsky blocked it with his forearm then cahnly shoved eric backward at least ten feet and down into the mud im sorry this is happening old friend he said if i hadnt had to go back to my apartment to get these magic keys to use on that heman lock over there you would have missed us and you wouldnt be nearly so muddy eric pushed himself to his feet subarsky circled around and cut him off itfrom the road but eric knew he neednt have bothered as long as laura enders remained the mans prisoner he was never going to run one way or the other it was going to end right here dave he said trying to stall until some idea some flicker of an advantage came to him how can you hurt so many people just to develop a goddam drug hey watch your tongue fella use any delaviniz tactic you want i like that and id expect nothing less from you but dont stoop to calling dsnineteen names were talking about a living antibiotic herean antibiotic that kills viruses and keeps killing them because it mutates as fast as they do it didnt work thats why no agency would fund its development didnt work in a test tube or a culture bottle subarsky corrected but tinker with it tighten a nut here a bolt there and stick it into a living infected person and whainmo the field is suddenly bloody with little teeny virus corpses includingwe are about to provethe one that causes youknowwhat impressed eric squinted across at him and in spite of himself realized that he was impressed the government grant agencies had clearly underestimated the mans genius faced with possibly the most lethal epidemic the world has ever known they had blithely cast off one of the few scientists equal to the challenge so eric said the tetrodotoxin was your tool for diverting nonextofkin patients to your place in utah get em pronounced dead and then get em out of town i wish it were that simple i tried using that doggone toxin in every way shape and form i could but in the mind only the houngans could do it right can you believe it a phd in biochemistry from mit and ive had to imrort my stuff from a bunch of witch doctors enter rebeca darden ah you know about my little island princess too eric you are really quite a guy if you know i assume ol haven knows as well not yet but i plan to tell him subarsky laughed merrily at erics bravado i wish you hadnt said that pal because now that makes you a real threat you see i dont think ol haven would approve of me he wouldnt be in the minority oh stop it be witty or be silent eric glanced about for a board or rock but saw nothing he could use behind subarsky traffic continued splashing along meridian but no one even slowed a police cruiser was about the best he could hope for he decided to continue stalling for as long as his adversary would allow so rebecca darden uws the contacts her father helped her make in haiti and gets the powder for you subarsky slapped a spray of water from his beard she does that yes he said but mostly she uses her contacts to get cocaine for me and lester to sell cocaine and some of the best poppy this side of istanbul how in the hell else was i going to finance tim my work lester and i tried doing it for a e with weapons but as our operations grown we just havent been able to generate enough business to meet our overhead so we decided to diversify we havent abandoned the weapons business but cocaine is much easier to handle than uzi semiautomatics know what i mean damn sight better markup too jesus david you are sick how did you make a thug like wheeler understand something as complex as dsnineteen simple subarsky said i just told him that the real name of the drug was money once its perfected we bargain for amnesty if we need to and then name our priceas in eight zeros maybe even nine oil lester understood that kind of science believe me he did so we skim enough from our business endeavors to maintain life and limb and keep sweet rebecca in shoes and then we throw the rest into the project the way things are going out in charity another year maybe two is all its gonna take i dont believe it frankly eric im very ticked off at you so i dont really give a damn what you believe things were going mighty smoothly until your friend in there showed up and turned your head now with most of my teammates gone we may have to consider a relocationwhole new players and even a new base hospital he sighed theatrically still i have managed to salt enough away to take rebecca on a sabbatical if i find i must you are really sad david youre damn right i am subarsky shot back his tone suddenly much harsher im sad because thanks to you i may have to retool again and im sad because im getting soaked and catching a chill standing here talking to an old pal from watertown who doomed himself by being too goddam smart for his own good he reached his long arms up like an attacking grizzley and took a step forward now he said since the lovely laura over there is absolutely positive that a certain video is locked in that trailer and since the wellknown chap buying poppy and blow from us on that tape is waiting to reward me handsomely for it suppose you just let mehead down eric charged the man hurling himself through the rain at his chest flailing with his fists at subarskys face subarsky stumbled backward enc lashed out again connecting solidly with his cheek then subarsky reached out and effortlessly shoved him back to the ground happy now he said is it out of your system eric looked up he had hit the man with everything he had yet subarsky was merely standing there licking at a small tear in his lower lip and smiling at him through his beard eric tried another onslaught but the advantage of surprise was gone subarsky grabbed him by the front of his jacket and slammed him against the trailer as if he were weightless erics head snapped against the metal door his arms and legs instantly went limp and he dropped into a muddy puddle before he could fight through the dizziness to react again subarsky was on him kneeling on his back he pulled erics arms behind him and tied them with a short length of clothesline then he knelt heavily on the back of erics thighs and tied his ankles with similar quickness and ad right then he said making no effort to ron eric over or remove him from the puddle there being no further objections i move we take out the magic key set and find the one that fits this bozo lock do i hear a second david dont hurt us eric said rolling onto his side it wont help anything to hurt us says you subarsky mumbled peering through the downpour as he sorted through a sophisticatedlooking ring of keys and oddly bent wires why just wrecking my flashlight the way you did carries the goddam death penalty david please now just shut up little fella sit back in your puddle enjoy the last few moments of your earthbound existence and watch a master locksman at work believe it or not these beauties were made by one of the engineering students at mit he sold them for a thousand bucks a set and was ready to retire by the time he graduated theres nothing they cant open he selected one of the keys examined it and then gently inserted it into the opening at the base of the padlock although there was a brand name of some sort diestamped onto the oddly shaped padlock it had become known around plan b as the scottlock out of deference to scott enders who had designed it the actual keyhole was well concealed beneath a small sliding panel at the top of the apparatus the keyhole at the bottom was another piece of business altogether as dave subarsky worked the key he had selected in up to its hilt the metal tip completed an electrical circuit between a tiny lithium battery and a wireenclosed plastic capsule in seconds the heat from the wire had melted the plastic releasing a single large drop of concentrated hydrochloric acid subarsky was dramatically humming a fragment of bachs concerto no in e and gently jiggling the key when the hydrochloric acid first touched the wad of chemically treated plastique explosive wadded into the base of the lock he was bending over peering at the keyhole when the apparatus exploded eric watched in stunned horror as in an instant both of subarskys hands and a good portion of his face were blown away bellowing insanely pawing at the remains of his eyes he stumbled backward he was still on his feet after absorbing a blast powerful enough to have actually blown a large hole in the metal door eric rolled over in time to see subarsky still shrieking incoherently reel blindly past the saab and onto meridian avenue the driver of the oncoming sixteenwheeler high on cocaine he had bought from a dealer in cambridge never saw the figure lurch out of the shadows and onto the road nor did he feel the impact when the reinforced steel grilleguard of the truck slammed into the man full force what remained of the genius biochemists right arm became entangled in the metal grate as the semi roared on through the rain the young driver immersed in a guns and roses tape sang along as he drove unaware of the huge grotesque ornament suspended just below the mack bull dog on his hood fighting the rain and a sudden profound exhaustion eric took nearly fifteen minutes to work free of his bonds then using a rock he smashed in the passenger window of the saab a minute later he and laura were inside the trailer the video receiver was on a crate in the front left corner it was enclosed in an oilskin sack and its wire antenna had been brought out through a tiny hole drilled in the trailer wall here eric said handing the tape over i think you should be the one to turn this in that lock was the second time today that scotts saved my life laura said they huddled together in the it eras she told him about finding her brother their subsequent capture and escape and scotts death she eluded lester wheeler and his men by swimming underwater from one pier to the next finally nearly unconscious from the cold she had stumbled up the bank and onto the roadway an elderly woman and her husband on their way home from the market had picked her up and brought her to their home ive got a bit of a story to tell you too eric said but unless i get some dry clothes on soon i may end up getting pneumonia and being taken to white memorial hospital and we all know what happens to people who are brought there not anymore it doesnt laura said she jumped off the trailer and helped him to follow epilogue the tenseat leariet swooped down through the cloudless midmorning sky like a falcon leveling off sharply at feet inside the cabin five passengers pressed their foreheads against the windows and peered through the glare across the stark san rafael desert each one anxious to catch a first glimpse of charity utah weve sighted the town mr harten the pilot said over the intercom about five miles ahead at ten oclock weve been cleared into moab so if its okay with you ill make a couple of passes at this altitude and then head over to the airport within three hours of receiving lauras call at his home in laurel virginia the head of communigistics international had the governmentowned jet on the ground at bostons logan airport by am the lear was airborne once again streaking west sharing the cabin with neil harten were an associate of his from plan b named thorsen plus eric laura and maggie nelson twentyfive hundred miles away they knew bernard nelson lay unconscious hooked to a ventilator in the intensive care unit of the hospital in utah and from what eric had learned from his conversation with the attending physician the detectives condition was not good their odyssey had begun with an earlymorning phone call to maggie nelson from a man named smith in moab from what she could tell her husband had succeeded in finding and penetrating the facility at charity utah only to be poisoned by the head of the operation there a physician named barber details of nelsons subsequent rescue by a charity employee named pike were sketchy but apparently barber had been shot and wounded in the process and another employee killed although he was conscious when the ambulance arrived at the town during the ride to moab bernard had slipped into a coma maggie nelsons first move had been to call laura at bernards boston apartmentnow the travelers stared down in awed silence at the fantastic scene below the town barely a smudge on the massive landscape was surrounded by police cruisers and ambulances dozens of people were milling about along the single main street others lay on stretchers outside a low cinderblock building the pilot made two wide swings overhead giving those on each side of the aircraft a good look then he banked to the east and shot across the rugged desert toward moab seated next to gil harten at the rear of the plane eric briefed him on what he knew of the poison tetrodotoxin with the intervention of haven darden the hospital administration had allowed eric to search the offices of dave subarsky and norma cullinet in a locked box in the nurses desk he found a number of ampules of intravenous adrenaline he also retrieved two of what appeared to be babyfood jars each about halffilled with a coarse grayish powder one had a small stickon label reading simply t and the other d when confronted with the find and a brief explanation of his daughters role in the charity project haven darden picked up the phone and asked eric to wait in the corridor outside his hospital room after just a few minutes he called him back inside my daughter says that the powder labeled t is what we suspected he said there was great sadness in his eyes but also undisguised relief in his voice that rebecca had agreed to cooperate the other is some sort of substance to reverse the effects of the toxin rebecca says that the dose of the antidote is between two and five grams and that her cohorts had been dissolving it in saline and administering it intravenously they also used large doses of adrenaline but she has no idea of the amount most of the work was done in the monitoring room at the mortuary later this morning she has agreed to go with my wife and our attorney to the police im sorry you and your wife have to go through this sir eric said darden shrugged who knows how much of a childs behavior is the fault of the parents he said perhaps in the long run some good will come of all this for her and for us the antidote dissolved readily in sterile saline working on his tray table in the plane eric used a small scale to measure out the dose haven darden had suggested and then carefully drew it up into a large syringe an iv injection of an unknown unsterile powder is not my idea of fun he said but i can always treat any infection that results whats your sense of the doc in wab harten asked he seemed okay but he wasnt too excited about administering the dose of adrenaline ive settled on together eric and den had maewed reed marshalls resuscitation efforts on loretta leone and had detennined that his aggressive approach and repeated use of the drug had almost certainly begun reversing her toxicity and increasing the speed and force of her cardiac contractions even while she was awaiting autopsy belts on tray tables up everyone the pilot broadcast were landing are you going back up front with laura harten asked eric shook his head throughout the early portion of their flight harten had sat with her candidly answering questions and sharing information about her brothers life of dangerous service over the hours that followed eric had seen the reality of scotts death take hold she needs a little time by herself he said is she going to stay in boston i hope so a soft squeak of the lears main gear signaled the perfect landing in moab a police cruiser and two cars raced out to bring the passengers to the hospital hand in hand with laura and maggie nelson eric hurried up the walk and straight to the icu the local internist had done a remarkable job of holding bernard together although the detective was still unconscious his blood pressure had begun responding to the massive adrenaline doses the man had given and his kidneys had already started working neil harten and the others waited in the family room as eric huddled with the internist while they were administering the tetrodotoxin antidote and another dose of adrenaline a stretcher bearing another patient was wheeled into the icu eric moved to help evaluate the new arrival and found himself staring down at the man who had once been his boss craig abrrell drawn and filthy stared blankly up at him with rheumy jaundiced eyes his temps oneohfour the ambulance attendant offered looks like fulminant hepatitis eric said to the internist this mans a doctor from white memorial in boston he was part of that caduceus group i told you aboutat least he was before he got into trouble at the hospital i guess this is part of the caduceus earlyretirement plan he looks bad maybe that dsnineteen wasnt working as well as subarsky said it was you want to work on him eric asked not really but i will ill stay with nelson in just half an hour bernard nelson began to show signs of responding to the treatment harten and his associate headed off to investigate charity firsthand while laura and maggie nelson took up a vigil at bernards bedside two hours passed during which several cardiac crises arose laura clutched maggies hand tightly as they watched eric move from one side of the bed to the other checking bernards physical condition evaluating lab reports and the monitor pattern and then calmly issuing instructions to the nurse and she knew that regardless of what lay ahead for the two of them she would never lose the admiration she was feeling for him at that moment over the next hour bernards condition seemed to stabilize the need for erics intervention grew less frequent laura could see the deep lines of tension across his forehead begin to recede finally four hours after their arrival bernards eyes fluttered open minutes later he reached up and pointed to the endotracheal tube imploring eric to remove it has he made it maggie nelson asked eric took both her hands and helped her up then he hugged her you married one tough guy mrs nelson he said hes a real bear i know she said he stepped back while she bent over spoke a few words to her husband and gently kissed him on the cheek then he sent the two women out of the room and motioned the nurse in laura watched from a distance as eric whispered in the detectives ear then quickly pulled out the polyethylene breathing tube bernard sputtered and gagged as the nurse suctioned out his mouth and pharynx for a minute there was total silence as eric stood by to replace the tube at the first sign of trouble then bernard cleared his throat anyone got a cigar he croaked one by one those charity inmates needing the most vital care were brought into moab the rest were transferred to other facilities eric worked through the night alongside the hospital staff and other vestiges of malnutrition shortly after dawn the next left maggie nelson with her husband at the motel where she was staying they walked along the large town to the south the sun day sparkled off the rich red clay of this place is so beautiful she said and the hospital seems very good for a place this size it is eric said laura locked her arm in his think youd ever consider working here she asked i think my lowest gear may still be about ten times higher than the highest one id ever need here well maybe thats just what you need he held her close maybe ill tell you what if we ever get tired of boston and white memorial ill think about it good because i understand real estate around boston is through the roof and here theres a whole town for sale just a little ways down the road
