heart of danger gerald seymour prologue back again yes he was back again back again in library a smile for the supervisor that was not returned as it had not been returned on either of the two days that he had been in library the previous month nor the two days of the month before that henry carters smile was brief just enough to be polite he looked for a table that was free train was late im afraid he said mildly he wiped the rain from his scalp its a dreadful service he was the interloper really an unwanted male in a feminine world and he supposed that he inhibited conversation on men cystitis brassieres mortgage rates curtain hanging school meals gilts versus equities tampons whatever women talked about these days the table that was free was placed furthest from the small supply of natural light permitted to filter through to the half basement floor of library pretty poor light anyway because the windows were of blastproof glass that distorted and were coppertinted to block the electromagnetic signals from the computers being monitored by any electronic surveillance from across vauxhall bridge different from his day seemed to have managed without leadlined rooms and coppertinted windows and computers in silicon casings and fingerprint recognition locks on interior doors managed pretty well and kept a few secrets he should not complain he found space on the coat stand for his overcoat his pension even indexlinked was inadequate he stood his umbrella dripping against the wall the two days a month back in the library were welcome well damned necessary at the free table watched by the girls and the women and their day shift supervisor he unlocked his briefcase the old one of course the one that he had carried day in and day out for twentythree years from waterloo station and along the pavement beside the river and into the concrete tower of century house with the eiir gold print faded from the flap the morning newspaper crossword started on the train was first out then his sandwiches cheddar and pickle and made by himself then his thermos milk and sugar and sufficient for four measures then the magazine of the royal society for the protection of birds a pleasure to be saved for the hours statutory lunch break if the rspb had been prepared to have him for more than a single day a week working on their membership register then he would not have needed to grovel in gratitude for two days a month in library the supervisor stood over his table she had the file in its cardboard folder clasped to her shallow bosom she apologized without sincerity its a bit of a mess well there were so many files these days that were a bit of a mess old files needed tidying and editing before being fed to the computer disks henry carter was good at tidying and editing which was why he was called back those two days a month and sat at a table away from the natural light he supposed that the women regarded the parttime labour as a threat to their own work security because there was never a greeting never any friendship i expect we can sort it out interesting one is it i wouldnt know the file was dropped on the table she turned and walked away from him clattering her heels on the composite flooring there had been carpeting in library at century house carpet had been good enough for the old building not for the babylon on thames that was the new monstrosity at vauxhall cross too vulgar too flash for a headquarters building for the secret intelligence service inappropriate he peeled the elastic band from the files folder words typed and handwritten and printed were leaping at him he looked up at the ceiling at the battery of recessed lights a little indulgence but henry carter lived with nostalgia somewhere close by perhaps in the annexe perhaps already transferred to disk would be the files of operations that had involved him from the start when he had not just been the road sweeper hired at an hour for sixteen hours a month to clear the litter of others a little tremor as there always was when he indulged himself no need for a retired hasbeen some neverwas to be called in to sift the files of henry carters operations he recalled the days when he had controlled a man sent across the inner german border to magdeburg he remembered the night long interrogation when he had reduced a desk head one of their own to a weeping and shamed creature decent files he had left behind him he they were watching from behind their silly screens it would have been a good day to have been up on the former railway line at tregaron midwales because it was just the right time of year for the rare red kites milvus milvus to be feeding glorious birds he dropped his head he began to read the file was indeed a mess no order and no shape he turned the pages fast fifteen typed sheets four faxes nine foreign and commonwealth office signals thirteen foolscap sheets covered by three different sets of handwriting and a buff envelope of photographs the old desk warrior gutted the pages his training taking over henry carter would have said if he was asked and he never was that there was a narcotic addiction from a file that was fresh to him he was hooked caught almost without looking up he called to the supervisor id like a map please of what because of what he had read because of the images already in his mind a scratch of irritation clawed him it was not a joke nor was it mischief hardly the sea front at bognor regis no thank you large scale if thats possible former yugoslavia what they call croatia the area that the united nations protection force designates as sector north he turned back the sheets of paper spread now haphazardly across the table he was reaching for his thermos flask and henry carters elbow the leather patch on his sports jacket caught the envelope that held the photographs the envelope fell from the table the photographs spilled he looked down at them he looked down onto the grotesque image of the young face worse than those of the old man shot to death on the ploughed strip beside that revolting german fence worse than those of the hanged iranian woman suspended from a hideous construction crane in tabriz he shuddered he barely heard the shrill voice a map like that youll have to wait until tomorrow for it cant get it before tomorrow you know mr carter its not our job to he bent to pick up the photographs he gazed into the face he wondered if she had been pretty before the decay of burial had swollen the features his fingers were scrabbling for the photographs and were unresponsive and he felt the cold sweat streaming to the small of his back his body weight swayed in the chair he gulped deep air he lifted the photographs onto the table and then he gripped the edge of the table that he might restore his balance too damned old for it the voice beat at him are you all right mr carter the woman at the computer desk nearest him giggled out loud it was the giggle that probably saved him from fainting it made his anger surge it was rare for him to let his temper show the woman was feeding her face with squares of milk chocolate he took the photograph that was second from the top of the pile and walked the five strides briskly to the womans desk and he laid the photograph on her keyboard a photograph of a young face with a head wound and a throat wound and a closequarters bullet wound the woman belched chocolate over her blouse henry carter went back to his table he called across the silence im fine thank you tomorrow would be grand for the map he settled for a moment he drummed his fingers on the table surface then he reached again for his thermos and poured himself a halfmeasure into the plastic cup he drank he took from his briefcase a bag of sharpened pencils and biro pens in three colours the moment had passed it was as if the photographs had ambushed him he began to search the sheets of paper for date stamps and he laid them out over the width of the table and then began to number them in red from the first date wouldnt take him long to knock the file into shape if the map came he would most certainly be finished by tomorrow lunch time that would be excellent it would give him time to be out of london before the afternoon rush for home and on the road comfortably for the powys mountains and the railway line from which the red kites milvus milvus could be seen the date stamp on the first sheet of paper was april for a moment idly he tried to remember what he would have been doing that day twentythree months before and failed the paper was letterheaded physicians for human rights it was easy for him to picture it there was a milage and a lane and foul mud and a grave one the area for the digging was outlined by a rude rectangle of white tape the rectangle was approximately ten metres by four metres as measured out by the professors full strides it had been easy to recognize the rectangle where they had dug because only weeds had grown in that disturbed corner of the field around the edge of the rectangle heaped on the grass beyond the white tape was the new boundary marker of piled muddy earth four policemen had done the digging at the professors direction the longhandled spades with the wide blades were now tossed onto the low mud wall the four policemen and the professor knelt in the pit they had made when they had started their overalls had been pure white they were now smeared in the greyblack mud of the field there was no talking amongst the policemen and they responded only to the curt instructions of the professor each could recognize that the light was starting to fall and would go quickly because the rain cloud was already below the level of the summit of the wooded hill that rose above the farmhouse they had the one chance to excavate and exhume and the chance would not come again and they had brought no portable generator and no lights it must be finished that afternoon the rain spat on them beat at their shoulders and their buttocks and at the backs of their knees the rain made muddied pools in the pit around the bodies that were already retrieved if the professor had been working at home if he had been called out by the police departments homicide team then he would have been protected by a tent of stout tarpaulin if the professor had been working at home crouched over the cadaver of a murder victim then he would have had his own team with him all expert and there would have been no pressure of time there was a way of doing things there was a pattern of procedure and he abided by the procedure because that was the bible to which he worked he thought they were fine men the four policemen with whom he uncovered the corpses the tall young canadian and the cheerful frenchman and the droll balding portuguese and the slimwasted kenyan and they worked in silence to his abrupt instructions that were muffled through his face mask each time he looked up he saw that the rain cloud crept further down the wooded slope of the hill and he saw that the lights burned brighter in the houses on the far side of the valley beyond the stream if it had been possible to have erected a tent cover over the grave if they could have worked at a slower speed then they could have used the scalpels and the narrow brushes the rain fell in the pit destroyed his hopes of minute care the policemen had learned from him watched him and copied and they scraped the clinging clay mud from the bodies with small trowels the sort of trowels that his wife used in the garden back home in north los angeles when they had taken as much mud from each body as was possible with the trowels then they wiped the faces of the dead with the sodden cloths that he had brought when he was satisfied that each face had been cleaned to the best of their ability then the policemen would stand back and he would photograph the body in wide shot and then operate the automatic zoom on his pocket nikon and photograph the face in closeup there were nine bodies photographed in wide shot nine faces captured in closeup nine body bags zipped and lying close together beyond the earth wall around his white marker tape the professor used a clipboard of note paper that was covered by a clear plastic bag he had made a small sketch map of the grave site and had detailed each corpse before it was lifted to the body bag ssk wore around his throat a gold chain to which was attached a thin gold cross and an inscribed medallion the left foot of ssk was gone taken off at the ankle the forehead of ssk showed the bullet hole central a single boot protruded from the mud layer alongside the indentation now filling fast from the rain from which they had taken ssk ok guys should be the last one the professors voice was a growl he kept his words brief and his voice low because that way he reckoned he was better able to prevent the bile spilling up from his throat it was the smell that made him want to vomit the face mask was a token against the smell of putrefaction he had been told that the bodies were reckoned to have been buried in the month of december in the year of but the clay of the earth had been dense enough to keep out foxes and dogs from the grave and had slowed the process of decomposition the professor stood for a moment and tried to stretch his back to arch out the stiffness back from the pit and the tape and the low earth wall back from the white painted jeeps of the united nations civilian police a small crowd watched he had seen them gather during the course of the day they watched and they made no sign he had seen them come from the tight cluster of houses around the church on the far side of the stream there were women in the crowd the old in black and the young in bright coats there were children with ravaged mature faces holding an unnatural quiet there were men in the crowd some wearing the drab clothes of farm work some in poorfitting damp uniforms some armed with shotguns and automatic rifles he wondered what they thought the crowd that had come across the stream to watch the excavation of the grave his eyes wandered he looked from the field and on down the lane where the grass had grown across the old tractor ruts and on towards the ruin of the village and on to the church tower where the upper stonework that would have housed the bell had been taken away by tank or artillery fire he wondered what they thought he turned to stare back at the crowd the canadian murmured dont make eye contact with them professor always smile at them keep the smile glued the kenyan muttered we want to get it wrapped and we want to get the shit out dont expect to be loved he thought them fine young men he was in his seventieth year he had taken two months of unpaid leave from the hospital in north los angeles where he headed the department of pathology back home those who had been his contemporaries through medical school had long retired to the beach houses of santa monica and santa barbara he thought them fools dear to his heart was the charity physicians for human rights and dearer to him than the charity was the knowledge that his abigail in the fortyfifth year of their marriage held a pride in her husband for taking himself off to croatia for two months hed tell her about the canadian and the frenchman and the portuguese and the kenyan great young guys who could chide gently a vague old man who let his eyes wander he had the one day at the grave and the day was nearly done sorry guys the kenyan was out of the pit and had gone to where the mine detector lay in shelter alongside the wheel of a jeep he jumped back into the pit and ran the machine over the last part of the earth beyond the protruding leg it was the fourth time that the mine detector had been used to sweep the site they were all in the pit again the crowd who watched from the edge of the field would only have seen their shoulders and their buttocks and the trowels of dripping mud that were tossed from the pit to the earth wall it would be the last body the growing gloom brought a new pace to their work an army boot a leg in disintegrating camouflage fatigues a hand that wore a cheap and dulled ring a wristwatch an arm that was bent crazily because the central bone had been broken the professor was scraping for the skull the portuguese policeman tapped at his shoulder asked for his attention he turned he saw the small trainer shoe revealed alongside the second boot his wife abigail liked to tell him that he was a tough old goat of a man that his humour when dealing with the dead was black as night gas chamber mirth he gagged he felt the emotion swell in him because he had not expected to find a womans body in the grave sure he could handle female cadavers when he was out with the police department homicide unit but he had not expected a womans body not here they were entwined the camouflage trousers and the blue jeans they were locked together the camouflage tunic arms and the grey windcheater arms they were against each other the skull of a young man and the skull of a young woman the canadian crouched above them and held a flashlight with the beam directed down he would have liked to have stood his full height and shouted to the crowd to come close the women and the children and the men with their guns he would have liked to have invited them to see the bodies of the young man and woman who were entwined and he wondered how many of them who waited in the rain would have known what would be found the chest of the young man was wrapped in stained bandages the professor understood all of the bodies of the men showed the marks of combat wounds bullet holes shrapnel gouges field amputations they had been the wounded it had been a shit little war in a shit little corner of europe and the wounded had gotten themselves left behind when the fit guys had run out on them he looked down into the swollen and decayed face of the young woman his own daughter was fortyone years old his own granddaughter was nineteen years old his own daughter had said he was an idiot to involve himself in a shit little war and his own granddaughter had asked him the night before he had flown to tell her why this shit little war was worth caring about he could go cold it was useful to go cold when he was looking into a young womans face where the putrefaction had started but not gone so far as to hide the killing wounds there was a bullet entry wound in what remained of the fair hair above the right ear there was a knife wound at the throat that had cut deep through muscles there was a bludgeon wound across the bridge of the nose and the lower part of the forehead they were all killing wounds sorry to hurry you professor the canadian pleaded we ought to get the hell out he realized then that all the light he had been working to had been from the torch held by the canadian the kenyan brought two body bags forward he took his photographs and made the necessary notes and nodded his head to tell them that he was satisfied they prised the stinking corpse of the young man apart from the stinking corpse of the young woman it was when they lifted the body of the young woman out of the pit that the professor felt the bulk of the money bag the bag was under her windcheater sweater and tshirt he delayed them while his rubbergloved fingers struggled with the bags clip fastening that was against the small of her back he put the bag into the pocket pouch on the leg of his overalls bent under the weight of them they loaded the eleven bodybags through the tail doors of the two cherokee jeeps they drove away when they turned to reach the lane as the rain pattered on the windscreen beaten away by the wipers the professor saw that the crowd had broken and now meandered away towards the houses and the lights across the stream off the lane in the ruined village the cherokee swerved to avoid a rusted and burnedout car and then again to go past a collapsed farm cart it was only when they were on the metal led road going towards glina and the sisak crossing point through the front line that the professor asked the canadian for the loan of the light he opened the money bag he took out an empty purse and a single sodden travellers cheque to the value of twenty us dollars and the passport he squinted tired eyes at the passport at the nationality and the name he took his handkerchief and wiped the discoloured photograph he wondered what she had been doing there caught in a shit little war in a shit little corner of europe the engines were cut there was a moment of quiet before the scuffled stampede as the passengers surged for the cabin door she sat three rows from the far end of the cabin she stayed in her seat as it had been suggested to her that she should she was tall did not fit easily into the tourist accommodation but the senior purser on the flight had in kindness arranged that neither of the seats beside her should be taken she had the look and the elegance of a woman who was used to being noticed as she had been by the other passengers dark hair well cut and short careful cosmetics a string of pearls at her throat that were real and confident dress she wore a titiancoloured blouse and a deepgreen skirt that had the length to cover her bent knees and its hem was over the upper part of her wellshined boots several of the salesmen on the flight those who had been away from home the longest had looked at her wondered what her business had been in that dismal city they were so relieved to be gone from the cabin was clearing the canned music was now supreme but she seemed not to hear the forced cheerfulness of the viennese waltz that drove her fellow passengers towards the immigration desks and the baggage carousel and the customs quiz she ignored the movement around her she leafed the pages of vogue magazine a small man one of the last to go bulged his stomach near to the diamond stud in her ear as he reached to lift down a shopping bag from the compartment above her head and when he breathed an apology she seemed not to hear him she gave the appearance of being quite engrossed in the colour advertisements that her eyes flitted over she was a sham the purser thought she was just brave she was still turning the pages of the magazine when the hostess came up the empty aisle of the cabin the cleaners were following whistling and laughing and grabbing paper debris from the floor and from the backs of the vacated seats she smiled up at the hostess and began to collect her possessions that were discarded over the empty seats beside her a handbag an overnight grip a raincoat a packet of cigarettes and a slim gold lighter a spectacle case and a patterned headscarf and a single red rose of which the bloom was not quite opened and the stem was wrapped in tinfoil she craned forward and looked through the porthole window and saw the low grey cloud and the puddles on the tarmac and made a small joke about the weather the hostess offered a hand in help and her eyes showed her sympathy again the smile as if the concern of the hostess were quite unnecessary out of place and not required and she stood and shrugged into her raincoat she looked behind her once and briefly to make sure she had left nothing she laid the scarf over her head then loosely knotted it under her chin she had the rose it was a small gesture but she laid her hand quickly on the hostesss suncoloured arm to show her gratitude she could cope no problem but the concern was appreciated she was led by the hostess down the length of the aisle to the cabin door the pilot coming from the cockpit ducked his head to her in embarrassment the purser shook her hand said something into his chest that she could not understand but she smiled back at him warmly the sham smile there was an official from the airport authority at the hatch of the aircraft she thought that he had probably done it before he had no smile for her and no handshake and no anodyne small talk he took her grip bag he unlocked an outside door at the start of the extended tunnel from the aircraft and gestured that she should follow him the rain and the wind caught her trapped her skirt against her thighs and billowed her raincoat she followed him down the steep staircase skipping the last step onto the apron the handlers had already started to unload the baggage from the cargo hatch and they took the suitcases and stringtied cardboard boxes from the hatch and threw them carelessly onto the open trailer there was a young woman from customs edging towards her unsure and pushing the documentation under her nose she signed with the pen she was offered and the ink ran as the rain dripped on the paper two men in black suits the one working his jaw round spent chewing gum and the other cradling in the palm of his hand a dead briar pipe waited statuejstill beside the hearse there were no more suitcases no more cardboard boxes coming from the hatch the men from the hearse moved forward as if to a signal she heard the noise of the scraping from inside the cargo hold the coffin was of grey sheet metal and it was heavy and awkward to manoeuvre in the confined space the pipe was pocketed the chewing gum was spat out the coffin was lifted clear she stepped forward she laid the single rose on the coffins lid beside the documentation that was fastened to it with adhesive tape the wind seemed to come fiercer off the tarmac and she walked beside the coffin with her fingers steadying the rose until they were sheltered by the length of the hearse the back door closed on the coffin and she could see her rose through the rainblurred windows it was driven away was she being met no she had her own car did she need a lift yes that would be very kind to the longstay car park mary braddock had brought her daughter her dorrie home i said we could go out and get something in a pub i said id have a go at knocking something up she wouldnt hear of it said something about being too tired to go out and something about me needing a

the little bitch i married mary not her bloody daughter youll have another charles braddocks hideaway what he called his snug was at the bottom right corner of the acre of garden behind the manor house the manor house elizabethan brick and good timber was hidden from them except for the tall chimneys by a succession of screens provided by the old azaleas and rhododendrons and a yew hedge and the wooden frame that supported honeysuckle and climbing roses and the flint stone wall of the vegetable garden under the big bare branches of the oak and beech trees that separated the garden from a farmers fields he had designed then built the wooden hut that was his hideaway there was power in the hut for a small fridge and space for a small cabinet he came to his snug to read meditate on problems at work sleep through weekend summer afternoons and curse alongside the hut was the boundary fence to his neighbours smaller garden and set in the fence alongside the cage for compost and grass cuttings was a stout stile that provided his neighbour access to the ice and scotch and gin it was the way of things that when arnold climbed heavily over the stile and took the offered plastic cup charles braddock would do much most of the talking she wasnt easy god and that classifies as understatement she was hopeless impossible and dead charles are you going to read me the lecture mustnt speak ill that sort of stuff if she hadnt been marys girl i tell you what i would have said bloody good riddance i would have said best you dont charles not many medals to be won there i think we all know what sort of young person was dorrie thank you charles braddock passed the refilled plastic cup it was always plastic cups that were used in the snug no washing up afterwards and a bin bag in the corner for the throwaways he valued arnold he thought of him as sensible and logical and calm probably he used arnold senior partner in the practice major architectural projects countryhopping for business taking home before tax a minimum of a year he found from arnold a patience and an understanding god the man knew just about every secret in the life of charles braddock and his second wife mary but then arnold was good with secrets and it was secrets that paid him a salary considerably less than fifteen per cent of charless gross they talked about charless work interminably and about charless domestic scene often charles knew the exact nature of arnolds job and it was off limits and his family was not mentioned they stood in the front of the hut huddled in their overcoats straight from the days work in london and the train from the capital charles knew that arnold was always on the down to the surrey and sussex border village and he had made the big effort to be on the same train and home early is there anything i can do or say she doesnt know how dorrie died in the middle of a war zone she doesnt know what the wretched girl was doing there in a village that was fought through she doesnt know what happened she says that shes the right to know you know mary itll nag and fret and worry with her the bitch living damn near ruined our marriage now the bitch dead id like to speak to mary the cups were finished thrown into the plastic bag the scotch was placed back in the cabinet the light was switched off and the door of the hut slammed and locked they hurried in the dark along the path of slab paving that wound around the azaleas and rhododendrons and under the wooden frame and past the vegetable garden wall charles was a big man sixteen stones and his neighbour was slighter and barely filled out his highstreet coat they ran as best they could through the rain and towards the kitchen door they came to the long thrown light from the kitchen window his wife was sitting at the wide refectory table in front of the aga cooker charles braddock cursed the bloody girl dead and hurting worse his wife had her head in her hands shes the right to know arnold said quietly i promise that ill do what i can his wife shook in her sobbing the journey had taken all of the day and all of the night it had taken all of the day because the tyres of the car had been bald and the front left had punctured on the road between belgrade and bijeljina and it had been at pistol point that they had persuaded the owner of the garage in bijeljina to replace it and the rear left had gone between derventa and miskovci which was a bad place and close to the front line and not even a pistol had won a replacement tyre from the garage in miskovci because there were none and they had had to wait while the puncture slash was repaired it had taken all of the night because after the punctures in darkness the car had run out of gasoline on the road between banja luka and prijedor under the losina mountain of the kozara range and the youngest of them had walked to prijedor to the barracks and taken four hours for it no tyres and a shortage of gasoline the bastard sanctions and dawn before the car had reached the bridge over the una river which was the crossing point from bosnia and they had reached dvor always the rain the whole of the journey in rain and uncomfortable in the mercedes of the man from knin because there were three of them on the bench seat in the front and four of them crammed onto the back seat no break in the rain but the bitter angry mood of milan stankovic had lessened as they approached glina coming closer to home coming closer to the fields farms villages woods hills that were his place the policeman was to be dropped at glina he would be next after the policeman and then the car would head on south for knin and when he had been let off then see if he cared they could have four punctures and they could have a dry tank and they could walk ten kilometres for new tyres and new gasoline the policeman insisted they stopped all of them in glina they banged up the cafe on the main street by the bridge and they hit the brandy he was close to home and the brandy was good banter and laughter in the car and talk of the meeting in belgrade and the hotel into which they had been put and the fine sheets in the hotel and the bar in which nothing was paid and good speeches for them in belgrade and the hall full for each of the five days speeches of the serb nation and the serb victory and the serb future and nothing about the bastard sanctions and no tyres to be had and no gasoline they took the bovic road beyond glina and they came into the village that was his home and his place he wanted the big mercedes to be seen in salika and he wanted to be seen with the big men from knin he took his time at the door of the mercedes punching shoulders through the opened window and slapping cheeks and clasping hands there would be enough in salika who would see that milan stankovic was the friend of the big men from the government in knin and those that did not see it would be told he walked home he wore his suit his best suit that was usual for weddings in the village the suit that had been right for the speeches in belgrade and he carried a small suitcase and slung on his shoulder was his ak assault rifle with the metal stock folded back the brandy was in him and he smiled and waved and called out his greeting to those who were already out in the street of salika his home and it puzzled him through the alcohol that none came forward to him when he was near to the river when he turned into the narrow lane beside the wire farm fencing that led to his home he called the name of his son and smiled the boy was running to him heh the little ape and not out of his pyjamas barefoot and running in the mud of the lane the boy his boy marko six years old was running to him and jumping at him he dropped his small case and he held the boy and hugged him and the boy was chirping excitement and the head of his boy was against the barrel of the ak he carried his marko the last metres to his house and the mud from his markos feet was wiped against the jacket of his best suit and the german shepherd was leaping at him paws beating at him and the back of marko and catching in the webbing belt from which the rifle hung she came to him his evica crisp in the blue linen dress in which she went to work school teaching and they were all together on the step of his house his home his place his safety his boy hugged him and his wife kissed him and his dog whimpered pleasure he climbed the stairs the bed in their room the room that looked away from the village and over the valley and the stream was not made and he could see from the bed that his marko had slept the night waiting for him with his evica he threw down the case and unhooked the ak assault rifle from his shoulder he started to strip out of his suit with the mud marks and his white shirt with the mud smears they were behind him he was telling her fast the brandy warm in him fast and with pride of how he had been in a group that milosevic had spoken to more than ten minutes and he had talked with seselj the red duke one to one for at least a quarter of an hour and he had been congratulated personally by kertesz who was chief of intelligence and he had shaken the hand of bokan who commanded the white eagles all of the big men were there and i was there he bent to the floor he wore only his socks vest and underpants he unfastened his case he rummaged amongst his used clothes for the parcels for the blouse and the plastic toy pistol that he had bought in belgrade with american dollars his evica said flat i tried to telephone you it was impossible milan grimaced of course the telephone did not work between the village of salika and belgrade the telephone did not work often between the village and glina nor between the village and petrinja not to vojnic nor to vrginmost of course it was not possible to reach belgrade he gave the wrapped parcel to his marko he watched the boy rip at the thin paper i tried to telephone you to tell you that they had come marko had the plastic pistol free and made the noise of firing and whooped his excitement he gave his evica her parcel she took it and was gazing into his face and he could see her fear confused tired and the wash of the early brandy still in him milan did it for her and took the paper from the blouse and held it in front of her and against her shoulders and her chest she pushed him away she ignored the blouse and went to the window her back and her head and her neck were in shadow it was the day after you had gone that they came and dug for them he held the blouse limp against his leg he went to her and stood behind her he looked out through the window and over her shoulder he looked across the fence at the end of his garden where she grew their vegetables and across the field where the grass was greening in the spring rain and across the stream that was swollen from the winters snow he looked into the village of rosenovici he saw the scattered homes that had been burned and the tower of the church that had been hit with shell fire and the roof of the school that was a skeleton of wood beams he knew where he should look on down the distant lane and he could make out faintly the new tyre marks in the grass that covered the old tractor ruts at the end of the lane where it went into the field was the rough rectangle of disturbed blackgrey earth we did not know without you what to do they dug for them and they took them away arnold browne closed the file he thought he might have met the man once or possibly twice when he had been briefing f branch recruits long ago or in that short period of a few months when he had headed d section of a branch he thought he recognized the likeness but the file photograph was poor and thirteen years old from what he remembered he was quite an alert and resourceful young fellow in his opinion and professional suicide to voice it there should have been room in five for men like that he looked up and noted that the door to the outer office was closed he had what his wife described without sympathy as a siege mentality to his work now he pushed the file away across his empty desk empty because little of substance in the affairs of the security service these days came his way he reached for his directline telephone dialled and spoke quietly so that his voice would not carry through the prefabricated walls of his office and the closed door he valued his neighbours friendship something that excited him about the power of decision that no longer came his way charles its arnold cant speak much mary she most definitely has the right to know theres a man who was once on our books if mary wanted someone to peck around a bit then ive a telephone number ill have all the details tomorrow for her and ill mark his card meantime yes i would recommend him two he had been sat in the sierra since before first light he had the engine idling and the heater going and every few minutes it was necessary for him to wipe the inside of the windscreen hard bully it to clear the mist that hazed his view of the target house he had parked up in a side street a full fifty yards from the main road on which the target house was one of a line of lowset terraced homes four hours back when he had first parked his sierra in the side street he had felt a small glow of satisfaction it was a good place to be parked because it gave him the option of going right or left up the road without the clumsiness of a threepoint turn it was the way he would have done it before the slip slide out of the service but it was different now from his service days and this was solo surveillance and he was working cheapskate this was shoestring stuff in the service days when he was with section of a branch there would have been one to watch in the car and one to drive and at the far end of the road also tucked in at a side street there would have been the backup car and two more in the bloody service days there would have been bodies committed on the ground to cope with target surveillance those who would stay with the cars and those who could duck out and dive for the underground if that was how the target chose to move but there was no point bitching nothing gained from moaning dreaming of the service days was crap and pointless he was on his own and just bloody lucky to have found a parking space off the double yellows in the side street and he would be going well if the target came out of the target house and used a car and he would be going bad if the target came out from the target house and ignored the target car and walked four hundred yards right to the piccadilly line underground or two hundred yards left to the central line the big decision for penn to have another cigarette or to unwrap another peppermint there was a cigarette packets cellophane on the carpet by his feet and silver paper from the peppermint tube he sat in the passenger seat of the sierra pondered made up his mind and lit another cigarette he sat in the passenger seat because that was the drill because then the locals would imagine that he was waiting for the driver and be less suspicious of a stranger in their street what they had said on the training course before he had gone to section of a branch the watchers was that personnel should be nondescript a good laugh that had raised and penn had the starter to win the bonus because he was reckoned good and proper nondescript like it was going out of fashion he was the man who did not stand out penn was the guy in the crowd who made up the numbers and was not noticed funny old business the chemistry of charisma at the first course he had actually been called out of the crowd by the instructor and held up grinning and sheepish as the example of what a watcher should be like penn was ordinary he was average height average build naturally wore average clothes his hair was average brown not dark and not light and average length not long and not short his walking stride was average not clipped and mincing not busy and athletic his accent was average not smart and privileged not lazy and careless with the consonants penn was the sort of man damn it who was accepted because he made few ripples and wanting to make waves wanting to be recognized was what had pitched him out of the service dragging on the cigarette the door of the target house was opening stubbing the cigarette into the filled ashtray he saw the target coughing the spittle of the silk cut and remembering the woman from section of a branch who had come to the garage they used under the railway arches in wandsworth and slapped a no smoking sticker on the door of the glove compartment and dared him and bloody won the target had turned and carefully locked the front door of the house and was walking the target was coming towards the parked and heatedup sierra he made a note on the pad time of departure and he eased his average weight across the gear stick and the brake handle and slid in behind the wheel naughty little boy the target and not playing it straight with the lady the client penn was taking a day a half to the company for ten hours a day cooking in his car with the silk cut smoke up his nose so that the lady the client should not be conned out of her fancy salary it was midmorning and the car would have stunk anyway from his socks that were damp and his trousers that were still wet from the rain when he had walked round the back of the target house to check whether there was a rear exit and a hell of a good thing that there wasnt because this was solo surveillance the target was the fourth male out of the house that morning the target had followed a west indian in building site overalls and an asian and a student with an armful of notebooks and college books the target wore old jeans and a loose sweater and a baseball cap back to front and the target came past him whistling a miserable morning with more rain in the air did not faze him enjoy it sunshine because it wont be lasting bit late sunshine to be heading off for the office good and modern sense of dress in that office sunshine the target went on down the road and it was kids play because the target had no suspicion that he was watched and took no evasive precautions the target didnt swivel didnt cross the road fast didnt grab a taxi didnt dive for the underground penn followed him down the road crawling the car watched him cross at the lights and it was pretty obvious where he was heading on a thursday morning too easy for a man trained in surveillance to the standards of section of a branch the target was a turkish cypriot tall and goodlooking and with a rakish step and hadnt a job and was living in bed sit land and the gravy time was just about up the target had milked a good number until the client had walked into alpha security sw and been allocated the new boy on the staff the client was a plain woman thirtysix years old with a highquality brain and a low threshold of loneliness who earned a salary of plus a year by flipping gilts and bonds in an investment team the client had fallen hard for the target and now wanted to know whether the love of her life was all he cracked himself up to be it was bad luck for the client that she had chosen the target to fall for because sure as hell the target was living a little lie and the claimed job in property development was economical skinflint with the truth bad luck miss client he parked up tough shit mr target he locked his sierra penn sauntered along the pavement to the department of social security office he went inside and found a place on the bench near the door and he watched the slow shuffling queue that was edging towards the counter where a bleakfaced girl stamped the books and doled out the money he watched the target going forward in the queue he lit a cigarette and his hand shook as he held the flaming match it was where penn had so nearly been if it had not been for alpha security and the partners three tired guys looking for a fresh pair of legs to take on the dross of the donkey trade then penn might just have been in that queue going forward slowly he sat it out and he went through two more cigarettes he waited until the target had reached the security screen at the counter and given the sour face a winning smile and won something back from her and she had pushed the money through the hatch to him the target scooped the money and slid it into a thin wallet the target was whistling again when he left the dss office penn made his way back to the sierra in his mind as he drove south across london he mapped out the report that he would make for the client when he gave the client the report she might weep and she might mess the little makeup that she wore on her plain face back at the office above the launderette in the road behind the high street in wimbledon deirdre gave him the note just gave his name as arnold thats his number said you should call him she would not cry not where her tears could be seen mary walked from the church door and she had the offer of charless arm and declined it the undertakers men were immediately ahead of her and they carefully manoeuvred the steel frame trolley that carried the coffin over the loose chippings of the path it had been a good service alastair walked beside her alastair usually came up to scratch when it was required of him damned hopeless when it was taking the confirmation classes for the village kids useless when it came to counselling the pregnant teenage girls but always good at taking a service when the grief was heavy in the air alastair had been vicar to the village on the surrey sussex border for seven years had come from an industrial parish in the west midlands and liked to say that he had been hardened to misery he had been taught to say the right things and say them briefly mary thought he had made a useful job of the address highlighted the positive points which must have taken him some soul searching of a young life taken he had said that only the superficial side of human character is displayed and it was arrogance for the living to dismiss un shown quality in the dead well done alastair she stopped charles stumbled because the halt was sudden his wretched mind would have been absorbed with the seoul contract and he had let her know and no mistake that the funeral of his stepdaughter did not come convenient she stopped and charles stumbled because the undertakers had halted to get a strong grip on the trolley that carried the coffin they lifted the trolley from the path onto the grass the coffin was heavy expensive the last gesture of throwing money at a problem and the wheels of the trolley sank deep into the wet grass they moved forward again slow because of the sodden ground justin her first husband and dorries father coughed behind her it might have been a snivel the reptile had a cheek being there and it was rotten of him to have paraded his second wife the little shrew it had been justins going running off with the little shrew that had been the kickstart of the problem an open and pleasant child had become a moody and awkward and bloodyminded horror story and hadnt grown better she hated herself for it for thinking of those times but they lined up in her memory the times when her daughter had driven her beyond distraction point the autopsy report said that her daughter had suffered a knife wound at the throat and a compressed fracture of the lower front skull as with a blow from a blunt instrument and a gunshot wound entry above the right ear she despised herself for thinking the bad memories of her child her daughter who had been knifed and bludgeoned and shot to death she knew nothing she followed the trolley and the coffin as they skirted the old stones and the trolley wheels squealed as the burden was directed around the plots they were old stones and old plots and they belonged to the village mary and charles braddock were the newcomers new money in the manor house there was a good turnout it was respectful of the old villagers to come to the funeral of the troubled daughter of the new wealth she had seen them in the church the woman who helped in the house and the man who helped in the garden and the woman from the shop and the man from the post office and the woman who came in two days a week to type the letters for the charities that mary involved herself with and the women from the committee of the institute and the man who captained the cricket side who was there because charles had bought the teams pads and stumps and bats at the start of the last season oh yes most certainly her dorrie would have given them something to whisper about and titter over bloody little rich girl god the poor kid the kid had a knife wound and a bludgeon wound and a bullet wound they had reached the freshly dug grave she noticed the sweat running on the back of the neck of the largest of the undertakers she tried to picture her dorrie an image without the wounds slight build but the shoulders thrown back in perpetual challenge a sparky little mouth pouted in bitter defiance cropcut hair that was a statement messy and crumpled clothes so that when they had dragged her to sunday morning drinks there were arguments at home and apologies to hosts afterwards her honeymoon with charles christ and not a relation that she owned who would have the girl dorrie and certainly not her damned father and the child accompanying them disaster she hated herself for remembering a dinner party for charless clients and the music battering through the manor house from her room and down the panelled staircase and charles going upstairs and the clients hearing the obscenities shouted back at him catastrophe the memories queued for her attention she felt herself shamed for remembering the village boys were at the funeral the village boys work clothes and casual clothes and trainer shoes and earrings had come and parked their beatenup cars and their motorcycles at the churchyard gate and hung their heads as if they cared the coffin went down alastair recited the last prayer mary took off her glove and took the wet earth in her hand and threw it to splatter over the coffin lid she stood beside charles at the gate to the churchyard she shook the hands that were offered and smiled automatically as the mourners mouthed lies of condolence the woman who helped in the house charles glanced down at his watch the man who helped with the garden charles bit at his lip impatient the woman from the shop and the man from the post office charles had made the arrangements for as early in the morning as alastair would do it the woman who typed her correspondence charles had a london meeting at noon the women from the committee of the institute charles was fidgeting to be off and he had a floral tie in his pocket that would be exchanged for the black tie as soon as he was in his jaguar the village boys walked past her like she was no part of their loss arnold was the last in the line solid and lovely and dependable arnold who did something in whitehall and she never asked what he did and she was never told only that it was something in whitehall charles kissed her cheek murmured about being back late squeezed her hand and was off and hurrying for his car he had a calm voice arnold said i thought it went well yes and nice of those young fellows to show mary said i used to tell her that it was unsuitable for her to liaise with boys from the council estate charles used to call them moronic louts wont you be late up to london wont be missed not these days someone who might be of help to you ive a number she heard the slam of the jaguars door the gravedigger had reached the earth mound and there was a wisp of smoke from his mouth and he leaned for a moment on his spade she wondered if when he had finished his cigarette before he started to shovel back the earth he would drop the filter tip into the grave thanks but its about time the foreign office did something the embassy was precious little help in zagreb all the time she was missing and last week frankly they didnt want to know so youve sorted me out with some redhot little civil servant whos going to beaver at last she heard her own sarcasm she smiled small weak sorry im grateful to you for digging someone out i mean she was a british citizen i want to know very badly what happened to her its because i think dorrie loathed me i can recognize it obsession however awful she was i have to know do i come to him the foreign office man or will he come down here i suppose its all about war crimes isnt it what that american said last year you can run but you cant hide i suppose its all about gathering evidence and preparing a case against the guilty whoever they are arnold said and there was sympathy on his dried and thin lips dont be disappointed never helps to set the sights too high im afraid it is the best i can do he passed her a small piece of paper she read a name and the address of alpha security and a telephone number im sorry that i can do so little he was walking away she said after him soft and women with obsessions are always tiresome correct god whats happened to you deirdre stared up at him from her desk behind the typewriter not that he had interrupted her typing and her magazine of knitting patterns lay across the keys penn said just the chummy didnt want to take it he tried to grin and that hurt his lower lip but his pride was hurt more than his lower lip he was learning the business of skiptracing the trades vernacular for the locating of debtors and learning also that not everyone enjoyed being pitched out of bed at dawn and greeted at the front door with the service of legal process chummy was a little taller than average a little heavier than penn and had stood in his doorway his belly bulging his singlet and swung a mean right jab from nowhere the pride was hurt because penn was trained to hit where it mattered and to hit so that a man stayed down but to hit now was to invite a counter charge of assault so he had dropped the legal process on the front mat and beetled it back to his car the split lower lip was not bad enough for stitches in casualty but blood had run down onto his shirt front you look a right mess mr penn and he felt a right mess and he felt a right wimp and a toe rag who was behind on the payments to the finance company for a fouryearold vauxhall had stuck one on him does it show deirdre was secretary to alpha security she ruled the outer office and she probably had a thing going with basil onetime cid who had founded the private investigation agency nineteen years back along with jim onetime fraud squad and henry who had once been with telecom as an engineer he definitely thought she was an item with basil and that anything that crossed her laser vision would go back pretty damned fast to basil it would go back to basil that the new boy young penn had come back from service of legal process with a split lower lip good for his battle honours another medal to set alongside the kick down the flight of stairs from the boot of the man who was wanted as a defence witness filling up the trophy cabinet deirdre snorted not necessary for her to tell him that his split lip was viewable at a hundred paces your clients here he had his handkerchief out and he dabbed the wound and that hurt hard he looked through the glass and into the waiting room into the drab little room that hadnt enough light nor enough comfortable chairs nor any recent magazines she was half an hour early it was because she was coming that he had hurried the service of legal process blundered in and caught the right fist to the lower lip she was a tall woman almost beautiful and she wore clothes of a cut that wasnt seen every day in the office of alpha security above the launderette she had her head down and there was a tissue in her hands that she squashed pulled squashed in a nervous rhythm she wore a good suede coat and a long black skirt and there was a bright outsize scarf looped over her shoulders he thought it was the first time for her first time in the office of a private investigation company she had quality diamond stud earrings and he could see the pearls at her throat penn accused didnt you offer her a coffee deirdre bridled stupid fart henry didnt put the milk back in the fridge last night milks off i cant just swan off and leave the phones i want some coffee and i want it now youre not much of a sight mr penn not for a new client bugger the phones he said coffee now and that would go back to basil soon as he trooped in midmorning a sledging from dear deirdre that mr bill penn quite aggressive quite rude and no call but she was collecting her handbag he had a split lower lip and blood on his shirt and he strode to the door of the waiting room never explain never apologize a good creed she must have heard him coming and as he opened the door she was looking up and for a moment there was the startled rabbit stare and then the forced composure and what he had to do was remember and hard that alpha security now paid the mortgage and the gas bill and the electricity and the food and put the clothes on his back and on janes and the nappies on toms backside and split lips and kicks down towerblock steps and solo surveillance were part of the game for a guy heaved out of five and he had better remember it she had a public face on the composure was set as if the nerves and the fear had never been he closed the door behind him she was looking at his mouth but she was too polite to remark on the split lower lip and the blood on his shirt mrs mary braddock im bill penn im early the traffic was less than id expected its not a problem penn said what can i do for you i expect youre a busy man sometimes so i wont waste your time my daughter was in yugoslavia she was there when the fighting was in croatia she disappeared at the end of she was listed as missing last week i was informed that her body had been identified from the exhumation of a mass grave in that part of croatia that is now under serb control she had been dead for fifteen months buried and hidden i want to know what happened to her i want to know how she died and why she died she was my only daughter mr penn he interrupted isnt this a job for you should let me finish mr penn but since you raise it shouldnt this be a job for the foreign office of course it should do you know anything about government departments mr penn theyre useless thats a generalization and a true one good at cups of tea in a first secretarys office good at booking a hotel room good at platitudes and they dont give a damn just some silly woman using up their day i have been to zagreb mr penn i was there when dorrie my daughter was missing and i was there to bring her body home i thought it was their job to help people like me and i was wrong arnold is a good friend arnold gave me your name high excitement coursing yesterday when he had been told by deirdre that arnold browne had left the message for him to call immediately he had sat in the cubbyhole area where basil had given him the desk and savoured the moments before he had picked up the telephone all some mistake a mistake to have let him go and of course they wanted him back or pretty bad cockup losing him but the service had plenty of scope for work by outsiders who were trusted and proven nice little one for him and of course he was not forgotten and what brutal disappointment crushing him yesterday when he had dialled the directline number spoken to arnold bloody browne been told that a neighbour had a problem needed a bit of uncomplicated ferreting needed a good plodder was what the bloody man meant he ran his tongue over his lower lip what was it you wanted of me she had her handbag open and she had taken the ointment tube out she didnt ask his permission she squeezed the ointment onto her forefinger and reached forward and casual gentle she smeared the salve onto the split of his lower lip i want you to go to zagreb for me i want to know how my dorrie died and why he thought her so bloody vulnerable she shouldnt have been there she shouldnt have been in the waiting room that doubled as clients interview room in a shabby godawful dreary little office he told her that he would think on it overnight that if he took it he would come down in the morning if she gave him an address he would think on it and consider it he walked her out of the office and they passed basil on the stairs and the onetime cid man gave her the lookover of a bloody farmer evaluating livestock they stood on the pavement outside the launderette would you tell me what he rasped would you tell me what state he is in the man who hit you this morning he saw the mischief dance in her eyes penn said i would have been done for assault no if id hit him like i know then id have been done for murder what state is he in probably pretty good probably hes looking forward to getting pissed up in the pub this lunch time and telling the rest of the select lounge how he put one on me i served the process but thats a smallbeer victory then the mischief was gone and she was serious i like winning mr penn i expect to win i want to know how my daughter died i want to know who killed her i want to know why she was killed i want to know they had been at the roadblock an hour they had sat in the jeep and smoked and talked together for an hour before they heard the coughing approach of the truck the engine would go on the truck if it went on burning the bad diesel that the sanction busters brought in no point in trying to reach rosenovici from the vrginmost road because there was always a block by the territorial defence force on that route the last week when they had been there and digging they had used the turning to bovic off the glina road then taken the plank bridge short of the village of salika to get themselves to rosenovici the roadblock was at the bridge there were four tm mines laid out on the bridge nasty little bastards and the canadian knew that each held a bit over five kilos of explosive it was the first time that he had tried in the company of his kenyan colleague to get to rosenovici since the digging the taking away of the bodies he had hoped to get back to the village and leave a little food for the old woman and a little love to have been discreet now there would be no food dropped off and no love because they were held at the roadblock it was what the kenyan called another peaceadvancing day in sector north they would not get the food to the old woman but that was not good enough reason to back off push smile probe smile negotiate smile step by fucking step and half of them backwards and smile always goddamn smile the canadian police sergeant had been stationed at the petrinja base for days and could tell anyone who asked that his posting had days to run when he made it back to toronto when his colleague made it back to mombasa then both of them bet your life would never forget how to smile they were kids they werent out of their teens but the tdf shit at the roadblock had shiny kalashnikovs and they had four tm mines to play with and they were drunk the canadian police sergeant reckoned that drunk teenagers with automatic rifles and mines should be smiled at it would have been easy to have given up and reversed the jeep away from the bridge away from the scarred village of rosenovici and driven back to petrinja easy but the abandonment of the old woman would have come hard it was worth smiling to keep the road open to the village that was wrecked rule of sector north and rule and rule dont argue dont at kids with highvelocity hardware and mines and booze in their guts it was a full hour since he had smiled and asked the first time for the responsible official please to be allowed to contact that senior and responsible official and he would appreciate their courtesy if that senior and responsible and important official had the time to spare just shit they could barely walk upright the tdf kids and every few minutes theyd go move the mines shove them or kick them and every few minutes theyd go drink some more the truck came the kenyan grinned you happy now man the truck stopped behind their jeep as a hog in dung the canadian smiled he looked out through the front windscreen of the jeep he knew the man he had met milan stankovic on the third day of his posting to sector north he had known milan stankovic for days and milan stankovic had only himself to blame the big mouth of salika the big boasting militia boss it was the big mouth and the big boast that accounted the canadian thought for the shitsour face of milan stankovic the kids were trying to stand tall and the kids were telling it to the shitsour face of milan stankovic that they had obeyed the orders and stopped the uncivpol jeep from reaching rosenovici the canadian smiled big and he knew they would not be going over the bridge and there would be no food for the old woman and he held the smile the shitsour face was at the window of the jeep you cannot go over the kenyan said pleasantly it is part of our patrol area sir it is forbidden for you to go the canadian said friendly we have never had a problem in the past sir if you do not leave immediately you will be shot we are only doing our job a neutral job sir one minute and it will be me that shoots you perhaps another day perhaps we can go over another day sir get the fuck out the canadian was still smiling as he reversed the jeep away from the bridge away from the track that led to the ruin of rosenovici away from where they had dug the previous week he smiled all the time that they were watched by the drunk kids and milan stankovic the jeep lurched back onto the bovic road and he lost the smile and cursed quietly to himself he had never seen the old woman but he had heard she was there in the woods above the village and he had three times left food for her and the food had been taken perhaps it was just a story that the old woman was there perhaps it was the stray and abandoned dogs that took the food the kenyan said maybe he has a problem with his bowel movement our good friend did not seem happy not as happy as a hog in dung the canadian knew it was the big mouth the big mouth had said there have been no atrocities here we serbs have always treated our croat enemies correctly and with care it was the big boast that said there are no hidden graves here we have nothing to be ashamed of the big mouth and the big boast in the grimy dining hall of the administration building at the tdf camp in salika and all the guys around him to hear it the canadian had put in his report and he had heard that milan stankovic was called to the summit chat in belgrade and the village was a headless chicken and the professor had been dragged off the ovcara dig for the day the canadian could smile when he remembered how they had been the mothers in the village the old men and the kids when the jeeps had shown up in the week before and not been able to deny that he had the permission of old shitsour face to go hunting a mass grave the canadian could smile when he imagined old shitsour face coming back from the belgrade kneesup to find a nice corner of a dug field empty mister do you think we could have given him something for his bowel movement a pill something to make him happy the canadian said a stone turned under the stone was a secret and the secrets abroad and public knowledge that might just have stopped his bowel movement but mister youre not talking evidence the canadian police sergeant far from toronto and yonge street and far from the whores and the pushers of home had not caught a good nights sleep since they had prised the blackgrey earth from a young womans face no he was not talking evidence it was that sort of place sector north the sort of place where evidence did not come easy it was rare for arnold browne to lose his temper dont ever do that to me again penn or youre lost forgotten just remember what you are and you are ex penn you are exfive you are exa branch you may once have stupidly harboured the illusion that there is a way back let me tell you penn that the way back is not via spitting in my face you dont think on it you dont consider it you damn well jump to it and i was doing you a favour i can get a score of exherefords who would give the right cheek of their arses for a job like this and i gave your name got me yes mr browne you dont patronize by thinking and considering you bloody well get on with it yes mr browne thank you mr browne he slapped down the telephone yes rare for him to lose his temper and he felt no better for it his anger was because of his memory of dorrie mowat and god alone knew what a pain the child had been he had left home early he had left home while jane was still feeding tom he had called once from the front door and she must have been distracted because she hadnt called back to him from upstairs she was too damned often distracted he had driven down through the countryside to the surrey sussex border penn was thirtyfive minutes early for his appointment at the manor house he parked up the sierra in the space beside the shop there were old halfcasks outside the shop filled with bright pansies and there was a notice congratulating the community on a runnersup prize in the tidy village competition bill penn and jane and baby tom in the maisonette lived in raynes park near the railway station and there were no tidy village competitions where he lived time to kill and he went walking away from the manor house away from the shop past the village cricket pitch where the outfield grass was wet and the square was thick with worm casts towards the church below the church was the graveyard he saw her in the graveyard penn felt a shiver she was sitting on the grass and her weight was taken by an arm braced to the ground she was beside the heaped earth on which was the bright carpet of flowers her head was ducked and her lips might have moved as if in quiet conversation and the two dogs were close to her the two dogs creamwhite retrievers were on their sides and chewing at each others ears and pawing each others faces she wore old jeans and a baggy sweater and sat on her anorak he wondered if mary braddock would have gone home and changed and presented the controlled appearance to him if he had arrived at the time given him he went through the church gate and his heels crunched the gravel path because she had still not seen him he paused for a moment to check that his tie was straight to check there was no dandruff on his blazer to check that his shoes had not been scuffed when he came up off the path and onto the grass the dogs were alerted they bounded away from her and from the grave and their leads trailed crazily behind them and their hackles were up he knew the basics of dogs penn stood still and talked gently to them as they circled him and he kept his hands still she looked up at him seemed to mutter something to the flowers then pushed herself up he knew what he would say and he had rehearsed it in the car just as he had rehearsed it in bed while jane had slept beside him i said mrs braddock that i would think on the assignment that i would consider it i am a free agent mrs braddock i am not owned by anyone most certainly not by the security service who sacked me most definitely not by arnold bloody browne who did not stand in my corner what i do not need mrs braddock is you ringing arnold bloody browne so that i get a quite unwarranted bollocking down the phone when i am thinking and considering taking an assignment it was the same as when he had spied on her in the waiting room of alpha security she shed her sadness summoned up her composure what he had rehearsed was gone from his mind good morning mrs braddock thank you for coming mr penn she walked well tall out of the churchyard and he followed a halfpace behind her the dogs looked back at the grave and the flowers whined once together then trailed after her it didnt seem to matter that he had left his car beside the shop she led him back through the village she walked him up the wide tarmacadam drive of the manor house the climbing roses on the brickwork were drooped dead and the honeysuckle was ragged not yet in leaf the sort of house that was photographed for sale in the magazines left in his dentists reception she took him into the hall and there was furniture that he would have noticed through the windows of showrooms when he was doing central london surveillance she did not tell him where she was taking him up the stairs wide polished oak along a corridor dark and panelled through a small door a bright and airy room a childs room a neat and cleaned childs room she waved him to a chair and he carefully moved the soft bears and made himself the space to sit she was on the bed bill penn had been brought to the shrine she said briskly my daughter dorothy was a horrid young woman she could be quite foul and enjoy it my husband her stepfather he says she was rubbish hes usually right about things i am a spoiled woman mr penn i have everything that i could possibly want except a loving daughter she was a messer a waster and costly i think she took a pleasure in hurting me and mr penn she was my daughter and mr penn her throat was slit and her skull was bludgeoned and she was finished off with a closerange shot and mr penn not even a rabid dog should be put to death with the cruelty shown to my dorrie do i carry you with me mr penn he nodded well go down to the kitchen mr penn ill make us some coffee i called her horrid and when we have some coffee ill give you examples i dont believe in putting dirt under stones mr penn by the by this isnt the room she left when she went away i had it redecorated i made the room the way it should have been the room is a fraud new curtains new duvet new carpet i went out and bought new books and new toys a stupid woman trying to believe she could start again wed taken her up to london and put her on a plane to brisbane the last we saw of her was her going through the departure lounge and she didnt even bother to look back and wave and we were so damned relieved to see her gone that when we were back here home my husband split open a bottle of champagne am i boring you mr penn the morning after shed gone i rang the decorators i come in here each morning mr penn while my husband is dressing and i cry do you know anything about yugoslavia mr penn he shook his head somebody elses problem isnt it somebody elses war correct my trouble is that somebody else is me i didnt even know she was there i thought she was still in australia will you go there please mr penn if we sort out my fee my expenses yes i think i would consider it it was boorish of him you were in the security service thats correct isnt it he said sharply thats not an area i can discuss she looked at him direct i just wondered why you left if im to employ you i just wondered why an officer of the security service ended up where youve ended wonder away but its not your business not her business not anyones business but his and janes his and janes business and all the bastards that he had looked to for support no there hadnt been written commendations that would lie in his personal file yes there had been congratulations backslapping snake words but nothing to lie in his file he had gone to his team leader to his section leader and to his branch leader all graduates he had requested their support for his application to be accepted into the inner core of the service general intelligence group and he had gone to gary brennard in personnel it was not her business in the newstyle service the men of the transit van teams were dinosaur history the new style was squatting in front of a computer screen the middle east squad was being wound up the trades union squad was being cut back the campaign for nuclear disarmament squad was being phased out the future without a degree was being stuck tied trapped in front of a computer screen with the other middleaged passedover nohopers the future was scanning the surveillance photographs from the hidden cameras in railway stations and shopping precincts and over busy pavements the future was searching for men with scarves across their faces women with their coat collars turned up carrying bags and dropping them into rubbish bins to hurry away before the bloody semtex detonated it was not her business that he had tried for belfast not told jane and been rejected told it wasnt for marrieds not at his level dougal gray best mate divorced had won the belfast appointment not her business that he had believed in his work reckoned he protected his society taken a pleasure that the great bloody ignorant unwashed snored in their beds at night safe because he sat in the damn transit van with a piss bottle for company and a leica not her business that in the last two years there had been bloody kids graduates set in charge of him and lecturing him on procedures and running up the bloody ladder that was denied him not her business he felt no warmth towards her no gentleness another rich woman at war with another rich child but there was just a flicker in her weakness just a moment in her pleading his mother and father lived in a tied cottage his father was a farm labourer who most days drove a tractor his mother went out most mornings and dusted and cleaned in the big house on the estate he hadnt much time for the rich and she took him downstairs to the kitchen and heated the old iron kettle on the aga and made him instant coffee and told him horror stories of the behaviour of dorrie mowat an hour later he said ill work out what it would cost how many days i estimate it will take goodbye mrs braddock youll hear from me three the pub was down the road from the launderette and round the corner you know what you are penn you are a jam my bastard the pub basils watering hole was mean and dirty and dark there was a table beyond the bar that was his out of danger from the darts board basil onetime detective sergeant had made the table his own since retirement from the metropolitan police nineteen years back most lunch times basil was at the table with deirdre you milk that one my son because its cream for the cat you spin it out my son jim didnt use the pub at lunch time left basil clear with deirdre but he came by at five most evenings jim onetime detective constable in the fraud squad liked a game of pool in the bar and a swift pint or three with basil it was where the hard business of alpha security was talked through they donc come on trees young fellow theyre gifts from heaven you fell on your feet young fellow henry onetime telecom engineer came to the pub only at christmas birthday or celebration time and nursed orange juice henry was valuable always sober and spent his drinks money on bug equipment and the gear for tapping hard lines and the new pride and joy was a uhf room transmitter built into a thirteenamp wall socket milk it run it enjoy it it wasnt talked about but penn assumed that basil and jim and henry did oddjob work for five work that was boring and work that was illegal would be farmed out penn assumed it had to be a good assumption because when he had been working out his notice at gower street when he was getting all the flak from jane as to where the mortgage money was going to come from there had been the quiet call from the fourth floor and the request that he attend the office of senior executive officer arnold browne a soft word of sympathy a frowned nod of understanding and a suggestion that alpha security sw might be looking for an able man he guessed a little empire had been built the tentacles spread and henry never seemed short of gear that cost and plenty more than he saved by drinking only orange juice they were a good little team give basil three phone calls he could find a burglar a mugger a safebreaker give jim half a day he could get an inland revenue annual statement printout henry could fix in twentyfour hours best quality audio and visual surveillance they were a good little team but needing young legs and young eyes and a guy prepared to sit through the breadandbutter crap but it wasnt breadandbutter crap they were celebrating in the pub with penn buying the drinks it was a hell of a good overseas contract with money going half share to the partners penn felt quiet satisfaction because basil was almost jealous and jim couldnt quite hide the envy and henry didnt seem too cheerful penn was reaching for their glasses and none of them was shouting that it was his round penn said actually shes quite a decent woman bollocks shes a punter daily rate plus per them expenses plus clubclass flights half the daily rate up front per them expenses in your greasy hand for a clear week before you go and that doesnt include the hotel of your choice penn said pity is that her daughter was a right little tosser he scooped up the glasses and headed for the bar two pints of best bitter an orange juice and penn was taking low alcohol because when he was shot of them he would be going back to the office over the launderette and he would be typing up the finances and faxing them down to the manor house on the surrey sussex border and then he would be going home to jane and hoping to god some hope that the baby slept hard and hoping to god some hope that jane wasnt flat on her back with exhaustion it was going sour with jane not solicitors and courts stage just going stale and he did not know what to do about it nor whether it mattered if he did nothing about it he brought the drinks back shouldered his way through the shop people and the mechanics in their overalls and the building site workers who were all on the black wouldnt have been seen in there not seen dead in there when he had been at gower street it still seared him and it would do so for a goddamn long time the memory of when he had come back home to raynes park off the train from waterloo and told jane that he was washed up working out his notice gone jane seven months pregnant and hysterical and him not able to staunch the screaming shed done it jane she had wound him up when she had packed her job in because the baby was coming she had done the sums of the household accounts told him they couldnt survive not with the baby coming not without her money unless he had himself promoted she had told him he should have been made up from executive officer to higher executive officer and like a bloody fool basil took his drink cheers im going to give you advice you jam my bastard dont go sentimental on it dont get yourself involved jim grasped the pint glass and nodded his agreement henry sipped at the orange juice good trip just pile the paper up reports analysis interview transcripts like youve been a busy boy i hear you he made his excuses and left them still talking debating arguing what the rate of per them expenses should be he walked out onto the street they were closing the shutters down on the fruit and vegetable shop and locking up the jeans and denim store and the launderette was packed full gary bloody brennard personnel wouldnt be unlocking a paintpeeled door beside a launderette and going back to work at pm and gary bloody brennard personnel wouldnt even remember his little talk with bill penn executive officer his own fault because he had not copped on to the new scene at five too dumb too stupid to have evaluated the new mood at five entry to general intelligence group was restricted to higher executive officers new scene didnt he know entry to general intelligence group was restricted to university graduates there was a new mood didnt he know they didnt want watchers nor legmen nor ditchmen they wanted analysts and information control management and they wanted graduates dont have a degree do you bill gary brennards sneer didnt make university did you bill his feet hammered the linoleum above the launderette he snatched the cover off the typewriter without a degree without a university education youve reached your plateau havent you bill he began to type he accepted the assignment he listed the daily rate and a half to be paid in advance and the per them expenses rate he pounded the keys of the typewriter if thats the way you feel then you should consider transferring your talents to the private sector we wouldnt want disaffected junior officers would we bill he read through the paper no he wouldnt be sentimental no he wouldnt get himself involved he dialled the number he watched the fax sheet go there was not enough light for him to make a clean job of the sewing he did it as best he could and it was poor work because he could barely see where he pushed the thick needle and his hands shook his hands shook in fear ham sewed strips of black elastic onto the arms and the body of the tunic the others watched him and waited their turn with the one needle and the reel of heavy cotton he tried hard to hide the shaking because each of the other five men who would go across with him believed in his professionalism it was what he was paid for what he was there for to communicate professionalism there were eight lengths of black elastic now on his tunic and he had already sewn five lengths onto his combat fatigue trousers and when they were down at the river when they were ready to slip into the inflatable then they would collect old grass and they would tuck the grass lengths in behind the elastic straps they were important shape and silhouette he passed on the needle and the cotton reel and the roll of black elastic tape he set himself to work on shine he spat into the palms of his hands and then scooped the cream from the jar and worried the mess together and made the sweeping smears across his eyebrows and nose and cheeks and chin and his ears and throat and wrists and hands he handed the jar to those who were waiting to use the needle and the cotton roll he had told them about smell and he had bloody lectured them that there should have been no smoking since the middle of the day and he had checked that the tinfoil was in his own battle pack for their shit and the burying of it he had lectured them about sound and he had shaken each of the webbing harnesses they would wear for the rattle of loose ammunition magazines and he had made them all walk round him in a circle until he was certain that their boots were quiet ham had learned shape silhouette shine smell and sound at the aldershot depot and none of the others the dozy buggers cared they needed it too fucking right they needed shape and silhouette and shine and smell and sound where they were going the others were from nd bn karlovac brigade and they had been pissed up since morning and ham was stone sober and his hands shook and his gut was tight they were dumb bastards to be spending the night with across the kupa river behind the lines on down his checklist ammunition magazines for the kalashnikov knife gloves the radio that thank christ he wouldnt be bent under cold rations the balaclava the water bottle that wasnt full of bloody brandy or the usual slivovitz piss map and compass field dressings the big fear what tightened hams gut shook his hands was of being wounded of being left it was better in the old days better when there were internationals on the ground like flies on meat because then there was the promise that the internationals the meres would look after their own if one was wounded you wouldnt know with this lot wouldnt know if theyd fuck off and get the hell out in a stampede back towards the river from behind the lines they were chuckling at him the others and it was because they laughed at his care and his thoroughness that ham felt the fear they were dumb bastards to be with but there was no one else who would have sidney ernest hamilton late of para late of east london late of the internationals attached to the croatian army his fingers found the twin dog tags hanging from the dulled chain at his neck the tags were bound in sellotape to keep them quiet the tags gave his number from para his name and his blood group and his number and name and blood group from the croatian army he knew it would be bad bloody news for any of them if they were wounded captured across the river and double bad bloody news for a mercenary ham didnt eat any of the bread that was offered him and he turned down the alcohol and he thought the croatians must have known that he was shit stiff scared it would be late evening when they moved off down towards the kupa river where the inflatable was hidden under the new scene the new mood there were little chores for a senior executive officer the little chores were adequate to remind arnold browne that he was outside the mainframe of service operations once a week a little chore he met with a senior executive officer from six and they talked platitudes nothings for an hour before going to lunch on expenses a little chore because it was unthinkable that the service would offer valuable information to six and inconceivable that six would volunteer worthy information to the security service valuable information worthy information was power and would not be squandered on the sister organization so arnold browne who was old guard and old time would parry and probe for a straight sixty minutes with a man who was also without a future and then go take a damn good lunch the probing and parrying that morning had involved the tedious matter of ukrainian nuclear warheads and he had extracted nothing that was worthy or valuable it was ludicrous of course that six should not share their information from the ukraine so that five could follow and monitor the kiev governments attempts to get the hardware of the former soviet union operational bloody pathetic but then arnold browne was not sharing with six what five had learned of pira arms acquisition on the continent he did not apportion blame it was the way of the sisters to squabble bicker hold their cards close but lunch was good and at a personal level he enjoyed the company of georgie simpson a bowl of pasta a bottle from the friuli region a plate of liver and spinach a second bottle called for and the talk twisting to croatia safe ground because georgie simpson never set foot outside inner london and would have no secrets to guard a belch from arnolds lunch guest im like the rest of the great british herd im bored out of my mind with the place victoria wont even have it on the television now switches it straight off she did the jumble bit last year getting parcels together then she read that the stuff she collected was all sitting in a warehouse she does parcels for somalia now i mean theyre just animals arent they theyre animals all of them not a peck of difference between the lot of them what gets up my nose is that people here in their ignorance seem surprised by the bestiality of the place ive had the place drilled into me from birth by my father back in the war he was on gunboat escorts that ran weapons down to the dalmatian coast for the partisans titos crowd two or three times my father went ashore and had to go up into the mountains to meet the serbs and he saw a bit of what was done to them by the croats small wonder theyre all a grade for cruelty dont want to put you off your food arnold but the croats the fascists in their ustase movement used to gouge the eyes out of their serb friends faces sack them up and send them back to their hero leader in zagreb my father says the ustase could make the ss blush i mean it wasnt just genocide it was good fun thrown in my father said that it wasnt just a matter of killing people they enjoyed it most of all they enjoyed causing pain incredible people barbarians should leave the blighters to it it might have been the wine could have been the company but arnold offered a confidence he spoke quietly without restraint of his neighbour and his neighbours second wife and his neighbours stepdaughter who must have been a right bloody fool to have let herself get caught up in that lot what id call a selfinflicted wound and a wound for everyone else arnold said he waved to the waiter for more coffee and the bill and she the mother wants to know what happened if you want my opinion she should let it rest its like scratching a bite yes you end up with blood and pain its different values there their values and ours dont mix not the sort of woman to let it rest sad really but she wont let it go until shes got the full picture actually i put her in touch with a private detective what on earth for arnold was brought the bill he paid cash and it would be a month before the money was reimbursed by accounts i thought that if she had something on paper some evidence then she might just be able to detach herself disengage rejoin the living where did it happen accounts would not wear gratuities arnold scooped the change from the saucer the daughter was killed near glina the territory is now occupied by the serbs i believe its called sector north georgie simpson laughed out loud a real good belly laugh itll be a pretty thin volume then this jokers report nice meal thanks puts me on my mettle where to go next week that would be a pretty bloody place to be sniffing its only a bromide job of course its not sharpend work they had their coats on they were out on the pavement their voices drifted come on arnold what would you have ever known about sharpend work arnold browne sniggered same as you georgie damn all of nothing it was the late afternoon and a thin sun was through the cloud and the garden grass was drying the child played between the apple trees that spread above the vegetable patch marko had the plastic pistol it had not been out of his sight since his father had brought it to him taken to school laid on the pillow of his bed he weaved among the old tree trunks and saw the old ustase enemy and fired on them and killed them it was the game he played every day with a wooden stick that made the shape of a rifle before his father had brought him the plastic pistol from belgrade killing the ustase enemy he played alone in the village there was the scream of a car horn sounded like an alarm and marko heard the shouts of men he played alone because his friend the one friend of his life was gone it was as if he no longer trusted that he could find a good friend again he was six years old and his birthday would be the next week and although it was many months since his friend had gone he could still remember so clearly the knowledge that his friend had betrayed him his friend had been a part of the ustase enemy where marko played ducking running throwing himself down onto the grass to find shooting cover beside the apple trees he could see across the field and across the narrow stream and across more fields to the village where his friend had lived he could see the house in the village across the stream and there was no roof on the house and where the side wall of the house had collapsed he could see the bright cream and red of the wallpaper of the room that had been his friends most days in summer he had waded the ford in the stream or his friend had come the same way to him and most days in winter when the stream was high he had gone across the plank bridge or his friend had come that way to him and now he knew that his friend was an ustase enemy and he knew that the parents of his friend and all in the village across the stream had planned to slit the throats of their serb neighbours he knew it because he had been told it by his father he had wondered often if his friend would have come in the night with all the other ustase enemies and carried a knife and cut his throat it was too much of a betrayal for him to care to find another friend markos game died a car screamed down the lane towards their house the car braked and scattered mud in front of the house and his father was jumping from the car while it still moved and was running towards the big door the dog was barking and running after his father and into the house marko came from the orchard hurrying he whistled for the dog to come to him the dog had no name now but it came to the whistle there were five men in the car and they were crashing magazines into their weapons the dog was his he had saved the life of his dog the dog had belonged to the family of his friend who was now an ustase enemy it had been before the battle for the village across the stream that his friend had gone with his family all packed with cases and bedding into the yugo car he had watched it from behind the apple trees he had been behind the apple trees because for a week the snipers had fired across the narrow stream and his mother would have beaten him if she had known he was at the back of the house they had left the dog he had seen how the dog had run after the weigheddown yugo car and he had heard his friends father curse the dog for running beside the wheels and the dog had run after the car until they were gone from his sight it had been a week after the battle that he had heard the dog barking in the night from beside his friends house and his father had said that he would go shoot the dog in the morning and he had cried for the dog in a way that he had not cried for his friend his father had crossed the stream and brought the dog home and his father had said that there was no point in giving the dog a new name because it would not respond and they could not use the old name of the dog because it was an ustase name he had hold of the dogs collar when his father exploded from the big door of the house his father carried his army pack and a small radio and his rifle there was the roar of the car leaving marko ran to the gate onto the lane up the lane in the square of the village he saw more cars gathered and he heard more shouting his mother had hold of his shoulder he should be inside the house he should not be out of the house his mother told him that his father had gone to lead the search for ustase spies who had crossed over the kupa river who were in the forest and the hills above rosenovici village all the rest of the afternoon marko stood at the window of his bedroom and he gazed across the narrow stream into the curtain of trees that covered the hillside she paid the taxi off fast thrust the note at the driver and did not wait for the change the drizzle was back and the wet clung to charless shoulder typical of him to wait on the pavement for her she reeled off her excuses the weather late train no taxis she saw his expression set hard and annoyed sorry sorry he marched up the wide office steps i saw your mister penn i told him his figures were ludicrous and i told him they were extortionate and he said that was his rate and he said that if i didnt like it i could shove it up my and he was pretty damn lucky to catch me happy he won charles braddock grinned sourly he said that he would be leaving for zagreb in the morning but dont think youll be getting anything more than a load of paper he was pretty damn lucky she kissed her husbands cheek thank you i rather liked him what i liked about him was that he told me to mind my own business doesnt grovel too much not to you not to me come on they were going to the lift the commissionaire had the doors open for them wore his medals proudly and ducked his head in respect to them penn had told her husband that if he didnt like the terms he could shove the assignment and he had told her to mind her own business quite amusing the lift doors closed mary said my guess is hes been badly used hes rather sweet but so naive if we could please just enjoy a normal evening it was the usual type of gathering for which mary braddock hiked to london her husbands senior colleagues and the design team and the clients she thought that her mister penn would not have stood a cat in hells chance would have been kicked away down the lift shaft if it hadnt been that the clients had put ink on the contracts that very day she wafted through the salon she meandered into and out of conversations her mind was away away with the man who would be travelling to zagreb away with her daughter who was dead buried gone a thin little weed of a man approached her husbands financial controller and he had caught her sincerest condolences dear mary such a dreadful time for you sincerity he wouldnt know what the word meant heartfelt apologies mary that i couldnt make the funeral just not enough hours in the day no he wouldnt have taken time off for a funeral from the small type of a contract still she was so difficult wasnt she we have to hope at last that she lies in peace your dorothy she was such a trial to you she did it expertly and fast she tipped her cointreau and ice against the left side of his palegrey suit jacket she thought it would be a lasting stain hoped it would defeat the dry cleaner the amber ran on the grey dorrie she was mine damn you she was mine she was sitting in the chair by the door and watching him she didnt help him to pack how long are you going to be there his suitcase was on the bed his clothes were stacked close to the case and he tried to make a mental note of what he would need where are you going to be staying she had the baby tom on her shoulder and she gripped him tight her statements came like machinegun bullets hurting him wounding whats the point of it all his shoes went into the bottom of the case with his bag for washing kit and toothpaste and razors and a guidebook of former yugoslavia and around their bulk went his socks and his underclothes penn told his wife quiet voice that he thought he would be away for a minimum of a week and he told her the name of the hotel where he was booked and he told her about mary braddock on top of his socks and underclothes he laid two pairs of slacks charcoalgrey so im just supposed to sit here and wait for you to show up again all his shirts were white it was like a uniform to him that he wore charcoalgrey trousers and white shirts and quiet ties he had always worn the uniform when he had gone to work at gower street the jeans and the sweaters and the casual shirts that were right for section of a branch had been kept in a locker if you hadnt made such a fool of yourself then you wouldnt be running round with that deadbeat outfit would you their home two bedrooms one floor had cost their mortgage was they could not have bought the house and furnished it without the help of her father digging into his building society savings they were not quite negative equity but damn near they could not sell the house without slashing into what her father had loaned them or what the building society had advanced them they were trapped in the bloody place and it was not a home any more but a little brightly painted prison he thought there was enough in the case for a week and something to spare what you do now its grubby isnt it its prying into peoples lives how do you hold your head up well he held his head up because there was a cheque coming into the bank each month and that should have been a good enough reason to hold his bloody head up he would wear his blazer on the aircraft not fold it away in the case he did not take jane home any more to his parents and the tied cottage and they had not yet seen their grandson tom nothing said but understood amongst them all that he did not take jane home if his mother rang and jane answered the telephone then his mother just rang off the maisonette was a brightly painted prison and the marriage was a locked cell door but he hadnt the time to be thinking about solicitors and he hadnt the money to be thinking about new rent to go with the old mortgage he closed the case and fastened the lock and put the case on the floor at the end of the bed and whats the point of you going there whats anyone to gain from it it was the way of her to goad him he looked into the frightened small eyes of her face and they were reddened from crying from before he had come home she was looking at his lip which was better now but still ugly penn said softly i am not going into a war zone the war zone is bosnia i am going to croatia the war finished in croatia more than a year ago the wars gone on by to bosnia i am going to trawl round the embassy i am going to see the ministries there i am going to interview and get transcripts from a few refugees i am going to write a report thats what theyre going to get a nice little typedup report i am going to get a good fee from it and theyre going to get a good typedup report the tears had come again youll be sucked in no chance he couldnt talk it through with her never had been able to but it was worse now it was his habit with her to hide behind the denials he could have talked it through with dougal his best mate in the transit team but dougal gray was in belfast had extended his tour and the postcards with the dry tourists messages didnt come any more it was only with dougal that he had ever talked through work problems and jane problems and had a few laughs and once substituted white paint thinner for milk in the silver tops of an old miserys house and once the best times in the transit were with dougal and then dougal hadnt been around to talk through his being dumped by the service and dougal had been long gone when he had spent the worst foul hour of his life going home on the train walking from the station to the front door preparing to tell jane that the job was finished youll be sucked in because you always want to belong no way wont you youll be stupid penn knelt beside the chair he had so little to say to her he did not have to offer a checklist of their social arrangements that he would not now be able to meet because they had no social life men from po box were not a part of any outside community and the pariah status remained for a reject there was no amateur dramatics society to be told he would miss a rehearsal there was no pub skittles team to be told that he was missing the next league outing there was no evening education class because he could never guarantee his attendance there was no dinner party or meal out with friends because five men exfive men avoided the great unwashed he would be gone for a week and no one in their block of maisonettes in their street would know or notice might just be the story of his goddamn life he put his hands on her arms and she flinched from him and was holding tight to their baby wouldnt she just understand couldnt she try to understand that he might just want to go i promise that i wont be stupid its just a report jane its not rambo nonsense its just a report that will put some poor womans torment to rest its nothing special dont think if you play the hero theyll have you back if youd met her he remembered the woman in torment sitting with her dogs beside the grave and he remembered that the flowers on the grave had lost their brightness he thought it a pity that the daughter dorrie had been just a messer and a tosser he thought that the work would have been more interesting more fulfilling if the girl had been worthwhile there was nothing worthwhile that he had been told about the girl when he had sat beside the aga in the kitchen and drunk the instant coffee i wont even be able to get close to it not even if i wanted to the people who did it killed the girl are beyond reach theyre behind the lines its only to write a report four he started to write after lunch henry carter had clear handwriting and much to be thankful for to a schoolmistress who had presided with an iron fist over a primary class more than fifty years before he had never lost the art of legible copperplate handwriting when he had completed the text when the supervisor had gone for her midafternoon rest break he would slip the sheet to penny a nice girl and respectful and penny would type it for him the typed sheet would go with the file when he was ready to present it for transfer to the disk it was always necessary henry carter believed to have background one couldnt say when the file would be called for when the material would be summoned up it might be next year but then it might not be for a decade it might be that the person young man or young woman who would call up the file was now in short trousers or ankle socks the war might be just history when the file was called for he brushed the crumbs from his table and he swirled his tongue round his mouth to try to lose the tang of the cheese and pickle what surprised him oh yes he could still sometimes surprise himself was that he had stayed with the file right through the statutory one hour of lunch break he had not even taken the rspb magazine from its postal wrapping onto clean paper with a sharpened pencil he wrote briskly it would be good to have the background helpful outline following the collapse of the soviet union amidst a wave of optimism for the future the ethnic groups of the empire demanded again the nationhood that had been suppressed since the establishment of communist regimes after ww communist centralism had failed significantly to blunt such demands yugoslavia always artificial originally dominated in part by the ottoman empire and in part by the austrohungarian empire achieved a bogus national identity between and which fractured on the german invasion ww pro and antiaxis feelings polarized the principal ethnic groupings croats rc and europeorientated took nazi side serbs orthodox and slav formed principal resistance chetniks and partisans muslims obvious tended to regard this as others quarrel and engendered both factions hostility characteristic of serb resistance v croat fascism was horrific cruelty serbs killed by the croatians tito main resistance leader communist josip broz tito by charisma and ruthless rule bound the infant yugoslavia together the serb majority were overrewarded with bureaucracy jobs plus internal security and military titos death can of worms unlidded again post tito problems of different cultures different ambitions are not solved nor much effort made in that direction the adhesive is communist discipline post communist collapse slovenes less important and croats critical are anxious to achieve statehood croats are encouraged by germans sticky finger in the pie again and name a date no thought given to the fears of the several hundred thousand serbs living within the area claimed for new republic of croatia inside serbcroat population were strong memories of ww atrocities also the knowledge that privileged status would end bosnia problem not dealt with irrelevant to this file the war serbcroat population formed territorial defence force ragtag militia and was aided by serbcontrolled jna regular army principal serbcroat population areas were taken in military action followed by ethnic cleansing removal or killing of croat population in captured areas main effort of the war lasted months ceasefire in january when per cent of new croatia had been lost to serbs nb dorothy mow at killed in december when serb militia and jna overran the croat village of rosenovici glina municipality situation at time of penns visit to croatia nb penn arrived zagreb april the indigenous serbs occupying parts of former croatia had declared a republic of krajina under the unbrokered ceasefire agreement the territory was to be policed by a united nations protection force unprofor but increasing serb hostility to the international community severely handicapped unprofors ability to carry out its mandate unprofor designated four areas of responsibility as sector south sector north sector west and sector east glina municipality in sector north ceasefire line maintained by both combatants in high state of alert with serb advantage in numbers and quality of armour artillery in the sectors ongoing brutality towards few croats left behind in general flight nb dorothy mow at body recovered april he read the paper back a little wordy his background material but he did not think it possible for the events of that spring two years ago to be appreciated if the context were not known he was thirtyfour years old and it was something he had wanted to do since he was a child penn gazed from the window of the great train he could justify it because one of the senior instructors had remarked over a canteen dinner at the training school fifteen years back that in the days of quality field operations it was always best to cross europe by train the instructor had said that border checks at night sleepy frontier guards thumbing their thick books of the names of illegals were never as sharp as at the airport immigration desks the instructor had said that if an operative wanted to get unnoticed unhindered into eastern europe then the operative always stood a better than average chance if he took a rocking and winding and slowhauling train that was the justification slight enough but the hard reason was that penn had always wished on the chance to take a great train through the mountains of central europe he gazed from the window into the night and the mountains were dark shadows except where they climbed sufficiently for the spring snow to have lasted and the steepling forests beside the track were a mass of black and the rivers tumbled silver in the light thrown down from the carriages the joy of the journey was gone with the coming of the evening the joy had been the afternoon crawl through austria and the images stayed with him of the talltowered and ruined castles that perched on crags of the farms of toytown neatness that were in the valleys below the track and the miniature tractors that were out in the handkerchief fields pulling the manure carts from the woodbuilt cattle barns it was not his style to think the clever thoughts that he was traversing the no mans land between the civility of old europe and the barbarity of new europe his style was to inhale the beauty the majesty of high mountains and sharp valleys and thick forest and brutal outcrops of rock take the beauty and majesty into his mind and imagine the delight of walking there he wondered if there would be the same deer the same foxes the same badgers as there had been in the fields and woods and hills around the tied cottage of his childhood a place for a man to be alone so he had taken the chance to ride the great train he had flown in the morning from heathrow to munich crossed munich by the airport bus and bought his ticket at the hauptbahnhof and eaten a sandwich and climbed onto the mimara express salzburg villach ljubljana to zagreb it was his dream it was a collection of postcard prints and the dusk and then the evening had come and he doubted that he would tell jane when he made it back to heathrow and raynes park and b the cedars that he had taken a great train over a track that cut a route through austria his briefcase was on the seat beside him he reached for it it was the briefcase that he had purchased second hand from the store in gower street bought with pride thirteen years back the briefcase had been black but long usage by a previous owner had frayed the flap and scuffed the edges and scratched the surface the briefcase might once have belonged to a higher executive officer even to a senior executive officer but it had been purchased by a b grade clerk and it was his symbol that he belonged at the heart of the security service the eiir symbol once gold was worn and it had been one of the games played by the b grade clerk to imagine what secrets had been held in the briefcase there were no damn secrets now he took his notes from the briefcase he was already in the vernacular of his client they were the notes that he had scribbled fast on the table beside the aga of the horrid young woman dorrie how the horrid young woman dorrie had killed her mothers honeymoon how she had made a quality scene when the guest for dinner had been the local master of foxhounds and she had poured tomato puree over the mans tuxedo jacket how she had made a quality exhibition with the strip dance that went to full frontal at her sixteenth birthday party how she had taken her mothers visa forged the signature and bought the current liaison from the council houses a cc yamaha new how she swore at her stepfather where the world could hear her how she stole screwed they had pulled clear of ljubljana they had lurched to an uneven stop at a halt station there was the slamming of doors and the scream of whistles the train headed on in the night how she was gone dead buried he thought that his own father would have taken a strap to the horrid young woman and his own mother would have locked her in a bedroom to scream starve do what she cared there were two photographs in the briefcase there was the photograph of her hanging back and half hidden behind the posed pair her mother and stepfather with her face pinched in aggression it was the second photograph that interested penn more the girl laughing and a prettiness on her face and three of the liaisons from the council houses with their arms on her as if they knew each corner of her this photograph had been hidden in her room and found by her mother perhaps he would find which of the photographs was real perhaps not a man towered above him it was as the instructor had said a man in a uniform of cheap cloth and with a cheap leather belt with a cheap leather holster slung from it and a cheap cigarette in his mouth waited over him smelling of cheap lotion his passport was checked handed back to him no record was taken of his passport number he was into croatia maybe it was important that no record had been taken maybe not he settled back to the photographs and back to his notes it certainly would have been easier for him if the clients daughter dorrie had been more than just a horrid young woman she knew the sound of the jaguar and she knew to take his moods from the sound of the jaguar braking the braking was sharp noisy god she set her face the smile of the little woman back home and waiting on an angry breadwinner returning from commercial warfare with his damned nose tweaked or his damned ego bruised she could usually massage his temper turn anger to a sullen acceptance mary opened the front door poor dear whats the crisis the door slammed behind charles braddock kicked shut with his heel fine for him to kick the door shut with his irontipped shoe heel but heaven preserve a village boy who as much as brushed a leaning elbow on the paintwork the crisis is those bloody koreans the crisis is that they are twentyfour hours after ink on paper requiring renegotiation of penalty clauses bloody impossible poor dear gins waiting routine time into the small living room into his chair four cubes of ice two fingers of gin halfslice of lemon to the top with tonic and let him blather it out mary sat on the arm of the chair and her fingers made patterns at his neck and the gin level lowered as if the anger was gulping down his throat curses obscenities giving way to resentment selfpity nothing changed after their supper when she was putting the dishes away she might just push him down the garden towards his snug and she might just ring next door and get arnold to report for duty across the stile i mean how can you do business with people agree everything have those bloody lawyers sift through it have them sign it then the little buggers want to start haggling again it is just not possible her fingers soothed him poor dear resigned hows your day been he rang she said brightly he rang from the airport i should think he bloody did and bloody cheerful he should have been with the bloody money were paying him not actually cheerful sort of distant she knew she shouldnt have said it it was like another flint in a walking shoe she saw the frown burrow at his forehead and tried to escape i dont know ill get supper hold hold what do you mean distant well it was the airport he was just flying out nobodys communicative when they ring from the airport give it me she took a breath it was as though he was uninvolved of course hes not involved it was as though it was just another job of course its just another job why should he be involved and she felt the tiredness and she didnt want to talk about it and she didnt want to think about it and she had sat all the afternoon in dorries room she was tired and the anger in his face lowered at her and his voice beat over her his problem penns problem is hes secondrate hes not what arnold cracked him up to be hes offensive and secondrate if it hadnt been for you i tell you i would not have tolerated his rudeness to me he caught me and hes a bloody secondrater hes taking me you us for a bloody ride the snap she was trying to call it back the face of a small child happy the weight of a footfall on a dried branch she had the body of the child and the clothes of the child she went for the kitchen the face was old mature not a childs and screwed in dislike she was shouting back at him always the image was of the screwed face of a young woman never of a happy child her voice shrill he should join the club right should join the club because were all secondrate to you right starting with my daughter the lights were dim over the platform the electricity supply had been reduced to save power penns carriage between ljubljana and zagreb had been empty he took his suitcase down from the rack and he checked that his briefcase was fastened and he went to the door he stepped down onto the platform into the gloom of the place a pair of germans suits businessmen jostled past him and penn thought they might have been cursing that they hadnt flown down the platform he saw two military policemen questioning a young man against the grimed brick wall and one of them held back a rottweiler dog on a short leash and penn guessed they would be checking for army deserters he followed the germans through the exit arch and down the corridors past the closed ticket windows there were men women sleeping on the hard floor in corners and penn was reminded that somewhere out in the darkness out beyond the city there was war he hurried he knew where he would go because he had memorized the guidebook map there was a mist on zagreb he stumbled on the cobblestones of the street a bell rang fiercely and he looked up startled as a tram loomed towards him he skipped forward and tripped on a tram line he saw the neon sign of the hotel tired staff waited on him at the reception he walked past the entrance to the bar closed he looked into the casino deserted but for the croupiers he went by the dining room shut a slow lift took him up he gave the porter a pound sterling coin and the porter grimaced as if it were dirt he wanted german marks or american dollars and penn thought he could go stuff himself there was a siren in the darkness all around him in the night a hostility a foreign place this not penns place and just thirtyfive miles down the road was the ceasefire line and the start of the war zone and it was not penns war he would have said that he was good at being alone but in the hotel room he felt his loneliness not his place and not his war he threw off his clothes he washed he unpacked his suitcase there would have been other men in the hotel far from home nitpicking through their lives behind their locked doors he chose to scratch unhappily at his marriage as if with grubby fingernails alone in the room he could summon the honesty to say it was not janes fault he was to blame five years back making small talk at a railway station waiting for a fogdelayed train and going for a drink when the train was finally cancelled and sharing a taxi she was so different to the women the girls in gower street she was pretty fluffy and her skirt was always halfway up her thighs and climbing and he was the quiet one with the secret of his job to hide behind she must have felt an excitement at being with a man who did secret work for the government something that could not be talked about and the excitement had lasted through to marriage and then gone sour gone sour because she would come home from the estate agents and maybe he would be just going out for a night shift with the transit van team of watchers or maybe he had been up all night and half the day and gone to bed and expected her to tiptoe round the maisonette as if she was a dormouse and maybe he would snarl because shed woken him with the telly and the soaps or maybe it had been a bad damn awful day that couldnt be talked through because that was the lore of the service maybe it was him snapping at her friends because he couldnt answer their so bloody simple questions about his work maybe it was him refusing point blank to permit her to ask her father for more money for another house deposit digging in his heels bloodyminded maybe it was him suggesting almost shyly that the way forward was for him to take three years out and go to college and get a bloody degree and maybe she was right to jeer back that no way was she going to live for three years carrying him paying all the bills and she hadnt passed an exam since school and wayne who managed the estate agents drove a fifthhand porsche and had never passed an exam in his life maybe the baby should have helped but it hadnt the baby tom should have bonded them the baby had cut out her money it was penns belief that a husband should provide a father should go to work a mother should stay home with a baby oldfashioned penn boring penn and hed said that no way was she going back to work with a minder to watch his baby shed told him full of tears that she hadnt listened to him had gone back with the pram to the estate agents made it as far as the plateglass window with the bright photographs of properties and seen wayne bending over the new girl and a hand on the shoulder of the new girls blouse and shed turned around and pushed the pram back to the maisonette and the day after that he had gone to those he thought he believed in on the high floors of gower street and requested the chance to work on general intelligence group and been betrayed he lay in the bed from the street below he sensed the burgeoning quiet of the night of a foreign city but it had been domes place and domes war the ant column had found his hand a barrier and busily crossed it he could feel their unstoppable progress and he did not dare to move his hand to shake them off he felt as if he was dead ham didnt reckon he could have run another yard crawled another foot climbed another inch the tree line had been the first target and the rock escarpment had been the second and the final aim had been to reach running crawling climbing the summit of the escarpment he felt as if he was dead he would have been dead if they had had a good dog or if they had had organization and discipline he could see them from where he lay they were below quartering the field that was beyond the escarpment down from the tree line of springgreen birches ham could hear their shouts and the whistle blasts but they had no dogs it was because of the wounded that they had broken off the pace of the search it was the wounded that had saved him and the three others who had stampeded with him away from the ambush the light caught the grass of the field and the sun feathered down through the upper trees and dappled onto the summit of the rock escarpment they had been hit at first light when the grey smear was settling on the fields and the trees they had been caught bunched and too close on a track that if the intelligence had been accurate would have brought them to the rear side of the artillery position if the ambush had been done properly as an ambush was taught at aldershot or out on the ranges above brecon then there would have been no survivors but the ambush had been crap and there hadnt been fire control and they had made it out and running all of them running and hearing the shouting and the chaotic chase behind them and they had hit the open ground of the field without warning shit bloody bad luck the open field it was there that the two of them had been shot and he had run too fucking right and the others who hadnt been shot had run looking down through the thin early foliage ham saw the line that advanced crouching then scurrying towards the two wounded men the ants came on across his hand and he would not move his hand and he would not twist his head he whispered from the side of his mouth as if he thought he hazarded his hiding place should his lips move move once you bastards move once at all and ill break your goddamn necks he could hear the three of them behind him all trying to suppress the panting all sobered by the ambush and by the charge out and by the climb onto the summit of the escarpment and by the sight of the cordon line closing on the two who were wounded shit no they hadnt listened to ham when they had crossed the kupa river in the inflatable and they hadnt listened to him when he had told them swearing that they should lay off the booze in their water bottles and they hadnt listened to him when they had moved out to get close to the artillery position under the night cover that was now gone shit yes they listened to him now and if it hadnt been that the ambush was crap then they would all six of them have been on the ground beyond help as the cordon line closed they listened and struggled to control their breathing and they were watching as ham watched nothing you can do so dont fucking think there is anything he knew that the brother of one of them behind him was wounded lying in the field it was the worst it had ever been for ham his throat was dry dust his gut was knotted tight his arms legs would have been stiffened clumsy if he had tried to move there were tears welling heavy too bloody unfair he had known guys who had been killed in closequarters fire and guys who had been wasted when an armoured personnel carrier had been rattled and brewed and guys who had been mutilated when caught without cover as the rockets from the organj launcher had come down he had known guys from the international brigade who had been in osijek in turanj outside sisak and shipped home in boxes by the embassy but that had been more than a year back more than a year and a half he had known guys who had said it was too goddamn dull in croatia after the ceasefire and who had hitched on down to bosnia but that was a crazy bloody place to get killed too bloody unfair in the days with the internationals ham had been classified sniper first class using the longbarrelled dragunov stationary target three shots out of four at metres in the days after the internationals had drifted off scene or been booted he had bullshit ted expertise in ordnance no home to go back to had to bullshit to stay big bullshit if he wasnt to be on the trail down to bosnia and the crazy bloody war too bloody unfair they had wanted an ordnance man to get across the kupa river and spy out the artillery position on the high ground and their own ordnance men would have been too precious as an ordnance man he would have been able to identify the type and calibre of the artillery pieces in the position their stockpiles of ammunition their threat big bloody bullshit and the bullshit had put him where it was worse than it had ever been for ham he did not reckon it safe to use his binoculars could have been flash or shine from the lenses against the lowrising sun he could see enough without the binoculars he knew what he would see he knew it because he had dreamed it in the temporary sleeping quarters behind the old police station in karlovac town the dream was hams agony ham knew that the wounded struggling to keep up with those who were not wounded would have thrown away their weapons as they had lumbered hobbled after those who had run if they had had their weapons then sure as christ they would have used them sure as christ they would have used their weapons and kept one back for the last there was no firing the cordon line reached that part of the field near to the tree line where the wounded lay he could see it clear enough without binoculars he should have looked away and he could not the stuff of hams dreams the stuff that made him sweat toss sometimes scream in the night there was a bearded man big and well set in the centre of the cordon line and he had a whistle in his mouth and his was the voice of command ham could not see the wounded lying in the thick spring grass of the field but he knew where they were because he saw the bearded man kick hard into the grass and the moan carried up from the field and through the trees and reached the summit of the rock escarpment he saw the bearded man swivel casually like he played kids football and kick again there was a moment of confusion men around the bearded man and bending down and two small scrimmages of bodies he heard the orders from the bearded man curt in the sunshine the two wounded were held upright in front of the bearded man and he punched them one in the face and one in the pit of the stomach and because they were held they could not fall then bandannas from the heads of two of the men who held them were used to blindfold the wounded the knife flashed at the waist of the bearded man the knife went low quick to the groin of the wounded man who had the bloodstains at his knee and down his right leg ham turned his first movement and he broke the column of the ants and he slapped the palm of his hand across the eyes of the brother of the wounded man he heard the howl of pain sobbing the tears were running on his face and the vomit was coming he watched it each instruction from the bearded man each thrust of the knife it was worse than the dream when it was over when the sport was gone then the bearded man wiped his knife on the grass and replaced it in the sheath at his belt and all of them sat in the field close to where the bodies lay and they drank and they laughed they had no organization and no discipline after they had drunk and told their jokes they moved off again towards the tree line but the heart had gone from the search they did not go far into the birch trees that covered the hillside and they did not come near to the rock escarpment they went back the way they had come and there were the marks of their boots in the wet grass and the trails where the two bodies were dragged ham watched he wiped his face furtive and his tears smeared the camouflage cream his eyes all the time held the broad and powerful back of the bearded man who walked easily walked without care piece of cake if he had had the dragunov svd mm not the kalashnikov piece of cake for a sniper first class ham murmured thats a right bastard the brother of the man who had been castrated whispered calmly that is milan stankovic that right bastard needs sorting he is milan stankovic he commands the tdf unit at the village of salika he has grown the beard now because he would think that makes him more of the serb soldier it is perhaps ten kilometres from here his village he was a clerk he was a junior clerk in the administration of the cooperative at turanj all the farmers in the region came to the cooperative with their produce and it was marketed from there we came my brother and i to the cooperative each week in the summer it was the job of milan stankovic to check the paper we brought to see that we did not cheat and then to stamp the paper to check paper and to stamp it now he is an important man he would have recognized immediately the face of my brother often we used to bring him the best cabbages or carrots or a side of meat some cheese because then he would check our paper and stamp it more quickly we would always look after milan stankovic he knew my brother and he killed him that is milan stankovic they were gone into the trees on the far side of the field ham sat he understood enough of the war to believe that if the brothers one dead and one living had captured the bearded man who they knew then another knife would have flashed another knife would have gouged he said nothing we could have done if anyone had fired wed all have been gone its called sere guys thats survive evade resist escape they would lie up the rest of the day at dusk they would move for the kupa river the streets were cheerful the shops had good stock the gutters were clean the bars were full and the espresso machines rumbled and the chairs of the pavement cafes were taken the sun shone warm enough for penn to have turned on his heel after a hundredyard walk collected his room key again and dumped his coat and his scarf and his gloves a fine morning to walk and for the second time he passed the taxi line in the road outside the hotel it was all a culture shock for bill penn and he had the guidebook to tell him that this was an old city historic and finely preserved and he could not square the city with what he had seen in his hotel room on the television from the satellite news on the news across country was srebrenica where a town was being shelled and starved to surrender and on the same bulletin had been clear colour pictures of british squad dies handso ling charred bodies and a young officer had said his men would need counselling if they were not to be scarred for the rest of their lives and there had been film of an american aircraft carrier across the water taking off with the bomb loads in place for practice runs a war in bosnia across country and nothing of it to be seen by penn as he viewed for the first time the capital city of zagreb he walked quickly he was not a tourist he was on assignment he had polished his black shoes in his room he wore his charcoalgrey trousers and his blazer and he had brushed the flecks from the shoulders he had his white shirt and a quiet tie and he carried his old briefcase and it was difficult for him to realize that the months had passed by that it was not a government assignment he had a starting place but not yet a programme he went up haulikova and across andrije hebranga and up preradoviceva and came to a wide square he felt comfortable he liked the feel of the place he would write a good fast report he thought that jane would have liked the feel of the city on ilica looking left jumping out of the path of a damned tram he saw the flag red and white and blue and looking as if it needed a full wash and tumble and hanging limp it was an old building and there was an arched entrance to the inner courtyard and a brass plaque at the side door of course the embassy was perms start point he saw the posters on the stair walls edinburgh castle british butterflies a cotswold village badgers outside a sett buckingham palace it was the world to which he had once belonged inside a small lobby and the englishwoman at the desk smiling and asking him with studied politeness can i help my names penn bill penn id like to see one of your diplomats please its in connection with miss mowat its about the late miss dorothy mowat it was as if he had sworn or unzipped his flies because the smile was suddenly gone from her she gestured for him to wait and her face was cold he wondered if she had been here dorrie turning the faces cold he thought that mary braddock would have been here sitting on the hard chairs in the small lobby and turning the pages of the english magazines killing the smiles he could see the englishwoman blurred through the frosted glass of the adjacent office he wondered if anyone had jumped when mary braddock had come the first time to start a search for her daughter and failed the blurred shapes meandered across the face of the glass and towards the door he thought the papers would have been sorted here stamped here duplicated here for the repatriation of the corpse the englishwoman stood in the door and gestured penn forward and stepped aside the room had been large once perhaps the salon of a wellproportioned apartment but it was now subdivided into rabbit hutches there was a tall man in shirtsleeves and braces rather young he didnt offer a handshake cigarette smoke curled from an ashtray he didnt give his name the desk was a confusion of paper he stood im the first secretary who do you represent mr penn i represent miss mowats mother ive been hired by mrs mary braddock and what are you mr penn pederast no pusher no pimp no private investigator yes i am a private investigator i have been employed by mrs braddock to examine the circumstances of her daughters murder why do you come here penn bridled as a starting point she was british im british natural enough to attend her britannic majestys talking shop we gave mrs braddock every possible help she left here knowing as much as it was humanly possible to know cant accept that she wrote a note mrs braddock of what she had been told which i read she had been told nothing if she hadnt been told nothing then i wouldnt be here because it was a sharp little voice reedy we have a full load of work and about half the staff necessary to accomplish it no dont interrupt listen mrs braddock was told everything about her daughters death that it was possible to discover everything i wouldnt imagine that private investigators have too much time to read newspapers if you read a newspaper regularly then you would know that there was a pretty horrible war going on down here and facts truths tend to be rather a long way down the order of priorities where miss mowat died only a lunatic would have been she died because she was a fool as regards facts in that dirty little war some croatians lost their lives more than were wounded are missing presumed dead have fled their former homes do i make myself clear there has been an earthquake here of human misery and against the reality of that destruction the demands of a mother for a fuller investigation into the death of one young lunatic woman is quite unreasonable first day here is it well get yourself a map mr penn learn a bit of geography where she died is behind serb lines where she was killed is closed territory i wouldnt want to see you or hear of you again mr penn because if i see you or hear of you again then it will mean you have caused trouble ive enough to concern me without freelancers interfering in sensitive areas and making trouble he had torn a sheet of paper from a notepad he wrote fast on it passed the paper to penn i imagine you have to justify an inflated fee i dont suppose you speak fluent serbocroat no thats an interpreter second is the name of the man who runs the croatian war crimes unit he wont know anything but hell be impressive on your report by the by do you know how mrs braddock came to know that her daughter was here a demand for money do you know how she came to know her daughter was missing the money wasnt collected it was sent back didnt she tell you were not talking about a very caring young woman you know go away mr penn and i suggest you allow the dead to sleep he walked to the door and opened it for penn penn took himself past the englishwoman to the main door he went out onto the street numbed it was as if a cold wind had come the hunger strike was spreading on the third floor men were smoking more in the sleeping rooms and she had shouted and threatened she had more families coming from bosnia in the morning and the accommodation area was already saturated she had received smiling and cheerful and a sham a delegation that afternoon from the swedish red cross it was close to midnight and she was exhausted she had had the police in accusing the children of stealing in the town men from prijedor on the second floor had been close almost to a riot at the counter for onward movement another day ending for ulrike schmidt as she slipped dead on her feet out from the high heavy doors of the transit centre she went to her car parked in the square and she did not look back at the old barracks building that was the transit centre for bosnian muslim refugees the end of another eighteenhour day and she had no need to look back on the building the building consumed her attention eighteen hours a day she slumped behind the wheel of the little volkswagen beetle bit at her lip turned the ignition key ahead of her was a cold supper in the fridge of her apartment a nights heavy and unrewarding sleep the clamour of an alarm clock that was the life of ulrike schmidt paid by the united nations high commission for refugees to administer the transit centre at karlovac the men were on hunger strike because they had been promised entry with their families to austria the papers were in place but the visas were delayed the members of the delegation of the swedish red cross were disarming and friendly but adamant that they could offer only medicines not entry permits if the men smoked in the rooms of the barracks where the floors were covered with mattresses where each family made personal boxes from hanging blankets then the fire risk was just appalling if the police came in and demanded the right to search and if the police took away children for thieving then there would be fighting and if more families came in the morning and the resident families had to be pushed into making room for them if more entry permits were not available at the onward movement counter she drove away she left it behind her for six hours the misery of refugees who were her charge ulrike schmidt had told the delegation of the swedish red cross that the bosnian muslim refugees were the most traumatized people in the world she had told them that where they stood grasping their factsheets was the most traumatized place in the world how did she cope she was asked by a severefaced woman from gothenburg when you fall over you have to pick yourself up wipe off the dirt start again and she had smiled and they had all laughed and they did not understand what was her life for eighteen hours of the day she drove through the deserted streets of the front line town towards her apartment it was the day a letter usually came from her mother in munich her life her emotions were shared only with her parents who wrote to her once every week she allowed no one else access to her emotions the jeep passed her her headlights caught the open back of the jeep and then the vehicle arrogantly driven cut across her she braked she slowed there were four men in the back of the jeep her headlights snatched at their faces that were indistinct from the dirt and the camouflage cream the jeep stopped hard outside the sandbagged entrance to the old police station she was at crawl speed three men out of the back of the jeep jumping down pulling after them their weapons and their backpacks one man left in the jeep as she went by him she looked into his face the man sat in the open back of the jeep and his hands were locked onto the barrel of his rifle he was older than the others and he had weight at the jowls and the cheeks of his face the eyes were full of fear and shock she saw the trembling of the body of the man and he blinked into the headlights of her car and he had made no movement to climb down from the jeep she saw the filthy uniform that was mudcovered and soaked wet ulrike schmidt understood she drove on the fear and the shock and the trembling belonged to those who came from behind the lines across the kupa river after her six hours after the alarm had gone in the morning she would be at the crossing point at turanj and she would meet the new party of refugees for whom she had no space at the transit centre and she would see the same fear and shock and trembling in those who had come from behind the lines she speeded her car a silent little prayer played at her lips that the letter from her mother would be waiting at her apartment five sitting upright uncomfortable jovic was waiting penn had learned to use the staircase rather than wait for the interminable lift he paused at the angle of the stairs and saw the young man immediately the hotel lobby was filled for the gathering before the first session of the congress international of croatian physicians a blend of accents and languages filtered up to him but he saw the young man immediately what he had imagined somehow was a retired schoolteacher what he saw was a studentaged young man with a gaunt and pale face and blond hair cropped short and a pair of jeans that were ragged at the ankles and a heavy leather jacket the doctors surgeons anaesthetists flowed around the young man who seemed not to notice them but sat rigid it had been an abrupt exchange on the telephone yes he was an interpreter yes he was available yes he would be at the hotel in the morning there was an aggression about the young man jovic that penn noted it was not possible for him to be without an interpreter sharp introductions an exchange of names penn had the ability to look a man in the face because he had looked into the eyes the face of jovic because they had not shaken hands it was a moment before he realized that the right arm of jovic was taken off at the elbow the right sleeve of the leather jacket from below the elbow hung loose and useless the circle closed an amputation accounted for the gaunt and fleshless face and for the ravaged pallor of the cheeks and for the blunt aggression there were reunion greetings around them the accents of america and australia the languages of swedish and german and swiss french jovic looked back into penns face patronizing bastards his accent was schoolroom english coming here to parade their success for the mother country to see and to write cheques and wring their hands and play their ego and get the hell out in the morning his voice was snarled would he like coffee the young man jovic looked around him and there was contempt at his mouth he led the way out of the hotel lobby and he shouldered his way past the uniformed day porter and the bellboy and penn followed him out across the street they walked in the sunshine towards the square with the open cafes jovic took a table and he shouted in his own language for a waiter and he ordered espressos without asking penn if that was what he wanted and he sat in silence until they were brought and then he pushed the bill slip towards penn for paying he could lay his right elbow on the table awkwardly and he could flick a cigarette from the packet and strike a match laboriously how did it happen have you been in a war mr penn no then you would not understand how it happened where did it happen do you know sisak mr penn no then you would not know where it happened when did it happen when you were safe in your own country mr penn eighteen months ago mr penn did you care about the freedom struggle of croatian independence no that was when it happened penn went on right young man ok jovic if you dont want the job so be it i dont have to take shit from anybody i suggest you go back to whatever corner you came out of and moan on your own a big smile that cracked the pale edges of jovics mouth penn glowered at him he said that he was an artist he said that he studied at the school of art he said that he had learned of constable and turner but that most he admired hockney he said in a new mood and shy that he was learning to paint with his left hand he said more boldly that his rate was eighty us dollars a day he pushed his left hand twisted towards penn for the handshake and there was oil paint on his fingers and grime dirt under the nails it was charles braddocks money a powered grip crushed penns fist he added quickly while their hands were still together that if a car was needed then he could get one and that his rate with the car would be one hundred and twenty us dollars a day penn seemed to see the arm bleeding and hanging loose and he seemed to see the stampede from a front line position and the bumped ride to a casualty clearing station and he seemed to see the fresh bandaged stump and he seemed to see the first tentative strokes of the brush that was guided by a left hand he nodded the money was no problem thank you mr penn so what is your work in croatia it was why he had hoped that he would not have to trail around with an interpreter and he started hesitantly to talk through what he knew of dorrie mowat without an interpreter he might as well sit in his hotel room but it was the sharing that was difficult the story was personal it was the story of a woman sitting at a fresh grave with her dogs and with the scent of newly cut flowers jovic did not interrupt he leaned back and he swirled the coffee dregs in the cup and his mouth had curled as if the story was a bad joke perhaps he tried to impress the young man perhaps he thought that the young man would be better able to do his work if he knew it all he was reciting the crimes of dorrie mowat and he felt a sense of shame as he pushed through the litany and as he talked he looked into the hard eyes that flickered dulled back at him he was dead without an interpreter and he had tried three times the day before to ring the number given him at the embassy and taken back the gabble of local language and not been understood penn wondered what it would be like to try to paint with a left hand he felt that he had betrayed a trust in the telling to a stranger he pushed across the table the telephone number given him at the embassy she wants to know ive been hired to write a report her mother wants to know how her daughter died its why ive come he watched jovics back jovic was at the telephone on the bar when he came back to the table his face was a mask he picked up his cigarettes and gestured coolly for penn to follow penn felt himself an innocent choked me but nothing we could do i took responsibility i said we had to leave them ill remember that bastard that stankovic if i ever get him in my sights but special forces cant hang about it really choked me to leave them ham was rested and it was good patter the patter had been laced with what para would have done and he gave the cocktail body by telling the major and the captain in the firstfloor room of the old police station that not even the rli nor the sadfs recce commandos nor their para brigade would have done it different he had learned the patter when he had been with the internationals and there had been jokers from the rhodesian light infantry and guys who had fought with the south african defence force there had been jokers and guys then who had done the rounds done time as warriors of principle and soldiers of conscience and ham had learned enough from them to give good patter ham said we couldnt have moved better the black hawks wouldnt have done it different i dont know how they got to jump us never saw anything before we were jumped goddamn shame because we werent that far from the position but once theyd jumped us then it was like the place was heaving with them if wed tried to shoot it out then we were all stiffed we did what we could and you cant ask more than that that was great patter to have thrown in the black hawks because they were claimed as the elite of the croat army and he had seen the major take a note with his pencil ham thought they would all get called in the survivors from sector north but he was happy to have been called in the first it had been a crazy dumb idea to send six jerks pushing across the kupa river and beyond the lines into sector north of occupied territory and it was good that the major and the captain should understand that too right i wouldnt want you to think major that it was wasted effort ill have it for you tonight my appraisal of the route in and the route out total detail of minefield location what strong points we saw general movement of tdf location of hulldown armour youll have it on your desk tonight major major what id like to say its rough over there wed done really well to get as far as we had got no i dont know how we got jumped but they were heavy on the ground major thats a bad place he thought he had the patter right wouldnt be good to show fear would be good to show thoroughness all officers shunned fear and adulated keenness the major was a bureaucrat seconded at the start of the war from the finance ministry and knew sweet nothing the major was nodding the major would get a paper of the route they had taken and the location of the minefields and of the tanks and the strong points and the major would take it to his colonel he was useful with bullshit patter ham said in sincere tones im really sorry we couldnt do more for those brave lads im really cut up about that if the objectives important enough then of course we should go back you wont mind me saying it but if i have to go back id request more experienced troops alongside me he had rehearsed that line the last was said looking straight into the majors eyes good sincerity stuff they hadnt more experienced troops in nd bn karlovac brigade if the major reported that to the colonel if the advice was taken then the black hawks would be tasked for the next recce of the artillery guns and the munitions stores and no way that the super shit black hawks would take along a bloody mercenary if it had just been the major to debrief him then ham would have reckoned he had done well but the captain cold bastard had said nothing the captain stared him out never took a note looked at him like he was shit the captain was an intelligence officer fronting as liaison in conclusion sir id like to say that i feel privileged to have served with those young men who didnt make it back ham saluted best salute it was the salute he would have given his company commander at the training camp on the brecons or the operational base at crossmaglen in south armagh or at palace barracks east of belfast centre bullshit salute he hoped dear god he would never be sent again across that bloody river into that bloody hell later when it was evening when he could slip away and the evening darkness came to the karlovac streets he would go to the bar where the telephone was in shadow and behind the screen the major said thank you hamilton thank you for good and resourceful work for nothing sir he had woken foulmouthed and badtempered her man had sworn at her while she had dressed and when little marko had come into their room to play in the bed he had cursed the child for evica her husband was a new man she had made breakfast given them bread she had baked the evening before and jam she had bottled in the autumn and she had tried to accept that her husband was a new man she had dressed her marko and they had gone to the school where she taught the third year and where marko sat in the secondyear class she had come back to her home at the end of the lane at lunch time to make a small light meal for the middle of the day and she had found milan still foulmouthed and badtempered he sat at the table in the kitchen and he had papers spread around him and he made no effort to clear them she had little time in the middle of the day when she took the hour from the school little time to waste in clearing the table and she must waste that little time there was never a point in arguing with him but the moods black and foulmouthed and badtempered were more frequent marko sat at the table close to his father and held the plastic pistol that had been brought from belgrade and was old enough sensible enough to stay silent her former man the clerk in the cooperative at turanj had never been home in the middle of the day and expecting to be fed it was the new way of the new man because she loved him had loved him since she was a child in the village the new man that was her husband hurt her only the beard changed him outwardly inwardly everything was changed he no longer played basketball in glina he no longer followed the big matches in the football league that were played in belgrade he no longer worked through quiet evenings in the vegetable garden at the back of the house he no longer talked gently with her the war had made her milan a new man the war suffocated evica stankovic she thought the war was her enemy and she would not have dared to say it the war was his life in the waking hours and the war was with him when he slept because now there was a shined and cleaned automatic rifle on the rug over the floor at his side of the bed those meetings in all the waking hours and her kitchen often filled when she came back from the school in the afternoon with men from the village who were ignorant and stupid and who talked a babble of fire positions and patrol patterns and her kitchen in the evenings was a stinking place from the smoke of their cigarettes and the scent of their brandy she did not complain would not have dared to in the sleeping hours her new man sometimes rolled in the bed and cried out she was an intelligent woman she had been trained as a teacher at the college in zagreb and she could read books in german as well as italian and in english but it was not possible now for her to get books because of the war and she did not complain and she was intelligent enough to realize that the respect now shown to her in the village owed nothing to love nor to friendship everything to the position of her new man her new man dispensed gasoline and tractor parts and decided who could enlist in the militia and therefore be paid had control over the quotas of agricultural seed they all fawned in the village to her new man and they all gave the show of respect to his wife she hated the war they were on the floor heaped loose where he had thrown them his back was to them as he sat hunched at the table with her toe she nudged the pile of uniform fatigues they had been left for her to wash there were dark bloodstains on them milan had not told her milan had kept his silence since he had come back drunk quiet the evening before she had been told it that morning by the woman who cleaned at the school by the wife of stevo who was the village gravedigger she had been told that her new man milan had slit the throats of two ustase who were captured and his fatigues on which were the bloodstains of the two ustase were left now on the floor for her to wash on the wall above the stove hung by thread from the nail he had hammered into the plaster was the bayonet it was near to a year and a half since he had brought the bayonet down from the loft the bayonet was rusted and the handle grip had rotted it was german army issue had been taken from the belt of a wehrmacht trooper and had been used by the cousin of the father of milan stankovic to stab the trooper to death he had brought the bayonet down from the loft where it had lain undisturbed for forty years and he had hammered the nail in the wall and tied the thread on the handle of the bayonet and hung it the next morning her new man had led the militia in the attack on rosenovici the sunlight played on the window of her kitchen she was hurrying and time was against her in her sink she was sluicing the earth from carrots from the vegetable patch she could see across to rosenovici to the ruined church to the broken houses to the disturbed earth in the corner of the field at the end of the lane the sight across the stream the devastated village was as a pillow that was pressed down onto her face over her nose blocking her mouth the sight was always with her when she looked from the window of her kitchen from the window of her bedroom when she went to get wood from the heaped pile against the shed wall when she went to the vegetable patch when she went to the orchard to pick windfalls when she went to hang her washing on the line then the pillow was across her nose and her mouth there was no escape from the sight of rosenovici she had had friends good friends in the village of rosenovici and she did not dare to talk of them she scoured the skins of the carrots it was since he had come home from belgrade since she had told him of the digging in the corner of the field that he had been all the time foulmouthed and badtempered evica had not told him would not have dared to of the change these last two weeks in the attitude of the schools headmaster to her there was a slyness from the schools headmaster a smugness a distancing from her since the digging and he would have heard as she had heard the broadcast on the radio he would have listened as she had listened to the radio in english on the short wave because that was the small window they could climb through each day when each was alone denied books the radio was her freedom and the headmasters freedom also it had been the voice of an american on the radio be identified and put on trial these perpetrators of crimes against humanity she saw from her kitchen window the dug earth in the corner of the field be treated exactly as were hitlers associates at nuremberg she had not been with those who had crossed the bridge over the swollen river and who had gone to watch the lifting of the bodies from the wet greyblack earth name some names let them understand that over the long run they may be able to run but they cant hide she had seen from her kitchen window the bodies in bags lifted into the jeeps she cut the carrots dropped them into the saucepan the war suffocated evica stankovic the bus was three hours behind schedule when it came through there were nigerian soldiers around her and there were two men from the unhcr office in zagreb who strutted impatiently and carried a printout of the list of names the bus came slow tucked in behind the whitepainted personnel carrier towards the nigerians checkpoint ulrike schmidt always felt a numbed despair when she came to the checkpoint at turanj to welcome in a bus from behind the lines her father of course had known total war and refugee status and her fathers first wife had been killed when the bombers had come to magdeburg one of the men from the united nations high commission for refugees office in zagreb smart and smelling of body lotion made a joke to her as if it were clever to laugh as the bus came through as if it were adult and she ignored him indeed she barely heard him the bus neared the checkpoint and there were serbs standing at the far side of the sandbagged position that the nigerians manned and the serbs would check the printout list of names against the papers of those on the bus she had never and she had written to her father and mother in munich of this never ever seen shame on the faces of the serbs when they checked through the new batch of refugees she knew from the printout that the refugees represented the population of the last village in the prijedor area to be cleansed there would be a village small houses and a mosque and a shop and once neat fields and a car repair yard that would now be flattened and the population of the village were moving away from homes that no longer existed and they would not know if a future was left to them their village was the bus and after the bus their village would be in the corners of the sleeping rooms of the transit centre at karlovac and the wretched fool the young man from the unhcr in zagreb was still laughing at his joke and she could not remember what he had said she saw the broken windows of the bus the front windscreen to the right of the drivers vision was a skein of cracks that radiated from the stones impact point and three of the left side windows behind the driver had caved in she saw the faces of the refugees the young man was talking at her again and she did not hear him so quiet and so cowed the faces of the refugees without expression the stoning might have been by the serbs in prijedor or it might have been later in the journey or it might have been when they were in the last serb village before the final checkpoint she had never travelled beyond the checkpoint never been behind the lines and she found it close to impossible to understand the ethnic hatred that had driven serb people to expel their muslim neighbours and there was no shame she was a small woman her tight waist was held close by the belt of her denims her hair was mahogany but flecked now with grey that had not been there before she had come to administer the transit centre she wore a pressed white blouse open at the throat she used no makeup because cosmetics might seem to offer an insult to the refugees who came from the villages of bosnia and who had nothing she set a smile on her face she was dwarfed by the men around her she was smiling briskly and going towards the door of the bus later she would hear the atrocity stories she would hear who had been raped and who had been tortured and who had been beaten she saw herself as the symbol that the past rape and torture and beatings was finished the young man was beside her towering over her and talking fast like a cockerel parading for a hen and he would because they always did offer her his telephone number for when she could next get to the city and there would be a promise of dinner and she would ignore him as she always did she paused at the door of the bus there were serbs on the steps and she stared them out defiantly until the first weakened his resolve and made room for her they came down off the buss steps and made a point of brushing their bodies against hers and behind them were the faces expressionless of the refugees there was no shame the history of her own country had been only academic to her before her posting to croatia something taught in secondarylevel school by defensive teachers the nazi years the arrogance of men in uniform the brutality of men with guns the fear of dispossessed refugees had no reality for her until she had come to croatia before croatia she had been among the thousands of young persons living the comfortable existence of the aid agencies now it was all changed the culture of the agencies was to turn the cheek smile deflect the insult and that had been possible for her until she had come to croatia there had been little to prepare her for what she would find a flight to geneva a job interview a threeday course and she had been pitched into karlovac she had learned on her feet she had learned to hate the men in uniform and their guns because there was no shame ulrike schmidt yearned to see them stamped down and humiliated she cried inside for a reckoning day to be delivered to those who felt no shame one day her father had told her and he had known because he had been employed as a junior interpreter by the british prosecutor that the guards at the camps in the neuengamme ring had taken photographs of the naked jewish women running past them towards medical inspection and felt no shame she thought that the young serbs who pushed against her breasts in the doorway of the bus felt no shame and thought themselves safe safe from retribution the chief guards at the neuengamme ring of camps had been hanged by the british but they had not thought they would be hanged when they took their photographs she prayed each morning after the clamour of the alarm for strength she made warmth in her smile what motivates me is my belief that if war criminals are found to be beyond justice then we are entering a new age of barbarism the man chainsmoked they had been on the hard chairs in the corridor for an hour bringing men to trial to a court of law will be difficult it will take many years but it is the most important thing the man rested his elbows on the filled desk they had come through heavy sets of old doors climbed dark wide staircases nudged their way past heaped and cobwebbed files revenge killing is useless it is necessary to find truth then justice the man coughed thick phlegm to his lips penn had been told by jovic that it was the ministry office for accumulating evidence on war crimes they had sat a long hour before they were ushered from the corridor and into an office he had tried conversation to kill the time and failed it is necessary to have meticulous preparation of evidence i am determined we will not move outside legality if when it comes to trials it would be catastrophe for a prosecution to collapse on technicality the man talked as if to an audience and the smoke eddied in the wisps of his beard an hour in the corridor and now half an hour as the working of the office was portrayed penn wrote his notes carefully he could not complain at jovics translation steady and at a good pace he had the name of the man and his title and the notes made good reading the pity was that the notes were rubbish they didnt matter he had tried to steer the conversation twice and twice had been ignored because this was prepared speech time for visitors and visitors were supposed to duck their heads in respect a secretary had put her head round the door grimaced at the man penn knew the form the speech would end handshakes farewells and the man would be sweeping out of the office to a new appointment i work in conjunction with the united nations human rights committee and amnesty international rosenovici in the municipality of glina penn said it loud i receive no money from my own government there was a battle in december of for the village of rosenovici in the municipality of glina penn battered on the material i gather will go to the united nations commission for the prosecution of war criminals you are a busy man i am a busy man penn saw that jovic queried him and his eyebrow was lifted in trifled amusement i am not interested in war crimes i am not concerned with the prosecution or freedom of war criminals i want to know what happened in rosenovici in december of when miss dorothy mowat was murdered i apologize but that is all i am interested in he saw the annoyance furrow the head of the man the greatest human rights abuse in europe for fifty years you are not concerned i want to know what happened in rosenovici in december in when miss dorothy mowat died point he saw the sneer creep over the mans mouth you cross the great continent of europe you visit our poor and humble country you arrive late after the war in which my poor and humble country has fought for its very survival you come when the finest of our young people have made the ultimate sacrifice of their lives after our old men have been tortured disembowelled after our old women have been beaten raped after our children have been slaughtered but you want only to know how a young englishwoman was killed you are not concerned with law and justice but with making a report penn said evenly i have been paid to make a report on the circumstances of miss dorothy mowats death the sneer played wide and she was precious and the thousands who have died were without value to make her so precious was she a queen there was the scrape of jovics chair beside him it was the end of the interview penn stood he felt so damned tired it had been time wasted as time had been wasted at the embassy penn said from what i heard what i was told she was a pig of a woman theres no goddamn hot water marty stood in the door and shouted in frustration the towel was loose at his waist i want goddamn hot water there is no hot water heh smart man i am not a fool i know there is no hot water i want my shower i want hot water i pay for hot water there is no hot water there will be hot water for your shower in the morning the doctor sat at the bare wood table and his study books were in front of him the evening had come and the light was poor in the room but the doctor had not switched on the electricity nor had he switched on the immersion that heated water for the shower the american yelled damn it i pay for hot water its part of the rental that i can go take a shower and not in the morning i want and marty let it go he let it go for his own survival if he did not let it go if he kept shouting about the need for hot water for his shower then he would get the big story again the big story was vukovar not that marty jones did not think the story should be told just that he knew the story of each day each night each hour of vukovar because the doctor had told him it the doctor had been in the hospital through the siege of vukovar marty paid a week each calendar month for his room and for the shared use of the sitting room and the kitchen and the bathroom and the rental was supposed to include hot water each evening for a shower he let it go and the doctor should not have been studying close print without the electricity and he let that go the doctor was paying his way through the college for surgeons and he was keeping his mother widowed in vukovar and his nephews orphaned in vukovar and he was keeping the family of his close friend killed in the hospital at vukovar when the kg cluster bombs fell he knew it all because he had been told it it was not easy for an american employed out of geneva by the united nations human rights committee to find good accommodation in zagreb it was damn near impossible on the allowances paid him to find anything that was a personal apartment with its own front door he lodged with the doctor it was the best he could get and if marty jones complained that again there was no hot water for his shower then he would get the story of the amputations carried out with a firewood saw and the casualty wounds cleaned with boiled rainwater and the surgery patients kept warm by a womans hair dryer and the fatals stacked in the yard because it was too dangerous to go bury them and there were no coffins and the pigs and dogs running wild and going for them he didnt need the stories not when he was scratchy and hot and at the end of his day right no shower no shower and no problem he went back to the bathroom he turned the water tap and sponged soap under his armpits the doctor called to him marty did you have a good day he shuddered under the cold water it was hard to have a good day in the converted freight container that had been dumped on the corner of the parade square of the barracks on ilica his work place it would be a good day tomorrow when he drove the jeep down to karlovac and got to talk with the new arrivals from some village in the prijedor municipality but the best days for marty jones were indeed when he sat in the converted freight container where the sun cooked the interior where he had his computer the best days were when he scanned the memory of the computer through what he called his snapshots these were his interviews with refugees now from bosnia earlier from croatia the pick of the best days was when he scanned the memory with the trace when he hacked through to a recurring name the name might be that of an officer in the former jna or it might be the name of a local policeman or a mayors name or the name of a man who had come through from civilian life to take a position of command in the militia or the name of a warlord like arkan or seselj the interviews in the memory were always recorded either by audio or video tape and because he was a lawyer by training marty knew what was necessary as evidence the best days were when he found the traces when a name recurred when a name gathered evidence it was what he was paid to do to prepare cases and accumulate evidence the close friend of the doctor had been butchered after the fall of vukovar when the wounded had been given by the regular army to the militia when the grave had been dug at ovcara when the wounded had been shot there was a named man there were good traces there was evidence of the order being given for a war crime getting there not too bad a day he tore the message pages into many pieces two message pages telephoned from england from mrs mary braddock requiring him to call back he tore them up dropped them into the rubbish bin in the bathroom and let himself out of the hotel room no way that he was going to jump to her no bloody way that he was going to be on the end of her string she would wait until he was ready to report and she could sweat fret whatever until he was ready and he had little to report he could have reported a failed meeting with a first secretary at the embassy and a failed meeting with an official from an outofreality office believing that the cavalry would come one sweet day and take the bad guys off to the thorn bush tree where the rope hung jovic had said that he would fix something for the morning what would he fix for the morning it was not often that penn felt loneliness but he felt it here after two wasted days which was why he had snatched the offer of a few drinks with some friends of the interpreter jovic was waiting outside as if the hotel was dross they walked in the darkness away from the hotel i dont know yet but something i have to make some more calls you worry too much and there will be something now see here you want to do it yourself youre free you make your own programme just tell me what time what place and you arrange it but then bill penn was not a graduate didnt have the bloody intellect and had been heaved bill penn was not material for general intelligence group bill penn was clerk grade executive officer grade pathetic grade with need of a nanny to hold his hand tight bill penn was the jam my bastard who had londed the big fat one and who was out of his depth and who shpuld have stayed on debt collection and rummaging through dustbins and service of legal process and surveillance tailing of a jerk who didnt know he was watched two days had been wasted and he had nothing to report do what you can penn said the streets were bright and full the windows lit the young faces gazing at the heaped goods from old europe the best of london and paris and rome and frankfurt brazened in front of the wide teenage eyes cameras and computers furs and fridges scotch and silks all there and piled high in the windows on trg bana jelacica perhaps jovic read him an illusion the artist said we have nothing but independence old men say that independence is important myself i prefer to have two arms no war and i prefer to paint rather than trail round with an innocent you are goddamn patronizing mr penn surprise surprise they have nice goods in their shops they are affluent innocence to me is shit innocence means that you did not bother to find out before you came right mr penn understand our truth we have no work we have inflation we have no factory production but our shops are full and so you congratulate us who has money mr penn to go to the shops profiteers black marketeers pimps spivs crooks anything can now be bought in our independent nation state what do you want mr penn if you want a woman you can buy her if you want a gun you can buy it if you want a life mr penn you can buy it you would be surprised in your innocence at how cheap comes a woman or a gun or a life they had reached the club the music battered out onto the pavement and the lights strobed from the doorway and fell on the anger of jovics face and he thrust the stump of his arm into penns face but you would not be interested in the price of a woman or a gun or a life i apologize for forgetting your interests would you feel everyone who died here was a pig was it only miss dorothy mowat who was a pig they were inside they had a table penn wore his uniform his charcoalgrey slacks and his white shirt and his quiet tie and his brushed blazer they ignored him he bought the beers for jovic and jovics friends and they ignored him the hash smoke played at his nose he wondered if dorrie had been here it was her kind of place and not penns they talked excited laughing in their own language and he bought more beers and the bottles crowded the table and penn felt a fool and a failure and one of the girls leaned her head against his shoulder as if he were a pillar or a wall the music of a band new orleans creole jazz punished him he was a failure because it had slipped beyond his control jovic the morning penn was shouting and the head of the girl was leaden against him what do we do in the morning jovic was banging his empty glass among the empty bottles and there was a sneer in his face was she really a pig of a woman six yes mr penn it was me that exhumed the cadaver penn felt a small tremor excitement masked it because that was his training jovic had collected him from the hotel jovic had been morose and wrapped within himself they had queued for a tram squeezed on and straphung with the morning crowd jovic had played his own game no talk led him as if on a string and taken him to the hospital jovic had abandoned him in a hallway of chaos in the hospital and argued with a reception woman and then with a manager and then with a doctor jovic had led him through corridors and through swing doors and past wards finally down concrete steps to a basement i heard that mrs braddock was in town two weeks ago when i heard she was in town i was stuck away up in sector east weve a big dig there the vukovar hospital people i just hadnt the opportunity to break away my problem now is ive a plane to get myself from zagreb to frankfurt and ive frankfurt to los angeles tonight fifteen minutes is my maximum penns hand was gouging into the briefcase for his notebook for his pencil but not too fast because it was his training to hide rich and raw relief the professor of pathology from los angeles was a big man he was well preserved but penn reckoned him over seventy years of age the white hair was thin on his scalp and the skin beneath was dappled and discoloured he had not shaved that morning and had white stubble for a beard a scrawny neck and hands with prominent veins he seemed a man who cared i can tell you when she died that was early december in i can tell you where she died in a field where a grave had been dug with an excavator outside rosenovici village in glina municipality i can tell you how she died not with full technical detail but knife wounds at the throat blunt instrument blows to the lower forward skull then a closequarters killing gunshot above the right ear i regret and you have to believe me that i cannot tell you who killed dorothy penn was writing fast they were in an outer office and a woman brought the professor a plastic cup of coffee there was a vigour in the growling voice of the american but a tiredness in his body and he drank deep on the coffee its a hell of a place there the village that was rosenovici its a place of foul death its where murder was done those responsible for the killing they would have come from across the valley from the sister village its salika we had the one chance to get in there and took it they watched us the people from salika and because of their guilt they hated us they wont talk and they were careful those sort of people always are careful there were no survivors that i got to hear about no eyewitnesses to know who killed those men and dorothy then you would have to cordon that village and find every knife every hammer or jemmy or engineering spanner every makharov pm mmcalibre pistol the knife would probably still carry blood traces the hammer or jemmy or spanner would still hold tissue that could be matched the pistol thats straight penn looked up the american had heaved himself up from the table and gone heavily to a filing cabinet he was ripping the drawers back on their runners jerking up files discarding them searching beside the filing cabinet was an open doorway in the next area was a mortuary slab and there was a skeleton body on the slab the bone sections were marked with tieon labels and at the far end of the body was the skull and there was an adhesive red arrow on it and the arrow pointed to the dark pencil diameter hole on the floor beside the mortuary table were three bags that penn could see unzipped holding a mess of bones the filing cabinet was slammed shut the professor laid in front of penn a seethrough plastic file cover which contained a crudely drawn sketch map and another file which held black and white photographs the photographs were tipped out where he could see them and the professors fingers shuffled them he saw her face not the face of the photograph with her mother and stepfather not the face posed with the village boys he forced himself to look at the face of death swollen wounded he closed his eyes momentarily there was a rattle on the table the bullet misshapen in a tiny plastic sack bounced in front of him rolled was steady the bullet was dull grey find the makharov pm mm pistol match the rifling and you have a case find the pistol and you have evidence you with me mr penn with you maybe not in my lifetime but some time in the hague in geneva here maybe in london i am an old man mr penn maybe not in my lifetime but i believe in the long arm of law i believe in cold and unemotional justice i believe in the humbling of the guilty by due process i want to believe it will be in my lifetime i have only scraps to work from but i see a picture she was a fine young woman penns voice was small in his throat tell me he was looking down at his watch the woman who had brought his coffee was grimacing at him and pointing to the clock on the wall his bags were beside his chair he slapped his finger on a photograph two shapes that were just recognizable as corpses locked legs and arms together torsos together skulls together penn stared back into the opaque watering eyes i have only scraps she was a fine young woman because she did not have to be there the scraps give you a jumble of a mosaic and you have to put the mosaic back together she didnt have to be there they were all wounded all the men they all had old wounds mostly artillery or mortar shrapnel they were the guys who had fought for the village and they had been hurt bad and everyone who was fit enough to quit had run out on them before the village fell they were left behind to the mercy of the attack force she was a fine young woman because she stayed with the wounded he thought that he could hear marys voice the stealing of a visa card taken from her mothers handbag and the forging of her mothers signature she didnt have an old wound she could have gotten out but none of the men could they would have been each last one of them stretcher cases she stayed with them it would have been her decision to stay with them that makes for me a fine young woman he thought he could see mary moving easily in her kitchen and pouring his coffee and bringing it to him there must have been one boy that she loved it has to be love mr penn to stay with those who are doomed when yourself you can be saved think on it mr penn think on it like ive told it its my best shot at the truth im an old man ive seen about everything in this life that you wouldnt want to see she makes my eyes mr penn go wet at the end she was trying dorothy was trying to shield her young man from the knives and the blows and from the gunshot the scraps tell me that from the way they lay he heard mary and he saw her a fine young woman a young woman to be proud of the room had filled there was a director and there were managers and there were staff from the mortuary no more time for dorrie mowat the professor smiled at penn as if it wasnt his fault aircraft didnt wait the director and the managers were pumping the professors hand and embracing him and the women on the staff were kissing him and one had brought flowers for him penn had screwed up the farewells to two months of unpaid work he heard it said that the car was waiting and they were running late for the flight the crocodile swept up the stairs from the basement mortuary and along the corridors and through the swing doors and cut a swathe across the lobby penn followed and jovic was silent behind him from the open door of the car the professor caught his eye called through the crowd and held the flowers against his chest awkwardly good luck mr penn build a case stack the evidence id like to think well meet again in court good luck he didnt say it that he was just there to write a report he waved as the car pulled away the botanical gardens were always his choice for a rendezvous it was where the first secretary chose to take his informants the botanical gardens on mihanoviceva a little tatty now compared with the time before independence still gave good cover there were sufficient evergreen shrubs and conifer trees to offer discreet privacy before the main summer blooms it was his second posting and it was the fourth month of his final year as field officer in the croatian capital and he had known hamilton sidney ernest for most of that time the file on hamilton sidney ernest designated freefall was fat which meant that the first secretary as he had told his desk chief on the last london visit knew about as much of the repellent little man as it was possible to know so the business was done behind trees and shrubs presented to the city of zagreb in the cheerful days of nonalignment the map of a route taken across the kupa river across the territory of sector north was paid for with american dollars the first secretary checked that the map was of some small value with minefields marked and strong points identified he was brusque to the point of rudeness as he discussed the map and the action behind the lines of all his informants in zagreb he believed that he disliked the man freefall more than any other he strode away the map would lie in the fat file the mortuary office was a colder place with the professor gone without his presence without his passion and his caring it was a colder and a darker place penn thought the work would slip more slowly he was an interloper and he was not offered coffee but they gave him what he wanted he left with photocopies of the sketch map of the grave site at rosenovici and of the professors notes on the exhumed bodies and of the photographs of the dead and of the writtenout detail of the killing bullet that had finished the life of dorrie mowat penn followed jovic out of the hospital lobby he felt a sense of bewilderment he reckoned that he knew right from wrong that his mother and his father had taught from the time he could remember that there was good and there was bad too damned simple wasnt he too damned simple to understand how the wounded could have been bludgeoned and knifed and shot it was beyond his comprehension how a man could have looked into dorrie alowats face and killed her the photocopies were in his briefcase the spring sunshine caught at his eyes the freshness of the air surged to his lungs it was good to be gone from that place of cold and darkness she found him in a corridor leading off the main walkway that skirted the second floor of the transit centre the walkway looked down onto the inner square but he had made his hiding place in a shadowed corner of the corridor where the daylight could not reach him ulrike dropped down squatted beside the old refugee he stank she put her arms around his shoulder he shook with his tears it was a worn timeabused face and the suffering lines ploughed through the white stubble of his cheeks and the tears ran across the lines and dribbled in the stubble she did not know him assumed he would have come the day before on the bus she did not know him and so she did not know his story but she could anticipate it because she had heard the story too often when she sat in her office with a delegation from the swedish red cross or the austrian red cross or the german red cross when she blinked into the lights behind the television cameras of rai or zdf or the bbc when she wrote her letters home she always said it was worst for the old men who were brought out from behind the lines he cried she took his hands frail and thin and gnarled from work in the fields and she felt the bones hard in her fingers she thought from his hands that he had worked all of his life in fields that he would have gone into the woods with a bow saw in the autumn for the winters fuel that he would have struggled down a ladder each morning of each winter with the fodder for his few cattle that he would have been a man of pride she held tight to his hands tried to no give the old man strength his home his fathers home would have been flattened by an explosive charge his barn would have been burned his cattle would have been stolen and his pigs he might know that his son the favourite had been killed it was worst for the old men who had lost everything and hope the children always searched for ulrike in the transit centre and they had discovered her now the children stood in the corridor and they watched her as she squatted beside the old man who cried she could not begin to say how the children would be affected by the sight of their flattened homes and their burning barns and their familys livestock being driven away and by the fighting she could see it in the old man feel the wet of his tears on her face she understood the dialect of the village in prijedor municipality his voice was a croak of anguish it hurt her that the children watched the children should not have seen an old man who had lost hope forsaken pride our neighbours our friends who we worked with how could they do it to us our neighbours our friends all of our lives their lives how could they destroy us is there no punishment for what they have done when she had found him she had been going from a topfloor sleeping room where she believed maybe that marijuana was smoked down to the kitchens she was behind her schedule she could not sit any longer with the old man and hold his hand while he cried she could offer him sedation tablets very good magnificent brilliant a bottle of sedation tablets pride no respect no sedation tablets of course is there no one who will punish them she could not answer she took his name the chief guards of the camps of the neuengamme ring had been punished with the noose for what they had done the chief guards had been the defeated the victors were never punished she took his name so that she could leave a message at the dispensary on her way down to the kitchens for sedation tablets for the old man later the young american would be at the transit centre perhaps the quiet and earnest young man from alaska would find time to talk to the old man of punishment she would push him towards in the american therapy to go with sedation she kissed his forehead she patted the arm of his overcoat that smelled of his body and his animals bodies he walked with jovic following jane would have liked the city he tried to turn again in his mind each word that the professor had told him but jane usurped as if she were with him as if she tugged him back to look into the bright shop fronts as if she pulled him towards the cafes in the sunshine as if she demanded of him that he should buy her flowers to hold as they meandered in the squares and along the ochrewalled streets jane would not have listened to the words the evidence of the professor but she would have danced to the band with jovic and jovics friends loving jane for her prettiness loathing her because now she found him boring slow played out jane coming down to the tied cottage to meet his parents jane wearing a brief skirt and a gossamer blouse jane not helping his mother with the dishes in the sink after the tense lunch because she had spent an hour on her nails jane not walking with her father in the fields after lunch because it was raining he hadnt warned her hadnt told her it wasnt her fault jane had reckoned them dirty they had reckoned her tacky two camps at the wedding all his own bloody fault where are we going you wanted to see people who were in rosenovici did you not the cable fault between sound and camera delayed marty he worked methodically in the freight container to locate the fault step by step then repair it he could not do the work outside he needed the desk surface and the sweat ran on his body and across his fingers the freight container he reckoned had been parked as far across the parade square of the ilica barracks from the administration block as was possible from the open door of his freight container he could see across the parade square past the drilling swedish troops past the bank of big satellite dishes to the administration block he was treated as if he had the plague as if those in contact with him up alongside him risked contamination he had been told to his face on his first day that the preparation of prosecutions was an irrelevance it had been given him straight in the first week all you achieve winding people up in your naivete is to further reduce unprofors credibility what they said those who thought he had the plague was of course there can never be trials because the biggest criminals are those we need to sort out the mess and they said it often those who thought he had contamination spat it at him what youre doing jones its just a cosmetic gesture to massage a few bruised consciences away across the borders alone in his converted freight container hot as a cook in a kitchen he ignored what they said in the big offices of the administration block he could cope he was reared in anchorage he knew what it was to be thrown down have the optimism belted out of him anchorage was false springs when the depression of the snow hanging on until late april had to be hacked anchorage was the collapse of oil prices and the good men his fathers friends heaved out of work anchorage was where they bred the philosophy of goddamnminded obstinacy pig stubbornness and to back his obstinacy he had a degree in international law from the university of alaska and a phd from the university of california santa barbara his mind methodical when repairing the sound cable from the camera was well suited to the work of gathering evidence what they thought of him in the administration block caused no loss of sleep it never had mattered to him an anchorage boy what the men in suits thought they were from his past the men who came in by helicopter the men who rode in the limousines to their oil company offices the men who went out in the private jets when they had sorted the balance sheets and screwed up a few lives like theyd screwed up his fathers life marty jones hated money and privilege and arrogance and the hate was deep from his childhood he reckoned had reckoned from the first day he showed up on campus that the due process of law was the one the only weapon that could cut down the money privilege arrogance of men in suits the hate had translated to the power and the cruelty of the butchers the hate made him a good investigator he would not take her anything too demonstrative not his way but he looked forward to driving down the highway to karlovac and meeting the woman who administered the transit centre he thought the german woman in the transit centre to be the finest human being he knew but he would not tell her did not know how to express that feeling marty wiped the sweat again from his forehead and there was mist on the heavy lenses of his spectacles the camera worked the audio level light fluttered but there was no smile of achievement marty seldom risked a smile she called herself dorrie i would not forget her jovic said that it had been the camp for officer cadets still taciturn the artist had explained nothing penn did not ask he assumed that jovic had gone back to the ministry office and perhaps he had apologized for penns rudeness and maybe he had made a joke about penns ignorance and it could have been that he had just said that the englishman was a crap fool jovic translated flat no emotion nor expression yes i remember her she had come to rosenovici about one month before the attack from the partizans i remember her they had taken the tram to the camp for officer cadets out to the west of the city in what would have been the quarter for skilled industry but drab and smokegrimed the officer cadets had been well provided for jovic went forward and talked quickly to the guards there was an unmarked van parked up beside the small guardhouse and the guards had come from the van where they had been talking to the driver looking over the barrier blocking the entrance into the camp penn had seen the driver of the van the face of the van driver was rounder fuller than what penn had learned to see around him and there was a tattoo at the neck of the van driver couldnt place the tattoo and the table in the guardhouse was stacked with cartons of marlboro cigarettes the guards at the barrier had wanted jovic gone fast instructions penn guessed the cigarettes were black market and knew it was not his business the front line was already north of our village it was not possible to go by road we were isolated in rosenovici the fighting was all around our village and at night we could hear the guns and in the days we could see the tanks of the partizans moving forward on the main road but the war had not yet come to rosenovici we felt some safety because we had always had good relations with the serb people in salika we put our trust in those good relations they were our friends they were our neighbours they were our work colleagues we felt that they would speak up for us we were no military threat to the serb people in salika there were very few guns in our village we could have done nothing to intervene in the war her name was maria she shared a room with her sister that would have been small for the occupancy of an officer cadet she said her sister was in the city that day searching for work she said that she had been secretary to the export manager of a furniture factory in glina she said that she was divorced the room was spotlessly clean penn thought she had little to do a refugee but clean the room as he listened his eyes roved over the room and he saw there were no ornaments nothing of the past of a woman he estimated to be in her midforties no bricabrac nothing to sustain memories she came with a boy from australia she came because he returned to his home when the war started there were many boys who came back to their country i suppose they wanted to help wanted to fight they were not soldiers this boy was not a fighter we believed we would be safe and when we found that we were not safe then all the roads to the north were blocked it was a tuesday night when the artillery guns and the tank guns were turned on rosenovici some people tried to flee that night they went into the woods and they said they would try to walk in the woods and the hills until they reached the lines of the croatian army i dont know what happened to them the rest of us we thought that it was a mistake by the regular army to fire on our village we thought that there would be liaison with salika with our friends and neighbours and work colleagues we thought they would tell the partizan officers that they should not fire on us they fired on our village all through the wednesday there were only rifles in the village to shoot back at them it was on the afternoon of the wednesday that her boy was wounded seeing mary braddock in the kitchen drinking the coffee feeling the warmth of the aga listening to the calm telling the sixteenth birthday party and charles away on business and mary trying to do the right thing and inviting in the teenagers of her friends in the village on the surrey sussex border and buying a new dress for dorrie and dorrie not wearing it and the village boys from the council houses crashing the evening and dorrie dancing across the lane from the church was a big farmhouse franjos and ivanas farmhouse it was the oldest building in the village it had the best and the biggest cellar it was where the wounded fighters were taken it was the fighters who were hurt because they tried to hold a defence line they could not hide in buildings some were hurt dead some were hurt wounded she brought him back from the defence line to the cellar in the farmhouse of franjo and ivana she was so small and he was a heavy boy and he could not help himself she carried him back across the fields from the defence line and the snipers were shooting at her and we could hear their voices the snipers and they were shouting to each other and making bets as to which would hit her she brought him to the cellar and she went again across the fields to the defence line to bring another back dorrie dancing dorrie in her jeans and black tshirt the boys her friends smoking their marijuana and passing the pills and the teenage kids of marys friends drifting away and frightened mary coming from the kitchen helpless and control lost and dorrie on the oval walnutveneer table that had cost charles at auction and stripping out of her jeans and the tshirt and her pants as she danced mary standing in the doorway stunned silent seeing dorries shallow breasts and seeing the straggle of the coming hair hearing the splintering of the antique table she was alone with the wounded fighters all through the wednesday night by the time the darkness came on the wednesday night the partizan snipers had come so close that the farmhouse of franjo and ivana was cut off from the rest of the village we could not reach the cellar and the boys there were too hurt to make their own way out she could have come in the darkness she alone might have managed to come i think she chose to stay the council house boys clapping their hands speeding the dance the white flashes of dorries body the dance finished when the table had collapsed and splintered dorrie drunk dorrie smoking dorrie popping the pills dorrie swearing abuse at her as she stood stunned silent in the doorway mary had told it calmly mary had said that it was done to hurt her it was on the thursday afternoon that the village fell on the morning of the thursday before it was light many people had left the village gone with what they could carry into the woods i and my sister we could not go our home where we had sheltered was close to the store in rosenovici and that is on the east of the village and it was open to the shooting from salika there were very few of us left in the village when it fell i had thought that it would be the regular troops who would come into the village when the flag was raised there was a sheet tied to a stick and it was held out from a window of the store it was people from salika who came into the village it was our friends and neighbours and work colleagues they came across the bridge from salika they all wore uniforms but i knew them as the carpenter who had made the table for my kitchen and the gravedigger who had made the grave for my father when our own gravedigger was ill and the postman who brought the letters to our village and others that i knew and commanding them was the man who was a junior clerk in the cooperative at turanj they took everything that we had our wristwatches and our earrings and our necklaces and our money they put us onto a lorry and they took us to a camp at glina what had been the prison there i urinate blood because of what was done at glina and dorrie what happened to dorrie she was with the wounded in the cellar of franjos and ivanas farmhouse when the village was taken what happened to her the tears streamed on the woman marias face jovic said she doesnt know she has told you everything that she could know penn had been hunched forward on a small hard chair and he had been writing hard he sat back he saw the face in the doorway and the shabby washedthrough uniform he did not know how long the van driver had been listening the man with the full and round face and the cropped skull and the tattoo on his neck the woman maria was speaking and she had taken penns hand with urgency she was choking the words when he looked back to the door the face of the van driver was gone he realized what the tattoo was the wings and the parachute gone jovic translated without emotion without expression she was an angel she stayed with them when no one else stayed with them she was an angel in her prettiness and an angel in her courage penn squeezed the womans hand he followed jovic out into the sunlight there were children playing kicking a ball there were women hanging out washing on lines slung from the trees that were in first blossom jovic asked cool it will be good for your report yes the potential

restbreak and canteen tea he had a great bank of experience seldom mined and seldom tapped and it was a lesson he had learned the dull men who were without hobbies the ordinary men who were without recreations without interests usually managed to confound with surprise god save the dull and the ordinary and the boring god protect the human species from exciting and unique and fascinating men that was a lesson henry carter had learned if it had not been for the war he would have been the mayor the headmaster stood at the back of the hall of his school there was an order in these things and the appointment to office of mayor would have come that year to the headmaster if it had not been for the war all of the village had gathered in the hall a meeting was held in the school every month he had never spoken out before he had never stood up before to be counted but he thought that as headmaster he would be listened to his was a position of importance in the village community of salika he believed it his responsibility to speak because of the war milan stankovic nothing more than a clerk was mayor and not mayor for a year but now in his second term and there would be a third milan stankovic nothing more than a clerk was mayor because he commanded the territorial defence force because he controlled the black market because he could provide gasoline or diesel or spare parts or crop seed because he killed and the bodies had been dug up and taken away and the headmaster felt the confidence to speak he was at the back of the hall and standing alone he would have to crane on tiptoe when he spoke if milan stankovic were to see him nothing more than a clerk and sitting in a frauds uniform at the table facing the audience of villagers and beside him were the carpenter and the gravedigger and the one who had delivered post when there were letters to be delivered before the war had come the carpenter and the gravedigger and the postman also wore the uniform of soldiers they were the new elite of the village he had not talked to the priest had not confided that he would speak at the meeting he had no trust in the priest the headmaster believed a new age of darkness had come to the village it was his duty to speak he was a small man with sparse greying hair above a short beak nose that held his ironrimmed glasses when he stood on his toes when he could see milan stankovic the image was blurred his glasses should have been changed but it was not possible now to get the replacement because of the war he had taught many of those who sat between where he stood and the table and they followed like sheep a false deity he thought it his duty to denounce milan stankovic he felt no fear the priest should have been beside him of the men in the village only he and the priest had known higher education he felt the priest slipped from the responsibility of duty he had a text as the priest had a text each sunday the text had been taken from an anthology of quotations in the english language that had been a treasured companion since his graduation from the university mr edmund burke political theorist it is necessary only for the good man to do nothing for evil to triumph he had been across the bridge two weeks before when milan stankovic who was a clerk had been to the junket in belgrade he had seen the digging and seen the bodies lifted from the greyblack earth and seen them bagged he had felt the disgrace of his village that sense of disgrace was the keener because he had looked into the face of the elderly american who had supervised the exhumation and seen contempt he was sixtytwo years old he was respected throughout the village he was not afraid they sat in front of him they stood in front of him the sheep they agreed to everything proposed by milan stankovic hands rose in acceptance of what was proposed they needed leadership the sheep the man who had been a clerk was beaming a smile and gathering together his papers and there was a pistol at his belt and his uniform was washed clean the chairs were scraping little knots of villagers were sliding forward to beg favours he did not understand how a good woman evica stankovic could share a life and a bed with such a man he loathed the man he loathed the power of the pistol at the mans belt it was the moment the headmaster chose before we go before we leave there are matters that should be discussed shoulders swivelled heads turned towards him and behind the table the smile faded he spoke out loud and he stood on his toes that he might be seen by all not one matter several matters your children go to the school my school at the school we have insufficient books for children to learn it is necessary they have books i had discussed the shortage of books with the uncivpol officers from petrinja and the uncivpol officers had promised me they would raise the matter with unhcr attempt to get more books but those uncivpol officers were harassed sworn at blocked threatened by the militia of this village it was the grossest stupidity to block the uncivpol officers and i will get no books for our children to learn from the silence was around him when he ranged his eyes across the sheep when he caught their eyes they looked away evica stankovic she had looked away we should not be led my friends by men of the grossest stupidity nor should we be led by men who stain the name of our village we should elect our leader to speak for all of us by a vote that is private and not by the vote of the bullet he looked far ahead milan stankovic stared back at him he could not see the detail of milan stankovics face but he believed he saw surprise we are a people who know suffering close to here is the great forest of petrova gora where our glorious partizans fought with such courage against the fascist ustase of the great patriotic war close to here in glina town is the church where our grandparents were burned alive by the ustase close to here near to petrinja is the site of the concentration camp where the ustase slaughtered the children of our grandparents and we have here amongst us a new group of ustase who stain the name of the serb people the headmaster saw the movement at the table the table was pushed back milan stankovic advanced on him the sheep scattered their chairs and moved aside to make a space for milan stankovic to reach him evica stankovic was among those who moved their chairs aside he had come to make a denunciation and now his voice rose i saw you saw the old american who came to rosenovici there was a report about him on the foreign radio he is a professor of pathology he is an investigator of the dead because of what he searched for what he found and took away the name of our village is shamed the fist of milan stankovic standing in front of him blocking his view of the sheep was clenched on the handle of the pistol worn in the opened holster we are disgraced all of us because of the wounded at rosenovici the pistol whipped into the face of the headmaster he felt the stinging pain and the blackness blurred in front of his eyes he fell there was no hand among the sheep to halt his fall he was on his knees there was wetness in his eyes he saw the blood splatter below him he groped his hand for his spectacles that lay close to the shined boots we are all criminals because of the wounded at rosenovici he saw the sole of the shined boots cover the lenses of his spectacles he heard the crunching of the broken glass what they promise on the foreign radio is that acts of criminality will never be forgotten the shined boot hacking into his ribs the headmaster gasped wherever we run the shined boot belting into his chin a whispered voice wherever we hide a fist in the collar of his jacket lifting him and the tightness of his tie around his throat and the punching starting and the kicking never forgotten our shame the death of the headmasters voice they let him drop and when he had fallen they kicked him some more he saw above him the gravedigger the carpenter and the postman and he saw milan stankovic bend and wipe blood from the toes of his boots and behind them the hall of the headmasters school was emptied the chairs were scattered without formation abandoned none had spoken for him the sheep he lay a long time on the floor after they had gone and he did not know for how long because the watch on his wrist was broken he held clutched his secret the secret was the location where a survivor of the destruction of rosenovici still lived the telling of the secret to the canadian of uncivpol had been the payment for the promise of school books he lay a long time on the floor until he had the strength to push himself up to his knees and his elbows and he gathered together the cracked shards of the lenses for his spectacles the headmaster crawled to the doorway of the school hall he saw no movement in the road the lamplight from the houses came indistinctly to his eyes all gone the sheep all barricaded in their homes afraid it was difficult for him to lock the door of the hall he felt no fear he felt only a loathing of the man who had been a clerk he alone in the village held the secret he could not be certain but it was his training to know when a tail was on him the late afternoon and the early evening were spent in his hotel room making sense of the note form of the interviews and then supper and a beer in the old town it was when he had stepped off the pavement to give room to a whore negotiating her rate with a client that he had thought he was followed he had swung amused to see better the face of the whore and her dressed like a housewife a cardigan and a floral skirt and there was a shadow moving behind the whore and the shadow froze when penn turned full face seven i saw her when the partizans came into the village the smells were close to perms childhood eight years old twelve years old at harvest time when the men were in the fields taking in the barley wheat maize and going to the hedgerow and squatting down and wiping between their cheeks with yesterdays newspaper and the sun settling with the flies on their mess and the smell six years old ten years old and the milking cattle in the parlour and the shit running out below their lifted tails and splattering and the shutin heat trapped inside the walls and the low asbestossheeted roof penn the boy brought up on the farm was close to the smells of the transit centre it was only chance that i was in the village you see i am bosnian i am a muslim of bosnia i was trying to take the bus from banja luka to zagreb i have the cataracts in my eyes the doctor in banja luka said i should go to the hospital in zagreb i thought it was possible for a muslim to travel through the lines of the serbs and the croats stupid of me the bus was stopped on the glina to vrginmost road the serbs were very hard on me i went where i thought i was safe to the village of rosenovici there was a madness around there but i did not think the madness could last i thought i would stay in safety in rosenovici until the madness passed when it became too dangerous to stay many of the village left at night to go through the woods and the hills because of my sight i could not go no one was prepared to delay their flight to help a woman who could not see it was necessary for me to stay men women lose charity when they are in flight for their lives i was there through the fighting for the village and i was there when it fell penn thought he had started to understand the village where dorrie mowat had died the village life and the farm life had gone away from him and he had taken the exams at the comprehensive school in cirencester and the exams had turned his back on his parents and on the farm and on the fields and hedgerows and woods and on the smells but he was learning and the farm life and the village life seeped back to him it was on the third day after the attack had started that the village fell i think it was the thursday it was the second week in december the village had been preparing for christmas their festival the people had no presents for their children but they had cut branches of green leaves from the holly trees they had tried to make a joy of their festival penn prompted gently what had she seen of dorrie when the village fell jovic translated i had been in the church it was the first time i had been in the church of catholics they called the place the crypt and the walls there were thick of heavycut stone the girl came on the night before the village fell she came to ask the women who were in the church if they could tear up some of their clothes their clothes that were most clean for bandages i could not see her well because of the cataracts in my eyes but there were other women afterwards who said that she was beautiful she took the clothes that had been torn and cut into strips and she went back to where the wounded men were hidden she had to cross the front of the church and then go across the lane and then she had to go through the garden of a farmhouse it was all open and when she went back there was much shooting as if they had seen her the partizans and tried to kill her i know she had a great courage and she was not afraid when she had the bandages and was about to go back into the open i could not see her but i heard her laugh it was a sweet and happy laugh you know why she laughed some of the women in the church they had put on all the underpants they possessed and the cleanest were the third or fourth pair from their skin and she was going to make dressings for the wounded from the third pairs or fourth pairs of the underpants and some of the women were shy to take off their underpants she laughed i did not see her again until it was over remembering marys story the story told in the comfort of the kitchen with warm coffee mary speaking without hatred but from the depths of pain the dinner party in the manor house black tie the celebration of the elevation of a neighbour to the lofty eminence of master of foxhounds north sussex hunt banter silly but cheerful spilling round the room that was panelled with old oak dorrie coming into the dining room bitter face and holed jeans and a tshirt too dirty to have been used as a rag for cleaning a floor it was the irregulars their militia that came into the church we knew that a white flag had been raised at the store and we knew that most of the fighters those who were not hurt had already gone we were taken out into the afternoon light i remember that it was afternoon because the sun was low above the hills and it was into my eyes we were made to form a line we were standing in front of the church and they took anything that was of value from the women and from me we had nothing that was special only sentimental but they took it i heard her voice she is only a small girl but she had so big a voice and she was shouting from inside the farmhouse that was across the lane from the church they had their guns and she was shouting as if she had no fear of them hearing the story marys pain dorrie coming into the dining room and holding the jar of tomato puree the quiet falling on the dining room and the cheerful joking killed dorrie marching to the master of foxhounds and shaking the jar and unfastening the lid dorrie pouring the rich red of the jar onto the head of the master of foxhounds the tomato puree dripping from the bald scarred scalp and down to the white of his tuxedo jacket she was brought out of the farmhouse all the time she was shouting at the partizans and she had her arm around the waist of one of the wounded fighters and she had the arm of another of the fighters around her shoulder to give him support it was near enough for me to see not easily but i saw i saw her hit he was a big man and he had a beard long dark i saw that man hit her and she could not protect herself because she had the wounded fighters to help there was the noise of the transit centre around penn crying voices and the clattering of metal pots the beating of hammers and the wail of radios the name of the woman was alija her eyes watered but he had the feeling it was from medical drops and not tears he thought she was a flotsam of war that she would be far down any list of patients requiring a cataract operation she held a ragged handkerchief in her hands and pulled and tugged at the edges he heard the hoarseness of his voice as if his throat was blocked what happened to her what happened to dorrie mowat she shrugged she looked away she murmured she shrugged again jovic said she has told you all she knows the women who had been in the church they were taken away she does not know anything more penn stood it was a reflex done without thinking he bent forward and he took the head of the woman in his hands and he kissed her forehead the hands that had held the handkerchief were dug now into the material of his blazer she was gabbling at him there was the foulness of her breath close to his nose and the smell of her clothes he thought he might vomit and he dragged her fingers clear the women who were with me they said she was so brave the women said she was an angel it was what they said he was away from his chair he reeled as if drunk from the room with the damp peeled plaster he was out in the corridor he leaned against the wall of the corridor there was the grin sardonic cold from jovic it had been jovics style to hire a car and have him drive without explanation down the wide road from zagreb to karlovac and to direct him to the transit centre where the muslim refugees waited for onward passage to the safe havens and the new lives in civilized europe jovic he thought played him like a marionette jovic said good stuff yes good stuff for your report yes penn snarled just shut your bloody mouth doubt crawled in penn he thought himself so insignificant once two and a half years back maybe three he had been shuffled for a morning to a ministry to do a positive vetting on an architect who would be working on ra f station bunkers and the architect had been in a wheelchair and so damned cheerful the architect had said that the best thing about spending time in stoke mandeville spinal unit was getting to know that however bad his situation was there was always someone in the next bed who had it worse penn was the little bureaucrat the little man whining about a job and a mortgage and a marriage he thought of the scale where his problems stacked against those of the woman alija penn thought of what dorrie had done and how she had achieved love the feeling of insignificance it hurt the german woman was in the doorway of the room she smiled friendly at him she was slightly built and her face was washed clean and there were sharp lines of tiredness at her eyes the german woman had led him and jovic to the room where they had found alija right mr penn now i will show you around the transit centre he was like all the others who came from abroad he was like the men from the national delegations of the red cross and like the television crews she was sure the place frightened him the place that was her kingdom they were all the same the ignorant they wanted to be gone before it was decent to leave there was a wedding ring on his finger he would have a wife at home probably a child he would live in a home that was small safe protected just as were the homes in munich she did not think it right to make it easy for them show you round the transit centre so that you can see our work here so sorry but i dont think ive the time always best to find time mr penn too easy to ignore if we dont find the time i should be away she thought that he looked a decent man she said briskly wont take all day mr penn there are people here mr penn and they have nothing not even hope it is important that i take visitors around the transit centre so that they are seen every visitor who is seen tells the people here that someone from outside has bothered to make the journey to visit them it is a very little thing for you mr penn an hour of your time but it shows these people that you have an interest in them if you lived here mr penn you would be pleased to know that people from abroad showed an interest thank you yes id like to she thought he was a decent man because she thought he was ashamed that he had tried to run away it was her regular tour the same as for the delegations and the television crews she showed him what she was proud of the kindergarten for the small children the little hairdressers room the scrubbed clean kitchens she told him what it had been when she had started up the transit centre she could not be sure what his level of interest was she told him that in the last winter when they had no fuel no glass in the windows it had been body heat that had sustained them she told him of the drinking and the smoking and the drug abuse and of the women whose menstrual cycle was blocked by stress and of the children who ran wild and of the men who had lost the reason to live she thought she held his interest when he asked her how it was possible for her to cope and she answered as she always answered that she could cope with the aloneness but that the loneliness still hurt her it was at the end of the hour she opened the door the american was playing back a tape on the video not finished mr jones he flushed never could help himself when she spoke to him it was the warmth and the boldness in her voice that brought the blood flush to his face just another two or three someones gone to find them marty said there was a man behind ulrike he saw the man in the blazer and the white shirt and the tie and he saw the creases in the mans slacks never could know whether she laughed at him and there was always the tinkling brightness in her voice he was told the name and the business of the man and he grimaced as if he was indifferent what im dealing with here is mass crime im not talking about little incidents anywhere you hit a golf ball round here itll get to land on a clandestine grave im talking about major league if i got sidetracked into graves where there were a dozen people id just be wasting everyones time no offence mr penn it was instinctive his dislike of the englishman with ulrike he stood too close to her and it was like he had her confidence he had put down the englishman and marty thought he saw just for the moment impatience flash in her eyes at her mouth just for the moment and ulrike was telling him that the englishman had been interviewing a muslim woman and named her he knew of the woman hadnt bothered to get round to interviewing her finding whether she had a snapshot of an atrocity was she raped the englishman penn seemed to frown i didnt ask her you always ask a woman here if she was raped a statement on rape sexual violation a statement with audio or video and the perpetrators name that can be evidence i didnt ask her the frown deepened wouldnt have thought so seemed old common mistake mistake people make when theyre not familiar with the ground here they dont rape for sexual gratification they rape to demean their enemy stick around and youll get to know the englishman said its not relevant for me to know he could have told him to go jerk himself if ulrike had not been there he would have his father back in anchorage and writing most months and working in the brother francis shelter for destitutes didnt think martys work far from home relevant and the grizzled old prospector his friend rudi gold hunting seven hours drive down the pacific coast from anchorage who wrote some months he didnt understand what was relevant and his tutor from the law faculty university of california at santa barbara in his last letter hadnt connected as to how a favourite former student found it relevant to ferret for mass crime marty had told them all in his return letters that in a new world order it was critical for the international rule of law to be established had written them all in his return letters that ends didnt matter catching and trying and hanging didnt matter but means mattered the process of law mattered dont let me keep you marty said if you can turn your back and you can feel good then youre a lucky guy he thought the englishman soft shit and if ulrike had not been there in the doorway he would have told him ive just a report to write then im gone nice to have met you mr jones he was late coming to his school because of the difficulty in shaving his bruised face it was a slow walk to the school because the road from his house to the school was rutted and the young men of salika were too busy in their uniforms and with their guns to use their muscles to repair the road a slow walk because he had no spectacles his body hurt each place that he had been kicked and punched meant pain when he walked to the school his wife had told him that he should not go his wife had said their life in the village was finished the village was his home he had refused her he had taken a new text that morning when he had started the walk from his home to his school a croat text but that was not important to the headmaster the text mouthed as he walked was the command given years earlier to nikolica bunic by the rulers of dubrovnik when the man the martyr was sent to treat with the pasha of bosnia he knew by heart the text to violence you will reply by renunciation and sacrifice promise nothing offer nothing suffer everything there you will meet a glorious death here the land will be free in case of difficulty delay be united reply that we are free men that this tyranny and god will judge them just to whisper the text to himself was hardship the carpenter milo watched him walk from the door of his home the postman branko watched him past the militia camp the gravedigger stevo leaned on his spade at the back of the church and could see him as he passed milan stankovic went by him in his car forced him to stumble to the side of the road where the weeds grew the headmaster went to his school he was late for the start of the day at his school the children were gathered in the hall he heard the singing he knew the song the children sang of the decision of prince lazar to commit the serb army against the turk and fight at kosovo there flew a falcon a grey bird from the holy city from jerusalem and carried in its beak a swallow june and the lie of serbian nobility the anthem would not have been sung at school assembly if he had been present the day june was captured by the extremists the barbarians of the new order by the killers and the murderers the day the nobility of defeat was taken by the new order in belgrade as an excuse for cruelty for violence there was glass in the upper part of the swing doors into the hall of his school he could see her she stood where he should have stood he felt the betrayal but that was not a grey falcon that was the holy man elijah and he does not carry a swallow he saw that evica stankovic stood in his place her arms were raised swung to lead the heaven of his childrens voices but a letter from the mother of god stop the headmaster stood in the open doorway sticking plaster across his face stop the children turned to him he saw her defiance she dared him to step forward he saw his children despised him he saw the children of the carpenter and the gravedigger and the postman he saw the grandchildren of the priest he saw the child of milan stankovic he saw the freshness of the faces and their contempt he turned in the doorway he heard the shout behind him forty childrens voices unbroken in unison it is better to die honest than to live in disgrace the headmaster began the slow walk home he had only his secret to sustain him the knowledge of katica dubelj existing as an animal in the ruins of rosenovici he knew no longer how to use it it had been done easily and smoothly and penn had recognized it so what are your future plans mr penn jovic had introduced the officer as liaison jovic had said that he was a captain and liaised between the croatian army nd bn karlovac brigade and the unprofor troops across in sector north jovic claimed him as a friend just to pick up what help i can captain and to write a report penn said jovic had said that the captain was his friend and had been with him at sisak when he had lost his arm only a report into the death of miss dorothy mowat only her death yes not the specific situation in that part of sector north where she died how it happened when it happened pretty bland why was the death of miss dorothy mowat when so many had died so important rich mother reckons she can buy anything a sensitive area a sensitive situation did he not know that just a report just to let her mother sleep the better at night and who else would read his report shouldnt think anyone will just her mother it was the gentle probing of an intelligence officer penn recognized it he hoped his answers were ignorant facile he reckoned the intelligence officer was poorly trained he would have done it differently himself bored harder he knew about digging into the recesses of a mans life because he had worked in the positive vetting team that cleared personnel for work at the atomic weapons establishment aldermaston trust no one believe in no one that was any intelligence officers maxim and he guessed that jovic would have telephoned ahead and engineered the meeting so that penn enigma would be checked over and his report would not be used as a start point for a war crime investigation good god no the gentle probing of the intelligence officer liaison was done during the tour of the ceasefire line the village of turanj was across the korana river near to where it joined with the kupa river east of karlovac not a house undamaged every building hit by multiple machinegun bullets and by tank fire and artillery shells the officer said for the benefit of his visitor that it was where the serbs had been held where their advance had been stopped he was told of the battle closequarters fighting he listened and looked around him an old woman was picking at burned roof timbers in the yard behind what had been her home they were past the defensive machinegun nests they walked in the village of turanj as if it were a museum but the old woman searching in her yard told him of present reality the front wall was off the food shop the roof was off the scorched interior of the repair garage flowers grew in overgrown front gardens and the blossom was on the magnolia and the apple trees he was shown the cooperative building and he was told not to go past it because he would then be in the field of vision of the snipers and the ceasefire was variable a cold place and quiet the officer said in war itself there is an excitement in combat there is an elation most men you ask them and if they give their secret answer tell you that war combat should not be missed but the war goes by i know nothing more degrading than a former battlefield where there are no bodies where there is no noise the war passes by and the excitement is quickly forgotten only the vandalism of the war is left it is the worst place you can be mr penn an old fighting ground with just the ghosts a cat saw him was bent low and scurrying but took the time to turn and spit at him the poles that had carried the telephone wires were down would it be the same in rosenovici why do you ask just trying to get the picture it would not be the same the officer said here the buildings are destroyed by war in rosenovici a few buildings would have been destroyed by war the rest would have been destroyed by placed explosives here there is a chance to rebuild one day in rosenovici there would be no chance to rebuild because nothing is left in rosenovici villages like it they went as far as bulldozing the graveyard here there is still feeble life in rosenovici there is only the memory of death penn thought he was being tested he looked away he stared up and beyond the jagged and broken roofs of turanj and he could see the first line of trees the officer anticipated him it is where their guns are they will be following you through telescopic sights maybe if they are bored they will shoot at you i am just here to make a report he played ignorant penn walked back down the road like getting his head shot off was no part of making a report they drove away in the officers car they went back past the machinegun positions and the soldiers waved to them they went across the bridge over the korana river and penn saw moored at the bank two greycoloured inflatables he didnt like to look hard because frequently the officer slung a fast glance at him to see whether it was a trained eye or a rubber necker eye that examined the front line there were tank obstacle teeth beside the road into karlovac and more defence positions and there was the emptiness they drove on past the officers headquarters in a new building where all the windows were taped against artillery blast they climbed a winding road they were above the town on the summit of the hill was a fortress tower they left the car they walked along a path and in the grass beside the path were teenagers cuddling and messing about and smoking they looked out the town was in front of them beyond the town were the rivers winding to their meeting point beyond the meeting point of the korana and the kupa rivers was the green carpet of the forest beyond the forest was the blue haze line of the high ground the officer said the high ground is the petrova gora dense woodland rock cliffs sheer valleys it is special to the serb people because it was in the petrova gora that tito had a field hospital for his partizans in the war with the germans the german army made many incursions into the petrova gora but they were never able to find the hospital the failure was a source of frustration that is why the germans killed many of the people in the villages at the edge of the petrova gora if you were to be there mr penn which is impossible then they would lie and tell you that it was croatian people fascists fighting alongside the germans who were responsible for the killings through the lies they justify what they have done now to villages such as rosenovici penn had his hand across his forehead he shaded his eyes he thought he could see twenty miles maybe more such peace it was where dorrie had been domes place it was like the place of his childhood where he had been before the exams and the application forms and work in london peace and beauty he strained to see better the officer said i am correct you see nothing that threatens the front line between here and sisak is the kupa river it is seventy kilometres in length across there on their side where you see nothing are minefields and strong points and defended villages across there they have guns that can flatten karlovac and sisak in a day across there aimed at zagreb are mediumrange missile launchers one day i hope we can take our territory back but not today and not tomorrow you see mr penn it is important to us that today and tomorrow we do not anger them across there it is of strategic importance for the future of croatia military and economic that the bastards across there are not antagonized who did it did what who killed dorrie mowat it is important for my report yes the officer smiled jovic was behind them silent penn and the officer stood together and stared out across the kupa river and the forest and towards the high ground the sun beat at penn they do not scatter evidence they do not leave eyewitnesses i do not know who would have given the order probably the commander of the militia perhaps the commander of the militia in the village close to rosenovici what is his name i used to know him not as a friend but i knew him my wife is a teacher and knew his wife why do you need the name for my report you can make up a name take a telephone directory just for a report for a mother who lost a daughter you can invent a name why not he had been led subtly to the trap he had underestimated the quality of the intelligence officer perhaps a graduate would not have sprung the trap not one of the young bloody graduates of the general intelligence group he stumbled pick a name out of the air why not a light murmur of laughter from the officer he is milan stankovic i see him at my liaison meetings i used to play basketball against him the militia in the attack on rosenovici was commanded by milan stankovic what will happen to him i saw him last month at the liaison meeting we talked about the electricity supply they have our territory but they do not have power we have lost our territory but we have power last month he did not seem like a man afraid but then the liaison meeting is always behind their lines today tomorrow nothing will happen to milan stankovic penn said i will put that in my report on that night of the week it would have been usual for the priest to have gone to the headmasters house and by candlelight played chess he had not made apologies he had not given notice of his absence to the headmaster he had gone instead to the home of milan stankovic he was a quiet man and through the adult part of his seventyfour years he had seldom offered an opinion that he had not first known would fall on approving ears capable of intrigue but incapable of confrontation he lived out the last years of his life in the intellectual backwater that was the village of salika he knew every man and every woman and every child in the village of salika but his only friend was the headmaster with whom on that night he should have played chess and taken a glass of brandy weakened with water that would have lasted him through the game and he had gone instead to the home of milan stankovic he could justify his abandoning of the game of chess they were coming in the village to the day when the population of salika travelled to the church at glina where so many had died it was an important anniversary the fiftieth all of the village would travel to the site where the people had been herded by the ustase fascists where the fire had been lit where a thousand had died if the priest had not been young not been fit enough to survive emaciated in the petrova gora if he had been inside the cordon then he could believe that he would have been taken to the church and burned alive but to go to the church at glina it was necessary for the people of salika to take two buses the buses were in a barn near to the school to take the buses there must be diesel fuel to get diesel fuel he must have the help of milan stankovic the gaining of diesel fuel was his justification for abandoning his appointment with his friend he had known milans grandparents zoran and milica and both had died in the fire at the church in glina he had known evicas grandparents dragon and gospava and both had been burned alive at the church in glina he understood what he called when he talked with his friend as they pondered the board the curse of history there was not in the village of salika a man woman or child who had not been fed since the dawn of understanding the story of what had been done by the ustase fascists they sat in the kitchen and he understood they were around the table and he had been given bitter coffee and juice and he understood the priest had baptized milan stankovic just as he had baptized evica adamovic and he had baptized little marko who slept now above them the bayonet was on the wall against the leg of the table on milans side was the automatic rifle all of their lives milan and evica and marko would have been battered by the curse of history he thought himself a pragmatist thought himself a realist it was impossible that the curse of history should not fall upon the big shoulders upon the wide face upon the big heart of milan stankovic the priest thought it was the curse of history that had made inevitable the attack on rosenovici the fall of rosenovici the butchering at rosenovici the priest did not apportion blame but he had not gone across the stream when many had gone to watch the digging up of the grave and the recovery of the bodies perhaps he had not wished to take the gaze of the old american near his own age who had come and directed the digging milan agreed with no dispute to allocate the diesel for the buses he considered milan the best of the younger men in the village the best basketball player but he no longer had time for sport the best organizer such as the time he had led the other men in the village in the flattening of a football pitch but he no longer had time for triviality the best husband but evica walked around him as though a wall rose between them milan sat morose opposite him his back to the window and the last light the priest thought that the curse of history made a treadmill for the best of men and the drive of the treadmill was faster milan sat subdued opposite him and never turned to look out across the stream to the corner of the field in the dusk distance walking briskly on the treadmill elected by acclamation to head the village militia jogging and the visit to the village of the barbarian arkan who was a criminal from belgrade and who had raised his own force of gaol filth and who had posed in front of the war memorial with milan running when the attack supported by the tanks and artillery had been directed on the croat neighbours of rosenovici sprinting when the wounded were taken from the cellar of fran jo and ivana and he had played chess with franjo when the wounded were taken out and the girl pounding when they had come with their spades and zipped bags and dug careering when the ustase spies had been captured the priest did not know how milan could go faster and he did not know what would happen to him if he fell from the speeding treadmill the priest offered his thanks for milans time for the promise of the diesel and evica let him out he walked up the lane from milan stankovics house going slowly but he speeded his frail stride where a wax lamp threw light across his path he did not wish to see the opened window to see if his friend sat alone in front of the board it was like a bad pickup in a bad bar he had written up his notes of the day good material he had walked up into the old city and bought a good meal he had come back to the hotel striding and wondering what jovic would pull on him the next day he had taken his key at the reception been handed the telephone message would he please please call mrs mary braddock crumpled it and handed it back to reception to dispose of earlier he had made his own telephone call international and no answer he had gone into the bar for a last drink he had ordered a beer local good and cheap he hadnt seen the man at first his eye caught the clutch of journalists whose table was covered with filled ashtrays and emptied bottles he was eavesdropping on them they were back from sarajevo and noisy he was halfway down his beer when the man came off his stool and the movement caught penns attention he saw the van driver from the camp for officer cadets he saw the shadow shape from when he had stepped off the pavement to give the arguing hooker better space for her negotiation a round full face darting sharp eyes closecut fair hair old acne scars on the cheeks and the chin a bulging neck above an open white shirt and on the neck was the tattoo a rolling swagger walk a small mans walk coming from his stool with his glass in his hand evening squire bit far from the old smoke evening penn offered him nothing dont see a lot of english here mind if i join you please yourself penn said coldly nice to talk english better than all this foreign jabber like a bad pickup in a bad bar he thought of when he had been in curzon street early days in the service close to shepherds market where the girls were when he had gone out for a sandwich at lunch time and he didnt think there would have been a hooker who would not have been ashamed at such a bad pickup the tattoo close to him was of the parachute regiments wings penn didnt feel curious only tired he finished his beer but the man was in fast youll have another course you will the man was leaning across the bar and flicking his fingers at the barman two more local piss move it my boy dozy buggers right im sidney hamilton i get called ham so what brings you to this shit hole squire just a bit of work penn said out from uk are we squire i packed it in there no future its all niggers there and slit eyes and fucking irish why were you following me penn said quietly beg pardon why were you following me why were you listening yesterday to my conversation the darting bright eyes had narrowed focused the new beers were in front of them smartarse eh straight question shouldnt be too difficult to manufacture a straight answer penn said but a diverted answer just heard a word the word triggered you know how it is squire you hear a word said and you get to listen its not a crime what was the word rosenovici the croat village in sector north you were talking to that hag about rosenovici you know rosenovici penn tried to stay casual didnt know whether he succeeded the confidence was flowing again i know rosenovici hell of a battle

points hes a bad bastard in there hes the commander of the militia hes at the village across the stream from rosenovici hes milan stankovic he did it himself used the knife i could have dropped him if

up here why did you follow me ham who said i bloody penn cut him an answer to my question ham why did you follow me like a ball being punctured the bombast of the man went flat he was standing off the

thats dawn my little one why me youre a bloody gumshoe youre a dick thats what you are a private detective then the story rolled an old photograph yes shed done a runner yes shed taken the kiddie yes

little man yes he wanted them found his karen and his dawn yes penn would not have known the answers before he had gone to work at alpha security he had had his share already bombastic men coming up the stairs to the office above the launderette showing a photograph of a woman and a kiddie and wanting them found basil had told him that looking for a woman who had quit with a child was a go careful area basil had said it was necessary to go carefully or the woman might end up in the casualty section he looked into the womans face knotted and the childs face strained he took an address a police station in karlovac he wrote down a telephone number he was told to ask for nd bn karlovac brigade then for ham everybody would know ham he looked a last time at the photograph then gave it back you didnt tell me your name squire penn eased off his stool ill be in touch maybe eight yes i saw her it was jovics success the tram ride out to the west of zagreb through the old quarter then out amongst the apartment blocks of the capitals new suburbs jovics success had brought them to the end of the tram route to where the track ended jovic had said that the wood huts used by the construction workers of the last block to be built were now a refugee camp to penn it was a desperate place there had been rain in the night and the puddles glistened in the first sunlight of the morning the road to the camp would have been gouged out by heavy plant equipment he stepped carefully but the mud gathered at the caps of his cleaned shoes there were children here but too beaten to play with a football there were men standing listless and watching their coming the place had its own aggression he had seen small gardens carved out of the rubble at the edge of the camp and thin thorn bushes had been planted round the plots pitiful little efforts to make a home in a refugee camp the huts were for communal living they walked inside carried more rainwater and mud inside as others had done before then into the gloom of a corridor a line of men waited to use the basins of the wash house a queue of women waited to use the lavatories jovic had given a name waited and they had been led by a sullen guide to a bleak and small room i had taken food to the cellar in franjo and ivanas farmhouse in the early morning there had been a halt in the shelling and i was able to go with food we had only bread to give to the wounded and the bread was old it was when i was there in the cellar that the firing started again and i could not leave i was in the cellar when the village fell when the partizans came her name was sylvia she shared her woodwalled room with her husband and he lay on the bed with dead eyes and sylvia said he was now diabetic there were two boys who she said were aged ten years and seven years and the older boy twitched all the time and the younger sat across his mothers lap and would not be separated from her penn judged her close to nervous collapse and he wondered whether it was worse now or had been worse when the village was fought for she chainsmoked cigarettes she had come with the boy from australia and she would not leave him everyone told her that it was not safe to stay in rosenovici and she ignored everyone perhaps i understood her because my eldest son was with the fighters and i would not leave the village i cannot say whether she realized properly the extent of the danger but she refused to go it was early on the thursday morning that i reached the cellar with the bread my son was in the cellar quietly jovic told him what she said penn wrote the words fast in his notebook he was humbled she had lost her home and she had lost her future and her mind was turned and she dragged hard on the filters of the cigarettes and threw halfsmoked ends into an old tin she said that she had been the secretary to the director of the railway station at karlovac she had come herself the previous evening when there was still shooting to the church where we were hiding and she had taken clothes that had been torn up for bandages and for dressings and we had told her then that it was dangerous for her to be with the wounded she never listened in the month that i knew her that she was in the village it was never her way to listen when i came into the cellar she was bandaging the wound of my son i can see it it is never away from me i see it each night and it is near to a year and a half ago i will never forget it my son had hold of her wrist she was trying to bandage the wound at his stomach but he could not be still because of his pain and it was difficult for her to make the bandage stay i can see it because there was a pi all candle lighting the cellar my son held her wrist as she tried to make the bandage and i saw his love for her they all watched her where they lay they all watched her and they all loved her he thought of what mary had told him stories and pain i knew the village could not fight on for much longer and there was too much firing for me to go back again to the church i thought that i would be useful if i stayed in the cellar and i thought i could help the partizan soldiers to move the wounded after the village fell i thought they would want help to move the wounded boys to the ambulances to take them to the hospital in glina it was in the afternoon on the thursday that they came into the cellar but it was not soldiers the men who came were from salika that is the serb village across the stream from rosenovici i knew all of them the first who came in was the postman from salika and quickly after him was the gravedigger and there was a carpenter who had made the chairs for our kitchen they were fierce with us most of the wounded were kicked they were shouting at them to stand up and none of them could stand and they were kicked because they could not stand she shouted back at them i do not think they understood her language but i saw her punch the postman when he kicked one of the fighters i thought they had a fear of her i thought they did not know what to do with her we were taken up the steps from the cellar and she made the postman branko and the carpenter milo and the gravedigger stevo help to lift the fighters up the steps he was in the garden of franjo and ivanas farmhouse tasting the coffee feeling the warmth of marys kitchen hearing the pain stories he shut them out i have shame because i did not have the strength that she had they threatened me with a gun they told me i could not help i was the last out of the cellar he was in the garden they did not know what to do it was for him to decide what to do some of our fighters were kneeling and some were on the grass in the garden and she held two of them upright and all the time she shouted at him and he went to her and he hit her with the end of the barrel of his rifle and she was still shouting at him i would not say he was a friend but i knew him well enough and there were days when i used to accept a ride from him as far as turanj where he worked and then i would take a bus into karlovac she was not shouting at him pleading she was shouting at him in anger i should have called to her told her not to shout at him but she would not have listened they made a line of them there were some who could walk just and there were some who were carried and she helped two of them they took them along the little road in the village to the square where there was the cafe and the store and the school they took them past the school and away along the lane that goes to the fields he gave the instructions they took them away down the lane because that is what was ordered by milan stankovic what happened to dorrie mowat he watched her the tears streamed on her face her fists were clenched and he thought she might hit him he knew he reopened the wound he understood why the shame held her she had been allowed to stay in the garden of the farmhouse she would have seen the back of her son walking or carried or supported and she would have seen the bobbing head of dorrie between the two young men that she held upright and she would have seen the guns and the knives and she would have known her words were a torrent breaking on penn i saw them until they were at katicas house the lane bends after katicas house i could not see them after they went past katicas house he said flat who killed them your son and her boy and dorrie mowat jovic said she told you she saw them taken as far as the old ladys house she does not know what happened after they had passed the house she told you that milan stankovic gave the order for them to be taken along the lane past the old ladys house towards the fields she told you what she knew but it is correct that she did not see them killed a bitter flare in jovics face she buried her son four days ago can you not comprehend what these people have suffered what you make them endure again for your report she did not see them killed correct a quiet in the room the husband had not spoken lay on his back defeated the children held their mother the woman sylvia looked with bruised eyes into penns face jovic said she does not understand why it is important who shot them who beat them who knifed them she says that katica was in her house when the village fell she knows that on the previous day katicas husband went out to the yard to get wood and was shot by a sniper she knows that katica was in her house with the body of her husband she knows that katica was not brought out of the village with the others who survived she has not seen katica since does anybody care what happened to them or who did it she says does anybody he said grimly would you thank her for her time she says that she has only time left to her she says and she says it is what they all said she says that the young woman was an angel he blundered out of the room and away down the corridor he shoved his way through the queue of men and women lined up for the wash house there was a cockroach crawling amongst the feet going slow because it was already damaged by kicks and then it was stamped upon by a bare foot he saw the slime of the destroyed creature the cockroach was forgotten the feet tripped past it he saw himself as the creature insignificant gone from memory but dorrie was remembered he could write his report embellish it for effect take the money be a creature squashed and slimed perhaps in life there was just one chance penn felt humbled he walked fast out of the camp and jovic had to scurry to keep at his shoulder towards the waiting tram at the end of the track she came in from her shopping she played back the answer phone and there was a message advising the date of the next meeting of the southeastern branch of the save the children fund and a query on the availability of the marquees for the garden party at whitsun in support of leukaemia research and the secretary who did two days a week would not be coming in the morning because of influenza she let the tape run she did not hear the voice the voice crisp competent was absent from the tape the dogs were scratching at the kitchen door she let them out and they jumped at her happy maybe it was just a folly maybe she had no right to know maybe the dead should sleep four times now she had telephoned the number of the hotel in zagreb four times in growing annoyance she had left her message and four times in increasing loneliness the message had not been answered she left her shopping on the kitchen table she took the leashes from behind the door mary walked her dogs through the village she walked on the drying grass next week they would take the flowers away from the grave she laid her coat on the grass and sat on it next week she would bring more flowers the dogs hunted out fallen wood and lay beside her and chewed and spat the morsels clear she heard herself her own words saying calmly that she enjoyed winning and she wondered what he thought of such stupidity she heard herself her own voice saying that her daughter was a horrid young woman and she wondered how he had taken such betrayal shared her secrets with him given her secrets to penn wretched little private detective opened herself to him stupidity and betrayal for nothing dorrie should have allowed your rest he walked with jovic jovic showed him the big german cars speeding on the cobbles and said they belonged to the new elite of racketeers jovic said that the country was rotten and that the profiteers fed from the carcass and every few minutes jovic would stop hold out his hand for telephone money and be gone into a bar and then be back and not offer any explanation each time he was left on the pavement he gazed around him the city was at ease the war was forgotten tucked and hidden behind the ceasefire line that was thirty minutes drive away he had never seen a tram before zagreb clanking and swaying monsters with raucous hooters to announce their coming with the passengers clinging inside to the straps and the lines running polished amongst the worn and smoothed cobbles he watched a flower seller jovic showed him the great circular plaza it had been the square of the victims of fascism now it was the square of croatian celebrities jovic showed him the historical museum closed for reconstruction indefinitely jovic took him into a yard behind a building and in the yard weeds grew amongst the mighty toppled statues of the former regime in stalinist bronze and jovic said the statues would be cut up and melted down destroyed as historically incorrect jovic said that it was necessary for history to be rewritten in new nationhood said it and grinned sardonically jovic took him to the tourist bureau and there were no new guidebooks of the city the old ones were all recalled for pulping and the new ones would carry no reference to the ustase fascists a new bar more money for the telephone penn waited outside the rain had started again the artist said there is no record of her coming out there is a database for refugees who have left the occupied territory and she is not listed she is classified a missing person the detail is small she is katica dubelj she is eightyfour years old she was in her eightythird year when rosenovici fell if she had died between then and now it is the sort of matter that is discussed at the liaison meetings if her body were returned for burial here then it would have come through the turanj crossing point escorted by unhcr i cannot help it but she does not appear on the database there are a few old people who still live across there perhaps in the woods perhaps they are tolerated she is beyond your reach alive or dead it is the end of the road mr penn i think you should be satisfied you know the last weeks and the last days and the last hours of the life of miss mowat only a few minutes have escaped you satisfactory yes do you want me to book the flight for you penn said he wanted to be alone shall i come tonight for my money or in the morning before you fly penn took out his wallet he counted out the notes american dollars he took the scribbled receipt written on the ripped paper from jovics notebook i think we did well i think you will write a good report penn shook his hand i think that by next week you will have forgotten us mr penn we are easy with our problems to forget penn had no pleasantries for jovic and he saw the surprise of the man for the moment he believed he had at last unsettled the artist no banter no chat no laughing and no thanks as if he had no time for them there was a confusion on jovics face but he was proud jovic penn thought would not have known how to grovel and was gone skipping away across the road through the cars lost in the pedestrians on the far side never looking back he had finished or he had not begun finished not begun it was penns decision a light rain fell and it brought a dust with it that lay on the cars and it settled on the shoulders of his blazer he made room on the pavement for two young men who swung theirjweight on crutches war amputees he was the intruder he prised himself into their lives into the life of the city into the lives of the camps it was penns decision on whether he had finished or whether he had not begun she had had everything and he had had nothing she had had privilege and advantage and abused them she could have walked into college but she declined to he would have called her to her face if he had met her selfish little bitch had had everything while he had had nothing had been free and he had never been it was as if he should have been warned away kept safe distance and he had prised beaten kicked his way into the life of dorrie mowat i told you and you cared not to hear me charles barking and the gin spilling from the glass rim i told you that you were wasting money but you cared not to listen i just wanted to bloody know mary walking the lounge spinning like a caged creature and smoking which was new for her dont i have the right to know its obsession and obsession will break you i tell you he wasnt flash he was wellmannered and he was considerate mr bloody penn hes taken my money and hes taken you for a damn great ride when hes ready hell be back when hes back there will be his bill and there will be a report that is bullshit theyre grubby people and you chose to involve them sorry what sort of day was it a bloody awful day he could have rung me back could have talked to me sorry she went to her kitchen started the supper what hurt was that she had thought mr penn cared the media had hit the hotel penn rueful sat in the bar and nursed the fourth beer might have been the fifth the circus had hit the hotel penn listened and he watched it was reunion time for those from sarajevo and those from vitez and those from mostar there was embracing and kissing and bellboys bent under the weight of equipment boxes he sat apart from them listened and his hand twitched to his tie no ties on show in the circus no blazers no pressed slacks no shined shoes penn listened because the talk was of staying alive staying alive was paying the welding company in sarajevo to fit the shrapnelproof sides onto the reinforced landrover chassis id have bought it too bloody right mm chunks coming in staying alive was not going to srebrenica across country on foot crazy place place to get killed not worth the hassle staying alive was laughing for the wild man in sarajevo who had brought a cow across the airport runway under the snipers guns best bloody milk in the city staying alive was getting down to the mortuary in mostar after the shelling he was about twelve hed got new trainers on sticking out under the blanket the trainers made it front page and it syndicated to penn listening they made staying alive just about possible they were in town for a wedding they were going back to sarajevo and vitez and mostar in thirtysix hours it was his decision whether he had finished or not begun it was as if her freedom laughed at him as if the laugh was recklessly loud in a cavern of silence as if she danced in front of him feral a creature of his childhood woodland challenging him to follow where she led he had never been free had he bloody structured bloody trapped duty stability discipline commitment penns gods it was as if she had never been defeated not even in death as if he had never succeeded not even in life he had not known freedom would never know it unless he followed it was like a pain in him he finished his beer penn went out of the hotel to walk think he sat in his kitchen and he fastened the belt that held the holster at his waist the carpenter milo bent beside the table and eased off his shoes then dragged on his old boots and he heard the intake of breath from his wife because the boots shed dried mud onto the floor that she had washed he went to the refrigerator and took an apple and put it into the pocket of his heavy coat it was a good refrigerator the best that could have been bought in zagreb but the door was always open because he had learned that to close the door meant the gathering of mildew on the inner walls there was no power in salika it was near to a year and a half since the carpenter had made the two journeys with the wheelbarrow across the river and come back with the refrigerator from franjo and ivanas kitchen and the television from the house behind rosenovicis store they both looked well in the carpenters home and he spat back at his wife each time that she declared them useless because there was no power with the holster at his belt with the apple in his pocket he took the hurricane lamp down from the shelf above the sink he could no longer use the big flashlight because the batteries were exhausted he lit the lamp and clumped in his old boots across the kitchen floor and left more mud he went out into the night he went to his store shed and he took from the nail the sharp bow saw and his big jemmy and the lump hammer he went past the house of the headmaster where a small light burned and he groped down and found a stone in the road and threw it hard so that it rattled the upper planking of his house he went past the house of the priest the old fool and past the house of the gravedigger stevo and called out to him and past the house of the postman branko short of the bridge he shouted forward there would be young men on the bridge guarding and it was best to call forward he yelled his name into the night the light swirled around him and beyond the light was blackness no moon that night and he could not see the ruin of the village nor the trees beyond it nor the outline against the skies of the higher ground it was to please milan stankovic that he went with his pistol and his apple and his bow saw and tools out into the night they were good boys on the bridge good laughter when he came to them and they pulled aside the frame that was laced with barbed wire so that he could go onto the bridge he considered milan stankovic the finest man in the village of salika he hated to see it what he saw every day now the sullen and hostile and bleak face of the best man he knew milan had said that morning that evica had complained of the table in the kitchen it was too old and the glue was dried out and the surface was too scratched to scrub clean there were fine timbers to be had in the ruins the wind was around him as he walked up the lane towards the village of rosenovici and there was light rain and once he stumbled and nearly fell because he had been looking ahead to the edge of light thrown by the hurricane lamp and he had not seen the deeper hole left by the jeeps that had come for the digging he did not understand the recent mood of milan stankovic the carpenter thought that he could bring the life smile back to the face of milan when he presented him with a new kitchen table at the edge of his light he saw a cat sprinting away stomach down and he kicked a stone fiercely towards its starved ribcage there were none in the village who would come with the carpenter to rosenovici at night the scared farts but he would gather up sufficient seasoned wood from the timbers and haul it back that evening and work through the small hours catch some sleep then work again through the day and have the table ready for the next evening the carpenter would have said that he was afraid of nothing he reached the village there was an owl in a tree up the hill he had been back to the village many times never with milan the timbers would not be at the square not at the store nor the cafe because the headquarters of the ustase had been there and the greatest concentration of tank fire had been there he had been back for the refrigerator and for the television and to help others round up the cattle left there and back for the shooting of the dogs that had been abandoned there and back to look and to search among the homes for hidden jewellery and he had been back to stand in the group that had watched the digging milan had never been back there was fine wood in the roof of the church but what had been burned had fallen and the rest of the roof spars were too high for him to retrieve the farmhouse with the cellar had not been burned but it had been dynamited destroyed the timbers would lie under plaster and stone rubble milan always found an excuse for not returning to rosenovici he stood in the square the wind played at his face coming from the east and cold the light caught at the houses that had been destroyed the carpenter could see up the road along which they had marched as escort to the wounded he was not frightened of darkness he thought he knew in which house he would find seasoned timber out of the square and along the lane he had brought up the rear pushed them driven them it was the lane up which the bulldozer had been directed following them he was not frightened of darkness but the silence around him was broken by the wheeze of his breathing and the stamp of his boots and the carpenter shivered felt the cold of the wind ahead of him at the edge of the light was the collapsed gate then the black expanse of the field it was through the gate that they had taken them and then the bulldozer had followed and the bulldozer had clipped the gate post collapsed the gate short of the field where the lane bent was the small house which had not been destroyed it might have been the postman branko or it might have been the gravedigger stevo but both had claimed to have shot the old bastard ustase he could remember it seeing the flash of her face at the window the old bitch ustase as he cursed them to go faster and he could remember the face of the girl it was only a hovel the carpenter reckoned he would not have put pigs in the house of the old bastard and the old bitch but the hovel had been there since the time he was born and the timber would be good seasoned in his mind they were both together the face of the old bitch at her window and the face of the girl the door groaned as he pushed it the hurricane lamp threw its light inside the one room he smelled the damp of the room it was close and small and he saw the sacking in the corner as if it was used for a couch bed not a place for a pig not for cattle he had to work quickly because the oil was poor quality in the hurricane lamp and burned faster than good oil but good oil was no longer available he began to rip the wide panel strips from the wall the best wood and seasoned he used the jemmy and then the lump hammer to hack away at the last holding nails the noise was around him and the dust of the plaster lathe he often thought of the girl it need not have happened to the girl she could have gone with the other women the postman branko had tried to pull her away from the two wounded men tried to save her and she had fought the postman had hurt him the dust clogged at his nose and when the wide panel strips were free he reached up and belted with the lump hammer at the ceiling plaster that cascaded on him the beams were good he wanted two lengths of beam each his own height for the legs of the table he would present to milan making room with the jemmy and the lump hammer for his bow saw the blow caught him he was turning in the grey white of the dust storm the shrivelled figure black and the hurricane lamp guttering and the stick raised as a club his eyes watering from the blow his vision hazed he clung to the stick the club wrestled it away claws in his face feeling the drag of the nails razor lines of pain on his face clutching at thin wrists seeing the bony fingers reaching for his eyes the shrivelled figure black gone in the mist of grey white gone into the darkness of the door he staggered to the door he had his pistol out from the holster there was only silence around the carpenter he fired the pistol up the lane and down the lane and the crash of the shots burgeoned at his ears he had no target he did not know where to fire he emptied the magazine of the pistol and he ran he left behind him his bow saw and the jemmy and his lump hammer and the failing light of the hurricane lamp he ran down the lane he splattered the potholes of rainwater and he ran through the square he was panting hard when he reached the bridge and he shouted out his name that the guards should not shoot him he found them scared cringing hiding down behind the sandbags and they had their own light which they shone in his face he wiped his cheeks he did not know what he could tell the young men who guarded the bridge across the stream his own blood stained the palm of his hand finished or not begun penn sat on a bench in the park the darkness around him penn thought he had made the decision to go to the end that was his fathers code doing it properly that was his mothers code on a bench in zagreb with noisy basketball played open air under floodlights beyond the darkness he thought of them his father looking at him direct pipe clamped in his teeth would have said that he had taken the money and that if he hadnt wanted shit in his face then he should not first have taken the money his mother averted head and pursed lips and wiping her hands would have told him that he was under obligation but that he should go carefully when he had swotted for the exams that had lifted him from the countryside prompted by his history master who had helped with the forms he had sent off an application for work as a clerk in government he was going back into the rock of previous years now chiselling for guidance taken on at the home office he wondered how they would have reacted at the home office to his query as to whether he had finished or whether he had not begun working with paper pushing paper annotating paper moving paper discarding paper for the prison service department of the home office they would have said the ones who had worked with him in the clerks pool who were still there working in the clerks pool that he had finished five oclock old chummy time to be gone always finished at five oclock old chummy one late night and there was a panic meeting between the home office and security service and an assistant under secretary stamping empty corridors searching for a file fetcher finding bill penn clerk he had run half the night down to the basement and back up to the third floor with the files they had needed he had brought the coffee he had gone out for sandwiches he had kept the files coming and the coffee and the sandwiches when their heads were on their bloody knees in tiredness and a week later the job offer had come through clerk grade in library at curzon street then at gower street in fives library they would have said he had finished into f branch pushing paper on subversives into a branch working with the watchers the guys in f branch and the guys in a branch they would have said too damned right he had finished the guys in f branch and a branch would have been quoting training courses evaluating backup querying days in lieu for extra days worked but there was no training there would be no backup it was penns decision he had the obligation and he would go carefully it would be for her dorrie not for mary braddock in the manor house not for basil and the creeps at alpha security not for arnold bloody browne who had not lifted a finger when hed needed help not for his jane and his tom and the paying of the mortgage for the roof over their heads but for the love of dorrie he had the photographs of her the photographs were in the inside pocket of his blazer dry safe close to him he thought that what he wanted wanted most in the world was to share in the love of dorrie he saw the face that was loved the face of mischief sparkle hatred bloodymindedness courage the face that was putrefied and drawn from the ground and wounded with cuts and blows and a pistol shot and all the rest was shit it was as if she called it was as if he should follow he knew that he wanted her love certainty more than anything he had wanted in his life he craved the freedom that had been hers as if he heard her loud laughter daring him not finished because it was not begun ham saw him come through the door then he was looking round checking the tables searching for a face hello squire funny seeing you in this shit heap most evenings ham ate alone couldnt abide the crap they served up in the old police station most evenings he asked the guys if theyd come down the town and join him and most evenings they had a reason not to fuck them he ate alone in the cafe on krizaniceva inside the walls of the old city he pushed out the chair opposite him so what brings you down the sharp end what brings you to sunny karlovac you wanted a bit of tracing done you wanted to know where your wife was and your kiddie ill do that ham said quickly cant pay a fancy fee no fee no charge ham said suddenly doubtful not for fucking charity whats the game squire for a favour you tell me whats the favour you said youd walked into sector north i want a route i want to know where to go where not to go thats my fee for the trace wideeyed ham said thats fucking dumb talk no charge for the trace but you give me a route so as i can walk to rosenovici ham said you dont get me to go i want a route to go on my own nine there was the same message on each of the boxes different languages the boxes were stacked high to the ceiling cross struts baby food nutritional gift of the people of germany pasta shapes various gift of the people of italy medicines antenatal postnatal gift of the people of holland rice gift of the people of the united states of america tents with blankets gift of the people of the united kingdom the biggest section of boxes was labelled as a mobile operating theatre gift of the people of sweden and there were cigarettes in boxes and alcohol and soya and hospital drugs penn was walked down the corridor between the boxes that filled the shed he read each label he thought of the advertisements he saw in the papers back home and those on the commercial radio stations he thought of the kids standing in the high street where he lived and rattling collection tins and he thought of the women who knitted warm clothes for refugees and he thought the business was dirty he had not been brought to the shed for food medicines drugs nor for cigarettes nor alcohol the mercenary had brought him to the shed because that was where he could buy a gun anything could be bought that was what penn had been told anything he had the money to pay for he could buy in the shed ham had brought him out from the old quarter of karlovac out through the modern city and he had seen the scar marks of the shelling and they had crossed over the kupa river and headed into the industrial estate it was a dead city no smoke from the chimneys no lorries carrying away finished products the city had died because the city sat astride the front line there had been two series bmws parked outside the shed and an alfa a giant man had come quickly through the door of the shed and his gaze had been hostile intimidating before he had seen ham there was an office space at the far end of the corridor between the cardboard and wooden crates ham had said he should take a gun ham had said that walking into sector north without a gun was about the same as going in barearsed ham had said that he should pack a gun before he packed his toothpaste three men were in the partitioned office at the end of the shed they lolled back in easy chairs and there was a haze of cigar smoke and one listened at a telephone and one was talking local language into a mobile and each wore designer jeans and a loosefitting designer leather jacket as if for uniform they were all under thirty years of age penn stood distant in the doorway and each casually shook hams hand but the enthusiasm was the mercenarys and they seemed to penn to regard ham as dog shit on the pavement what sort of gun did he want penn shrugged like they should tell him what was on offer and there was a big peal of laughter from the heavy man who was not listening on the telephone good english spoken he could have a t tank soviet he could have a mm howitzer american he could have an rpg rocket launcher soviet he could have a stinger groundtoair american if he could pay the mocking laughter subsided he could have a heckler amp koch machine pistol or an uzi highfirerate submachine gun if he could pay the eyes were locked on him ham had said to him where he was going every male understood the workings of firearms their culture cradletograve stuff penn felt like stale piss he knew how to strip down and clean and reassemble a shotgun because that was what he had used around the hedges and fields and woods of the farm where his father drove a tractor now he felt inadequate penn knew how to strip and clean and reassemble a browning mm automatic pistol because that was what he had been shown on the twoday firearms course organized for newcomers into a branch it was fourteen years since he had downed a pigeon with the shotgun and it was seven years since the twoday firearms course he asked if they had a browning mm automatic pistol the heavy man swivelled his chair the telephone was down and the mobile was switched off they seemed to strip him with their eyes the heavy man dragged the keys from his pocket that were held to his waist belt by a thin chain reached forward and unlocked the tall wall safe he was spilling handguns onto the desk pistols and revolvers shortbarrelled and longbarrelled with or without silencer attachment old and new when it came penn recognized the browning mm automatic pistol no silencer it was pushed towards him like a toy he lifted it from the table held it it felt strange in his hand unfamiliar and he tried to hide that how many rounds of ammunition he had fired four magazines on the twoday course he said that he would like to take fifty rounds again the mocking two hundred us dollars for the browning mm automatic pistol one hundred us dollars for the magazines and the ammunition and twentyfive us dollars each for four rg fragmentation grenades that ham said he should have and fifteen us dollars for the olivegreen backpack that was pulled off the floor from among the rubbish and ten us dollars for webbing and for a canteen and for a knife and five us dollars for the boots penn peeled the american dollars off the wad in his wallet the heavy man said that he liked to offer a discount and the discount was five dollars penn didnt smile penn handed him the four hundred and twentyfive dollars he stood his ground waited on his receipt he hitched one strap of the backpack over his blazer shoulder so that it hung loose against him he stood in the doorway thank you gentlemen i hope youll give me a good price when i bring them back penn was halfway down the corridor between the boxes and crates before their laughter subsided the nice girl penny who showed some respect for him brought back the backgrounder sheet she had typed for him henry carter looked up smiled at her the way that he thought young people liked to be smiled at he thought she was a nice girl because he had worked with her father a considerably long time ago but he always made the point of asking after her fathers health just to remind her that he had pedigree still hard at it then mr carter he rested from his writing yes its rather an interesting one very interesting what ive just typed up for you will there be more for me to type up tomorrow he grinned then whispered dragon alert he could see over her shoulder the return from tea break of the supervisor the nice girl penny scuttled away from him the file was taking shape now and he placed her typed work where he thought it relevant near to the start good background notwithstanding the arguable advantages of hindsight he thought always useful and the thin biography always useful to improve the understanding of a file well if a future reader of the file did not comprehend the situation on the ground and the prime players personality then it would not be easy to appreciate the quite dreadful hazard into which this young fellow proposed to walk he read back

man trap for the uninitiated area of extreme danger he had the words of the file and the photographs and in the morning he would have the largescale map the light was slackening outside he understood he would not have claimed any particular credit for his understanding but he felt the events were within his experience been there done it seen it hadnt he no not to this squalid little corner not to this exact place but he had been to other armed and fortified front lines and he had pushed young men with quite a firm shove into such man traps of suspicion and hostility it was because he understood that the memories seeped back so many yean before he did not think these young men dull and ordinary and boring went because they were brave he thought they went because of their fear of personal failure old men such as henry carter senior men experienced men men who had never done it themselves went to these front lines that were armed and fortified and gave a young chap a pretty firm shove then went back to a hotel or a safe house villa to hang around stooge around wait to see if they made it out of iraq or east germany or czechoslovakia or iran an awfully long time ago but they were all sharp in his mind all the young men all of them dragged to the cliff edge extraordinary but they all seemed to go willingly he stood stretched he took the fax message that he had written earlier to the supervisor he asked for it to be sent and he believed that his smile was gracious the memories came close too often the memories that would be carried to the grave hustled into the mind of the old desk warrior standing on the safe side of the fence with the minefields and the tripwires and the selffiring guns and hearing the explosions and the shrill german shouts seeing johnny donoghue leave the young woman who was living and her father who was dead watching johnny climb the bucking bloody wire the memories standing and seeing and watching were not erased sharpest of the memories neatly condensed for an addendum to his file was the late supper of cold cuts of meat and spiced cheese and gassy beer served by an impatient landlord in the helmstedt hotel johnny lovely young man bottling his emotion in silence such dignity and he had been on the safe side and did not know how to communicate with johnny and the two of them toying with the food he felt so humble in the morning they had caught the flight from hanover back to heathrow parted with a limp handshake before the next christmas he had sent a card to johnny but it was not replied to he had never again seen johnny lovely young man he had used him and the memories damn them did not mist back at his desk he thought of the place sector north as a man trap they were in a wood it was the middle of the day and the sun dappled down through the early leaves on the birches ham had quit the bullshit penn asked questions about his karen and his dawn there was a softness in hams voice and hed lost the obscenities and the swagger it was later that ham had gotten round to talking about the rudiments what could be told in a couple of hours of survival movement behind enemy lines there was a cordon around the village as tight a line as the men from salika could draw eighteen of them made the line covering with their guns the open fields around the village it was like a rabbit shoot eighteen men to watch the fields between rosenovici and the stream and the road and the woods on the higher ground they had whistles and each man in the cordon line when he was in the position given him blasted his arrival some had the new ak assault rifles and some had the hunting rifles with the long accuracy barrels that had been handed down from their fathers and some had shotguns branko the postman waited on the road that led to rosenovici from the bridge for all the whistle blasts with him were his constant companions the gravedigger stevo and the carpenter milo they were the dogs that would go in and flush the rabbit and the postman chuckled some goddamn rabbit some goddamn claws on that rabbit and he looked slyly across at the carpenter and the raw lines on the carpenters cheeks it was a bright morning good for sport he heard milans shout milan was on the high ground above the village they went forward three of them with the dog bounding ahead he could see milan past the tower of the church that was broken and branko waved his handkerchief to show that he had heard that they were moving milan should have been with them it had been the postmans idea to ask milan to bring the dog hed thought the idea clever because he had reckoned that if milan brought the dog then milan would be with them among the ruins of rosenovici something had to shake the man out of his morose misery and the dog would know where to look the postman reckoned milan had said that they could take the dog that he would control the cordon line the dog led them into each building they watched each house put the dog in then followed the dog always the dog went first they searched each building it was necessary to be careful because the fire and the dynamite had weakened the floor boards and brought down the rafter beams he had known those who had lived in each house because he had come there each day way back with the letters from the kids who were away at the colleges in belgrade and zagreb and the letters with the stamps of australia and america the postman felt nothing bad because they had been all of them goddamn ustase they were the people who would have come into salika at night with knives and with fire no doubting they would have done what their grandparents the original goddamn ustase had done killed and burned he felt nothing bad and did not understand why milan the best felt something bad they had cleared the homes leading into the square they cleared the church and the store and the home that had been used as the hq they put the dog into the cellar of franjo and ivanas farmhouse and while the dog was down in the cellar he had stood on the stone flags of the kitchen most times that he came to the farmhouse branko had been given a slash of brandy in the kitchen while they opened the letters from franjos nephew who was in australia or ivanas aunt who was on the west coast in america no concern to him the brandy because franjo and ivana were the same as the others goddamn ustase if it was no concern to him then he did not understand why it concerned milan they cleared the school they shouted their progress across the village across the fields up to the tree line on the hill where milan controlled the cordon branko watched the dog it would have been the first time that the dog had been taken back to rosenovici since its family had gone left it let it run beside the wheels until it could run no more the first time that the dog had been back since milan had gone to the edge of the village and called the dog and brought it home to his son and the goddamn ustase dog was remembering the dog whined at a heap of collapsed rubble the dog whimpered beside the wall section with the green flowers on a yellow base of interior wallpaper the dog curved its tail over its privates sniffed crawled on its belly over the wall section with the wallpaper the postman was not concerned that the old american had come with the uncivpol and dug for the bodies they could dig where they goddamn wanted they could cart the bodies stinking back to zagreb and then they could do goddamn nothing and he did not understand why milan had such morose misery what could they goddamn do nothing he shouted for the dog and it came back to his side they were going up the lane a small shed a stone shed with a roof of rusted corrugated iron precious dynamite would have been wasted on the shed fire would have had little to burn in the shed the dog found a plastic bag the bag was white and inside the bag were dried crumbs of bread the shed was forty paces short of what had been the home of the dubelj pair goddamn ustase between the shed and the home of the dubelj couple was a small paddock thick with weeds a cow had been kept in the paddock and a goat and two pigs stevo had the cow and milo had the pigs the postman had taken the goat but had killed and eaten it he had felt strong until they reached the house of katica dubelj the door hung open held only by the lower hinge it was dark inside the dog held back the postman kicked the dog through the door the carpenter was behind him and there were the raw scratch scars on the cheeks of his face he was not hurrying to push past him he went inside into the goddamn smell and the darkness he held tight to his gun he had to stand very still and wait for his eyes to work for him the dog was in the corner the image cleared the dog scratched in a heap of rags maybe sacks in the corner he saw the hurricane lamp that had died and the bow saw and the jemmy and the lump hammer dropped on the old linoleum there was another bag white and he lifted the bag and crumbs of bread crust fell from it the dog had come from the corner and sniffed at a chewed apple core the dog held a scent down the lane from the house and through the entrance to the field where the bulldozer had crushed the wooden gate the dog followed a scent that skirted the low wall of grey black mud around the pit went over the tyre marks of the jeeps there had been heavy rain in the night and branko slipped and fell in the field as he tried to keep pace with the dog he could see milan above him close to the tree line the dog went past the grave the dog reached the small ditch that came down the field and at the ditch the dog lost the scent they tried the dog up the ditch right side and left side but the dog had lost it the postman trudged up the field sliding cursing until he reached milan he showed milan the plastic bags in which they had found the crumbs and the chewed apple core he told milan that someone had been there recently had eaten there slept there the scar scratches on the carpenters face proved it he asked milan to come down into rosenovici so that he could see for himself where they had found the plastic bags and the apple core milan refused him milan was the postmans leader he would never criticize him he watched milan walk away he had taught milan boy and man everything he knew of the game of basketball and he had been superb milan walked away along the edge of the tree line took the long route so that he would not have to cross the village he could remember when milan in attack brilliant in the dribble fantastic jumping for the net had led glina municipality to victory against karlovac municipality taken the cup a player without doubts milan was going the long way round the village towards the bridge the postman did not understand the goddamn problem ham had slung a white tshirt filthy as if it had been used to clean the plugs of a car engine across a low bush of thorn they sat a dozen paces back from where the tshirt was draped and ham talked penn through the maintenance and cleaning of the browning mm automatic pistol and then made penn do it and then tied a handkerchief round the front of penns face and made him do it again and he made penn load a magazine with the blindfold still in place it was seven years since the twoday firearms course and it was more forgotten than he had realized later ham would show him what he had also damn near forgotten how to crouch lock his legs extend his arms find the target aim and hold it how to fire the pistol ham talked low and keen as if firing the pistol was of importance in the grip on the back seat of the cherokee jeep were seven video tapes nine hours of audio recording thirtyseven pages of handwritten notes marty drove along the wide highway back to zagreb they were good snapshots the video and the audio and the notes from the stories of the latest refugees from the village outside the bosnian town of prijedor he drove steadily did not exceed the speed limit although the road ahead was empty ewt traumatized but coherent had said that he had seen seven pairs of fathers forced to have oral sex with their sons before the fathers and sons were shot evidence ewt thirteen years old but with a visage going on sixty had said that he had seen prisoners ordered to castrate fellow prisoners with their teeth evidence and plenty more eyewitnesses telling his microphone of rape and beating and killing telling it like it was evidence the evidence would go from his notes onto disk the disks and the video tapes and the audio would go on the courier flight back to the secondfloor office in geneva but it was just damned ridiculous it had hurt him that he had not seen the german lady when he had pulled out from the transit centre he had wanted to see her wanted to be with her had checked her office actually gone up the staircase and through each of the third and the secondfloor rooms and the dispensary and the kindergarten and the kitchens been told she wasnt there anywhere and kept looking for her it had been a long time since he had last gone looking for a woman and wanted to be with that woman it was just damned ridiculous that his work work of this importance should be dumped off in a damned converted container he was coming into zagreb picking up the traffic had he looked at himself which he did not marty jones might not have liked what he saw his mind did not acknowledge the ravages of stress the videos that he filmed were of rape the audios he recorded were of torture the notes that he wrote were of foul cruelty the woman he reported to in geneva three weeks back when she was down in zagreb had said to him dont you get sick of it marty why dont they just kill each other what does it do to you marty why do they have to cut out eyes cut off noses cut off heads why cant they just kill each other how do you stay sane marty he had not known how to answer her but he never looked in the mirror he had a dream and the dream was a prepared case it was just damned ridiculous that he had to make the dream in a converted freight container he drove into ilica barracks the parking lot available to him was up by the a block where the big shots were there were workmen carrying prefabricated partitioning and timbers in through the main doors the big shots were extending their office space reaching into the roof area the big shots had space and he had the damned converted freight container for the rest of the day he would get his notes onto disk and get the package off and then he might just raise some damned noise he unlocked the door of his container pulled it open and the wall of heat hit him the crows above them had scattered with the first shot the quiet came again to the woodland of birches the magazine was exhausted four hits on the tshirt two hits for every three misses ham didnt criticize back on the training course the instructor had given him hell with three hits for every five misses penn guessed that ham didnt criticize because it was too late to rubbish him quite relaxed he had been on the training course but time was not running then when he had cleaned the pistol he sat with ham and they went over the maps they had a tourist map that ham had bought in karlovac and they had the sketch map that ham had drawn the sketch map would take him to within six miles of rosenovici there were minefields marked on hams handdrawn map and strong points and villages where there would be patrols and roadblocks and all the time ham seemed to watch him in a manner open but sly ham watched him as if he were meat hanging from the hook in a butchers window evaluated his quality penn thought ham was making a reckoning on whether he would get himself back to go for the hunting of karen and dawn and he thought also that ham judged him capable of bringing back intelligence bullshit that the mercenary would present to his officers he was a rotten little man but he had taken the one chance and perhaps would be remembered dorrie was a horrid young woman but she had taken the one chance and was loved jovic was a prickly bastard who learned to paint with his left hand and might succeed it was about winning his own respect about walking his own path taking the one chance and the afternoon was slipping of course well have another well hows the selfinflicted wound itll have to be a cheaper one georgie simpson had his arm raised for the attention of the wine waiter the food wasnt good the monkfish didnt taste as if it had been swimming too recently best to kill another bottle arnold browne didnt believe he cared too much about the freshness of the fish he wiped his mouth with the napkin not a lot moving on that front which was economical with the truth the truth and it rankled was that he had been summoned the last evening to the snug at the bottom of the neighbours garden at about the time he was looking to his bed and his book given a token whisky not generous and berated hammered penn did not respond to telephone messages penn had been away nearly a week and not a squeak from him penn was on the gravy train penn was a bloody waste of money no shortage of money arnold wouldnt have thought it was small change to charles bloody braddock penn was the wrong man what sort of chap i beg your pardon the private detective you told me last week youd arranged for a private detective to travel i did yes hes a good fellow not bright but dogged arnold had hold of his glass and his fingers shook and what was left of the wine spilled onto the crumbs on the cloth you all right arnold not bright enough for five not bright enough to have been taken into general intelligence group not bright enough to have a future but dogged georgie had the wine waiter muttered to him within his price stricture anything in my slow mind there is the grind of cogs meshing you recommended a five reject hes a very good investigator go to the end do you have something i could smoke georgie a cigarette or a cigar ella bless you yes hed go as far as was possible maybe further georgie lit the cigarette for him arnold coughed hard georgie said quietly going to the end is where the evidence is if theres evidence to be had id back him to get it the bottle was on the table uncorked arnold poured for himself and his hand still shook are my friends at five playing funny little games arnold depends on your perspective whether theyre funny and he wanted to talk talk to anyone talk even to georgie simpson and it was a hanging offence in gower street to talk to personnel from babylon on thames evidence is leverage right leverage is pressure right youre a bit ahead of me i usually am georgie so stop pissing on me words of one syllable what im told is that we require the means for pressure we wish to pressure those moronic hooligans in belgrade we wish to pressure the serbs too fast for you georgie evidence is pressure in the world of public relations the spin merchants the image men the serbs bloodthirsty mob want to appear virgin clean but good evidence tends to stain the snow its all part of the pressure game to get those morons to the conference table you didnt tell me that last week blame the monkfish congratulations you have an uptight reject yes told about a half of the truth could be a quarter straightforward sort of chap not too much intelligence fatal to be intelligent who will predictably go to the end of the road for evidence something like that arnold do you have the faintest idea of what the end of the road might be like please dont patronize me was this your idea we all bend the knee when we have to of course it was not does it end up with handcuffs and things god no hell just make a report sorry if im slow havent you hazarded him george get the bill theres a dear thing your gavin he went to university in london didnt he my caroline she went to hull social sciences my man my reject he wanted rather badly to go to college it didnt work out doesnt matter why you know what i cant abide about carolines friends probably the same with your gavin theyre so cynical so scheming they seem to believe enthusiasm is a vice its as if my reject was spared that cynicism one of those people that are ambitious but dont know how to get themselves promoted think promotion derives from merit god my caroline could tell him my caroline would walk over our throats if the main chance was in view theres something rather attractive about a man who hasnt cynicism in his backpack but it tends to leave him so very naked sorry been talking too much havent i should be getting back to the shop he pushed himself up from the table georgie looked up staring he thought georgie happy and ponderous and cheerful georgie was frightened havent you hazarded him perhaps he sat on the bed beside her the sheet of paper was supported by a book ulrike was in the doorway behind him and she prompted the translation the woman alija held the book and the paper high in front of her eyes and drew the road and the square and the lanes of the village and she would make a mark on the map as it formed and ulrike would say that the mark was the school or the church or the store or the farmhouse with the cellar and each time penn took from her hands the sheet of paper and the book and wrote the designation word himself the noise of the sleeping room in the transit centre was around them but shut from his mind she drew the line for the river and she marked with a crude circle the second village that was across the stream ulrike told her of his thanks they walked out of the sleeping room and down the stone stairs evening was rushing forward they were at the main doors of the transit centre and across in the square ham had seen him and started up the engine of the car a small yugo he could sense that ulrike was unusually serious he thought she understood why he had come back to the transit centre to speak with alija would he come to dinner the smile sorry but no can do the shrug was he going back to zagreb the smile the shaken head again the shrug she knew why he had asked for the map to be drawn what he thought so fine about her was that there was no interrogation no questioning no requirement for lies she looked into his face he saw her tiredness and the clean skin and the strength of her chin and the power of her eyes no questions her hand was for a moment on the sleeve of his blazer he understood what it would be like for her working from dawn and through the day and past dusk in the transit centre alongside the misery he thought she recognized that he made a small gesture against a wrong he felt a marginal pride and it was a long time since he had stood tall with himself her fingers squeezed for a moment at his arm as if to transmit comfort she was gone and the doors closed behind her he walked in the dusk to hams car almost dark outside he reckoned hard to be certain because the windows were on the far side of the library area and so thick and tinted the girls were hurrying for their coats and there was a babble of talk from them and penny smiled at him as she loaded her bag and the one who sat nearest his table scowled at him and shed have a plenty big enough problem scrubbing chocolate off her blouse the supervisor challenged him working late mr carter he smiled sweetly never was one for watching a clock youre not supposed to be here with the night shift only once in a while i doubt ill attack them what was damnable was that he had finished his sandwiches and emptied his thermos dry it shouldnt be a habit mr carter oh this came for you the supervisor handed him a fax message thank you it was always the same when the night shift came on there was hardly a civil word between the day shift and the night shift capitalism and communism chalk and cheese and the whitter nfthe night shift girls was around him complaining about the state of the desks left for them the state of the rubbish bins the state of the carpets he started to read the fax sometimes the bickering criticism amused him that evening henry cartel found it

fear of failure drove those young men across those hideous front lines he knew because he had stood on the safe side and waited for them to come back so it was the map that mattered the map supplied by this unstable unreliable creature he breathed hard dont fuck about on me squire ham whispered get on with it he steadied himself eased his weight forward on the side of the inflatable the noise of the great kupa river was an engine idling far away to his right down river a single small light shone the deep dark water of the river was behind him but close was the fast sluicing sound as the current broke around the paddle manoeuvred by ham to hold the craft steady penn reached back his fingers felt down hams arm to his hand the palm of his hand wrapped over hams fingers on the paddle and when im back then ill go find them find them and tell them that you love them just come back with your balls still under your belly the bloody map ham its a good map the only bloody map youll ever get on your way squire his boots were hung by the laces round his neck his socks were knotted at his throat he hesitated if the map was no good if the bastard had drawn the map wrong if he could not follow the map if the map the fist caught him on the shoulder the fist pushed him off the side of the inflatable he splashed in the water his bared toes sunk in the slime mud and the fallen weed panic time he reached back for the side of the inflatable to steady himself but the paddle was into his ribs the drive of the paddle propelled penn towards the bank that was the dark mass ahead of him the backpack caught his head and landed on the bank above him he struggled forward stumbling through the mud he groped for the bank and the tree branches were in his face and he grasped at them and they broke and then he had a better hold he dragged himself through the reeds and up the bank his hands caught at the shoulder straps of the backpack he sagged he could see the inflatable moving out towards the main flow of the river a shadow shape and the quick flash of the paddles breaking water he watched the inflatable all the time that he could see it and when he could no longer see it he searched for it penn wiped his feet with the sleeve of the tunic he drew on the thick wool socks he laced the boots he threaded his arms through the straps of the backpack he was in dorries place the silence and the black darkness were ahead of him the silence was good he was at ease in silence he could be silent with himself and jane would have thought him sulking had been able to absorb silence from the childhood days when his mother had taken him to the church in the village where she worked the swab cloth on the flagstones and tidied after the ladies had taken down the flower arrangements silence was safety and it nestled around him he had come to domes war penn pushed himself up started forward ten it was as ham had told him penn had moved on his stomach up from the river bank trying to insert himself between the reeds where they were most thick to spread his weight was what ham had told him and not to walk where it was easiest where boot marks could be most clearly seen he had moved up the bank and there had been the open space that he assumed was a path and he had rolled across the space which was difficult with the backpack and the pistol on his waist had bruised into his stomach past the open space the path he had found as ham had told him he would a single low strand of barbed wire he had found it because the barbs on the wire had suddenly trapped him become embedded in the material of his camouflage tunic ham had told him that he should not shake the wire because it would carry empty tin cans and he should not go beyond the wire because it marked the perimeter of an area where mines were buried he had a sort of reassurance when the barbs of the wire caught at him proof that ham knew he had picked the barbs off with small and careful movements then crawled in the darkness along the length of the wire threading the wire through the circle he had made with his thumb and forefinger until his hand was a mess of blood from the barbs he led himself on his stomach along the length of wire until his hand felt the post and then the twine binding the wire to the post from the post the wire twisted in direction and headed back and away from the river behind him it was as ham had told him another path going away from the river and he had searched for a small stick as he had been told to do and he had held the stick loose in front of him as he had walked at the side of the path ham had said that he should be at the side of the path because the mud that would betray his boot weight would be in the centre of the path he had held the stick loose in front of his knees because ham had said but didnt know that there might be a tripwire slung across the path at knee height and a tripwire might rattle empty cans or it might detonate a grenade it was as ham had told him penn stopped when he reckoned he had gone a full hundred yards from the river bank when he had stopped he groped with his fingers and found the barbed wire that ran two strides from the path and he followed the barbed wire deep into the birch wood he had sat down on the old leaf mould and waited they were desperate hours to wait especially when the rain had started the rain dripped from his head to his chest and his shoulders he tried to ration how often he looked down at the luminous hands of his watch should have rested should have catnapped as ham had told him but he could not have slept and could not have dozed he reckoned he heard each dribble and splatter of the rain coming down from the tall birches and each minuscule shifting of his weight where he sat seemed a confined explosion of sound he waited for the dawn the dawn was late because of the low cloud the dawn coming late meant that he would have to push faster when he moved off when he could see where the weight of his boots would fall then it was the time for him to move forward there was no going back there was no inflatable waiting at his bank of the kupa river there was no alternative to moving forward there was nothing in his mind of sentimental crap staying alive was going forward as ham had told him the most dangerous part of the journey for him was the first five miles and the worst of the most dangerous ground was what he would cover in the first mile he tried to razor his concentration the first mile was where the minefields were most closely settled where the tripwires were where the military ruled the first five miles were where the patrols would be most frequent it was the fucking contradiction was what ham had said that he must move most carefully in the first miles and move fastest when he could see the path penn hoisted the backpack onto his shoulders and went forward not running not jogging but going with a brisk pace when he had gone half a mile twelve minutes going on thirteen he realized the futility of the map drawn by ham he had no detail the farmhouse was not marked on the map the farmhouse was twostorey brickbuilt from the ground up and then heavyset planking for the upper floor there was a wide balcony area at the front on the upper floor he could see the man clearly the man on the balcony did not bother to look out to wonder if he were watched the man opened the front of his trousers and urinated through the bars of the balcony and down onto the waste ground near to the front door of the farmhouse and then penn saw the woman nightdress under her coat and above her black rubber boots and she had the washing basket on the ground beside her and was starting to peg out the clothes a bloody early start for the old house chores and she bawled penn heard her voice full of rich complaint and was near enough then to see the man scratch and ignore her and yawn and stretch and belch and still ignore the beat of her complaint and turn to go back inside penn moved on each time that he stopped he tried to be certain that he was against the line of a thicker birch trunk as ham had told him never to be in silhouette never to be the unnatural shape and sound and smell and shine could bloody wait it was silhouette and shape that mattered at the back of the farmhouse were outbuildings and barns a mess of slumped roofs and corrugated iron and abandoned harvest equipment and the corrals for cattle and pigs and sheep parked up amongst them were three military lorries and a jeep he could no longer see the front of the farmhouse but the womans yelling carried to him and there were new cries of encouragement and jeers from young troops so young half asleep and paddling around in the mud the troops but they had their rifles slung on their halfdressed bodies hesitation to move or not to move but the light was growing all the time none of the training on the five surveillance courses seemed relevant he had only his instincts to protect him and the guidance that ham had given him and the instinct and the guidance seemed damn all of nothing going so carefully tree to tree along the track and knowing that if the movement were seen holy shit going carefully one of the troops a freshfaced young boy a straggle of beard on his chin walked purposefully from the barns and up the field towards the track carried his rifle and a small entrenching spade and three dogs gambolled and chased around him penn had to move because the line that the trooper had taken would cross the track ahead of where he now stood he had to risk the movement going forward fast too fast going from tree to tree spurt rushes just a boy coming up the hill behind the outbuildings probably a shy boy probably looking for a place where a shy boy could dig his small pit and defecate and not be watched there was a terrier dog and a crosscollie dog and there was a big slow heavycoated dog his last surge and the terrier had its hackles up and the crosscollie barked and the heavycoated dog didnt seem to know what the hell was happening the boy was twenty paces from him slow hands trembling feeling into the flap of the backpack twisting his arm round finding the paper holding the sandwiches that ham had given him ham had said there was cheese and beef and pickle in the sandwiches the terrier growling as the boy dug slow hands clumsy un peeling the newspaper from the sandwiches the crosscollie barking as the boy lowered his trousers and the rifle was beside him penn put the sandwiches gently to the ground on the wet dead leaves the heavycoated dog wagging its tail in vigour penn understood dogs because that was his childhood dogs had poor eyesight but had the sense of smell and the sense of hearing they came close it was his luck that the boy had his crouched back to him they were close and he looked into the sharp teeth lines of the terrier and the barking fangs of the crosscollie and the happy friendship of the heavycoated dog with his boot he edged the sandwiches closer to them he went on his toes he went in silence and behind him was the snarling for possession of his sandwiches penn went with his chest heaving and his legs leaden and his heart pounding he went and all the time that he moved he waited for the shout and the metal scrape of the rifle being armed but he heard only the dogs disputing for his sandwiches when he had gone past the farmhouse where the troops who guarded the front line were billeted he looked back the boy was walking down towards the farmhouse and with his bowels cleared the boy whistled he wondered whether he could have knifed the boy just a shy boy just a pack of farm dogs and penn understood what ham had told him a fucking dumb place to be he made ground went hard had to cover good distance before the daylight settled it was a response to the rejection the rejection was of him not his wife which made it wound the more for his wife there was normality in salika village she was the nurse she could still move amongst the people of the village visit the elderly examine the children weigh the babies while her husband stayed at home with his books and his loneliness each of the days that she had gone out since his challenge at the school and his beating the headmaster had asked her what was said of him how he was spoken of she had thought she too would be rejected and she was not his wife could go into the homes of the village and talk gossip advise and drink coffee and she answered him straight always had spoken to him in frankness since the youth of their marriage simply nothing was said of him it was as if she had said the night before and that morning as she hurried his breakfast he did not exist in the life of the village his wife had gone to visit the two sisters who suffered from rheumatoid arthritis to offer them comfort instead of drugs that were no longer available he was alone in his house he was with his loneliness and the books that he could read when he held them as far as his arm would stretch in front of his face and when he sat close to the light of the window the headmaster believed there were two women and one man who had cared about him and the two women and the one man had now rejected him evica stankovic had taken over the running of the school and used his office as her own the priest had missed another evening when he might have called by to counter the agony of his rejection the headmaster determined that morning when there was still insufficient light for him to sit in his window and read that he should pray to the good god if the good god was there he did not believe that the good god was known to his former friend the priest who rejected him their bond had been intellectual not religious he resolved that he would struggle in his own way to find the necessary words of prayer he was a communist of course and he would not have been elevated to the headmasters position if he had not been a member of the party he did not know the way of prayer his mother and his father dead so long knew of prayer and he would try to summon the memory of them he would go in darkness to that place of evil he would pray alone where evil had been done he would pray in that place of evil for guidance as to how he should utilize the secret he held if they had not been sitting on the track if they had not been squabbling over cigarettes if they had not been scuffling for the bottle penn would have walked into the patrol into the arms of the five militia men but they were sitting on the track and one yelled as he snatched the cigarettes and one shouted as he grabbed the bottle first statue still rock still stone still then retreating back along the track cat careful cat cautious he edged back up the track from them testing each footfall looking behind him to be certain there was no dried wood that he might step on he slunk away from the track and into the depth of the trees and he lowered his weight down slowly and then he knelt and then he lay on his stomach and there was a thick bush of holly between himself and the track he heard their laughter and their cursing they were moving again coming to that part of the track closest to where he lay not daring to move he could have been pitching up for work at alpha security first in and climbing the stairs to the office above the launderette he could have been hearing the wail as the shutters went up on the shops beside the launderette he could have been going to work with the smell of jane on him and the taste of toms food from the kiss on the cheek he could have been going in to collect the legal process to serve or going in from the nighttime watch on a husbands cheating or going in to meet a builder whose competition knew the contracts he was bidding for not daring to move and seeing the young faces of the militia men ham hadnt told him what to do if he were bounced ham hadnt been through the capture bit each one of them had a knife at his belt they went by him close enough for him to see that they went off down the track he had almost walked into them he felt a true excitement the excitement was an exhilaration truth was that he had never before known such excitement the blood pumped in him they wouldnt have known what he meant about the excitement at alpha security how it coursed in him and lifted him the excitement was danger they wouldnt have known what he meant in a branch the excitement was his own he would move for another hour and then rest up till the dusk nothing i can do for you mr jones its the pressure of space the danish woman in administration property deflected him we all have our little crosses mr jones better we learn to accept them and live with them the libyan man in administration headquarters put him down cant help you mr jones my good fortune i dont have a dog in that fight the canadian man in administration finance moved him on its sardine time here mr jones youre lucky to have whats been allocated you without sharing the swiss woman in the civilian affairs office central directorate dismissed him the question is one of protocol mr jones protocol dictates container accommodation as suitable for your work the ethiopian man in the civilian affairs office deputy director was contemptuous you people your job your end game it pisses me off mr jones if i put it bluntly then perhaps youll understand me better the irish man in the civilian affairs office director kept a pleasant smile and spat through his teeth it had taken marty all morning to get that far he had been shuffled up the ladder and with each putdown he could have tossed in the towel and gone back to the ovenlike container on the far side of the parade ground at the ilica barracks but not that morning no sir there was a big photograph on the wall of the office of the director of civilian affairs the photograph was labelled as co cork where god comes to holiday the director liked to show the photograph to his visitors show them where he was reared and where his parents still lived marty thought the seascape of cliffs and the atlantic was secondrate compared to the mountains and fiords of alaska he had not come to talk about co cork he had come to demand better accommodation for his work than a pressure cooker steaming goddamn freight container he had been told outside by the willowy german secretary to the director that there was no possibility of entry without an appointment and when the meeting inside had broken he had simply elbowed his way inside sat down challenged for attention you your work mr jones is an obstruction to what we attempt to achieve i want a proper room i am integral to the united nations effort in former yugoslavia i want decent accommodation while he had waited outside there had been a multinational bicker in the english language between the secretaries with german swiss french scandinavian and indian accents about desk space he had filed an affidavit the last evening from an eyewitness who had seen prisoners of the serbs beheaded by a chainsaw rome was not built in a day that sort of crap but sure as hell the un empire was putting in a spirited challenge he had transferred to disk the statement the last evening of an eyewitness who had seen a man castrated after a cable had been tied between a motorcycle and his scrotum and the motorcycle had been ridden away and the man had died from blood loss the secretaries had air conditioning and they had window light his work was pissed on the goddamn secretaries were looked after and he was not i am a busy man mr jones so do me the favour of bugging out of here and going back to your quite adequate work area a dog couldnt work in there but he was an anchorage boy anchorage bred them stubborn what he had learned from twentytwo months in new york turning round paper on member nations subscription debts and what he had learned in zagreb had given him a deeprunning hostility to the fastcreated empire they had the good apartments and the good allowances and the good life while marty jones survived in a stinking hot goddamn oven maybe a dog would be doing something more useful than your war crimes shit let me tell you a few facts of life young man war crimes talk is just a sedative for the poor punters outside of here whove joined the cant we do something brigade there will be no war crimes tribunal you may want to jerk yourself off each night at the thought of milosevic karadic mladic arkan or seselj standing in the dock without a tie or a belt or shoe laces it wont happen like it or not and dont patronize me by thinking i like it it c nnot happen because i need those bastards and all the rest of the grubby little murderers that walk this godforsaken corner of earth i need them to sign a peace treaty for bosnia then a peace treaty for occupied croatia and im not going to get them to sign if theres a sniff of handcuffs in the wind then you give the world over to anarchy intolerable anarchy i need a lesson from you where have you been you have been fucking nowhere peace between egypt and israel if the brit buggers were still hammering for begin to be tried for terrorism for sadat to be tried for making war peace in namibia if half the south african defence force were to be wheeled in front of a court on genocide charges i know reality because i have faced reality your argument is morally bankrupt he faced the big grossset irishman he would screw him down screw him down hard if the opportunity ever came his way screw him down so that he screamed and your office is a converted freight container so fuck off back there marty went back in the sunlight across the parade ground back to his video and audio tapes and his computer disks the gravedigger stevo had been on the expedition to the church at glina but it was not personal to him it was personal to milan stankovic and the postman branko and the carpenter milo but not to him because no one from his family had died in the fire of the church they were ahead of the buses it was usual for milan to have a car when he needed it and the fuel to go with it before the war before the rise of milan they would all have been on the buses for the annual journey to the church at glina since the war the gravedigger had not been able to make the particular long journey that was personal to him his own mother and father had been murdered in the crveni krst concentration camp that had been sited at nis near to belgrade he knew that milan and he was grateful that milan had tried had last year attempted to arrange the long journey for him but there had been shelling on the road that week near to brcko and all traffic had been halted his father had died in the big breakout february from the camp at nis machinegunned against the wall by the croat ustase guards and his mother had died at the hands of the croat ustase killing squads on the hill called bubanj that was near to nis where a thousand were killed each day and they were buried now together amongst the trees on the hill called bubanj the buses would be far behind them now and the old mercedes with in excess of kilometres on the clock powered them home he knew it was not the ceremony at the ruin of the church that affected milan it was not the ceremony and the prayer and the singing of the anthem and the reciting of the poem of the battle of kosovo that left milan sullen and quiet because he had been that way for too many days since the digging in the field at the end of the lane in rosenovici and the others in the car had taken the bastard mood from milan stankovic and because it was not personal to him where they had been the gravedigger stevo thought it right to break that bastard mood he leaned forward the radio in the car played faint and r distorted and the singer was simonida with the onestring gusla to back her he tapped milans shoulder milan i love you milan if you were dead i would dig the best hole for you milan why are you now such a miserable bastard the gravedigger thought he could break the mood with mischief milan you are a miserable bastard you are a miserable bastard to be with if you want me to milan i will go and dig a hole as deep as i can dig it so that i have to chuck the earth up over my shoulder and you can go and lie in the hole and i will chuck the earth back on top of you and that might cure you of being such a miserable bastard he had reached forward and his fingers worked at milans shoulders like he used to see the postmans fingers brankos at milans shoulders when he loosened him before a big match of basketball milan you are a miserable bastard to be with and you make everyone else a miserable bastard look at us we are all miserable because you are a miserable bastard and the man pulled himself forward and broke the gravediggers hold on his shoulders and he thought he could play milan because he had the sort of black humour that would make milan laugh the gravedigger was on the crest and he could not see milans face if he had seen it he might have sat back into the seat let the springs tickle his arse but he could not see it you know why you are such a miserable bastard milan you are a miserable bastard because you are scared the gravedigger could not see milans face and he could not see his hands you are scared have been scared since that old american came and farted over at rosenovici why are you scared then he saw milans face he saw the erupted anger he saw the hands and he saw the pistol the face was against his bright red and flushed one hand coming past his eyes and locking into his old straggled hair and pulling his head forward one hand holding the pistol and driving it through his teeth grating them until the foresight ground against the roof of his mouth and he had seen milan kill and he could not doubt that milan would kill and he had seen a bastard ustase killed by a bullet fired from a pistol deep in the mouth and seen the crown of the head where the hair was thinning lift off and the postman had swerved the car gone half into a ditch and come out and the carpenter cowered away against the far window of the back of the car and the anger was gone the foresight of the pistol scraped the roof of the gravediggers mouth and against his teeth and nicked at his lip and the smile was there as if milan was saying that he was not scared stevos mouth was raw agony and he could feel already the wet of his trousers at the crutch he did not tell milan that he thought he lied with his smile he squirmed in the wetness that he sat in laughing we should go get the hag in rosenovici lie up for her like it was wild pig we were lying up for milan you miserable bastard you should be with us but the shoulders had ducked down and he could not see the face whether it still smiled whether it was still angered for the old american had come to rosenovici and milan stankovic ran scared the map had shown the escarpment of high rock in the trees it was where he had found the small torn shreds of the chewing gum wrapper and he recognized the brand name of the wrapper and he knew that ham had been there as ham had said he had there was a field of winter grass below the escarpment on which he lay he could see the trails across it and the flattened grass in the middle he could not see blood but ham had said he would not be able to see the blood it was clear in penns mind and the clarity killed the excitement that had been with him through the length of the day he looked down onto the flattened ground where two men wounded had been skewered with knives and he looked down onto the trails in the field where the bodies of two men had been dragged and no point in further thinking on it the flattened grass and the trails in the grass and ham had not talked of the risk of capture penn moved down from the escarpment down again into the depth of the trees the shadows were longer the grey merged with the falling gold of the evening he had slept just during the length of the day when he had rested up he had eaten a pie and not yet missed his sandwiches it was two hours back that he had left his resting place through the day a shelter made by an uprooted oak he had slept just then woken at the sound of childrens voices but they had not come near him penn checked the map when he had reached the base of the escarpment rock there was a plan a fragile plan in his mind a better man a special forces man would not have moved across the damned river without a solid plan locked in his head he did not have that training the plan grew he would get to the village of rosenovici he would walk at night along the route where they had taken dorrie where she had been he would walk past the house where katica dubelj had lived he would look for her in her house and only there nowhere else that he knew to look it would only be a gesture to look for katica dubelj because he did not think she would speak english and he knew nothing of her language he would find the disturbed grave in the corner of the field it would be right for his report that he had walked the road through rosenovici and along the lane and into the field it would be important for his report that he had gone to seek out katica dubelj it was not good enough for penn that he should take a name from a telephone directory and embroider a story basil would have said he was a fool not to flick the pages of a directory jane would have said he was an idiot dougal gray who had been his friend in the transit van would have understood with the plan he reckoned it possible that he could look back into the eyes of mary braddock see her respect and take her husbands money he could tell them that he had walked where dorrie had been he moved away slower than before he had come to the escarpment before he had seen the flattened grass and the trails in the grass he thought he could move for another two hours before darkness came im so sorry to trouble you tell me please is the crossing point at turanj open ulrike schmidt sat in her office the transit centre was awash with the noise of shouting screaming laughing the evening cooking smells filtered to her her assistant a nice ghanaian girl but happily scatty stared across from her own desk confused ulrike had never before rung the liaison office with the request for information as to whether the turanj crossing point was open and her assistant knew it thank you but could you please make certain yes ill hold she was thirtynine years old she held the telephone like a conspirator like a teenage girl who spoke by telephone to a teenage boy and did not wish to be heard when she went home every two months for a weekend back to munich and the apartment near the hauptbahnhof then her mother and father told her of their pride and her mother each time on the one evening that she was at home before they went to dinner in a restaurant would sidle into her room and ask her nervous question it was difficult to be truthful and more difficult not to be truthful no she had no plans no there was not a particular man it was difficult to be truthful because her mothers face would cloud and the question would not be repeated the answer always was followed by the breezy excuse that life was too hectic work too ferocious to share there were flowers and there were invitations but there was no particular man definitely the crossing point is open you have heard nothing about it being closed tomorrow no thank you it was just a rumour i am so sorry to have troubled you good night she put down the telephone and her assistant was watching her puzzled ulrike blushed she gave no explanation if she had given her assistant an explanation truth then the girl might just have climbed onto the central table in the office where the computer was and danced her assistant was scatty enough but the truth was that a man she cared about was behind the lines across the river in the place where the stories came from of atrocity and bestiality and torture she cared because he took a road that was different from the turned cheek and the fixed smile the truth was that if a man had been captured behind the lines then the border crossing at turanj would have been closed the serbs always closed the crossing point when they discovered incursion into their territory if the crossing was still open then he stayed free it was the end of the day and the end of the map there was a brisk rain shower falling into the upper branches of the trees the last of the light showed penn where he should spend the night no mines laid off the track because there were tractor ruts and the tread of worn trailer tyres a small tin hut had been abandoned beside the clumsy heaps of cut wood and penn judged it was where the timber men sheltered from heavy rain and where they made their coffee and ate their food the men who came to the hut would be the same as the timber men on the estate of his childhood who had talked with him and amused him and they would kill him if they found him too dark for him to move further and the hut was the final point on hams map he squatted down in the hut then curled onto his side closed his eyes in six hours three at dawn and three at dusk he had covered twelve miles according to hams map it was important that he should sleep ham had said that where the map ended was six miles from rosenovici perhaps seven but not more he would go forward blind in the first light of the morning she was old and ham could not afford a girl she was old enough and cheap enough to look for trade in the side streets off the square behind the big earth ramparts of karlovac it was usual for her trade to be with the muslim men of the transit centre ham did not know her he had not been with her before it didnt matter to him that she was old but it was important that she was cheap chicken shit pay from the army and the slimmest cut left in his pocket from selling on the imported cigarettes she had to be cheap he lay on the bed he could see she was old from the single unshaded bulb hanging down from the ceiling and he could see the flab ridges of her waist after she had unbuttoned her blouse and the wide weight of her buttocks after she had peeled down her knickers she smoked while she undressed not the imported cigarettes that he handled but the loose filled sort that came from the factory in zagreb he had heard a child cry out in the night from behind a closed door and she had shouted back at the child when she was naked the prostitute straddled ham on the bed heavy above him and her last gesture before earning the money that she had whipped from his hand and buried in her bag was to reach across him and grind out her cigarette he tried to think of his karen it was always best when he closed his eyes and thought of karen but he could not find her in his mind the pillow sunk below his head she felt for him opening his trousers he could not find karen in his mind he saw the thin and faded wallpaper of the room on the sixth floor of the block on mihovilica that was away from the old walls of karlovac and near to the river and the bridge that carried the main road to zagreb and there was a narrow framed picture not straight of the crucifixion and there were a childs plastic toys on the floor near to the chair where discarded clothes had been dumped the bed heaved as she worked harder with her fingers couldnt help her couldnt respond to her couldnt think of karen because the bed heaved iron springs screaming the child behind the closed door cried out again and the woman ignored her child her face was above him she had the waist of his trousers down to his knees and his pants pulled back and he could not respond to her there was contempt at the womans mouth she had already been paid and her interest was going couldnt think of karen he could only think of penn he had checked at the operations centre before going out of the barracks in the old police station casual questions was it all quiet over there any balloons going up over there bored answers it was all quiet over there just a sniper two rounds near the milk factory that was across the river where they had the salient nothing else he was thinking of penn and penn should now be at the end of the map because that was the schedule drawn for him and penn should now be holed up in the woodcutters hut the shiver came to him and he thought of penn who was alone and the thought shrivelled him the big mouth with the thick lipstick rim hovered above ham and he could not turn the face and the bagged eyes and the greyflecked hair into the face of his karen and the big mouth with the thick lipstick rim curled at him in disgust because he could not respond he hit her he smacked with a closed fist into the side of her face faces replacing the pain in hers the face of the barman that he had punched in the bar at cullyhanna because the barman had backchatted the patrol he was hitting her with both fists belting feverishly into the flab lines of her stomach the face of the irish sales representative who had jogged his arm spilled his pint in the pub in aldershot put on the floor with the fag ends and the beer puddle and kicked she was off the bed and whimpering in the corner crouched among the clothes she had dropped the face of karen when he had belted her when shed cried when shed packed when shed gone out of the front door with her bag and his dawn all the faces fleeting gone penns face stayed he pulled up his pants and his trousers ham left the door of the bedroom open behind him and the door of the apartment and the woman whimpered and the child cried he jogged down the stairs ham thought only of penn and his fear the compliment that benny stein would not have recognized was that he was the most popular the most revered the most talked about driver in the aid convoy team sponsored by the british crown agents going off through those bloody awful people through their bloody awful villages was not worth thinking of without benny stein to humour them along the seddon atkinson his lorry was loaded full eight tons of wheat flour yeast sugar and seed and now the damn tricky girl was playing up on transmission the only one of fifteen seddon atkinsons in the lorry park that was contrary two engineers worked with benny stein to get the tricky girl road worthy for the morning and two more of the drivers had come back after their hotel dinner to the lorry park out by the zagreb airport to see if the tricky girl would ride in the morning across the turanj crossing point and down through sector north and on into sector south if it had stood up and slapped his face benny stein would not have recognized a compliment but it was one hell of a big compliment to him that two engineers were prepared to work as long as it took through the night to get the tricky girl road worthy and two of the other drivers had come the long drag out of the city centre to check how they were doing past midnight and the convoy manager had joined them to peer down into the exposed engine space and leaning forward behind the convoy manager was the convoy administration manager quite a crowd to get the tricky girl road worthy not that benny stein longdistance lorry driver overweight middleaged stubbed height shiny bald head that was alive with oil smears would have noticed an aid convoy going down through sector north and on into sector south might not be safe if benny stein wasnt in the line might not be fun when the transmission was fixed when hed gunned the engine when hed driven round the lorry park lunatic fast when hed crashed the gears done the emergency stops when hed put the tricky girl through the hoops benny stein pronounced himself satisfied he tried not to think of the past but to concentrate on the present the image of the fox was the past penns present was each footfall of ten strides then the listening and the silence then the moving again he could not kill the image of the fox the present was going forward in the dawn and he had slept too poorly to have wanted to eat before there was enough light for him to leave the timber mens hut and he counted himself lucky that the rain showers that had beaten on the tin roof of the hut had been cleared by the wind hams map was finished and the map bought in the shop in karlovac was too small a scale to help him with much beyond the lines of the roads he could get a rough bearing from the early movement of the sun and that was sufficient to guide him he was deep in the woods and going well but always there was the prickle of nervousness at his back the past was the image of the fox there had been chickens inside a walled and roofed wire cage at the bottom of the tied cottages garden it had been his job through his childhood each evening to feed the chickens and to collect the eggs it was easy enough for a fox to approach the cage to sniff the wire mesh of the cage but approaching the cage sniffing the cage didnt fill the gut of the fox the fox had to find a way through the wall of the cage scratch back the loose seams of the wire dig frantically under the wire chew at the frame of the door if the fox were not to go hungry and scratching digging chewing aroused the frightened screams of the chickens it was easy enough to get close but the bloody awful bit for the fox was doing the business with the cackle of the chickens came his father with the shotgun and the dogs from the shed and the big flashlight from the shelf beside the kitchen door three foxes were killed near the chickens cage during his childhood two shot by his father when caught in the flashlight one trapped by the dogs against the panel fence by the fruit bushes one fox had made it in it was the night when his father and his mother had taken him to the pantomime in chippenham a foul wet night and before the expedition to chippenham he had fed the chickens fast under the rain and not latched properly the gate frame not hooked the chain onto the bent nail penn couldnt count on it that the frame door to rosenovici would have been left open it was easy enough for him to get there but when he roused the chickens but he was trying not to think of the past penn could hear the sounds of tractors he had been going along the side of a hill that was close set with trees he had no path to guide him no trail he could move well and quietly on the mat of damp leaves he was drawn forward towards the engine sounds of tractors suddenly he was looking into the valley there had been a fine rock in front of him weathersmoothed and lichencoated and the rock had blocked the valley from him past the rock and he saw the valley there was a stream going fast well swollen that cut the valley into halves two tractors worked in the grass fields on the far side of the stream from him and both pulled old laden manure spreaders the fields on his side of the valley were unworked and weeded up he saw the contrast and he understood his eyes tracked the progress of the stream past a pool where the water ran slower with the white spume giving way to dark depths and he thought it would be a place for trout beyond where the tractors heaved out manure there were cultivated strips and he saw women working dark shapes in the early morning mist wrapped in thick coats against the cold and bent over hoes and forks on his side of the stream there were no cultivated strips no women nothing planted his eyes moved on attracted to the soft colours further down the valley the apple trees were in blossom there were cattle grazing across the stream and children played amongst routing pigs and a dog drove sheep along a track and it was all on the far side of the stream yes he understood he saw the smoke climbing from the chimneys of the village across the stream and when he squinted his eyes and shaded them from the low sun he could see the shape of the houses and the block of the church and the brightness of flowers he saw a car pass another car his gaze roved across from salika over a linking bridge rested on the twin village that was his side of the stream he saw at first the mirror image then the reality came the broken church the small houses without roofs the foliage of brambles and nettles growing high in a lane it was difficult for him at that distance more than a mile to see the detail of rosnovici but he saw that one village lived and one village had died and at the edge of his vision blurred by mist coming off the dew on the grass he thought he saw a greyblack scar in a corner of the field that was immediately before the village that had died a cock pheasant faced him he saw nothing that was danger the valley was at gentle peace he knew the fox would have thought the chickens cage was a place of gentle peace until the birds screamed and the gun came and the dogs were loosed it was where dorrie mowat had been and where dorrie mowat had been knifed and bludgeoned and shot to death the cock pheasant rose up on its clawed feet beat its wings shouted the warning he looked again across the stream to the ruin of rosenovici he had taken the money and when he had taken the money he had given his commitment he wanted to earn his own pride he sat in the shadow of the big rock where he could see down the valley where he would wait through the day when he could no longer see the apple blossom and when the tractors had driven back to the living village and when the women had trudged home and the children then he would move again and work his way under the cover of coming darkness towards the village that had died he wanted to make a report that would earn his own pride the cock pheasant careered away in noisy flight down the length of the valley at gentle peace eleven so nearly first would have come the crows and after the crows had taken carrion there would have come magpies and jays and after magpies and jays there would have been rats and after the rats there would have been crawling insects and the worms would have come for the final feast the jaws seemed to laugh at penn the eye sockets seemed to stare at him he had so nearly stepped on the skull two winters and a summer he thought had given every chance for the birds rodents insects and worms to strip the flesh and muscle and tissue from the face of the skull the mouth leered the eye sockets challenged him walking a pace to the side of the track in the late afternoon halflight under the tree canopy his foot poised to drop and take his weight he had seen the skull in the leaves and brambles the skeleton was lying on what had been its stomach but the head was twisted as if the final living movement had been the attempt to see the killing danger behind the skeleton was clothed in a long darkbrown overcoat and there were trousers that had also not rotted but he could see the bones at the ankles above the shoes because the man had not worn socks and he could see also the bones of the hands still clasping a farm sack of rough hessian he was in the tree line going towards rosenovici and he could see down through into the trees and into the quiet calm of the valley and therewas a golden light settled on the valley he had no business with it the knowledge could not help him but he bent and he took the finger bones from the neck of the sack and they came away easily inside the sack stuffed in were the clothes of basic winter necessity what a man could carry for himself and for his woman he saw it in his mind the moment when someone in the doomed village had claimed there was a window of opportunity for flight and frightened men and women had jumped for the window taken what they could carry and tried to smuggle themselves through the perimeter lines of their enemy he wondered if dorrie mowat had seen this man go wondered if she had wished him well wondered if she had kissed him or if she had hugged him wondered if she had told him that she would stay he had so nearly stepped on the skeleton of the man who had been at the head of the fleeing column when he went forward edging his way he found the others all skeletons all dressed against the cold the skeletons lay in a straggled line there were the remains of women and of children and of babies there were bulging suitcases of rotted cardboard and decaying imitation leather that were tied shut with farm twine there were more hessian sacks there were the heavy plastic bags that had once held agricultural fertilizer he counted a dozen skeletons in all in the cases and sacks and bags he found the necessities of survival clothes and childrens favourite toys and the small framed pictures of christ in calvary he supposed a machine gun had taken them traversing some would have run forward at the first explosion of shooting and some would have frozen still and some would have tried to go back last in the line was a tall woman and he could see that her body wore three dresses and there was a bag beside her where she had dropped it and each hand still held a small swaddled bundle and the bone of the third finger of her left hand was amputated where her wedding ring would have been he understood what she had carried what in her death she had not let go of because the two small skulls were close to her boots he wondered if dorrie had known them if dorrie had kissed and hugged the babies if dorrie had told the mother why she would stay to the end with the wounded he felt no hatred because his mind was chilled no fear because his mind was numbed he went forward he had walked half of the distance to the village that he must travel before darkness dorrie had been here in the valley and would have seen the tractors and the women and the animals and dorrie had stayed to the end she pulled him forward it was as if she had taken penns hand and there was mischief in her smile as if she taunted him as if she dared him to come closer to rosenovici he did not think there was anything in his life before that had been worthwhile she had captured him with her taunt beckoning with the laugh of her lips and cheeks that horrid young woman he would have loved her penn wanted to be near to rosenovici before darkness that angel he would have loved her he had put down the book because there was not enough light through the window for him to read more he was still cold the headmaster sat in his chair he was hunched bowed with a blanket of thick wool across his shoulders and he rubbed hard at his upper thighs to put warmth in them all through the day he had been cold his trousers soaked from the wading of the river at the ford that was not guarded by the scum boys of the militia could not be hung on the line to dry outside in the days spring sunshine it would have invited suspicion to have displayed his wet trousers for the village to see his shoes mudcaked could be left discreetly at the kitchen door because no one from the village now came to their house that much was guaranteed the plague was on his house but his trousers would have been seen from the road and his wife had not complained to him just laid them wet and filthy over the wood frame in front of the kitchen stove although he shivered he felt a sense of true liberation it had been good to pray in that place of evil kneeling in the mud crying silently for the forgiveness of them all he did not think it an idiocy which was what his wife had said it was that he had waded the ford to go to pray in that place of evil he made out a movement through the window the hurrying walk of villagers going towards the crossroads near the church he stood up from the chair and pressed his face against the cold glass and craned to see where the villagers went hurrying he saw the white jeeps stopped near the church and he saw in a blur the canadian policeman who had promised to bring him books for his school in return for the sharing of his secret and the political officer who was an educated man he felt his strength because he had prayed in that place of evil knelt in that muddied pit that shamed them all and he would wade the ford again that night ask again for their forgiveness pray again that the guilty would face harsh retribution he knew that some a few had the courage to stand up because he had heard it on the foreign radio there were some a few who had sheltered and hidden their neighbours croat or muslim there were some a few who had stood against the tide and shouted against the barbarism of the concentration camps and the killings and the digging of graves in the dark silence it was worth praying for harsh retribution for the guilty the headmaster climbed the stairs of his house it was right when he went to see the uncivpol canadian and the political officer that he should wear his suit we have a job to do and the job is mandated by the office of the secretary general of the united nations the political officer was finnish but it was many years since he had lived in the family home at ivalo up north by the arctic circle close to the russian border and many years since he had served in the offices of the foreign ministry down south in helsinki the political officer was a united nations man had been for seventeen years he did not know whether he had offended a particular dignitary whether he had made waves where oil should have been poured but following an investigation that he had led into the use of united nations facilities by the families of diplomats accredited to new york he had been shipped overseas his wifes home where she was with the children was new jersey his home where he was alone was the spa town of topusko perhaps it was his penance for digging too deep into claimed expenses that he was posted to topusko in sector north when you hinder me then you hinder the world it is a great conceit for a little man to hinder the humanitarian efforts of the world community the political officer had come to salika to offer what he called moral weight to the efforts of the canadian and kenyan police officers he used big language and he recognized that his words fell empty you should know mr stankovic that each obstruction of our work is logged and filed if i were in your position mr stankovic i would be unhappy that my actions had attracted so many reports go get the shit out of here he regarded the man as a brute the political officers training was in the quiet world of diplomats and bureaucrats and functionaries he assumed that he was regarded as a dull man at cocktails and poor company at the dinner parties of the social circuit but he believed himself to be a man of rectitude and decency because of what he believed himself to be any meeting with milan stankovic was personal pain and there were so many like men scattered among each valley of the area that he covered from the spa town of topusko the length of bosnia the width of croatia there had been atrocities and graves dug through the length and the width there were thousands of old women old men washedup debris on a shore who died alone for the want of a parcel of food brought in secrecy he made the point of calling this one by the title of mister little victories were hard to come by and mister stankovic always wore military fatigues we have the right of free access anywhere in this territory you go where i say only where i say i say you get the shit out nothing of his upbringing in ivalo had prepared him for confrontation with the likes of mr milan stankovic nor for the others similar to him who ruled over similar villages nothing of his short work in the foreign ministry in helsinki had prepared him nor anything in the hushed corridors beyond the secretary generals inner sanctum once a year after his posting to new york jogging with his wife and his three children at night in central park he had met such a beast seen a knife handed over his wallet and his credit cards from the pouch at his waist it had been his only experience of the beasts before coming to topusko but that beast had gone running for bushes and shadows and cover had not stayed in conceit to confront the weakness of him and his family he knew the headmaster by sight for conversation and he saw him coming up the road behind stankovic there was always a curious undressed look about a man without the spectacles that were habitual to him the headmaster had twice offered him a game of chess but there had never been the opportunity there were deep orangeblue bruises on the headmasters face and welt scars on his cheeks and the lower lip was split and angry we have a file on you mr stankovic that grows more thick each week i promise you from the depths of my heart that we are not stupid men we have the file the hand was on the holster fiddling for the locking button of the flap we have a file maybe you will be an old man when the file is presented to an examining magistrate you are one of those mr stankovic who tells me loudly that serbs and croats can never again live together i tell you never is a long time my experience mr stankovic those who shout loudest that there can never be reconciliation are those who hide the greatest guilt but the pistol was out of the holster the political officer rated his file as a puny weapon when set against the makharov pistol the pistol was armed the clatter of the metal parts seared at him for seventeen years he had believed in the power glory authority of the blue flag the reality was a loaded pistol on a village road there was a shout from beside the canadian policemans jeep a wiry little man in camouflage fatigues trying to peer past the bulk of the kenyans body and into the back of the jeep he said in his reports that went to the desk of the director of civilian affairs for onpassing to the secretariat in new york that there was so much cruelty so much fear and his power of intervention was so minimal milan stankovic was striding away towards the jeep and the headmaster had reached him my friend what happened to you the question of a fool the small piece of paper was put in his hand he was told it was a prescription for the lenses of spectacles we will have them made my promise we will bring them to you was it him that did that to you the question of an idiot the headmaster shrugged turned away they had the door of the jeep open and the canadian and the kenyan were blocked from intervention by the rifles he saw the bag lifted out and held high and passed to the hands of milan stankovic it was because of the bag that he had come to salika with the two policemen and the political officer had believed he possessed the seniority to argue his way through the roadblocks that curtained rosenovici the face of milan stankovic was in front of him and the face was contorted in hatred the white plastic bag was held up the three cartons of milk were tipped out and each one in turn was stamped on the three loaves of bread were kicked as footballs across the road and into the rainwater ditch and the cheese and the ham and the apples from the kitchens of the hotel at topusko where he had his room another failure failure was the reality of the power glory authority of the blue flag he had good control of his voice did not raise it what mr stankovic is a war crime the killing of the wounded after the finish of a battle is a war crime who mr stankovic is a war criminal the leader of the men who killed the wounded after the finish of a battle do you sleep well mr stankovic in your bed each night i add to the file get the shit out and stay out another failure the political officer could not see in the face of milan stankovic if there was guilt or shame or fear he hoped they came journeyed to the beast in the quiet of the night gnawed at him it was all he could hope for that the brutes face would one day quiver in guilt shame or fear one day he was losing time with the lost time came impatience penn wanted to be close up to rosenovici before the total darkness came down on the woodland of birches with the impatience came arrogance the wire line that marked the perimeter of the minefield ran away to his left and seemed to reach as far as the edge of the tree line if he were to skirt the mines going left then he estimated that he would have to break the cover of the trees and he reckoned there was still sufficient light for his movement to be seen he looked up to the right and the barbed wire stretched away to a rock wall to go round the minefield going right he would have to backtrack and then climb the cliff and that would be serious delay he wanted to be close up to rosenovici penn could see the evidence of the mines the trees were thinly spaced here as if they had been coppiced within the last five years and there was room for armoured personnel carriers or tracked vehicles to power between the tree stumps of the old harvesting the evidence of the mines was from their antennae it was his impatience and his arrogance that led him to step over the barbed wire line the antennae as far as penn could see were laid out in straight lines the antennae of the mines were eighteen inches high reaching to just below his knee cap penn had never been on a course not for a weekend and not for half an hour on mines it was pretty obvious to an impatient and arrogant man a man running late that the mines with the antennae were developed to catch the undersurface of a vehicle chassis if the wheels or tracks rolled clear he could step out briskly and ahead of him was better light to tell him that the last of the woodland was near there would be better light because a field was ahead and if the map of alija was correct if she had drawn it with accuracy then the village of rosenovici was beyond that field the minefield was no problem there was a quiet around him because the tractors were gone now and the harsh voices of the women and the shouting of the children was stilled penn in sight of the break of the tree line coming to the open greyness of the field saw the cat there had always been cats at the tied cottage semiwild and only fed in the worst of the winter penn knew cats it was a big brute with nothing handsome about it the cat was blackcoated but the white flash at its chest alerted penn to its advance penn stopped the cat was a distraction couldnt help but watch the cat and if he was distracted by the big brute then he might blunder in the dropping light against the fine khaki wires that were the antennae he stopped and the antennae wires motionless were squared about him the big brute came fast towards him the throaty growl of the cat called to him he could see its ribcage the cat crossed open ground a dozen paces from him and at the centre of the open ground was the spike of the antennas wire penn reckoned the cat would have been a household pet or a farmyard ratter and the cat had been abandoned in the flight from the village perhaps by one of those who now lay as skeletons deep in the woods the big brute hesitated because penn stood still he could see the knots and the burrs in the cats coat the throated growl had become a purring roar penn knew cats on the carpet floor of dead leaves there were no stones for him to throw at the cat unless he moved past an antenna wire he would not be in reach of a dried branch to throw at the cat he could not shout at the cat he was too close to salika down through the trees and across the river he could not shoot the cat with his browning mm automatic pistol penn knew the way of an abandoned cat that had found a friend the cat arched its back the purr riddled the wood a cat with a friend always wanted to show its pleasure by arching its back then finding a surface to rub against and the surface nearest the cat was the needlethin antenna of the mine penn cooed at the cat the back of the cat was against the antenna penn slipped to his knees and stretched out his hand and he murmured his love for the cat the antenna wavered as the vigour of the cat was arched against it ten pounds of high explosive in the mine below the antenna maybe twelve pounds enough high explosive to take the wheel off an armoured personnel carrier enough to immobilize a tracked vehicle penn urged the cat gently to come to him the cat left the antenna and the wire swayed like a dying metronome penns heart pounded the cat wary circled penn and there were antennae on either side of him and an antenna wire behind him he cooed murmured urged the cat to come to him again the high arch of the back again the fur bedded against the wire to his right the cat came to him one movement the cat was against his knee one chance the cat howled its pleasure if he missed the one moment the one chance penn thought the cat would sc udder out of his range and find an antenna wire to snuggle against penn grabbed the cat with two hands no friendship no love he held the cat tight the cat bit at his wrists and its back claws slashed at his upper arms penn held the cat as if his life depended on it as if his life rested on an antenna wire not being bent over he tramped in the last light past the antennae through the final trees going towards the field with the cat hacking and spitting at him he was through the minefield penn threw the cat hard away from him he stepped over the barbed wire strand the cat snarled as if its friendship had been betrayed and stayed back from him and there were no antennae for the cat to arch against all right you old bugger im sorry please dont do that to me again but i apologize the cat watched him he took a slice of ham from the paper bag in his backpack and tore it into quarters and flipped the meat towards the cat the cat dived for the food in front of penn was the field he could see the small wall of earth in the corner of the field he could make out just the outline of the broken roofs of the village and the jagged rise of the churchs tower it was what she would have seen where dorrie had been it was warm for the late afternoon benny stein sweated it was hard going getting the sacks of seed out of the back of the seddon atkinson lorry but best to be in there with the local knin coolies because that way their sticky fingers couldnt pilfer so bad best not to make it easy for them a pretty little town knin pity about the people and when theyd done the unloading then hed try to find the energy to climb the long zigzag road from the warehouse by the football pitch down on the river and get up to the old fortress above the town he was good at photography prided himself but the canon with the mm lens was back at the hotel in zagreb and if hed pulled out a camera up by the old fortress then the guns would have been raised and theyd have been bawling it was the people that spoiled knin and the people didnt seem to him to have any bloody gratitude for him hiking down their way with his lorry and fourteen others he sweated he heaved a sack of seed he brought it down from the tail of the seddy he carried it to the trailer they were good guys who worked with him good crack sweating gulping heh wasnt that the hun frau at turanj wasnt that the frau there a good guy packed in stockbroking to make five hundred quid a week driving a lorry into sector north too old benny you are for looking at skirt too bony for me the frau what was she there for a good guy a banker who had dropped out of gilts taken a money cut to run a truck into sector north getting fruity benny getting the hots she was waiting for a refugee bus you know what she had that look a lot of broads give me that look half hackneys broads most of palmers greens they have a sincere romantic problem cause of me i take cold baths i walk away from it too bloody complicated for me but she had love you know the argie one the tickle of laughter from the onetime banker and the onetime stockbroker benny recited an argentine gaucho named bruno once said there is something i do know a woman is fine and a sheep is divine but a llama is numero uno well you know what i mean perhaps shes got a big fellow a big nigbatt guy and shes pining theres not a refugee bus scheduled through today thats all he knew when the refugee buses came through refugees were something from benny steins past hed had his little laugh from the frau and he thought her the grandest woman he had ever met and when they were not driving nor doing maintenance then he would hitch a ride down to karlovac and head for the transit centre and his last project had been carpentry for the little desks and low stools of the kindergarten he understood about refugees because his grandparents had walked out of czechoslovakia fiftyfive years before and his father had walked with them and all they had owned was stacked in an old pram that they had pushed as they had walked hed thought looking at the fraus face that it wasnt just a bus arrival she waited for he had walked into a gate and he had ripped the shins of his trousers on fallen wire and he had cracked his knee on a dropped gravestone and he had been in the ditch it was black dark in the village and penn had a little chat to himself waspish it was imbecile to be padding about the ruin of the village in the black dark and he should get a better grip of himself slow down stop the charge do it like he had done it as a child when he had gone early in the morning into the top copse where the keeper bred the pheasant chicks in the summer and sat under the widespread oak and waited for first light when the sow brought her badger young from the sett going back to the basics of his life the only course where he had beaten the graduate intake into gower street had been the rural surveillance course and crawling up in the woods night so quiet that when he had put his hand from behind over amanda fawcetts mouth she had squealed and wet her jeans the only time he had won an instructors praise and amanda fawcett stuffy bitch with a out of sussex had had to wear her shirt tails outside her trousers for the rest of the morning and a fucking malicious grin shed given him on his last day coming out of administration when hed given in his id and amanda bloody fawcett graduate general intelligence group paper pusher wouldnt have made it a hundred yards off the river bank after the little chat to himself penn stood a long time quite still and he allowed the night sounds of the village to play around him the owls shout the whine of a swinging door the creak of a dislodged roof beam the motion of the stream against the piles of the bridge voices that were distant and brought on the wind he stood in what he thought had been a square and the only building clear to him by its size was the mass of the body of the church there were lamps lit in the windows of the houses across the stream where a community lived breathed and he could see sometimes a wavering torch on the move there was an occasional small beam thrown up from the bridge and it was from the bridge that he heard the young mens voices larking their boredom at guard duty he stood quite still he thought that when dorrie had crossed the road where he was now with the torn lengths of the womens clean clothes she would have had flares to light her way and there would have been buildings burning he could not see the farmhouse outline where the cellar had been where she had run to he had the map in his mind when he had calmed himself then he moved again he went slow and he had one arm outstretched in front of his face and his other arm in front of his legs twice his fingers brushed into low rubble and once his fingers caught at a lowered telephone wire it was a rough lane that he took and sometimes his lower hand flicked against the taller weeds that grew between the ruts of the lane he tried to make each stride a measured one and he counted each stride that he took because alija had told him that the house of katica dubelj was paces from the square there was a new sound catching at him and he could not distinguish it a few paces from katica dubeljs house where it should be and the new sound was there again he had counted out his strides and he groped off the lane and his fingers found a fence set around with clinging thistles and sharp nettles he tracked the fence and he came to the wall of the house of katica dubelj he came to the door if she were alive she would come back to her home every night or every third night or one night in each week if she were alive it was what penn thought what had brought him to the village of rosenovici that there was the small minimal chance she would come it was past the house of katica dubelj that dorrie had been marched to the field with the wounded to the grave he would wait through one night for her to come if she were alive his fingers were off the stone then into the void then feeling the rough plank surface of the door it was the sound of a man who cried out penn was drawn forward the words of a man with pain in his mind at the end of the lane was the broken strut of a gate across the entrance to a field he had that sense of the openness beyond the gate that his fingers rested against he heard the words cried staccato and growing in his eyes was the failing light of the torch beam the shapes were appearing gathering strength the words were of anguish he saw the earth wall around the pit it was what he had seen from the tree line in the dusk going closer going in stealth he saw the shape of the man who knelt in the pit penn looked at the grave at the burial place of dorrie mowat and a man knelt in the pit in prayer an old man spoke the prayer of a personal agony and knelt in the pit with his head hung going closer drawn forward he could think of no threat that would come from an old man in prayer kneeling in the pit where dorrie mowat had been buried going closer as to the sett of the old badger sow crossing the ground where she had been stabbed bludgeoned shot going covert as to the culvert drain where amanda fawcett hid stepping silent in the loose slither of the mud over which had been dragged the joined bodies of her lover and dorrie mowat drawn forward it was luck his father said that men who got lucky most times deserved their luck he came at the old man from behind he came in a sharp movement across the small torch beam threw an instant shadow and was over him and the strength of perms hand was across the old mans mouth if he prayed at the grave he could be no threat if he was no threat then he could be a friend and penn needed some luck into the blinking staring eyes did he speak english the head nodding would he shout out the head shaking penn needed some luck he took his hand from the old mans mouth and he came around the old man and he saw the tremble in the old mans body and he thought of what the fear had done to amanda fawcett he took the old mans thin hands in his own and he held them as he had held his grandfathers hands on the night before death he squatted in the mud in front of the old man and the small beam of the torch was beside him the old man wore a suit and a tie knotted slimly at the collar of a white shin and to the thighs the suit trousers were soaked wet who are you my name is penn why do you come here to a place of evil i come to find the truth of the death of dorrie mowat the old man took back his hands and he reached with his fingers for penns face i come to find how she died and to find who was responsible the fingers brushed in gentleness on the harshness of penns jaw and followed the contours of his nose and his mouth as if to be certain that he had not discovered fantasy i come to find the eyewitness if she is alive the woman who is called katica dubelj the old man switched off the torch he took the sleeve of penns coat and they stumbled together out of the shallow pit getting closer to the tart mischief of dorrie mowat edging nearer to her the old man led perm away across the wetness of the field all together huddled in darkness branko and stevo and milo had taken a position in a ruin that was across the square from the church they shivered and chewed on cubes of cheese and had a small corked bottle of their own home brew nothing not a cat not a man no one could move through the village without passing them across the stream the big clock in the tower of the church at salika beat out the chimes of midnight the headmaster wheezed as he climbed the track i am the headmaster of the school penn wished he would shut his face i am the headmaster but i am now rejected because i have spoken out against the shame of our people they made enough noise going up the track without adding to the noise with talk i should now have been the mayor of the village but ignorance rules and savagery penn thought that ham would have punched the old man the headmaster until he stopped his talk when we had only one school before i was headmaster the children from rosenovici came to our school in salika and katica dubelj was one of the women who gave the children lunch because i know her i have a responsibility for her penn had been led at a brisk pace into the woods at the top of the field the tight grasp sharp fingers all the time held at the sleeve of his fatigue coat he could not see ahead of him beyond the immediate drooped shoulders of the headmaster and the lowest branches whipped off the headmaster and into his face and across his body he guessed the path that wound up through the wood was the secret of the headmaster and the lowest branches that cut at his face and snapped back at his body told penn that the path was rarely used it was a good way to go and between the brisk pace of the climb there were rest halts when the headmaster gasped for breath and his lowered shoulders shuddered from the exertion and penn heard the chime of the faraway church for the halfhour and then for the hour once there was a cacophony of noise rushing away from them the stampeding flight of a wild pig or of a grown deer we lived together in the old days we had our friendships across the prejudice of birth until the madness came the madness has destroyed what was a fine community destroyed because rosenovici is across the stream from us but always with us we cannot shut away the sight of rosenovici we look at what we have done every hour of daylight we see what we have done the heart has been torn from us i help you penn because you have the power to hurt the madness it was the smell that first caught penn he was wondering who would believe him mary braddock or basil at alpha security or arnold browne and the smell was of stale excreta he was wondering whether any of them safe at home and deep in their beds would believe that he had trekked behind the lines gone there because he had taken the money and the smell was of unwashed filth he was wondering whether jane would believe him if he shared it whether she would back away from him and hold little tom clear of him and the smell was of lingering dirt he was wondering if it mattered whether anyone believed him what mattered to him was truth and the truth was dorrie mowats smiling cheek and he had never before searched after truth it was in his mind to think about those who rejected the truth they were in their beds and in their chairs in front of the droning televisions and in their bars with their elbows slouched on the counter and they were bored with the truth they were in the other maisonettes of the cedars and in the roads of raynes park and in the pubs and they were hurrying with their bags of washing to the launderette before it closed and they were the late workers in the offices of five and they turned their fucking backs on the truth they were miles from him and they had not the space in their hearts to yearn to find truth bloody good old chummies wash your hands of it scrub them with soap old girls lucky old you old chummies and old girls because the truth is boring the torch beam now shone ahead and the headmaster mouthed small cries as if warning of their approach penn thought from what the torch beam showed that in daylight he would have walked right past the mouth of the cave but he would not have walked right past the smell it was as if the headmaster called softly to a frightened cat or to a dog or to a wild crow that should come for food the torch beam trapped the narrow mouth of a cave set behind a rockfall i used to come here with food i used to take the food from my wifes cupboard you take food from a womans cupboard and she notices she questions she said that if i took more food for the ustase bastards then she would denounce me do you understand penn that in the madness in which we live a wife can denounce her husband i have my own shame because i do not bring her food any more the headmaster tugged at penns sleeve and dragged him hunched low into the mouth of the cave he could have been sick was swallowing back the bile coughing the smell was like a cloud the torch beam played faintly around the walls of the cave where the water dribbled glistening then wavered on deeper into the cave it was not often that penn had a big thought not in his childhood and not with the service and not with alpha security the rag bundle was cowered in the recess of the cave perhaps a big thought could only come in a place such as this it would only have been a rag bundle if there had not been the brightness of the eyes reflected back by the torch beam penns big thought was that this was the one chance in his life to find truth she was so small she was wrapped in sacking rags he followed the headmaster down onto the floor of the cave sat crosslegged the headmaster talked her voice cackled back penn heard the clock chimes come faintly from across the distant stream she saw it herself she saw them taken past her house and into the field they had to wait while the bulldozer dug the pit she could see it from the window each of them killed one man but she says that she saw the girl killed by milan stankovic i have to go back across the stream what more do you want penn said i want her to walk me through what she saw each place and each moment what she saw right to the killing of dorrie mowat the headmaster was glancing furtively at his wristwatch shining the torch beam onto the hands he said that he would return the next evening did penn know the risk of staying but the intoxication of the truth had caught him and he waved his hand dismissive to reject the risk the headmaster was gone truth was evidence evidence was the naming of milan stankovic penn sat on the floor of the cave and could not see her the eyewitness twelve penn woke no dreams deep sleep could recognize nothing blinked to get the light into his eyes tried to focus did not know where he was it came fast he kicked back the blanket he felt the damp in his hip joints and his shoulders and the ache from the rough ground and was hells thankful for the hotels blanket the smell caught at him penn remembered the sun threw a long shaft into the recess of the cave he wondered if she had been there all night if she had slept if she had stayed in the crouched posture against the inner wall of the cave the cave big in the small light of the headmasters torch seemed shrunken little more than a cleft he yawned stretched he smiled at her and won back no acceptance of his presence he tried to smile warmth he looked hard at her there was little to see of her because there was a shawl of torn cloth across the crown of her head that covered also her ears and her throat what he could see of the face was a mosaic of age lines weathered and grimed small hands without spare flesh were clasped rigidly on her lap and he saw the deepset dirt as if they were painted with it she wore a long dress of black cloth that shrouded her and the cloth had the stale dankness of the cave over her dress open to the waist was a big overcoat too large for her sparrow size and penn thought it might have been her husbands and there was a knotted string holding it to her waist her short legs were extended in front of her and her stockings heavy grey wool were shredded at the knee and her feet were in smallsized rubber boots that came half of the way up her shins it seemed to penn as if the shawl and the dress and the coat and the stockings and the rubber boots were moulded to her body did she have other clothes did she change the clothes did she go to a stream and strip and wash he was wondering how long it had been since she had changed her clothes washed herself in his mind he made small markers had she changed or washed since his little tom had been born washed or changed since the acid session with gary bloody brennard personnel changed or washed since he had last laid up rough through a night in the undergrowth beside the network southeast rail track when they were watching the lockup garage for the irishman washed or changed since the battle for rosenovici and the death by a snipers aim of her husband and her flight to the woods the cave his jane showered in the morning and in the evening his mother stood in the kitchen of the tied cottage and stripped to the waist and didnt care if her kiddie had seen her and soaped herself he made the markers and wondered if she had ever washed or changed since she had come to the cave he tried to smile across the cave floor would she come back with him katica dubelj was the eyewitness would she come back to zagreb and make the statement had she the strength to go back with him across country penn smiled and he gazed into the dead animal eyes of the old woman he did not think she had the strength they had no language that was common to them he pulled his backpack round from its pillow position and when he made the movement she cringed back against the cave wall as if seeking a cranny where she could hide from him when the headmaster returned then they would make a statement and the headmaster would write the story of the eyewitness and she would make her mark as authenticity she did not have the strength to go back with him across country he had given ham for the cat and sandwiches for the dogs he was down on his food stock there were bread rolls in the backpack and there was cheese and the opened packet of ham and there was an orange penn split a roll open and he laid a piece of cheese in the roll and then peeled off a slice of the ham and laid it with the cheese he crawled towards her across the cave floor and he held the roll of driedout bread in front of him she could go no further back and he came close to her until her hand the bony filthy claw darted forward to snatch the food from him christ and she had no teeth she tore at the roll broke it into pieces and wolfed the pieces she could not chew them down they were swallowed indigestible when she had finished the pieces then she picked for each crumb and each fragment of the flaked bread it was as if he fed an untamed animal he passed the orange to her he wondered when she had last seen an orange jane had orange juice on the table each morning and it was maybe a year maybe a year and a half since katica dubelj had last seen an orange she grabbed at the orange and her fingernails blackcoated nicked the full flesh of his hands and a little blood ran she pulled the orange into pieces and stuffed them down pith and fruit and peel into the mouth without teeth he saw the juice dribble from the side of her mouth and when the orange was gone she lifted the fold of her dress to her lips and licked the juice off she had gratitude and she wanted to share it was picked from the cave floor from amongst her bedding sacks it was passed to him in her closed claw fist he held out the palm of his hand and the claw fist opened christ a bloody root she scurried back to her far edge of the cave a sucked bloody root she watched him it was truth the reality of the war he wondered how many of them there were old people holed up in caves in the woods behind the lines sucking roots for survival he thought that if he sucked the bloody root then he would be sick onto the floor of the cave they would have sucked bloody roots in caves in the glorious and pleasant land that was england a thousand years and more before but this was civilized fucking europe and now he would have the statement when the headmaster returned and her signature her mark as an eyewitness he reached again into his backpack penn took out the brown paper envelope he had the photograph of dorrie mowat penn showed the face of dorrie mowat the cheeky smiling mischief challenging face held it up there was joy cracking the mouth of katica dubelj as if the mouth had been touched by love as he had been touched and there was the cackle laugh of the old woman a memory coming back to her that had been private and suppressed too long she reached for the photograph and she took it and she kissed it she babbled at him and he shook his head because he understood nothing of what she said she took his hand in her tight claw fist and she led him as a child out into the sunlight falling through the high tops of the trees she pointed down through the trunks of the trees towards the village and then gestured towards the sun and made with her small arm the arc of the sun falling penn thought it was the promise of katica dubelj that she would take him to the village when the darkness came where the truth was and he would have her statement he had heard his wifes voice beyond the steel door frightened sent away and not arguing the headmaster sat on the mattress on the concrete shelf he had heard milan stankovics voice harsh in the guardroom beyond the steel door state that the matter would be dealt with on his return later the headmaster sat cramped in the cell built of concrete blocks and the light came through the meshed grille at eye level in the steel door he had heard the postman talking about his hands and his fingernails and he did not know why the state of his hands or fingernails was important the headmaster sat in his damp trousers sat huddled in his jacket and they had taken away his tie and his belt and the laces from his shoes he did not know what he would say when milan stankovic returned from his meeting wherever he went and his mind was too terrorized to concoct a reason for his having been alone in darkness soaked wet from crossing the streams ford in the village of rosenovici his mind was too confused to manufacture a story of innocence if he had not met the englishman they had not brought him food and they had not talked to him they left him solitary to wait for the questioning of milan stankovic it was an aspect of the madness that so many men hundreds thousands had sat in cells throughout the beauty of their land and waited for questioning and torture if he had not stayed so long at the cave he did not know could not know how he would respond to the beating or to the knife or the burning by cigarettes did not know whether he could hold his silence against the pain could not know whether the pain of torture would prise from him the secret if he had not hurried noisily back through the village towards the streams ford benny flicked the speak switch he said gravely we cant all be heroes somebody has to sit on the kerb and clap as they go by he heard the laughter distorted coming back over the loudspeaker in the seddys cab that original benny whod you lift that off benny nothing original about me will rogers and i collaborate cut it benny do me the favour he obeyed the convoy manager had cause to be stressed up pissed off because the rock that had come through the side window of the landrover had caught his face above the collar of the flak jacket and below the rim of his helmet the move out of knin had been sweet enough departure but the shit had started in a village just up the road from titova korenica with ugly women and dwarf kids lobbing rocks the convoy manager had a bandage over his face looked a really fine hero rocks in that village and four windscreens broken they were blocked now by mines they were up from slunj almost with the whiff of the river at the turanj crossing point in their noses and there were mines and four little arse holes to negotiate with good stuff for the hero the convoy manager to negotiate with they were blocked in between a cliff face and a river a good place to get the old head blown off it didnt happen on every run but happened too often that they were messed around on the convoy route benny reckoned that up the road between slunj and veljun they were moving tanks maybe artillery and a track had gone broken or a wheel had got holed and they werent having a united nations relief convoy going by and seeing what they were moving it was difficult for him to get the bloody great pisspot on his head out of the window but he took the trouble past all the lorries past the landrover the convoy manager was in his second hour of failing too right to negotiate the removal of the mines from the road their schedule was all shot to hell the kids with the mines from what he could see were drunk and theyd a good game going he saw the convoy manager stride back to his landrover the voice tight with controlled anger was in bennys cab they were going to take a minor road over towards the bosnia border they were going for the scenic route for the tourist run going up towards glina then would work back through vrginmost for the turanj crossing way behind schedule he sat in the seddys cab snuggled in the flak jacket and with the weight of the helmet squat on his head and hit the gears the convoy took the fork road east drove off the main drag and away from the kids with their frag mines and he smiled down at them like it was a pleasure for him to be going the scenic route and the kids loosed off their aks into the air as if theyd won a war and not just diverted an unarmed aid convoy they were laid out neatly on the bed her new files she had drawn the new curtains back because she came into the room each evening and closed them mary braddock sat beside the new files on the new duvet and she had kicked off her shoes onto the new carpet the new soft toys bears and rabbits were on the new pillow of the bed and the shop assistant when mary had bought them had prattled to her as if she were a grandmother and she had not contradicted the shop assistant nor told her of obsession or the weight of guilt because of the new paint and the new wallpaper it was a pretty room and a room that was correct for a child who would grow to be a climbing star not a horrid young woman it was after a spring shower that had beaten on the mullioned window and the sun shone into the pretty room the size of the new file was a measure to mary of the scale of the obsession she had read about herself in the newspapers different name and different address but read about parents who shared with her the obsession to know the newspapers printed sad photographs of fathers and mothers sitting close on settees with the picture of the dead child the lost loved one in the frame behind them those who demanded to know and who had failed she could recall the sad photographs of the stunned parents of the friendly fire boys in the gulf of the girl in the kenya game park of the young man murdered in chiles capital of the young woman who had died in saudi and the sad parents all had the same refrain of confused criticism for the help they had been given all her friends said it was obsession she shared the file with none of them and she did not allow her secretary two days a week to type the letters of which the copies went into the file there were the copies of fourteen letters written to the foreign and commonwealth office her friends said she should close her mind to an episode better forgotten there were four letters personally addressed to the ambassador in zagreb there were two letters written by hand to the president of croatia none of the replies were curt or brusque or rude the replies aidedrafted signed by the dignitaries were bland and oozed sympathy and were bloody useless her friends said that she should start again the telephone stampeded her out of the newly decorated newly furnished bedroom for a child she ran for the stairs god please make it the call penns call the dogs slithered with her down the stair carpet cannoning against her legs god please make it penns call she snatched up the telephone in the hall the dogs barked raucously as if her run for the telephone was a fun game charles here where were you outside a nice morning up here in this filthy city sorry darling but its all negative did i tell you cant remember

new see you this evening she went back slowly up the stairs and tidied the file on domes bed they were a rather more cheerful crowd for him to be with than the day shift and they did not seem to regard him as a hostile antibody inserted into library and the memories seeped again over the pages typed and handwritten and the photographs and the worn maps shaken the hand of that lovely young man johnny donoghue and watched him go tired away to the entrance tunnel of the underground train at the end of the arrivals concourse and gone to look for the car that would run the old desk warrior back to century house walked down his corridor on the eleventh floor hello henry have a good trip well i wouldnt say carrying the duty free towards his corner of the office just one of those things i hope youre not thinking itll be your head on the block well we did all we could settling down into his chair always a problem when you use an amateur dont you think well you win some and you lose some brought a beaker of coffee and sipped it and opened his briefcase and started out on the damned report for the file of a young mans journey through the lines a used young man it was long after he would normally have cleared the desk and trudged away to the station but the night shifts supervisor had wandered friendly to his desk with a mug of coffee for him a good young fellow and chatty and they talked desultorily about the new world that was dangerous and nostalgically about the old world that was comfortable the usual son of garbage he waited his moment then asked henry carter requested the trawl didnt know what they would find if they trawled for him didnt know if they would find anything he had the clearance he wouldnt have called the supervisor a chum but there had been times back in the old century house that he had shared a lunch table with him in the canteen the trawl had left in the net what he regarded as a prize catch a short memorandum at the top of a light pile of flimsies and worthwhile him staying late because it was a catch that the day shift supervisor would never have searched for from george simpson security service liaison rm c to desk head

and passed over and frightened witless of redundancy wrestling not too hard on a matter told in confidence carter thought that so much now fell into place a trust betrayed well simpsons old georgies dilemma about betraying a trust hadnt gone the distance hadnt stopped him snitching it was an old maxim but true that confidences didnt count for too much in the trade the intelligence officer fronting as liaison had known that the opportunity would not come until the end of the meeting at the breakup there would be coffee provided and biscuits and juice and the opportunity there was a working relationship now that civilized the meetings stiff formal but a relationship the meetings were always in the police station at tusilovic that was twelve kilometres into the occupied territory from the crossing point at turanj the relationship had prospered sufficiently for there to be a hot line from his office in karlovac to the police station at tusilovic and a monthly meeting across a table they never came to karlovac and it was usual also for the intelligence officer to meet milan stankovic at tusilovic the intelligence officer before permanent secondment to the military had been chief salesman export for the timber factory at karlovac he was trained to read body language the serb was sullen there had to be room for sport there more on the agenda concerning the electricity supply across the ceasefire line deadlock the sort of agenda item on which stankovic would usually have shouted his opposition hammered the table the matter of the woman croatianamerican who had travelled from chicago for her mothers funeral at topusko and been kept waiting three days in zagreb with no permission for entry into sector north granted until after the burial and no explanation the sort of matter on which stankovic would usually have sneered contempt the intelligence officer anticipated sport they had been through the litany of ceasefire violations a sentry frozen and lone looses off a single shot a section bored responds with a mortar round a platoon angry replies with an artillery piece a company furious loads up an organj multiple rocket launcher the sort of litany on which stankovic would usually shoot his mouth off there had to be good sport because stankovic was sullen head hanging the intelligence officer came round the table and he held the coffee cup in his hand he eased himself onto the table sitting casual beside the big bowed shoulders of milan stankovic hello milan bit quiet today hows evica my wife always tells me to ask after her managing is she i heard her school was short of books but then youre short of everything must have been shit through the winter without the power he watched the hands fidgeting and the body hunched and the serbs eyes avoided his own were quite well on with the new cooperative building out on the ilovac road good position and close to the zagreb highway your farmers happy you built a new cooperative no well maybe next year maybe some time there was clearly a personal burden there for the intelligence officer to scratch at he probed and sipped his coffee you know what people ask me friends who know i come to the meetings the ones who used to know you what they ask is this that milan stankovic the clerk once but the big man now what does he think his future is ive an idea of the future longterm because nothing will be forgotten what i tell my friends the people who ask me it may not happen in my lifetime nor in yours the vengeance but my son will come for your son because it will never be erased he wondered if it was shame that he saw or whether it was fear he imagined his quiet voice as a knife between the blades of milan stankovics shoulders i nearly forgot to say id have kicked myself if id forgotten to say it there are questions being asked about you your name is mentioned i suppose if you hadnt been in belgrade then you would have been able to prevent it but you were in belgrade when they dug for the bodies of our wounded that were killed after rosenovici fell that was a mistake you being away in belgrade im told theyre filling a file on you milan there was a bigger mistake the intelligence officer was bent over milan stankovic good sport he whispered the words into the ear of milan stankovic time i was getting on time i was back in karlovac not too bad there because weve got power please tell evica that my wife wanted to be remembered to her theyre asking questions filling a file killing the english girl milan that was a serious mistake they talked quietly in the guardroom they sat away from the scratched steel door of the cell branko passing his cigarettes it was the same bag in the police jeep the same bag white plastic as was in the dubelj hags home the goddamn bastards brought more food milo stubbing his own cigarette taking another it wasnt that fuckers hands you saw his nails i saw his nails wasnt his bastard nails was a womans stevo striking the match we go back tonight skip the music shit we go back tonight until we find her until she comes back down into that pig place they smoked they flicked their hands of playing cards on the table they ignored the man behind the steel door of the cell they waited for the return of milan stankovic she had come back to the crossing point at turanj she had again left the transit centre and driven to the crossing point and parked her car and waited the convoy of the aid lorries returning empty should have been through an hour before if the convoy had left knin promptly and made good time then it might have been through an hour and a half before she stared up the road from where the croat militia stood and the light had started to dip she looked up the hill up beyond the small san gar of whitewashed sandbags where the troops of the nigerian battalion had their machine gun up towards the defence positions of the serb militia where their flag flew and on the hill greying in the low light would be their trenches and their strong points and their mortars and artillery each time she glanced down at her watch and realized the convoy was delayed then the fear tripped in her if the convoy was late then it would be because of a security alert if there was a security alert it would be because of a discovered infiltration if there was a discovered infiltration it would be because penn was hunted each time she looked at her watch the ratchet of her fear turned if nobody did anything if everybody just wrung their hands if nobody acted if everybody said that action was impossible then the camps of the neuengamme ring could be built again then the wickedness could come again she saw the car come slowly to the far checkpoint and stop if the big men of the chancelleries and ministries did nothing then only the little men could try to halt the wickedness the car came on from the far checkpoint and stopped again at the nigbatt san gar penn was the little man and was alone and behind the lines and trying the car came forward going faster between the rubble of the foughtover village of turanj she was apart from the militia checkpoint and when the car reached them the militia men pointed to her and there were smiles on their faces and she imagined they called her the silly bitch or the daft whore the door of the car opened she knew the liaison officer he was often at the meetings she attended at the karlovac municipality he came to her perhaps it was something in her face but the smirk was wiped off him you have a problem what is the problem why is the british convoy late a difficulty down the road said breathily what difficulty a route interference they have had to divert why do you ask what is the interference some kids mines near to slunj why do you ask no difficulty in the glina area nor near to vrginmost it is the usual interference and the glina area is quieter than the grave you are sure i am returning miss schmidt from the liaison meeting with the people from glina municipality there is no difficulty in that area the difficulty is at slunj may i repeat please my question why do you ask its not important it was only the first beating starting with a slap then punches then kicks but he had not been burned it was the fire that the headmaster dreaded the flame would be the worst he had known milan stankovic through all of the young mans life known his mother and his father before they had gone to live in belgrade the headmaster had once liked milan when the boy was the basketball star of the village school when the young man had been the hero performer of the glina municipality team he had always had time for milan stankovic before the war all through that day he had lain in his cell and waited for milan stankovics return from the liaison meeting and he had thought of the fire against his body it had been just slapping and punching and kicking so far and he had held the secret tight in his mind only staccato questions not an interrogation when the interrogation came then there would be the fire against his skin but he did not understand why milan stankovic had shown no appetite for hurting him and he had seen between the slaps and punches and kicks the confusion of the expressions of the postman and the carpenter and the gravedigger as if they also had not understood it was important to the headmaster to keep his secret as long as it was possible for him to survive the pain the music from the hall in his school beat at the meshed grille high in the door of the cell after the music after they were drunk they might come back to the cell with the fire he did not know how long he could protect his secret but by the night by the time they were drunk surely the young man would have turned away from the evil that was rosenovici it was his hope run hard young man he murmured to the walls of the cell run hard so that i do not betray you she had offered him berries from her store that was under the rags of her bed while they waited the berries were bullethard dried through and he estimated they had been picked the last autumn from the dog rose brambles in the wood and from the branches of thorn trees they had waited an hour in the cave as the shadows had fallen into darkness for the headmaster it was all in gestures because they had no language he showed her the palms of his hands rejecting the berries then declining the root section that she offered the headmaster had said he would come and they had waited and he knew as certainty that she did not have the strength to come across country with him to the ceasefire line and he did not have the language to persuade her nor to tell her that the headmaster must record her statement penn would have bet high stakes that the headmaster would return after the first trumpet call of the big owl from a high tree down towards the valley she wrapped her shawl tighter around her face she knotted the string more closely around her overcoat and she replaced the berries and the root in her food store under the rags and she stood penn smiled at her to reassure her and did not know whether she saw his smile in the caves gloom he had the pistol in the pocket of his coat and a spare magazine and he checked that the pistol was armed and on safety he felt a skein of worry that the headmaster had not come it was katica dubeljs decision that they should wait no longer for the headmaster she took his hand as if she could reassure him he was trained by a branch of the security service he carried a browning mm automatic pistol there were four hand grenades in his backpack and the shrivelledup woman eighty plus years of life lived reckoned he needed her reassurance christ she babbled words at him and the only word that he caught was the name of dorrie going back to domes place domes death and he knew her only by the words of others who held the love and by the photograph and nothing before in his life had mattered so much as the truth of dorrie mowats village dorrie mowats killing he would go from rosenovici he would not return to the cave it was the best time for him to say his thanks to her he had his hands on her light shoulders and he kissed the old woman softly on her forehead below the line of the stinking tight shawl and she pecked at his cheek stretching up with her dried mouth that had no teeth the humility dug into him he hoped that he would never again feel the arrogance that was the trademark of a watcher of a branch he hoped that he would never again swagger in conceit she laughed guttural and dragged him out of the cave they went fast down the narrowed track from the cave all the time she held his hand he scrambled to keep up with her skipping short stride they came nearer to the high tree where the big owl shouted gaps in the tree trunks and penn saw the small pin lights of the village across the stream the wind was coming into the trees and penn heard the murmur of music from the village across the stream she went quickly and pulled him clumsily after her it was the movement of a scavenging vixen fox when they were out of the wood she used the overgrown hedge at the side of the field scurried close to the spread hazel and the thorn stopping and scenting and seeming to sniff for danger and going on no shadows now the gold from the sun gone grey behind the trees above rosenovici she never lost her grip of him he grinned to himself first she had felt the need to reassure him now she did not trust him to move silently in darkness they went by the corner of the field not stopping a sharp thought where was the headmaster why was the headmaster not with them sharp because she hurried him past the black pit of the dug grave she stopped suddenly and he cannoned into her back and she turned only a slight outline in the darkness and her finger jabbed at him as if she criticized the child she led as if bloody penn knew nothing of covert movement she waited the vixen fox at the broken gate at the end of the lane and listened to the night he heard only the bleating music and the grind of a swinging door and the creaking movement of fallen rafters penn was led to her house he was taken into the house through the open and hanging door she was miming what she had seen she stood at the window at the front of her house and she pushed her head against the shards of the broken glass identified what had been her viewpoint penn was not yet accustomed to the dark of the interior before he was pulled again and his feet crunched the glass and he cursed and she hissed her complaint she took him back out into the lane now she loosed his hand he stood in front of katica dubeljs house and he watched squinting to see the mime act of the eyewitness she was the guards and she seemed to kick some forward and to beat others as with the stock of a rifle she was the walking wounded and she seemed to carry some and she seemed to drag others she spoke the name she was dorrie mowat and she seemed to support two heavy men and her arms were out and she seemed to buckle under the weight of the men and she seemed to turn once and aim a kick back behind her she took his hand again she walked penn back through the fallen gate and into the field they slithered together on the wet of the grass and the weeds and across the tyre ruts left by the jeeps penn was led to the edge of the pit she made the mime again she was the guards and she moved to take their places in a half circle facing the pit and she seemed to aim down towards the ground she was the wounded sitting she was the wounded lying she said the name and she was dorrie mowat and she seemed to crouch down on one knee and her arms were outstretched as if she held the shoulders of two men against her small body and her mouth moved as if she shouted a defiance she was the bulldozer and she growled and she jerked up her arms as she walked the length of the pit and she seemed to throw back the pits earth he watched and he would forget nothing he would not forget that dorrie and the wounded men had watched the bulldozer gouge out their grave she scrambled across the earth wall and down into the pit he could barely see her the blackgrey shadow shape against the blackgrey earth of the pit the music across the stream was a frenzy she lay in the mud at the bottom of the pit she was the wounded and waiting she stood she made the knife thrust and she made the chopping blow of a hammer she moved a pace she seemed to stand above the next of the wounded waiting and she thrust with the knife and chopped with the hammer another pace another penn forced himself to watch dorrie had been the last in the line dorrie and the boy that she loved he had to watch katica dubelj because it was what he had come for she was a guard she was a man from the village where the music played across the stream she seemed to try to pull them apart dorrie and her boy and she recoiled back and held her eyes as if extended fingers had been punched into them she spoke the name the whisper milan stankovic she went crab fast to the near end of the pit and her hand was first at her face to show the length of the beard milan stankovic she was milan stankovic and she seemed to hold a pistol in her hand stopping aiming the pistol hand kicking a pace stopping aiming the pistol hand kicking a pace this was hard for penn to watch milan stankovic working methodically down the line and fetching the last life from the wounded who had been stabbed and bludgeoned stopping aiming the pistol hand kicking a pace she did not hurry herself she made each movement as she had seen it she was the eyewitness stopping aiming the pistol hand kicking a pace going closer to dorrie mowat and her boy she seemed to stand above them then reach down as if to break the hold and then she seemed to double away and clutch her hands at her groin as if that was where the kick had gone she was reeling back she was reaching for the knife and slashing she was reaching for the hammer and crashing it down she was aiming the pistol the pistol hand kicked twice she whispered the name milan stankovic he turned away it was what he had come to find the power of the light seared into perms face thirteen his eyes saw only the white brightness of the light there were excited shouts from in front of him and then all around the light stripped him bare he stood in the white brightness he dared not move if the fear the panic had not been frozen into him in that moment when the light caught him then he might have tried to duck away or throw himself to the edge of the light but the fear was in him and with the fear was blindness the old woman had been behind him she had been in the pit behind him when he had turned away with the shouts with the click of the safety catches there was a sudden stifled scream a mans hoarse pain the light never left penn it was what he himself would have done or what his instructors from far back would have told him to do put the light down sonny boy be close to the light but not on it sonny boy cause if theyre going to put suppressive fire down sonny boy itll be the light they go for that is what an instructor would have said and he realized the angle of the light was low as if it was on the ground there was a hammer of shots behind him semiautomatic on a rifle and after the shots and the scream there was the sound briefly of ripping cloth penn did not dare to turn to see whether katica dubelj old woman gone animal old woman gone eighty years of her life old woman who had never been on a surveillance or an evasion course old woman not strong enough to go cross country had made it clear through the thorn and wire in the hedge beyond the pit there was a loaded pistol weighting the pocket of his coat there were four grenades in his backpack penn did not dare to reach for either very slowly so carefully that the movement should not be misunderstood he stretched out his arms kept his hands open raised his arms he thought he was the prize he heard behind him after the bullet volley nothing of pursuit fear seemed to numb the movement of his legs so that they were rigid scarecrow stilts and to loosen the hold of his guts so that he wanted to piss crap the fear trembled the movement of his arms up high and into surrender his eyes bunked uncontrolled and the water from his eyes distorted the glare of the cone of light there was still shouting but coming closer to him moving closer and slowly because they could not know the fear that shackled him as if he was still dangerous to them only his mind was not frozen in his mind the thoughts raced ham hadnt talked of escape and evasion the fatfaced little bastard hadnt talked about what to do he had once been at a territorial army depot in warrington a marksmans rifle gone missing a suspicion that it might have been sold to protestant para militaries from ulster which was enough to bring in security service involvement and an escape and evasion pamphlet picked up off a book shelf he had been waiting for them to wheel in the armourer and he had flicked the pamphlets pages just from interest he had read the first moments of capture offered the maximum opportunity of escape also offered the maximum opportunity of getting the old head blown off because of the high state of adrenaline of the captors he had read that it took real guts big bravery to antagonize captors by going runabout his hands were high above his head in his mind the thoughts cavorted he was shit scared frightened and dorrie mowat had been here dorrie mowat the horrid young woman had kicked one man in the privates punched one man in the eyes spat at the whole goddamn lot of them dorrie the one that all who had touched had loved had sat in the wet grass where he now stood in surrender and her arms had been round the wounded man that she had chosen and she had sat and waited while the bull dozer dug out the pit she hadnt had the fear a shape loomed at the edge of the cone of light in his mind the thoughts raced jane in the small room little tom on her lap with the television on and whats the point of you going there whats anyone to gain from it failed her mary in the kitchen and making the coffee i think she took a pleasure in hurting me and mr penn she was my daughter and mr penn her throat was slit and her skull was bludgeoned and she was finished off with a closerange shot and mr penn not even a rabid dog should be put to death with the cruelty shown to my dorrie failed her basil holding court to jim and henry in the darts bar of the pub round the corner from the launderette you know what you are penn you are a jam my bastard failed them the old american professor of pathology build a case stack the evidence maria who was a refugee she was an angel in her courage alija who needed the operation to her eyes she could not protect herself because she had the wounded fighters to help sylvia who was cloaked in the nervous collapse does anybody care what happened to them who did it anybody failed them the blow was at the back of the neck failed them all the blow was with the stock of a rifle short swing and failed jovic who had interpreted for him and ulrike who had touched his arm to make a talisman for him and ham who had given him the map and failed himself he was pitched forward by the blow they were all around him and the shadows of their bodies masked the cone of white light he wondered if they would shoot him there or whether they would take him some place else to kill him and felt he did not have domes courage he tried to cry out beg mercy of them but his voice was suffocated the fear consumed him when they had hit him some more times when he had seen the grinning of cold faces when he had smelled the foul close breath of them then they searched him and found the pistol and they skewered his arms back and pulled the backpack off him then they hit him with the rifle stocks some more penn was pulled to his feet he could hear the music from across the stream penn william five reject failure he was held tight and dragged towards the pin lights of the village across the stream they were through glina the convoy was belting it was not usual for the convoy manager in his landrover to let the fifteen seddys behind him sniff the wind and belt but they were all pissed off and benny who was driving three from the back supposed that the wound on the convoy managers face had lost its numbness and would now hurt like hell benny wasnt fussed it did not matter to him that they had been off the main roads into the ditches up bloody awful rutted lanes hed done the runs into northern iraq out of turkey to resupply the kurds in winter grinding in low gear down tracks that had never seen a loaded seddon atkinson before he made it his business to know the land read up on his guidebooks and he wrote twice every week to his wife becky to tell her where he had been and what he had seen there wouldnt be much to write to becky about glina because they had belted through the pretty little town but hed think of something to say he only wrote to becky about the towns being pretty never about the people being shit it was not his way to frighten her to tell her that most days he wore a pisspot on his head and a flak jacket of kevlar plates front and back across his body and he didnt tell her that the doors of the cab were armourreinforced nor that he had sandbags under his seat as protection from mine blasts on the main road and belting perhaps fortyfive minutes if they werent messed again from the turanj crossing and the voice crackled on the radio in his cab guys theres usually a roadblock between glina and vrginmost i dont want to spend half the night yammering with some defective on a roadblock theres a right a few miles ahead up to a village called salika i reckon we can get round the block then back onto the main heave ok guys they didnt have call signs the drivers didnt like to play at military games if theyd had call signs then all of them would have been foxtrot something all fword stuff call signs were for kids playing soldiers the answers tripped over each other and not many of them polite and bennys next letter to becky would not tell her that his nerves were hacked jagged by driving in darkness on stone tracks through these shit awful villages through these shit awful people bad news that there would be another shit block to divert round he flicked the speak switch it was important to get a laugh because the nerves of all the drivers and the convoy manager would be as hacked jagged as his own you know what lily tomlin said things are going to get a lot worse before they get worse they brought him down to the bridge they had tied his wrists together cutting hard behind his back and his ankles so that the bones chafed each other and they had to drag him they came down to the bridge and they pitched him onto the planks and he fell onto his stomach and was trying to twist his head away so that his nose did not take the force of his fall there was a rusted old hurricane lamp on the bridge that threw a good light from beside the sandbag position of the guards it was then he saw for the first time the three men who had taken him the one was thin and big another had a heavy body and was taller the last was slight and shallow in his build theyd thrown him down dropped him like the dead roebuck that a stalker and the keeper had shot in the long copse behind the tied cottage and they had the same excitement of the stalker and the keeper and all three had the weathered faces of the country aged and penn knew the country was cruel he was a specimen to be boasted of and he heard words that were similar to english and to spy and the old bastards were showing the young guards of the bridge his passport and the browning mm automatic pistol and the spare magazines and the grenades he did not see any more at the bridge penn tried to tuck down his head when the young guards at the bridge took their turn she hadnt flinched from the kicking dorrie had faced up she had kicked them back punched them back shouted back she had kept her pride her goddamn courage dorrie mowat a horrid young woman hadnt let them see her fear he forced his eyes open he looked into their faces as she had looked into their faces into their boots into their eyes he didnt see jane he didnt see mary he saw dorrie mowat he wondered if she watched him and laughed at him wondered if she knew the love god and he had failed her they picked him up with rough hands under his armpits and they dragged him on over the bridge and he heard the beat sound of the music from among the pin lights of the village the sergeant came to her with his thermos of coffee a good hour gone now since the sergeant had last tried to play the kind uncle and get ulrike on her way she took the coffee thanked him she sipped the warmth of the coffee the sergeant was defeated knew it and did not seem to care she was not moving she was staying until the aid convoy came through the convoy was eight hours late she did not believe the sweet talk of the liaison officer who was long gone sweet talk seldom convinced ulrike schmidt sweet talk of happiness and friendship had lured her to the job with the organizing committee for her citys olympic games nineteen years old waiting to go to university taking the job of helping to get out the results for the swimming and the judo and the archery joining the weeping girls with her own tears when the shadow stain of violence cut down the israeli athletes sweet talk of progress in ending human misery had trapped her into united nations work the university discarded and service in lebanon and cambodia becoming a part of the cynical company that realized nothing changed through their efforts little was made better sweet talk of love and marriage had brought her to the bed of an australian army major in phnom penh and there was the letter left casually on the dressing table of his quarters and the photograph of the majors wife and four children in the drawer under his uniform shirts sweet talk in geneva had told her that the refugees from bosnia would be cleared through the transit centre inside four weeks because there were promises of resettlement from the governments of europe she dealt each day with hunger strikes protests trauma because the governments lied ulrike drained the beaker of coffee when the convoy came through then she would know forget the sweet talk that there was no alert up the broken road from turanj up beyond the machinegun post up behind the lines silent prayer was not sweet talk he was the king it was the court of milan stankovic he was back from the liaison meeting back from the cell block at the headquarters of the tdf unit of his village he had survived evicas carped complaint in his home coming sullen to his kitchen and facing the barb of evica would he get himself together because now he was shit would he hike himself up because now he was pathetic listened to evica heard her call him shit rubbish pathetic held out his arms for her and she had come to him closed his arms on her and their little marko had clung to his legs and the dog had bounded happily against his back he was the king the chief man and he had held the warmth of evica against him and felt the warmth of his little marko against his thigh and his hip it was the canadian policeman who was shit and the political officer and the liaison man from karlovac he was amongst his own and was loved he could not be touched he had kissed the eyes and ears and mouth of evica and the head of his little marko he was beyond their reach those who were shit pathetic rubbish the king danced the music was heat around him the chief man drank the shouts were about him it had been the strength of his evica that had liberated him and the spit of her tongue he danced and he drank as if the death shroud was taken from him the king danced with the queen space was made for them in the centre of the hall of the school there were shrill shouting faces around them and the clapping of a hundred hands about them she was so lovely his queen and dancing wild with him and her full skirt sweeping high on her thighs as he led her the loveliest girl in the village now the loveliest woman in salika as he danced wild the folk dance of the serb people so the hands of the men who acknowledged him as king reached out with glasses of brandy as he danced he drank he felt he had found freedom he was the power of his people the glory of his village spinning with the dance the skirt of evica climbing the music faster the clapping louder the brandy spilling from his lips milan knew he was the king coming to the climax of the music and his feet were stamping and evicas feet were gliding and the clapping hammering in him he was free and when the music had climaxed and when he had drunk again then he would sing he was the king they came through the door of the hall they were dragging the man they brought the man to him through the parted crowd around him that had gone to silence and the music died milan stared down at the man who lay prone on the floor he saw a man who was trussed at the wrists and ankles the man was dressed in filthy wet fatigues mudsmeared the man gazed back up at him the face of the man was bloodspattered branko was dropping onto the floor noisy clatter a heavy pistol and then four grenades rolling loud milo was shaking out onto the boards of the floor a backpack socks and underpants and a thick sweater and spare magazines for the pistol and old bread and an envelope of brown paper stevo threw the passport down onto the floor the postman and the carpenter and the gravedigger smiled their pride around him were the people of the village all watching him he bent down he looked at the passport the passport was british united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland he reached for the envelope he stood and took a sheaf of photographs from the envelope the man with the blood on his face gazed up at him evica was beside him like a blow hitting him milan saw the face the face that he had known and the knife wound the gasp of evica beside him the face swollen in putrefaction but with the bludgeon wound on the forehead the face that he recognized and the bullet wound above the ear and they were all watching him because he was their king and the fear twisted in him and could not be shown the freedom was gone the liberty was lost and the brandy was beating in him trying to focus on the face on the floor and the face in the photographs the face of the man on the floor gazing back at him and the face of the woman in the photograph and blood on the faces that merged he unhooked the clasp knife from his belt threw it to the carpenter the twine at the ankles and at the wrists was cut she had not been bound evica held the photographs and shivered it was what was expected of the king branko and stevo lifted the man up and he stood in front of milan and swayed milan should not show fear not in front of those who admired and worshipped the king and she had not shown fear a short arm blow as hard as he could punch he hit the stomach of the man the man staggered went down was on his knees the man stood again milan did not see the fear and she had not shown fear he threw the man into the crowd around him for their pleasure they were crawling into the village benny reckoned they were going slowly because they had missed the turn he reckoned they should have taken the left turn before they were into the village he knew it was a serb village because the roofs were on the houses and the church had a tower and what looked like the school wasnt a burned shell the convoy manager benny reckoned had screwed up and was crawling because he knew it and it was long odds against tiptoeing away when they had to turn round and back up a landrover and fifteen seddon atkinson lorries it was strange benny thought that they could pitch up in this lost forgotten corner of pretend civilization and not have half a hundred people coming out the woodwork to know their business peculiar the convoy manager up ahead had started the turn and backup routine it looked dark quiet a hell of a bad place to be lost a hell of a good place to be shot of the lorries were manoeuvring like leviathans and at present no bugger with an aks safety off and armed coming out of the houses to ask their business benny waited his turn to manoeuvre penn heard just the shout the shout was an order the last of the kicks went into him into the small of his back and the last of the womens nails clawed at his face and the last of the punches went to his unprotected stomach the pain ran rivers in his body the shout was a command he tried hard to keep his eyes open because that seemed important he lay on the floor and the boards were wet with his blood and his spittle and his urine six would have done courses on resistance to interrogation five didnt any rate not for his level of a branch nongraduate in a circle around him were the heavy laced shoes of the men and the light slideon shoes of the women and on some of the shoes were dulled stains not a course for his level of a branch nongraduate but maybe for the top grade super fucking experts who went to belfast it was a hallucination for penn kicked clawed punched to be thinking of courses for resistance to interrogation for topgraders who went to belfast but the hallucination swamped him there was a woman in gower street and hed been down a queue for the coffee machines when shed been at the head shed been pointed to and hed been told that the proves had trapped her in some godawful pub no backup present and shed fought her way out just a slip of a woman with rusted gold hair and a flat chest and rounded shoulders who had taken her coffee and walked slowly back to her office like she was a bored woman not a topgrader the big man the voice of command the one who had swayed when he had seen the photograph the one who had hit him first broke the cordon circle the big man came towering towards him penn blinked up and tried to retain the focus of his vision couldnt break the hallucination there were two women in his mind both topgraders the woman with the rustgold hair bored in london in the coffee queue who had the courage to fight clear of a killer enemy and the woman with the cropped hair the mischief smile in her photograph who had the courage to bury her fear when the killer enemy closed he was so wanting to be brave bravery might just be survival or it might just be dignity or it might just make the fucking knife and the fucking bludgeon and the fucking pistol shot fucking easier the hallucination rode him talking in the openplan office area of a branch chattering idly about the hostages in lebanon and the big mouth graduate reading claiming that he would have gone for escape and the simpering mouth graduate warwick whining that she would have gone for a runner and penn nongraduate trying to contribute quietly that an escape attempt took more courage than anything and being ignored and just the idle chatter of a hallucination in a quiet hour of a london office because fucking escape was not on the reality agenda the big man pulled him up the big man had a loose beard grown free across his face not trimmed between the matt of the beard growth the tongue of the big man wiped his full lips above the growth of the beard were the eyes evasive the face the eyes and the mouth as penn saw it were empty of passion the woman beside the big man held the photographs outside the envelope as if she did not wish again to look at them she wore a bright full skirt flowerpatterned and an ironed white blouse that was simple and there were sweat streaks in her hair at her forehead penn stood and hoped that he would find the courage the question was put to him the woman interpreted the question who are you trying to speak strongly i am william penn i am a british citizen the answer was repeated by the woman to the big man a second question are you a mercenary from the ustase scum trying to stare into those evasive eyes i have no connection with the croatian army a lie you wear the uniform of the ustase scum i bought the camouflage uniform on the black market in karlovac the big man made the question the woman interpreted the question she spoke formal taught english what was the mission penn heard it the revving of heavy engines behind him no one moved around him they hung silently on the questions put by the big man and the answers given by the woman beside him could not know where it would lead him where it would take him but knew the importance of bold talk the village of rosenovici across the stream was taken in december of there were wounded men in the village who were sheltered in a cellar during the final attack on the village what has that to do with a mercenary the wounded men were taken from the cellar after the fall of the village they were taken to a field they were sat in the field laid out in the field while a bulldozer dug the interruption the woman had translated in a quiet voice while he talked and the circle craned for her words what has that to do with while a bulldozer dug a grave pit the wounded men were then killed with knives and were bludgeoned and were shot and they were buried what has that they were buried in a mass grave in the corner of the field what buried in the mass grave in the corner of the field was a young woman the young woman was not wounded in the battle for the village she had chosen to stay with the wounded she had chosen to be with them at the end she was not a fighter she had no guilt she was butchered in the pit dug by the bulldozer why was she important staring all the time into the face of the big man and the eyes above the matt of the beard darting away and the tongue in the midst of the beard sliding on dried lips she was english and that is why i came she was not serbian and not croatian and not muslim she was not a part of the quarrel she was english and her name was dorrie staring into the face and hearing the drip of the translation he had spoken the name and there was a little gasp and a small murmur in the circle around him he was trying to hold the pain and the tremble trying to ape the mischief moments of dorrie mowat her name was dorrie mowat and there was no cause for her killing it was cowards work killing dorrie mowat who sent you i was sent by the mother of dorrie mowat i came to find how dorrie mowat died i came so that i could tell her mother how she died in a pit and i came so that i could tell her mother who killed her the name of the man the man who was responsible penn felt the moment of power he heard the engines of big vehicles away behind the door no one moved in the circle around him he didnt know where it would lead couldnt know who knew her who knew dorrie mowat he heard the echoing ring of his voice the woman interpreted who met her when she lived in rosenovici before the fight before she was butchered he turned from the shifting eyes from the licked lips it was all a fraud did you know her it was a fraud because it was pretence that he held the high ground when he held fucking nothing he searched the faces an old man a young man a teenage girl it was a sham act you did you know her he searched the faces challenged them and they would not meet him he ranged over the faces of the circle who met her he reached the woman who held the photographs who interpreted the questions and answers she dropped her head i met her penn whispered why did you meet her i met her so that i could talk english with her i met her before the fight for the village so that i could better my language of english penn said i came so that i could tell dorries mother the name of the man who killed her daughter so that she would know the name of that man i came to prepare a report for dorries mother i came to find the evidence against that man he saw the fingers of the woman twisting on the photographs tearing them and she did not notice what was the name the wall around him was of shame he had won his dignity as dorrie had claimed hers he had stamped his death warrant and fuck them the circle about him was of guilt she would be laughing at him laughing loud from her mischief face dignity was won somewhere he heard the roar of lorry engines pulling away fuck them because they couldnt hurt him if he had his dignity they could only kill him it was penns moment it was to him as if he were alone with the big man facing him it was as if all else was suppressed as if each other person in the circle held no importance it was a handsome face a leaders strong good face i have the evidence for my report that dorrie mowat was killed by penn heard the voice of the woman who interpreted was murdered by milan stankovic and in front of him the face flushed in anger and the fists caught at him penn shouted his name is milan stankovic men around him the circle broken hands grabbing him he saw the face the last time the anger flush in the matt of the beard and the woman who had interpreted was sobbing he kicked and he struggled and he was forced towards the door of the hall he had his fucking dignity he bit at the hands that held him his fucking dignity what dorrie had had he writhed with them as they pushed him through the door into the night the lorry in the line was starting to roll the line of the lorry lights speared the darkness of the village and the lorry was in front of him beginning to move the opening of the door of the hall flushed the inside light onto the union flag on the lorrys door only two men were able to hold him as they came through the tight space of the doorway penn saw the small round startled face he bit the hand on his arm he elbowed into a stomach it was his chance he broke free there was black darkness beyond the lorry penn yelled kill your lights the one chance only the lights died night darkness around him he ran the darkness was his friend he threw himself under the moving wheels of the lorry and rolled he didnt know what the hell happened but he had killed the lights just the glow of the dashboard in the cab and the fluorescent buttons of his radio he was nudging the lorry forward the far door of the cab came open and there was a quick blast of night air there were hands groping by his shins and ankles and something benny didnt know what was thrown from the cab floor it hit the wooden fence across the road clattered in the dark there was weight across his legs and panting wriggling movement something else benny didnt know what was thrown from the door of the cab and that seemed to go further and it hit glass across the width of the road perhaps a greenhouse perhaps a cold frame the door closed quietly on the cab and the weight came over him and prised into the gap behind his seat and the passenger seat there were men running round the seddy going across the road towards where something had hit the wooden fence and something else had smashed a glass surface there was shooting he could see the gun flashes in the big side mirror of the seddy could see the fireflies of the bullets going towards the fence and where the glass pane had been broken and all the lorries were hammering it now because of the shooting the lorries swerved each in their turn for the road they should have taken benny was cool he didnt favour panic the radio in his cab was a jabber of voices all calling for the convoy to get the hell out get the distance in there was the sharp panted breathing behind him and benny realized the man stank he was in cruise gear and they were doing good speed and the village was behind him and the sound of shooting was fading he was cool no panic and he could think well benny reckoned it to be about give or take a bit twentyfive minutes to the crossing point at turanj and he was in deep shit deepest without a bloody bottom because the first rule aid convoy driving is dont get involved but the yell had been english the second rule is not to take sides but the shout had been english and desperate all the rules up to one hundred and one bloody rules said the aid convoy system went through the window if the drivers werent all the way impartial but the cry of kill the lights had been english what he had done was get involved take sides and what hed done when they hit the crossing point at turanj if back in that black village theyd gotten their act together raised the radio lifted the telephone sent a fast bloody pigeon what hed done was to hazard the whole of the aid convoy programme people survived because the aid convoys went through without getting involved people would starve if the aid convoys were banned because the drivers had taken sides people depended on the aid convoys crossing the lines impartial perhaps benny thought before they were at the crossing point at turanj hed just chuck him out push him clear in the convoy queue spearing the night with its lights the seddy hammered forward going sweet benny unhooked the pencil torch from the dashboard clip he shone the light around his feet now then my old cocker you have just lost me my sandwich box that my becky gave me and you have just lost me my fire extinguisher and i am not allowed to drive without a fire extinguisher in the cab and im thinking you should do the decent thing and please close the door after you benny shone the torch behind him into the gap behind his seat and the passenger seat he turned to look fast behind him in the narrow beam benny saw the blood on the face and the cuts and the bruises back to the road he thought he had seen the face of a man who was softened for death he twisted again benny saw the stubble growth that dammed the blood and the eyes that squinted between the puffed bruising and the swollen split lips he dragged down the switch of his torch and again the cab was in darkness you are my old cocker a heap of trouble fourteen when the big torches came and the guns they would have him against the stream milan shouted orders among the babble of the men of the village make a line search everything coal sheds tool sheds the barns search your houses keep the line the men of the village stood in line as they had been told to waiting for the big torches and the guns to be brought between shouting the orders his eyes flicked down to his watch milan stood on the steps of the school building and behind him were the two swing doors into the hall they had only their small torches sufficient to light a way from their homes to the hall for the social evening and they had no rifles until the firearms were brought from the locked armoury of the headquarters building five clear minutes lost five minutes lost since branko had pushed his way back into the hall licking at his wrist that was bitten and milo had followed him with his hands held across his groin five minutes lost since they had blurted that the bastard had gone and been heard to crash through petars fence and been heard to run into the greenhouse where dragon brought on his spring lettuces he had not seen it for himself and he must take their word on trust behind petars fence and dragons greenhouse was wire and then sodden fields and then the stream that was where they would get him the bastard when he came to the stream the first orders he had given with his barely suppressed fury had been that they should run shit quick to the bridge alert the bridge guards and get themselves across the fields on the far side of the stream they alone had guns and a torch theyd gone fast scuttling in their goddamn shame five minutes lost and men were running back to the school steps with their torches and vuk was panting his way back from the armoury at the headquarters with an armful of rifles with his pockets bulged by the magazines the line was formed it was a muddled story it was something about the bastard breaking clear and rolling under the lorry and then going through petars fence and then breaking dragons greenhouse where was the goddamn lorry but milan had to move the line the torches caught at petars fence and the broken glass of dragons greenhouse there was the clatter in the line of rifles being loaded and cocked he glanced again at his watch they should be in position now on the far side of the stream and they would be raking the bank with their flashlights they would drive the bastard to the bank he gave the order for the line to move and the minutes were crawling and lost milan heard the curses from the line the men wore their best trousers and their best shoes and their best sweaters or jackets the women in their best dresses were streaming from the doorway behind him and they carried away on plates the bread that had been baked for the evening and the fruit and the cheeses that had been taken earlier to the hall it had been an attempt by his trapped village to throw off the mood his own mood and everybodys of being held prisoner and the bastard had destroyed the attempt he searched the faces of the women who carried the food home because they had all heard his name given and all heard the name of dorrie mowat and the bastard had used the word that was coward he searched the faces and none met his and the minutes on his watch were frittering away evica was beside him carrying in a linen cloth the food she had brought for the evening do you have him the excitement of the chase of being the king who gave the orders slipped in him no evica said simply i could not help myself when he looked at me when he asked who had met her he was so so bold i could not help myself when he faced me what does it mean the man coming to make a report there was a shout he did not answer her milan ran across the road at the side fence in petars garden he was shown the plastic box there was a single bread roll in the box with squashed tomato and pressed cheese in the cut in the roll and half a bar of chocolate he felt his nerves squirm in his belly another shout the torches showed him the way he climbed the fence between petars plot and dragons garden milan saw the broken glass pane on the roof of dragons greenhouse and more torches shone inside the greenhouse on the trays of spring lettuces was the fire extinguisher amongst the plants and the shards it had been gone it had been buried and some nights he could even forget it and the bastard had come to bring back for him the face of the young woman he was shouting who saw the lorry was it just one lorry what colour were the lorries which way did the lorries go towards glina or towards vrginmost the minutes slipping on his watch were the white lorries from a convoy of the united nations milan stankovic ran he ran like the athlete he had once been he ran for his life and for the bastards life hoarse chest heaving milan scrambled into the office area of the headquarters the minutes slipping they all badmouthed her back in england she was just a horrid young woman there seemed to be a story about her for every year of her life the stories seemed to queue up to foulmouth her her mum told the stories worst like it was something she had to get release from the way of the release was to find out what happened to her there was no release until her mother knew what happened to her who killed her they were throwing money at it because theyd cash coming out of their ears just go there mr penn and write a bloody report and then we can forget little miss dorrie who was an awkward bitch it was something like that benny listened sometimes the voice behind him stopped when the radio came on when the convoy manager had some crap to tell them from up front he drove carefully and the whole of the convoy was going fast and i came here and it was all lies that had been said about her perhaps at home she had just been a bloody nuisance perhaps she was just a bloody cuckoo child in a second marriage perhaps she just got in the way perhaps she didnt start to live until she was at rosenovici i came here to pocket the money and write a report good bromide stuff a few names and a few quotes good money you know how it is mr stein when youre sucked into something its like youre being pulled towards a cliff why did this one killing in one village matter cant answer it best i can do its something about that young woman i learned about her each time i was told about her then i was pushed closer to that bloody cliff grabbing for the telephone whirring the handle of the field set that linked to the glina military hearing the deathly response of silence milan pushed it aside so that it fell useless to the concrete floor he turned to the radio set that was the backup that sometimes functioned when they had powered out of that godawful village then the cab radios had gone ape shit each driver and the convoy manager wanting to know what the fuck was going on what was the shooting benny hadnt given them a laugh hadnt given them anything until right at the end of the exchanges hed waited to the end then pressed his speak switch and he just said hed seen nothing because theyd have kicked him half to death if theyd known benny listened she was just brilliant i dont think im just some mooning bloody sheep she was incredible it wasnt just that she stayed with the wounded because she loved one boy you see mr stein dorrie could have carried out one boy she was a tough little thing made of barbed wire she could have put one boy on her shoulder and she would have stood a good to middle chance of hiking him into the woods and finding a hole in their lines but that would have been walking out on the other boys she was just brilliant because she gave all of them her courage i was dragged to that cliff dragged over that cliff i looked him in the face i looked into the face of the man who used a knife on her the man who shot her it was like shed given me the courage like she was with me to look into his face and not be afraid i dont suppose that makes much sense mr stein benny said i was going to chuck you out because the shits in the fan because theyll be waiting at the crossing point because im not supposed to get involved i reckon if i laid up for a couple of days rested then i reckon i could swim the river like hell you could benny snapped short theres a rendezvous tomorrow night where theres going to be a boat but im off line for the pickup i dont have a map for the location but i reckon i could swim the river he hadnt used his pencil torch from the dashboard not since right at the beginning from what benny had seen when hed used the torch the guy wouldnt make it to halfway not against the current of the kupa river the rest of the drivers would kill him if they knew you wont be swimming youll be staying bloody put well see whats there at the crossing point it was so slow for milan to make the radio link with glina militia the man who knew the radio was away back at the greenhouse in dragons garden and the procedure for transmission was written up in scrawl on the wall above the set and an imbecile at the other end when he had made the contact and its a spy you lost in salika village you lost a spy what would a spy want with salika village a foreign spy a bored man sitting the night watch on the radio in the glina barracks nursing a bottle and at last there was amusement for him a foreign spy has come to salika village that centre of military secrecy should they know in belgrade that a foreign spy chose to visit salika village losing the minutes could not tell a bored man sitting the night watch on the radio at glina barracks about a grave about an investigator with evidence about a young woman who had not shown fear milan shouted if the crossing point is not closed if the convoy is not searched i will come for you my friend and i will flay the skin off your face when the alarm clamoured for the close support platoon ham was on his bed in the dormitory quarters and reading his best magazine his mother sent it him not often because most times the old cow forgot nagorno karabakh wherever the fuck it was seemed the right place and there were guys already there but then there was also an article with photographs of guys who had made it down to tbilisi wherever the fuck that was the alarm shifted him he was snatching webbing kit going for the dragunov marksmans rifle that was his personal weapon when close support platoon was on immediate buttoning the flies on his camouflage trousers running for the stairs of the old police station and no fucker in the lit yard taking the trouble to explain to him why the alarm had gone he heard among the bloody yelling there was heavy radio traffic on the other side there was a guy running on the other side there was some sort of flap at the crossing point something about a bloody convoy it was all to do with their radio traffic on the other side he was in the lead jeep going down sharp to turanj he thought about penn crazy guy they were slowing the convoy manager was saying distorted in the cab im hooked into their radio theres a problem but i cant make sense of what it is probably just that were so delayed theyre saying they need to search the lorries you know the form guys that we are not supposed to allow un vehicles to be searched he lay behind benny steins seat and the passenger seat he had a rug that covered some of his body he heard the sharp whistle of benny steins breath and heard him mutter an obscenity going down through the gears crawling the voice was saying what im thinking guys is that the laws of the game might just get bent a bit if the choice is between bending or sitting here for the rest of the night high on principle and since weve not any loose women from knin on board ok guys penn said ill do a runner which door the answer was very quiet so calm what im seeing on my side is a big jerk with an ugly machine gun and on the other side three jerks with rifles and what im seeing further up front doesnt get better penn said im sorry i mean that bit late my old cocker theyve stopped ahead were all closing up so helpless it had all been for nothing for nothing he had found the headmaster praying in a grave they were inching forward for nothing he had found katica dubelj eyewitness he waited for the grinding of the brakes for nothing he had found milan stankovic war criminal what are you going to do theyre opening up the cabs ahead my top cats letting them in you know what oscar wilde said he said in matters of grave importance style not sincerity is the vital thing give it a go penn was looking into benny steins face and it was calm as if he was taking the kids out for a sunday afternoon ride going very slow and swinging the big wheel so that the lorry went out of the line that was pulling up then straightening the wheel penn saw the hands go to the gear lever then to the ignition and the engine slurped to quiet a silence around penn and the gentle rocking of the cab going forward the pace of the lorry quickened benny stein was winding down his door window time to see if old oscar had it right they were rolling faster penn heard the first yell and benny stein had his head out of his door window and was howling it into the night the brakes the brakes gone no control because the goddamn brakes had gone going down the incline through turanj penn saw the white sides of the freight lorries slipping by quicker all the time benny stein was yelling that his brakes had gone and waving every miserable mother out of the road going by the landrover and benny stein was turning side of his mouth muttering about shit or bust saying theyd shoot or theyd laugh they hit the checkpoint the cab of the lorry clipped the corner of the sandbag wall he had his head down and he had his hands over his head and he would have said and reckoned hed not lied that benny stein had twisted the wheel the necessary fraction to take out the corner of the sandbags the cab lurched and penn bounced and he thought there was a popping of tyres as if there had been a chain with spikes on the road they were waiting for the shooting or the laughing they went clean through the un barrier broke the pole across the road and the cab pitched worse and he felt the tyres shredding and all the time benny stein was yelling himself hoarse that the brakes had gone the lorry jerked and he saw the wall loom against the cabs passenger side window and that slowed it and penn saw benny steins hand furtively slip to the brake handle and he saw his foot pump the brake pedal but gently so that the ripped tyres did not scream they came to rest penn croaked that mr stein was style get out you told a good story i said that i was sorry it was because you talked a good story get lost benny steins hand fleshy reached and caught at penns collar and he was dragged through the gap between the seats and shoved out of the open door he lay in the road beside the ribboned front tyre the door above him was scraped the fender in front of him was dented deep thank you penn called back up at the slammed door of the cab he crawled to the side of the road to the heaped rubble of a collapsed house benny had jumped down from the cab and was striding towards the broken pole of the united nations block and the wrecked sandbags of the serb block so tired and all the pain was back with him he looked past the soldiers and the woman was running with flapping legs towards him she came across the road from where she had been standing beside a car he saw in the lights of the crossing point her concern and ham had broken clear of the group of soldiers and was ambling towards him there was shouting back up the hill and he heard bennys voice loud they all danced for dorrie he danced for her and ulrike schmidt who gazed into his face and ham who walked towards him with a wide smile and benny stein who was yelling hard about the failure of his brakes she had touched them and they danced for her youre a fucking mess squire how was it and if ulrike had not had hold of his arm and if ham had not taken him under the armpit he would have gone down evica said so he could be this side of the line or he could have gone milan lay fully dressed still in his suit on the top blanket of the bed evica pressed so he could have been in the lorry that crashed the checkpoint the dirt of his suit and his shoes would be on the top blanket milan said empty i dont know evica held his hand and on the hand was the mud of petars garden and dragons garden what will happen to us if he went through the line all that he had all that he leaned on was the wife beside him and the child sleeping in the next room milan said what i was told was that one day they will come for me in a month in a year when i am old one day perhaps their children will come for our child one day we have to wait for the day they come because we cannot run cannot run anywhere because of what has happened of course i have known there will be revenge one day but it was vague just in my head but it was said to me direct at the liaison meeting and you know his wife and he said that one day direct if it were not him that came for me then it would be his son that would come for our marko it would go on for ever as long as the memory lives of what was done like a curse on us and on marko maybe i did not believe him and then the englishman came and i was named it had been a safe world before the englishman came we on our side of the line they on theirs they could not come across the line and reach us they could sit in karlovac town they could say what the shit they wanted but they could not touch me and then the englishman came to us to me i believe him the liaison i believe now that they will come for me one day or that his son will come for our marko if i had known i would not have not have killed her but then you thought you were safe not have killed the girl evica said he made me remember her two afternoons and i remember them when she came to our shop for food because their own shop had nothing it was three weeks before the fight it was after the children had gone home you told me and she sat in my room at the school and we talked in english i told her there would be no fighting between our village and her village i told her there was no quarrel between us she spoke of her home and her mother what her home was like and what her mother did we cannot run and we cannot hide through the gap of the curtains evica saw the first light of the new day she said sad we have to live we have to wait as she waited in the field but we have to live soft gentle fingers moving on the wounds a womans fingers and tender he was in the cellar and there was only the light of a small tallow candle he was the wounded and the face of the young woman was above him and her fingers dabbed sweet at the wounds with sharp iodine and salted water she touched him and she had no fear he loved her the young woman who cared for the wounded in the cellar penn stirred his eyes flickered the fingers with the cotton wool were close to his eyes god and his face hurt it was a womans room bright and alive and the candle in the cellar was gone and there were flowers on a table across the room from the bed ham sat on the floor his back against a neat chest and he held the longbarrelled rifle across his knees ulrike flashed her smile nervous and short embarrassed and she was pushing up from beside the bed as if she had been kneeling close to him as she had cleaned his face wounds and sterilized them ham said you cut it fine squire you got through before theyd organized their communications are pissawful you wouldnt have got through half an hour later that driver did you well theres not another fucker other than me and the lady knows you were up aboard how much did you drop the driver squire penn said i told him why id gone he said that he wanted to go back to zagreb make his report and buy the biggest bottle of scotch in the city and they said that theyd share it it was morning they helped him to dress ulrike carefully and ham roughly and the pain of the kicks and the punches had stiffened to each corner of his body he thought he would always remember long after he had written the report and drunk the scotch the image of a cellar and wounded men and a young woman without fear he went hunting trouble first thing marty had talked it through with the doctor from vukovar his landlord and the doctor had steeled him to it he had talked it through because the longdistance telephone call had woken them both in the apartment and half the night they had sat over coffee and the doctor had toughened him to it it was raining soft like it did in the spring in anchorage when the snow melted as marty strode across the central grass towards the steps and doors of a block he had gone hunting trouble before opening up the converted freight container there would need to have been a gi provost on the door of the suite of the director of civilian affairs to have stopped him the goddamn phone call in the bad half of the night hadnt been from geneva but goddamn new york marty went past the secretaries to the door and didnt knock he went on in they were round the directors desk marty saw on the sleeves of their uniforms the insignia of canada and jordan and argentina they had a big map over the desk and the director was with them and looking at the maps detail through a magnifying glass and a cigarette hung from his lips and they turned the soldiers and the director in annoyed surprise he hammered i just wanted to say that i am not prepared to be treated like crap any more and i just wanted to say that i find it incredible that one united nations agency is active in blocking the work of another united nations programme i find it shameful that you have gone behind my back to sabotage my work what the fuck are you talking about i am talking about getting pitched out of my cot in the goddamn middle of the night by new york to tell me that my work is causing offence my work is a nuisance i will not tolerate that goddamn crap i will not tolerate you crawling behind my back to get new york to order me to cool it are you with me if you go now you can go down the stairs on your feet if you wait one minute youll go down the stairs on your face because i am inconvenient because listen to me you silly young man listen hard there were refugees supposed to be coming through turanj crossing point today but the crossing point is closed there was an aid convoy supposed to be going through turanj today but its passage has been cancelled thats not my problem my work is to prepare war crimes listen ill tell you my problem they have a maximum alert along their line they are leaping about like theyve pokers up their arses our movement is quite restricted why there is some garbled story about a war crimes investigator captured and escaped i know nothing too fucking right i doubt you know the length of your dick my job is to keep our access into sector north and all this is after i suggested to new york that i could do without a wetbehindtheears puppy giving me shit from the high moral ground where glina municipality marty looked at the map where the magnifying glass rested where the rumour is he was picked up in rosenovici he swayed he felt the cold on him he remembered what he had seen the man in the transit centre the man with ulrike he remembered the lecture he had given goddamn patronizing and the answer ive just a report to write then im gone he remembered the bosnian muslim woman that the man had talked to and she had been in rosenovici he rocked its just a rumour i am a busy man do you wish to leave on your feet or on your face marty had no more anger he let himself out quietly it was the irregulars from glina town who interrogated the headmaster they were the men of arkan who was zeljko raznjatovic and they called themselves the tigers and they were men freed from gaol cells in belgrade they had come at first light from glina and they had taken control of the headquarters building in salika they had come to the village because he was known to them because milan had once posed for a photograph in front of the war memorial with their leader arkan it was as if his only function that morning was to make them coffee they had taken his room and his radio and his desk and they stubbed out their cigarettes against the bared stomach of the headmaster the screaming rang in milans ears it was the agonized screaming of the man who had taught him at school of the man who had been evicas friend with the cigarettes crushed and stubbed out milan heard of the englishmans journey of discovery and of katica dubelj who was the journeys guide after the screaming and the telling the irregulars of arkan took the headmaster from the cell of the headquarters and out into the road that cut the village they wore plain belted onepiece uniforms of greygreen and when they came out into the road they had put black hoods over their faces so that only their mouths and their eyes were visible out in the road they did not need milan to bring them coffee so they sent him from house to house in the village to get the people to come and watch and he did as he was ordered until there was a small crowd in front of the headmasters home he could not face his own people nor could he face the headmaster who was made to stand in front of the door of his home nor could he face the weeping wife of the headmaster who was held back by the irregulars they shot him first in the legs and then in the stomach so that death would be slow when the headmaster died the men of the village and milan led by the irregulars were climbing the track in the woods going where the headmaster had told them they should go ulrike drove the car and ham talked all the way ham talked his bullshit of battles and fire fights and ulrike drove and said nothing and penn lay across the back seat of the car he was leaving behind him dorries place he was quitting dorries war the boot print was sharp in the mud of the track and the man had worn military boots when he had been brought to the school they had the clear tread of the boot to tell them that the headmaster had not lied when the cigarettes had been stubbed out against his stomach and the evidence quickened their pace up the track through the trees there was a light rain falling in the trees and heavy cloud coming from beyond the hill and milan could see the rain later would be heavier he was at the head of the column and walked immediately in front of the leader of the irregulars his own people were behind him and he could not see their faces and he did not know what their enthusiasm for the work was it was where the headmaster had said it would be the cave entrance between the two large rocks and in the worn mud close to the entrance was the boot print squashed over the lighter traces milan could smell her there were many torches crowded into the narrow cleft of the caves entrance and the beams caught her there was laughter behind milan the torches found her cringing back at the far wall of the cave like a trapped rat there was more laughter behind milan milan turned he called forward milo who had the scratches on the cheeks of his face and he gestured forward stevo who had the bruised privates there were many pressing behind him to see the trapped rat that was katica dubelj who had fed him and most of them with their lunches at the school she was the trapped rat and her mouth seemed to snarl at the torch lights and she had no teeth and she was the evidence he knew that the man had not been found and he knew that a lorry with failed brakes had crashed the checkpoint at turanj and he knew that his name was on a file in karlovac and on another file made by the political officer at topusko and the trapped rat was the eyewitness he wondered if he would tell evica the hand of the leader of the irregulars was on his shoulder pushing him into the cave youre not telling me in honesty that you wrote it up of course i wrote it up arnold i wrote up what you told me georgie it was in confidence georgie simpson didnt like to face him not that he would have described arnold browne as a friend not really possible for six men to be friends with five men but he was almost fond of the man they had nothing in common not hobbies not holidays not career paths but he had come rather to enjoy their weekly session and weekly lunch that would all be behind them now the sessions and the lunches there would be different men given the job and few enough confidences exchanged then he didnt like to face him because arnold browne made no attempt to hide his quite positive anguish im not proud and im not a happy man i put a memorandum in i reported our conversation this morning arnold and i might face a firing squad for telling you this morning i was summoned on high i was instructed to telephone you arrange an extraordinary meeting i was to pump you arnold you said your man was dogged you reported my confidences back you should know what i said georgie simpson ignored the sarcasm no citations to be won here best ignored you said your man would go to the end of the road we have a listening post at zagreb airport we monitor serb radio traffic principally we have troops in bosnia we have to know whats planned please dont interrupt me arnold please dont the radios are monitored twentyfour hours but obviously were not wasting our time interpreting whether general mladic wants express delivery of new loo paper soft tissue we have trigger words when a trigger word comes up then the transmission gets classified immediate for analysis obviously their tonguetwisted version of british is a trigger its been pretty shambolic transmission but we picked up british spy and british investigator captured then escaped and the transmission was coming out of a village called salika and there was a name what im telling you arnold in confidence is that salika is adjacent to rosenovici and the name of the spy investigator is penn he thought he might have smacked poor arnold browne across the bridge of the nose to make his eyes water what are you going to do your people are out of their depth arnold they are meddling in matters beyond their remit our station officer zagreb if your dogged mr penn gets safe back to base will pick him up by the scruff of his neck and throw him on the first plane to heathrow and your lovely lady will be told by my hairyarsed director to cease interfering your penn is a busted flush im afraid and well be taking his legs off at the knees sorry arnold but its a sharp game ours and thats the way itll always be corner penn dictated and ulrike typed and ham whined away in the corner he was rambling contradicting himself coming to stand behind her and reading what she had down on paper and changing it it was full of errors because it was an old standup typewriter that she had begged from reception and the arms were forever sticking because it had been on the floor of the back office and was clogged with muck ham was muttering to himself wallowing in his own pity and they ignored him except for when he filled the glasses no i need what alija said before i have what sylvia said and what alija said should be in direct quotation because she is the more important eyewitness the women who were with me they said she was so brave the women said she was an angeli want that in direct quote so where then does maria go does she go after the american you know what this will do penn when it reaches them it will break them you know that right for the top copy maria and then alija and then sylvia and then your journey ham said splashing the drink from the bottle get it down you squire cause you bloody earned it and dont leave yourself short of credit take the bloody credit for what you did we never got the bloody credit for what we did the internationals when we held those fuckers at sisak if theyd broken us at sisak where billy and jon jo were zapped where herb who was awol from the guards was fragged where the big oz guy went theyd have been in fucking zagreb for tea didnt give us any bloody credit you make double bloody certain squire those posh smart arses know what you did slow going in the hotel room the writing of penns report and what it would do to them that was not his problem because mrs chadwick had the flu mary worked in the kitchen alone most times when there was dinner for friends mrs chadwick came in to help mary was happier alone actually other friends of course had daughters still at home who would flick the recipe pages and find the outrageous and get the exotic into the aga the sun was going down slanting through the window and onto the wide pine table she hadnt a daughter she worked briskly at what she did best boring food she had the clock on the wall to guide her and if she worked briskly then everything would be in place and there would still be time for her in the last light to walk the dogs through the village to the church the report was two sheets closely spaced typing and there were penns last notes handwritten in the margin he glanced down at the two sheets and the words were a jumble for his eyes there was precious little left in the bottle and there was precious little down on two sheets of typing paper precious little to tell of eleven days they were all allocated their lines and they had caps for the typing of their names he should have felt an elation should have felt proud and strutted the length of the room but there was only an emptiness he should have wanted to share his pride he had no conceit it did not seem significant to him that he had made the march learned and ultimately broken clear from the certainty of death he had been close to dorrie and he thought that he had joined the queue of those who had failed her in his terms her life was worth just a report it was the measure of how she had driven him mocked him that his best effort was just a report it was as if in his mind she had given him the one chance of his life to walk alone from the herd to walk tall above the herd and he had failed to take that chance he felt a failed man not a changed man the old disciplines were supreme a clear and brief report sent immediately a fuller report to follow just what he would have done after a weeks session in the surveillance team what he would have done for a client of alpha security he would never forget her and now he would turn his back on her he would go back to the office above the launderette and the maisonette that was too small people liked to say there was one bloody chance in this bloody life and they were probably bloody well right he glanced down at the sheets of paper and ulrike looked up at him and she waited for him to nod his satisfaction he wondered whether the report would be read in the kitchen or taken to the old elegance of the sitting room whether she would take it upstairs to dorries bedroom just a mass of words now blurred by the scotch but the names with the caps were highlighted three lines for the croatian war crimes investigator seven lines for the american professor of pathology five lines each for maria and alija and sylvia four lines for the croatian liaison officer three lines for ham who had gotten him there four lines for benny stein who had taken him out of there fifteen lines for the headmaster twentyone lines for katica dubelj and on the lower half of the second page were twentyfive lines that quoted the words and described the body and face and the village of milan stankovic under the long paragraph concerning milan stankovic killer of dorrie mowat there had been room for ulrike to type his name penn nodded he was satisfied he took the rooms gratis biro and he scribbled his signature above his own typed name and then he wrote the fax number with the international code at the top of the first sheet it was his report and he was finished he put his hand momentarily on ulrikes shoulder and he felt the hardness of her bones and he took his hand away in shyness because he could remember the soft fingers that had dabbed the iodine into the cuts on his face the road had turned at the point that the road had started she had been a horrid young woman and he could see the last time that his tired eyes speedread across the two pages the words courage and bravery and love and angel he hoped that she would read it in the bedroom alone where she could not be seen just bland bloody words that filled two pages of a report and they did no justice to so many and they shortchanged the headmaster and katica dubelj just a bloody inadequate report no place for the fear no space for the terror just a report something that money could buy when it was thrown at a problem he hoped she would read it in the bedroom alone because his report might just break mary braddock you still with us squire ham slurred still with you ham let me give you my advice good advice from real combat ham belched and he was rolling across the room and the last of the bottle was going on the desk and on the typewriters keys its just a fucking job squire what you need squire is a little of the old home comfort a lot of the old bottle you need to get well pissed have a bit of a cuddle forget it because it was just a fucking job he saw the kind care of ulrike different to the standoff mischief love of dorrie perhaps it was old home comfort perhaps it promised a bit of a cuddle probably it was getting well pissed he might ring jane in the morning and he might not he might get a plane in the morning and he might wait until the afternoon the city moved noisily below the window of the hotel room it would be a long time penn thought before he heard again a silence like that of rosenovici village and the lane past katica dubeljs house to the field and the grave pit in the field dont come back empty squire penn let himself out of the room he walked down the corridor towards the wide central staircase and the sharpness of the pain in his body was replaced by a stiff ache that was everywhere there was a television crew in the lobby with their boxes around them and their light meters and clipboards and their selfimportance and they noticed him as he came down the stairs and the plasters and the cuts and the bruises and the grazes seemed to amuse them he asked for a bottle of scotch at the reception soonest charged to his room and he gave the woman on reception the two sheets of paper for the fax yes send it now please fifteen good god didnt realize it was so late henry carter had a watch on his wrist and there was the big digit clock on the wall and it was many hours since he had looked at either past midnight and time did not seem any more to matter that much not now that he had reached the chronological moment when the fax sheets assumed relevance the supervisor apologetic as if it were an intrusion to disturb him handed him a bacon sandwich thats really too kind thats very considerate the time just seems to have run away with me as it had the dragon of the day shift would not have brought him a bacon sandwich not if he had been faint with hunger and the dragon would most certainly not have permitted the transistor radio that played jazz piano rather a pleasant atmosphere if he had not had the photocopies of the fax sheets in front of him he pushed them aside so that the diced onion filling would not fall on them it was as if they tolerated him as a harmless fool without snap or bite but the old desk warrior had the hard core of experience that helped him to understand only too well the compulsion that pushed men forward one memory hurt him the worst mattie furniss running a section revered and respected had been held in a torture cell in the iranian town of tabriz and had broken out mattie furniss given up for lost had walked alone to the mountains on the turkish border proud mattie furniss had declined to admit that the pain of torture had broken him theyd sent for carter summoned the weasel carter the weasel had destroyed good old mattie furniss and won from him the truth of course there were bloody casualties in this life mattie furniss with the shotgun barrel in his mouth and his toe on the trigger was a casualty he could see as yesterday the church hear as yesterday the hymns recall as yesterday the shame as he had sat far from the altar and the widow with her daughters the file on the desk in front of him taking on an ordered shape scratched the memories totally illegal cooking on the premises weve had to invest in a very powerful deodorant spray the sort for the most sweaty armpits are you going through the night mr carter looks like it im hoping to get away at lunch time midwales to tell you the truth this isnt the sort of file that id want to leave over until next month interesting one he spoke through a mouthful of the bacon sandwich so good plenty of fat left on the bacon not just interesting rather tragic and its a text book on interference what happens when you shove your nose in without thinking through the end game sorry thats rather a heavy speech if youll excuse me oh and thank you so much for the sustenance the supervisor of the night shift drifted away and his feet glided and his hips swayed with the motion of the jazz beat there were many triggers to what had happened to the tragedy but he thought the two sheets of the photocopied fax message were at the heart of the matter the music was gentle lulling him but he was too old a dog to be seduced by atmosphere gentle music did not ameliorate a barbarity the two sheets of paper sent from the hotel in zagreb would have been a sledgehammer knocking down the doors of mary braddocks home he returned to them drew the blood from them report on the death of dorothy mow at miss by william penn alpha security ltd prelim report interviews govt croatia war crimes investigator is preparing evidence for future use in war crimes prosecution no interest shown in this particular case of killing of dorothy mowat dm a foreigner professor of pathology ucla supervised exhumation of dm killed with sovietmade makharov pistol a fine young woman because she did not have to be there because she stayed with the wounded from the battle for rosenovici tho she herself was not a casualty could have made her own escape at the end dm was trying to shield one young wounded fighter from the knives and the blows and from the gunshot eyewitness imaria and the sledgehammer would have brought a cold wind into mary braddocks home they get on wonderfully but then jocastas such a caring girl and tarquins so easy its such a relief it was prawns and crab with cubes of turbot done in a cheesy sort of sauce for the first course guests didnt talk not these recessionridden days about the value of their houses nor about the cost of the school fees nor about their jules verne holidays houses were repossessed children had to be withdrawn from schools holidays for some were impossible safe talk talk that would not in ignorance wound was about how firstmarriage children tolerated secondmarriage children charles always poured the neighbours fierce gins before bringing them into the dining room he was good at giving the conversation a hefty kickstart and children were safe talk i dont know how id do without emily she wants to be a nanny poor sweetheart shes getting the training with ben dont know how id do without her the belgians hadnt finished eating mary wondered if they slept together the big belgian with the stomach and the little belgian with the shaved head they hadnt finished and they hadnt said much as if the offspring melding of first and secondmarriage children was low down on their agenda well it would be wouldnt it if they slept together it was prattle conversation washing over her and when the bloody belgians had finished she could get back to her kitchen and heave the bloody lamb out of the aga oven tanyas become really excellent at soccer thats because jake is so marvelous with her but i do worry for jake jake gets more soccer with tanya than with his father his fathers quite hopeless mary stood if the bloody belgians didnt like her crab and prawns and turbot in a cheesy sort of sauce then they could bloody go without one perfunctory can i lend a fist mary from giles the bankruptcy accountant and a curt shake of her head she put the bowls on the tray we were allowed to have jocasta for christmas but only after a solicitors letter lovely darling quite delicious shes so much happier with us she carried the tray out of the dining room she left the door ajar if the manor house had not been listed grade then theyd have been able to knock a hatch through from the kitchen but charles had said that a hatch knocked through would be an act of heritage vandalism she toed open the door of the kitchen and clattered the tray down onto the table she was by the aga she was away from them and they could talk now freely ditch the safe talk she heard them do you think shes getting over it charles god what a trial for you both charles she put you both through a hell of a hoop charles but mary particularly i think you showed the patience of saints dont take me wrong charles but i think dorothy was quite wicked and god knows where that came from times a great healer charles like an open window with a smell time will make her forget mary heard their voices and she heard the low bleeping from her den room not much more than a broom cupboard off the kitchen she had the lamb in the basting dish out of the aga oven and onto the table she was tipping her vegetables potatoes and carrots and leeks everything that was boring into the serving dishes if the bloody belgians hadnt taken so long then the cutlets wouldnt have dried out she tilted her head and she could see over the back of the settee in her den room to the fax machine on the table beside the television and she saw the paper spilling out and judy with her tail silly wagging tail had broken the plastic frame that caught the completed faxed messages and liz would chew anything that was paper or cardboard and judy and liz were craning from their baskets on either side of the aga alerted by the working sounds of the machine she left the vegetables and the lamb cutlets and the gravy and the jelly she strode off into her den room on her mission of protection for the fax message she picked the first sheet off the floor and the second sheet was rolling she read the address of the headed notepaper and the title of the message and the name of the sender she sat on her sofa and the dogs came against her legs and she read she heard the voices through the opened door of the kitchen across the hall through the opened door of the dining room so much love for such an undeserving child i think shes coming to terms with it the reality that dorothy was just a shameful little minx such a dreadful place she went to i wont read about in the newspapers i switch the telly off when its sarajevo shes got to wash it out of her mind its not our responsibility if they want to behave like animals there i think shes on the mend you should take her away charles about as far away as you can go where that dreadful girl can be forgotten she read what she had demanded to know eyewitness maria refugee from rosenovici dm had come to the village with a croataustralian boy who joined village defence force was wounded dm carried wounded back from front line to the cellar there when

old silver frame on the table beside the fax machine because charles never came there she had the photograph in her den room she read well my dear you wanted to be told and you have been he said it

and so sad they were all trapped by young dome mowat who was dead all trapped mary and penn benny and ham and the eyewitnesses and the headmaster and this most extraordinary old woman and himself all flies in the skein web of the spider that was dome mowat would you like some more coffee mr carter the supervisor called across the library floor they didnt have it in my day but then that sort of music would never have been allowed in library in my day i dont suppose youve any brandy we all demand the truth but we very seldom stop to consider the consequences of knowing the truth there was brandy cheap and spanish kept in a locked drawer of the supervisors desk hidden from the day shift and poured for him into his coffee mug they were all looking at him each young man and each young woman on the night shift as though he were just a sad tired old desk warrior trapped in nostalgia by a file she came very quietly down the stairs but then she knew which step creaked carrying her bag and her shoes they were still talking still discussing her in the dining room as she went silently back into her kitchen youve got a chance now charles and youd better damn well take it like someones overboard and you go into the water to get them out double damn quick youve got a chance now to rescue her my nephew was down in bosnia driving warriors he said that standards of common decency dont exist its a cruel madhouse we should all turn our backs to it until they come to their senses and so should mary shes such a lovely woman and the strain shes been under the stress so many years its been pitiful to see i tell you charles each time i came here when i left id say to libby thank god that childs not ours mary took the last saucepan off the agas hot surface and she closed up the agas lids the dogs slavering mouths were sitting either side of the table and the tray with the cutlets was between them she covered up the vegetables she took her coat from the hook behind the door and the keys for her car do you think charles that mary needs a hand jocastas such a help emilys always there when i need her mary took a sheet from the memory pad she wrote gone away dorries business back soon dont ever let those bastards and bitches into our house again mary it was charless business maxim never to explain never to apologize she left the note under the gravy boat where hed see it when he came searching she wondered how long it would take them the stupid puerile bastards and the malicious scavenging bitches before they came to offer help and she wondered whether judy and liz would have beaten them to the lamb cutlets she was drawn back a last time to look at the photograph in her den room mary said darling understand me i am so sorry and i am so proud she slipped out carrying her bag and her coat through the kitchen door closing it carefully after her she would drive away through the village leave it behind her behind her would be the garden of the manor house where she had that afternoon picked spring flowers for the lounge arrangements and behind her would be the brick cottage with the climbing wisteria where the old widow with the varicose veins lived whom she had visited that afternoon and behind her would be the smiling greeting of the butcher where she had bought her meat that afternoon and her neighbours and her friends who had been a part of her life that afternoon all behind her there was a bitter wind on her face a cleansing wind when he had no audience then he hated to be alive sometimes the drink made ham morose and selfpitying and sometimes it made him loud and aggressive he sat on the floor of the hotel room and the dragunov rifle with the big telescopic sight was on the carpet near his stretched legs and he held loose to the bottles neck and the bottle was going down he felt such morose selfpity because he was alone and they ignored him they were on the wide bed he could see penns head and he might have been sleeping and he might just have been lying still with his eyes closed and he could see the fingers of the german woman playing smooth patterns on the skin of penns face penn was his nightmare when he was alone his nightmare was capture and capture was torture they always tortured the foreigners he could see penns face where her fingers made the patterns and his face was the start of the torture there were many nightmares for ham when he was alone torture was the worst but the fears when he was alone competed with torture the small kid in the tower block his father long gone with the acne bullied and rejected his karen holding tight to his dawn and carrying the suitcase to the door of the married quarters house and wearing the bruise he had given her with his fist and her not looking back as she walked to the taxi and his bawling after her because he was rejected his sunray commanding officer of rd battalion parachute regiment reading the riot act at the depot in aldershot telling him it wouldnt go to court but that his services were no longer required rejected him being told the bastard sneering that he didnt fit into the scene at personal security ltd bodyguards wasnt smart enough with the clients didnt keep his mouth shut enough with the clients going at the end of the week rejected his getting pissed up in the bunker at osijek and the crap guy howard needling him because he had the photograph of his karen and his dawn and the gun pulled to shut the bastard up and the shot in the bunker blasting his ears and the blood on his body and the other internationals chucking him out and letting him know that they didnt want him when they headed for bosnia rejected the nightmares of rejection pushed close to the worst nightmare when he was alone and the man on the bed with the woman he was different the man penn listened to what he said with no shitty sneers the man on the bed thanked him penn didnt shout at him didnt rubbish him there hadnt been officers like penn at para hadnt been management like penn at personal security ltd bodyguards hadnt been commanders like penn in the internationals penn listened and penn thanked him no other bastard did because he was close to penn ham felt safe from the nightmares and he believed what penn told him believed that penn would take the flight out in the afternoon when hed slept and sobered and go find his dawn and his karen he thought penn the best man he ever knew have you any bloody idea what the time is georgie simpson said miserably its past one here and if you didnt know it there is a time difference between london and zagreb i have it is in the morning he could hear down the telephone line a baby crying im sorry i was told to speak to you personally they seemed to think it urgent i was told it wasnt to go by telex so damned urgent that it couldnt wait till the morning he ignored sarcasm by habit and georgie simpson had never been elevated to the responsibility of running a field station and he had never ceased to wonder at the goddamn arrogance of field officers abroad wearing a first secretarys cover it was not the moment to let it be known that his own office from which he had telephoned zagreb at twohour intervals from eleven oclock the previous morning had the heating off and was cold as the grave you werent in your office and neither your secretary nor your wife knew when you were returning im sorry we dont run by the clock here ive actually been in sector east not that youd know where that is ive actually been in a quite bloody unpleasant area not that youd understand it well whats so important can we go to secure there were clicks on the line a sharp bleep then the voice level from zagreb was at reduced volume give it me georgie simpson gave the name of william penn described the nature of his assignment spoke of security service meddling i met him i gave him a useless start point he came to see me i told him to let the dead sleep i told him to go away he felt he held the high ground felt more cheerful didnt listen to you im afraid pity that youve been out of touch if youd been in touch then youd know of events in sector north we think hell be back in zagreb by now get him on the first plane will you yes and it was not georgie simpsons business to concern himself with penn not for him to consider the effect of his telephone call on secure to zagreb he was just the joe who passed on messages from an unheated office in the small hours of the night but curiosity stirred in him you said that youd met him i did does it matter personally i regard it as late for conversation i just wondered about him i mean what on earth did he do it for i am actually rather tired theyre a bit pathetic these sort of people dig into their lives and youll find angst are you following me theyre failures and theyre looking for a way back myself if i needed to up the dose of selfrespect then i hope dear god that i could find an easier way than trekking into sector north its a bad hook to be caught with because there are likely to be tears at the end of the line dont ever bloody well ring me at this time again my apologies to your wife sorry i woke the baby ulrike thought the squat little man in the uniform that was a size too large on the floor with the longbarrelled rifle beside his legs was like a guard dog sitting without speaking sitting and always watching the mercenary did not matter to her she lay on the bed beside penn and she stroked his face and his chest where she had unbuttoned the front of his shirt long enough it had taken holy christ for her to follow her mothers message ulrike schmidts mother told a story of a friend the friend lived at rosenheim on the autobahn and the train route from munich to salzburg so it was easy for her mother to travel to see her and to update the story her mothers friend made preparations for each stage of her life at chess speed the education that would present her with maximum earning capability the husband who would be a rock for her the holidays that would relax and divert her the home that would be pleasant and convenient for her her mothers friend could no longer find a private bank to employ her and was locked in a loveless marriage and had been food poisoned the last winter in mombasa and the home was mortgaged to the bank as collateral to her husbands failing business and the friend her mother said stuck stubbornly to the principle that everything must be planned for and it was rubbish all the planning all the preparation that had sifted through job opportunities weighed the young suitors agonized over brochures to the sun toured housing developments was rubbish her mother said coded for ulrike each time she flew from zagreb to munich for the weekend that her friend had never known the freedom of impulse she lay on her side some of the night he had been awake but he was sleeping now she lay on her side her head held up by her crooked arm and she watched over the peace of his sleep and her fingers moved gently over the bared ribcage that showed the colouring of bruises it was her impulse her mothers marriage had been impulse few would have looked at the harrowed man her father mourning the death of a loved one in the bombing of magdeburg and inconsolable a teacher without a school her mothers impulse had brought long love long happiness she would tell her mother about penn when she next flew to munich for the weekend she could see the two faces in the photograph frame on the bedside table the young woman with thin lips and the baby without hair but it was her impulse to protect the man who had walked alone into sector north not love because she did not know love love was beyond her experience it was attraction and it was interest and it was fascination she wanted to protect him lie close to him and in the loneliness of her life his sleeping body seemed to bring a comfort to her and by protecting him she thought she might show him her gratitude he deserved her gratitude he had done what she craved to do and was not able to he had confronted the bastards of the uniforms and the guns a tiny gesture maybe but few others did it what she wanted what she could not have was to make happiness for him to take him from the bed and march him into the old city and hear the music throb and take him in her arms and dance dance wildly dance till the dawn came what she wanted was to dance with him and laugh with him and wear a flower that he had given her but he slept and she protected him and the morning would come too soon and the aircraft would scream from the runway and penn would be gone back with his cuts and bruises to the young woman with the thin lips and the baby without hair he had walked into sector north just to write a report and the report was gone and she had never met another man in her life who would have walked into sector north just to establish the truth that was necessary for a report when he had woken when he had sobered up when he had gone on the plane then she would return to the daily and nightly misery of the transit centre she sat in her car and watched the milk float judder down the street she was parked up outside the terraced house it was a neat street decorated and smartened with bright window boxes of pansies and hanging ivy when the milkman had passed she left her car and went to the front door and rang the bell it was four minutes past six in the morning she shivered she waited she stretched because she had been sat in her car for three and a half hours before the milk float had turned into the street she heard slow feet coming clumsily down the stairs behind the door she had been to his wedding charles was a friend of his parents she flexed her hands felt her nerves rasping the door opened blinking eyes in the halflight a loose dressing gown bare feet tousled hair good god mrs braddock what on earth he was half her age charles said he was very clever charles had said that if her dorrie hadnt been such a bloody messer then jasper williamson would have been the right sort of man please i do apologize i need advice eyes narrowing what sort of advice she stood on the step he was the only one she could have come to she could not have come to any of the fat cat lawyers who were charless friends she said in meekness international law i suppose thats what its called eyes concentrating what sort of international law she blurted prosecution of war criminals somehow he understood straight away because of dorrie youd better come in mrs braddock fraid its a bit of a tip had people in last night i was sorry to hear about dorrie i can only tell you the basics he led her into the long living area and he seemed not to know where to start with the filled ashtrays and the dirtied glasses and the emptied bottles and she told him that he shouldnt bother she took the two sheets of fax paper from her handbag and gave them to him and hed groped for the mantelpiece and his spectacles she thought that hed probably have reckoned dorrie to be quite awful like everyone had like she had he sank down onto the sofa and he started to read and she began to collect up the glasses and the ashtrays and took them through to the kitchen didnt know much did she knew how to bloody tidy up didnt know much about mothering did she knew how to bloody wash up he was reading slowly and hed found a pad of paper and hed started to take notes when she had all the glasses and all the ashtrays and all the bottles away into the kitchen when she had run the hot water into the sink mary came and stood behind him she could read over his shoulder what he read milan stankovic see ms above commander of para militaries in salika village formerly clerk to agricultural produce cooperative aged early to middle thirties tall approx ll athletic build no facial distinguishing scars etc beard and full hair dark brown eyes greyblue well dressed suit for social evening quite obviously the undisputed leader of the community after capture i was taken to salika school hall punched by ms interrogated by ms through interpreter gave my name confirmed my nationality to ms told him purpose of my journey to sector north told ms that he had been identified to me as the killer of dm my impression ms deeply shaken by being named through interpreter in front of his village peers from my kit he had seen photographs i carried of dm after exhumation my impression was that he recognized dms facial features evasive and unsettled when confronted with my accusation of guilt after villagers beat me he gave the order for me to be taken away dont know intended destination dont know whether i was to be executed immediately or later managed to break free in confused situation i am not trained in escape and evasion i believe my life was saved by intervention of bs see above i have no doubt that dm was murdered by the direct actions stabbing and beating and shooting of milan stankovic of salika village in glina municipality faithfully william penn alpha security ltd right mrs braddock what do you want to know i want to know how i can nail that bastard to the floor give me a few minutes she went back into the kitchen she filled the kettle for coffee and she started to rinse through the glasses she saw that he was reading the two faxed sheets a second time she wondered if he still thought dorrie to be quite awful like everyone had like she had a young woman came down the stairs naked so pretty so different from the young woman in virginal wedding white and didnt seem to notice that an intruder had usurped her sink and was making free with her coffee the young woman picked up a packet of cigarettes and wafted away back up the stairs clever young jasper who would have been right for dorrie if she hadnt been such a bloody messer was pulling thick books off the shelves and he took the coffee mug without comment mary dried the glasses she cleaned the ashtrays she stacked the empty bottles outside the back door she wiped the wood surfaces down she found the vacuum cleaner in the cupboard and ran it over the carpet his head was down in the books and he had torn strips of paper as markers and his pencil writing was filling the pages of the notepad the young woman came down the stairs white blouse and executive blazer and discreet navy skirt with a briefcase and kissed clever young jasper and was gone out onto the street he didnt seem to notice her he hadnt touched the coffee shed made him he put the books back onto the shelves he stapled the handwritten sheets together with the two faxed pages its all there mrs braddock its a bit complicated but if you take it slowly im in court in an hour of course its possible to prosecute but what it needs is the determination without that determination then the world just rolls on the notes are halsburys laws its volume youll have to excuse me mrs braddock but ive got to move you see its not important whether dorothy is now the english rose or whether she was an awkward little bitch a crime is a crime is a crime the british jurisdiction would be pretty complicated what with yugoslavia not being a country any more and it being a civil war but the geneva convention on the treatment of prisoners sews it up theres a procedure in place now for dealing with war crimes in former yugoslavia it can happen if theres the determination ive got to go and dress mrs braddock whether that determination exists well youll find that out its not for me to say whether you can nail that bastard to the floor i just dont know thank you she took his notes from what he called halsburys laws volume put them in her handbag i want to hear him scream only one problem but its cardinal its one thing to find the determination of the great and the glorious to prosecute something else to have the accused man in custody where are you going to walk to be alone i have to open the school to be alone he didnt think his wife had slept and he had heard most chimes of the church clock they were in the kitchen and marko was still at the table and hanging back on his breakfast because there was crisis between his mother and his father it was what milan would have expected from evica she had to open the school she had to make the pretence of normality it was her strength that life must be lived she was chiding marko for not eating and she was clearing the table in the kitchen and she was routing for the books she would need for the day in school she had the strength and he did not he had not told her of katica dubelj in the cave in the woods he was not strong enough she would hear it at the school in the morning she would know it when she brought marko home for their lunch he wanted to be alone he fastened the clasp of the heavy belt over his jeans and the weight of the holster carrying the makharov pistol dragged at his hip he went out into the morning he had not kissed his marko and he had not hugged his evica and it was not normal for him to wear the holster with the makharov pistol when he was about the village milan stankovic was no longer the king of salika the throne was taken from him he walked away down the lane away from the village now ruled by the irregulars who followed arkan he did not wish to be seen by his own people as subordinate to the gaol scum from belgrade he walked past the last houses of the lane towards the open fields beside the stream he did not want to go back towards the village because his office in the headquarters was now the command centre for the irregulars and they were without respect for him his office would now be filled with their bottles and their guns and their sleeping bags and their crude cold laughter if he had walked back through the village if he saw the people to whom he had been king then he would have seen the fear in their eyes that the presence of the irregulars had brought he walked away from the village there were magnolia flowers in the gardens of the last houses of the lane and tulips were open and the blossom was heavy on the fruit trees it was so clear in his mind the memory of how they had carried him on their shoulders when they had elected him as commander of the territorial defence force just as they had carried him on their shoulders when the team had come back with the cup won from karlovac municipality and so clear in his mind how the men had begged him pleaded with him for weapons to use in the attack on the village of the ustase bastards across the stream not a man in the village who had not slapped his back in congratulation when he had walked back over the bridge from rosenovici with the mud of the pit on his body he had been the leader he had issued the guns he had brought the bulldozer to the field he was responsible he walked in the watered sunlight beside the gardens of flowers it was like a closeness at his throat because he was responsible the weight of the pistol chafed against his hip there were no tractors out that morning and the animals were still in the barns and the village boys who were too old for school had not shepherded out the sheep and he was responsible for the silence and emptiness of the fields because he had brought this fear to the village and what was done could not be undone his eyes searched the tree line he was wondering whether they would come again some day in a month or a year or in his old age and he was wondering whether his son would carry the makharov pistol on his hip and search the same tree line for their approach he walked beside the stream it was his home it was a place of beauty and the tree line hemmed him in the sunlight played patterns on the slow movement of the deep pool and he saw the ripples of the trouts rise a shout carried to him he saw distant back at the edge of the village the waving arms of branko calling him he left behind him the streams deep pool and the gathering spread of the ripples from the trouts rise the canadian policeman watched him come there were no flowers on the grave the grave was a mound of earth and at the end of it was a single stake there was not even a cross for the grave he stood beside the grave and he held the spectacles in his hand in five months he would be back in his beloved ontario back in the brick house in kingston that melanies father had built for them and he did not know what he could tell melanie and her father about the place he had been posted to couldnt tell melanie and her father about the cruelty nor about the bulldozed graveyards nor about the poisoned wells nor about the rape of grandmothers and the disembowelling of grandfathers and the bludgeoning of grandchildren couldnt tell them that the smile which was adhesive to his face hurt far down in the pit of his soul the wet mud of the new grave cloyed at his boots nor would he tell melanie and her father about the headmaster of a village school who had had his spectacles broken a small crowd confronted him there were the faces that he always saw when he came to salika weathered faces and amongst them scattered with them were the cold bearded men of the arkanovici if he had not made his report if the professor of pathology had not been available for one days digging if he had not taken the window of opportunity then and it hurt the canadian the headmaster might probably would have been alive nor would he talk to melanie and her father about the hideous price paid by those who had gotten themselves involved hed told them to go fetch milan stankovic when milan stankovic was close to him the canadian turned and laid the new pair of spectacles on the graves mound it was something he had been really most proud of getting the new spectacles made in zagreb from the prescription passed to him by the political officer in just twentyfour hours he had radioed the prescription through from petrinja to the ilica barracks in zagreb and he had begged for urgency and in twentyfour hours the new spectacles had been brought to the crossing point on the road north of petrinja the sun burnished the lenses on the grave where there were no flowers his commissioner the big guy from alberta back in the ilica barracks liked to tell a story to the new guys coming to serve with uncivpol the commissioner had been down to sector south a onenight stand and on the first day had found three old croat women whose home was wrecked and whose well was polluted and who were starving the commissioner had given them the bread and cheese that was the next days lunch for his team the commissioners gift was witnessed four nights later in the story the commissioner thought worth telling the new guys the three old croat women were shot to death it was a story about trying to help and a story about screwing up he was not supposed to show emotion he was not allowed to shout and curse he stood to attention beside the grave above the new spectacles he turned smartly his heel squelching the mud he was supposed to smile to celebrate little victories he was allowed to smile he fixed his smile at milan stankovic then walked away from him went to his jeep he had made the bastard come from wherever come running and panting for a fucking smile good god the supercilious grin played at the mouth of the first secretary so the warrior of principle is pimping the soldier of conscience is providing some home comforts he stood in the doorway holding the passkey that the floor maid had given him paid for with a packet of cigarettes the curtains were still drawn and he saw the shape of the man on the bed barechested asleep and there was a woman crouched over him who stared back like a cat cornered with a rabbit and fancy finding you here my little friend fancy finding your little snout in the trough but hamilton the loathsome sidney ernest hamilton codenamed freefall on the file header was between the first secretary and the bed and freefall hamilton had a damned ugly rifle across his knees before hed seen the rifle his intention had been to get across the room shake the sleep off the bloody man and kick him smartest out into the corridor down the stairs to reception for account settling and a sharp drive to the airport that was his intention before he saw the rifle he saw the empty bottles close to hamilton and he recalled the file in the safe of his room at the embassy with six pages on an incident in a bunker at osijek a drunken shooting the first secretary held back the growling hungover voice what do you want i want him on the plane im going to put him on the first plane hes going this afternoon first plane my little friend and i dont have time for a debate which was truth the first secretary had little time he had a meeting with the monitoring officers and he was late for it and they had access to useful areas of raw intelligence and he had a session which had taken him seven weeks to fix with the brigadier commanding croatian military intelligence who was a bad old bastard from tito times and who knew his trade but he was wary of a rifle in the hands of a man who was hungover drunk so a bit of action please you should let him sleep hamilton horrible little freefall crabbed his way to the window and the rifle was dragged with him horrible little freefall caught the curtains and pulled them apart letting light into the hotel room the woman the cat cornered with a rabbit and threatened hovered over the sleeping man christ who did that to him the first secretary saw the wounds and the discoloured bruises and the scars he felt sickness in his throat penns breathing was regular and his face was at peace the first secretary knew enough of what happened in sunny former yugoslavia to an enemy he gagged the vomit back he remembered penn coming to his office the first secretary said you will bring him to the airport the hours flight ill see him onto the plane you get him there the curtains were pulled shut again hell be there hamilton or ill break you the aircraft banked she was reading the bones of ambit of criminal jurisdiction paragraph iextra territorial jurisdiction and slipping on to paragraph sources and rationale of territorial jurisdiction the aircraft levelled out west from zagreb she was reading for the last time the pencilled written notes under the heading of offences against the person genocide paragraph and her eyes slid across the pages to h offences committed abroad and subsection subparagraph murder see para and sec post the aircraft was losing height she was reading quickly reminding herself of geneva red cross conventions turning through the geneva conventions the convention relative to the treatment of prisoners of war riffling through the convention relative to the protection of civilians in time of war the aircraft wallowed over the end of the runway she was reading the last page of the young barristers notes learning them so they were ingrained treatment of the wounded etc paragraph general protection at all times and particularly after an engagement parties to a conflict must take measures to search for and collect the wounded sick and shipwrecked protect them from pillage and ensure their adequate care and the dead must be searched for and their spoliation prevented at all times the wounded sick and shipwrecked must be treated humanely without any adverse distinction founded on race colour religion or faith sex birth wealth or any similar criteria the aircrafts wheels touched down she was reading paragraph conflicts not of an international character treat humanely persons who take no active part in the hostilities including members of the armed forces who have laid down their arms or are rendered unable to take part by reason of wounds violence to life and persons including murder the passing of sentences and carrying out of executions without a proper trial upon noncombatants are prohibited the wounded and sick must be cared the music played cheerfully over the loudspeakers as mary braddock put away in her bag the notes and the two sheets of the faxed report sixteen the pain beat against the bone behind his temples and there were needle pricks behind his eyeballs and there was a battering throb behind his ears it had been a hell of a long time since penn had been this hungover the others were still asleep he was padding halfnaked round the room moving without order stumbling round the bed where ulrike slept hiking his feet over hams outstretched body he should have been working to a system should have cleared the bathroom first then been to the wardrobe and had his shoes off the floor and his shirts and underwear and socks out of the drawers and his jackets and slacks off the hangers and then he should have been gathering up everything that belonged to him from the shelf below the mirror including the two typed sheets that had gone for the fax transmission but there was no system the pain dictated that there was no order in his packing penn blundered around collecting forgetting carrying cursing the aftermath of the alcohol he couldnt hold his bloody concentration not at all he had the case on the bed and now he was emptying the case because the shoes and the plastic bag for his toothpaste and his shaving cream and razors were out of place should always be shoes at the bottom and washing gear and then the dirty clothes and then the clean clothes and then the folded trousers and then the jackets and the whole bloody lot were out of order ulrike slept hard as he skirted the bed and ham slept deep as he stepped over his legs and that horrible bloody rifle because both would have been awake through the night watching for him they were a holiday friendship he knew and they would be gone belted out when the big bird lifted off the tarmac at zagreb airport ships that pass in the night that sort of crap they slept now because they had stayed awake through the night and watched his own sleep and the thought of it through the pain and the confusion of packing out of order made penn feel humility he wouldnt see her again nor would he chase after hams woman who had done a runner with her kiddie but they had watched over him while he slept a lonely woman and a small scumbag frightened because he hadnt a friend he might tell mary braddock about them because they were each in their way a part of his finding dorries truth or then he might not get to see mary braddock when he hadnt the pain in his head he could work it through whether he would see mary braddock or whether it would just be the fuller report in a weeks time and the full invoice of his charges sent in the post by recorded delivery he had never been drunk incapable when he was a teenager living at home in the tied cottage because that was the example of his mother and father his mother taking only a sherry at christmas and his father talking of it like it was a devil he had been drunk incapable once when a clerk at the home office and taken out to a party in the catford flat of another clerk and thinking afterwards that it might just have been because he was so bloody boring that they had spiked the drinks and had good sport out of him reeling and crashing and throwing up in the street and ashamed he had been drunk incapable once when with five and they had worked seven weeks on a surveillance before showing out on a shift change into the derelict van with the flat tyre that was parked up opposite the safe house and the irish target gone and lost and the guys going down to the pub when the operation had been called off with heavy recrimination and an assistant deputy director general level inquest and sleeping on the floor of the taxi home and ashamed now he had no sense of achievement there was no elation it was just a report that he had written as he had written previous reports that cut into the lives of the dead and the vanished and the criminal as he would write further reports he wanted out and he wanted home and he wanted to sleep out of his system too much goddamn scotch and he wanted the bastard place behind him and the fear the shit the pain it was only a report and the one chance was gone he had the shoes back at the bottom of the case and the washing gear with them and the underpants and the socks into the space between the shoes and the washing bag and the dirtied clothes and the ones that he hadnt used he was starting to fold the slacks and the jackets the fatigues that he had worn into sector north were on the floor near to where ham lay stretched out holding the bloody rifle like it was a babys toy and the fatigues werent going with him nor the boots that were under them and he heard a brisk knock at the door penn went round the bed and he stepped over hams legs the knock was repeated impatiently he opened the door of the hotel room penn rocked she peered into the gloom late morning closing on midday and the curtains of the room were not drawn back mary peered past the shadowdark figure that rocked in front of her yes she had expected surprise but the man could hardly stand and the light from behind her in the corridor seemed to dazzle his eyes and he could not focus on her she came into the room and with her heel she nudged the door back shut behind her only the light now from the bathroom and the shadowdark figure was backing away from her away from the narrow strip of light from the bathroom she came past the door and into the room the smell in the room was foul quite defeating the eau de toilette scent that she had sprayed at her throat and wrists in the taxi from the airport on the plane and in the taxi from the airport she had rehearsed what she would say to him how she would be cool but goading and what she had rehearsed was thrown from her mind if she had wanted to she could not have controlled it the sharp spasm of her anger good morning mr penn no reply from him and he was stumbling back further from the bathroom light as if to hide in the grey gloom of the room how are we mr penn just a growl of a response she was going forward into the centre of the room coming closer to the bed that he skirted when she saw his case on the bed and the shape of the woman on the bed the blouse of the woman was unbuttoned halfway down to her navel and she could see the sexless strength of the womans brassiere and the white skin a little endofterm party mr penn got demob happy did we mr penn hit the bottle did we mr penn the bottle and a bit of skirt mr penn its not what what i think you wouldnt have the faintest idea what i think mr penn if you had had an idea then you would not have ignored my telephone calls to this hotel you would not have bloody well abandoned me you wouldnt know what it was like just a silly woman mr penn a silly woman incapable of understanding a woman to be fobbed off with a twopage fax the growl spluttered in his throat she saw the gleam of his teeth and his words came haltingly she wasnt my daughter what the hell does that mean she wasnt my daughter and if she had been my daughter then she would not have been badmouthed to every stranger i could get my claws on she laughed shrill we make judgements now do we mr penn we know more than a mother does about her daughter do we mr penn exactly what i need wonderful and she was following him through the grey gloom of the room and the woman on the bed stirred he said to her and the life had gone from his voice and there was only a tiredness if it was just anger then you wouldnt have come if it had just been anger then you would have stayed away you came because of the guilt dont lecture me because of the guilt because of the shame because she was your daughter and you didnt know her she was following him she was drawn to him suddenly there was a startled grunt in the darkness ahead of her and she saw the heaped clothes that stank and the sudden movement of the body in front of her and the rifle was coming up and the muzzle caught against her stocking at the knee its fine ham its domes mother its dorries mother whos come perhaps it was the calm that had come to the voice now perhaps it was the gentleness that tinged the voice perhaps it was the smell of the bodies and the damp of the clothes on the floor perhaps it was the rifle and the emptied bottles perhaps it was the woman scowling from the bed and the man crouched down hostile on the floor perhaps it was the suitcase that was packed perhaps it was the guilt she spat it out you were going home i was hired to write a report worth two pages was she two pages and thats time to come home i have written a preliminary report i will write a fuller report when i am home and that is your idea of the end of it its what i was hired to do what i have done to the best of my ability enough is it just to write a report its what i was asked to do hired to do she could not see into his face the worst for mary was the calmness in his voice and with the calmness was the gentleness she could remember her tears because of what dorrie had done to her she could remember when she had thrown things saucepans books clothes hurled them because of what dorrie had done to her she could remember charless accusations because of what dorrie had done to her and how she had gone sobbing up the stairs to beat her fists on the locked door because of what dorrie had done to her and the guilt roved in her her voice rose so you walk out you walk away i dont know what else i can do it was just empty words it was to write the report you requested what the politicians said what that american said just empty fine words or empty words you wanted a report you have a report she stood her height was it just empty words didnt they talk about a second nuremberg didnt they talk about war crimes didnt they talk about a new world order where the guilty would be punished where theyd be locked up and the key thrown away didnt they talk the voice calm and gentle not the businesslike voice from the graveyard in the village not the brusque voice from the kitchen of the manor house its the sort of thing people say politicians its not to be taken seriously you saw the man who killed her i saw him you found the evidence of an eyewitness i found the eyewitness you know where to go i know where he is and i know where to go for the eyewitness she could not see into his face she saw the grey shadow and the dark sockets of the eyes do you think i am just a woman to be humoured do you think i am just a silly woman who is obsessional i wrote my report she said hard if there is a will then there can be a prosecution sources and rationale of territorial jurisdiction and offences against the person geneva conventions and treatment of the wounded and conflicts not of an international character if there is determination then there can be a prosecution what do you want she said brutally i want those empty words thrown back down their bloody throats i want them to choke on those empty words i want that man before a court i want to hear your evidence against him what can i do she looked into his eyes pitilessly go back take him bring him bring him to where they cannot hide behind their empty words go take bring or are you going to walk out on me he turned away from her he was at the window his hands reached up to the curtains and her voice died the silence held the grey gloom of the room quite suddenly the daylight was flooding the room and the curtains were heaved back it was the bruises on his face and the cuts and the scarring that she saw first she gazed at him and she felt shame there was a weal on his throat and on his chest deeper bruises and wider cuts and abrasions i didnt know i will go back behind the lines and take him and bring him out will you please listen to me mrs braddock will you please not interrupt me i will bring him out but not for you you mrs braddock are owed nothing i dont think listening comes easily to you i doubt you ever listened to your daughter but then i am sure you are a busy woman and capable and resourceful with many demands on your time does life always revolve around you for domes sake i will bring him out and for myself dont drop your head mrs braddock and please dont offer me more money and dont think the united nations in their glory will stand and cheer nor our embassy nor the government here i will bring him out because knowing and loving your daughter has been my privilege i will bring him out the woman came off the bed and she was tucking her blouse into the waist of her trousers and then she was buttoning her blouse and she seemed to look at penn as if to satisfy herself that he had made up his mind she did not question him just checked him and she was slipping from the bed and going for the telephone on the shelf beneath the mirror and the small man the man who was crouched down on the floor with his rifle shook his head like he heard something that he could not believe and he said that squire is the biggest piece of fucking madness that i have heard just cause the cow winds you up doesnt mean you fucking have to the woman was dialling a number she looked at the scars and bruises and cuts i didnt know he said simply we loved her all who were touched by her came to love her your problem mrs braddock is you knew nothing about that love his hand was laid on evicas hand just for the moment she allowed his hand on her hand she took her hand from under his milans hand lay on the kitchen table he drummed his fingers he looked into her face she did not criticize him with her eyes because the log bin beside the stove was not filled she did not criticize him because he had sat at the table rereading old newspapers through the whole of the morning while she had been with marko at the school she did not criticize him because he had not risen from their bed before she had gone with marko to the school had not been to the store in the village to see if there was fresh bread had not swept the floor of the kitchen evica pushed the last logs of the bin onto the fading fire of the stove she did not criticize him because she had to go out into the shed behind the kitchen door to get potatoes and beetroot and she was wearing her washed and ironed blouse and her neat skirt that were appropriate for the acting headmistress of salikas village school and she took the emptied log bin with her her face when he had laid his hand on hers was without expression he could not know from looking at her face whether she was ashamed of him whether she was frightened for him whether she loathed him the body of the dog was pressed against the kitchen door as if waiting for the mistress to come as if the master were no longer of importance they had been married more than a dozen years ago when he was the basketball star of the glina municipality and she the prettiest girl in salika village and he did not know her the boy his marko came to him sat on his lap sturdy weight on his upper thighs and he thought that perhaps the boy had been crying as his mother had walked him home from morning school and there were the scars of fighting on the boys face she came back into the kitchen she was carrying the log bin filled and a cardboard box of potatoes and beetroot and he could see the stain of dried mud on her blouse and the strain of her arm muscles because the logs were damp and still heavy and he could see near to the broadest of the smears of dried mud the place on the waist of her blouse where she had stitched a short lshaped rent in the material she did not criticize him because it was impossible now to buy new clothes she did not criticize him because she could no longer go to the shops in karlovac and sisak she did not criticize him as if he were responsible as if it were personal to him for the war she had dumped the bin he held tight to his son she was tipping potatoes and beetroot into the bowl in her sink for washing and peeling and cutting she knew of the death of the headmaster and she would know of the killing of katica dubelj she had translated the accusation of the stranger who had come to their village and he did not know what she thought it had rained hard in the night through the window he could see the cloud on the hill above the village across the river her back was to him she worked methodically over the sink milan said because the stream is in spate it cannot be today and i do not think it can be tomorrow but when the pace of the stream is settled then i will take marko to fish far up the stream up past where they graze the sheep where they plough there is a good pool i saw trout there we will dig some worms we will bring you back a trout he laughed out loud and he cuddled the boy who was heavy on his upper thighs and the weight of marko tautened the belt at his waist and dragged the bulk of the holster into the flesh of his hip and he would always wear the holster now and she did not turn to face him and he did not know what she thought he was waiting for them at the entrance to the barracks marty signed them in and the swedish sentries issued lazily visitors permits for ulrike and the englishman and for the mercenary and for the tall woman with them who was elegant and beautiful he showed ulrike where she could park the car marty walked them from the parking lot to the freight container he took them inside the freight container and he apologized for the wet mud on the vinyl flooring and he shut down his screen and he tidied away the papers on his desk and he said he would make coffee for them if she had given him more warning with her telephone call requesting a meeting then he would have gone out of the ilka barracks and bought flowers for ulrike schmidt he was filling the kettle finding the mugs getting the milk carton from the small fridge looking in his cupboard for sugar the elegant woman the englishwoman came right at him mr jones you are a war crimes investigator and marty hadnt even gotten round to establishing who had milk and who had sugar thats correct maam you are here to prepare cases against war criminals with a view to eventual prosecution correct again maam what progress are you making mr jones precious little maam why are you making precious little progress he grimaced do you have all day please mr jones just explain it depends maam on why you want to know it the englishwoman took from her handbag two sheets of faxed paper and she passed them to marty he began to read the kettle was starting to blow but ulrike made that her job he read the synopsis of a killing ulrike spooned the coffee into the five mugs and they talked among themselves about milk and about portions of sugar he was reading the brief text of eyewitnesses and the englishwomans eyes never left him as he read he was reading the material that crossed his desk each day that was recorded on his camcorder that was held on his audio tapes there were photographs pinned to the interior walls of the freight container bad atrocity photographs and the englishman stared at them coldly and ulrike ignored them and once the mercenary made a joke of them but the englishwoman seemed not to see them she watched him as he shifted from the first sheet to the second as he weighed the names as he drank it in he thought of telling the englishwoman telling her how many thousands of civilians had died in former yugoslavia how many of the ethnic minorities had been cleansed how many concentration camps existed how many homes had been burned how many acts of criminality had been perpetrated against the defenceless when he finished his reading he could have told her that in the catalogue of bestiality the incident at the village of rosenovici was minimal those that trusted him those who were the eyewitnesses and who provided his snapshot experiences were hungry and tired and traumatized they no longer possessed the spark of action she was smartly dressed like a big oil man wife she had fine skin like a woman who was cared for with money he supposed she believed it her right to jump to the head of any queue he made for the priorities of his catalogue of bestiality he handed her back the two sheets of paper i make little progress maam because my work is perceived to be an obstacle to eventual peace please plain language the worst bastards excuse me run the show the thinking in new york the thinking in geneva the thinking at unprofor across the parade ground from my kennel is that the worst bastards have to be kept sweet so as theyll put their illiterate scrawl on whatever appeasement document ends this crap session plain language im a goddamn leper here plain language i am obstructed shortfunded blocked plain language im pissing into the wind and thats good enough for you but he wasnt angry he didnt flare she did not seem to be insulting him i do what i can maam did the killing of the wounded from rosenovici and the murder of my daughter constitute a war crime yes does the material here in abbreviated form provided by mr penn constitute evidence of a war crime yes but but what its good to meet you good to make you coffee its good to learn about your daughter but but what mr jones but its hollow talk its academic its wasting your time and my time because the accused is not within jurisdiction put simply the guys the other side of the line and if its where it stops the line im sorry suddenly feeling tired tired because it was a dream a dream was a man in handcuffs a man who was confronted with evidence the dream was a man who flinched when confronted with the cold paper of testimony the dream was always with him mr penn is going over that line ive his promise hes going to take him and bring him back across that line so in the plainest language have you the balls to handle it you bring him ill screw him down my word to you ill give it my best my word ill not back off and marty knew that he had lost her lost the german woman he knew that he had lost her to penn he was crushed if he had gone more often to the transit centre if he had gone more often and taken flowers if he had pushed and shoved and heaved if he thought that he had lost what he cared for the most he searched again for confirmation marty looked into penns face at the bruises and the scars as long as you know maam what youre asking that man to do first he had watched the outer door of the concourse he had sat where he could see the door taken a magazine and relaxed later he had gone to stand near to the queue waiting to have their tickets and baggage processed and when the queue had thinned he had gone to the desk and asked in decent local language for a fast look at the passenger list now he used a telephone from which he could still see the checkin while the announcement of the flights closing beat in his ears and he rang the hotel in central zagreb and spoke to an idiot and the idiot confirmed that penn william had checked out paid up and gone the first secretary hurried from the concourse and outside he heard the distant rumble of a jet airliner gathering speed on the runway it was a talent of his that he could control his fury but he trembled in the knowledge of a failure that must be reported immediately to london ill go because ive said ill go ham said i told you its just fucking dumb ill do it because ive said ill do it you never go back not when youve been bounced on your own no chance not second time at it its what ive said ill do the german woman was driving she was very quiet she had her eyes on the road and her hands tight on the wheel ham was sitting beside her and he had the rifle down between his legs and he was twisted awkwardly so that he could face penn who was stretched across the width of the back seat he knew where it was going it was freefall hamiltons lifetime skill that he could deflect the big decision and he thought this time round that deflection was fucking out the window he squirmed because the bullshit stakes were finished ham blurted dont think im going with you hadnt asked you wasnt going to ask you dont think im going in there with you dont think ill be there watching your arse im not going in there with you and that means you cant fucking go i was never asking you you go back in there and youre dead meat just say just suppose that you make it in there just say that you find the bastard just suppose you take him do you think when the balloon goes up and sure as hell it will that one man can take that fucking bastard out hot pursuit going fast crosscountry going covert with a prisoner youve no chance for christs sake you know youve no fucking chance believe me penn no chance its not your worry are you just thick its not your worry because i am not asking you she was driving in the falling light on the wide road back down to karlovac she seemed to stiffen her lips moved pale and thin lips without makeup as if she tested something she would say out loud she glanced across at him away from the road you dont have to be ashamed ham because you are frightened we are all frightened here all of the time not only you you should just make available the weapons the food the method of crossing the river the rendezvous on the way back dont fucking tell me the headlights of the volkswagen flared over the empty road ahead you speak the truth ham he has no chance if he is alone he knew his place in the great organization of six he knew his place influence authority because his wife cared to remind him of it most weeks there were occasional good days when georgie simpson would let himself into his mocktudor semidetached home in carshalton and pocket the latchkey and sing out the news of his arrival and be anxious to tell her of some minimal triumph achieved that day in the great organization of six his wife on those evenings would be sitting in front of the television and she would recognize his minor elation and diminish him she could put him down when he was up and she seldom bothered to try to lift him up when he was down he replaced the secure telephone on its cradle the central heating blown along ducts from a main boiler unit was still functioning would be for another month most of those around him had discarded their cardigans or jackets and georgie simpson shivered only little tasks were given him if he carried out flawlessly those little tasks then he could expect to hide in the corner and remain unobserved by those bloody people who now trawled through the building for dead wood that could be hacked from the body of six if he were to be forcibly retired sent packing because he could not even be relied upon to fulfill the little tasks he shivered he felt the sweat cold on his body he unlocked the drawer of his desk took out the notebook where his sacred telephone numbers were written georgie simpson thought of going home that evening to his wife sitting in front of the television and if he told her of a disaster his disaster then she would laugh back in his face he dialled arnold its georgie here no be a good chap pasts past let it go please arnold i beg you please listen ive just had our field station zagreb on we have a problem a huge problem the memorandum was in front of him he cast his eye over it slowly shook his head henry carter had never thought greatly of georgie simpson the memorandum of simpson six concerning his telephone conversation with browne five he thought it a pathetic little document and all the selfserving was there of a panicladen man who was attempting to pass on the parcel no henry carter did not think panic too strong a word he knew the way the place worked he understood the culture of six it would not have changed in the years since he had left his own fulltime employment in the old century house there was a childs grin on his face yes henry carter could picture panic running a limited course early on a spring afternoon some twentythree months before through the corridors above him a man who should have been tied down fastened tight was free and going loose behind the lines a man who was a freelancer and an amateur was behind the lines and beyond recall a childs grin and a quiet chuckle because panic would have been scampering down those corridors of inaction above him kicking down the doors into the offices of inactivity above him clever men the men who drew up clever plans would have been cursing swearing twisting pencil stems and passing on that parcel of responsibility there was a new cup of coffee in front of him the last that the night duty supervisor would bring him before the day shift came on in an hours time he knew his socks smelled and he could feel the rude stubble on his chin he thought that somewhere in the vast recesses of babylon on thames there would be a plastic razor that he could beg but he did not know where he would ask for replacement socks his chuckle was because he saw the clever men with their clever plans cursing and scampering in panic he thought of the man running loose behind the lines beyond recall lunatic of course but predictable too lethal and emotional a cocktail for a decent fellow to have rejected it was usually the decent ones who could be inveigled to go behind the lines beyond recall he knew the scenario of course he did he had himself twisted the screw manipulated young and decent men and he was not proud of what he had done and he hoped quite fervently as the dawn came up over the thames that mrs mary braddock was not proud the night supervisor was locking away the small microwave in which the bacon for the sandwiches had been cooked and a young woman from the shift was spraying that end of library with an air cleanser and the music was already gone another damn morning was coming she was unpacking in her room it was a better hotel than the one she had used on her two previous visits to zagreb she was on a floor above the room from which she had hunted out penn and there was a good vista from the window that went away past the hospital with the big red cross painted on the white background over the tiles and over the wide street that was laced with tram tracks on towards the formidable floodlit public buildings of the viennese style of a century before when the telephone rang she was ferrying her clothes from her opened case to the wardrobe she went to the telephone with the framed photograph of her dorrie beside it her husbands voice hacked anger at her do you know what you are doing you are interfering you are interfering and meddling i have had arnold bloody browne into my house as if i were some sort of criminal as if i were responsible for you you are interfering with policy you are meddling in matters damn it matters beyond your pitiful understanding and dont you think you owe me some sort of bloody apology do you know what you did to me and my guests you made a bloody fool of me did you stop and think what you were doing to me humiliating me you sent that man back thats what arnold bloody browne is saying always have to get your own bloody way dont you that man was close to getting himself killed first time around his luck and a deal of guts from other people saved his life but you couldnt let it go had to send him back again god mary do you understand what youve done she put the telephone down on him she sat in the chair she stared at the photograph of her dorrie such an old photograph because the child was laughing he sat on his sons bed he was cold from the night air there was no heating in the house outside the kitchen and no electricity that evening the oil lamp threw a feeble yellow light into his sons room from the timbered landing milan told his marko that the night was clear with no sign of rain he did not tell his son that he had walked out into the village that evening after the darkness had come did not tell him that he had walked as far as the headquarters building of the tdf and that he had gone inside and into the room that had been his office since his election by acclamation as leader he did not tell his son that branko was in his chair and sitting at his desk and working through a new duty roster for the sentries on the bridge to rosenovici and on the roadblock to vrginmost and it was the leader who made the roster for the sentries he did not tell his son that stevo was deep in negotiation with the chief of the irregulars and handing over money for the supply of diesel and it was the leader who controlled the fuel resource for the village he did not tell his son that milo was talking with others of the irregulars for the acquisition of more of the heavy calibre machine guns and more grenades for the rpgs that were stored in the concretelined armoury and it was the leader who had charge of the armoury he did not tell his son that he had been ignored by the irregulars and by the gravedigger and the postman and the carpenter milan held the boys hand if there is no more rain if the stream has gone down then tomorrow afternoon may be good for fishing ham took them across she could see nothing around her beyond the white swirl of the water where he dipped the paddle penn was in front of her settled across the forward angle of the inflatable not speaking and ham was behind her and grunting at the exertion of propelling the craft into the strong current of the river ulrike thought that she understood what was ahead she should have known the refugees who came by bus to the turanj crossing point had been through what was ahead what was ahead was enough to traumatize and crush and terrorize the inflatable staggered against the currents power her father was in her mind she had been twelve years old when he had first talked of it to her opened the chapter of his life that was closed away before her father was a pacifist teacher and had stayed silent for selfpreservation and the tears had run thick on her fathers face as he had explained the call of survival for he had known who was taken to the cells and who was interrogated and who was eliminated he had known the evil and stayed silent it had been with her all through her life from the age of twelve that if a man or woman stayed silent then the time would come in later age when the tears would roll helplessly on the face witness to shame her father would have understood why she rode the inflatable against the current into the width of the kupa river she did not wish to cry when she was old and her father had told her her twelve years old and him sitting beside her and holding her and weeping that after the surrender he had found work as an interpreter for the british control commission it had been part of his work to translate in the courts that arraigned and sentenced the war criminals the night before the execution of a sentence by hanging her father had been taken to the condemned cell of the deputy commander of a camp in the neuengamme ring and it had been her fathers job that night to interpret for the british gaolers the last letter written by the deputy commander to his wife and the wife would receive the letter several hours after the hanging and her father had said to her through his tears that it was a sweet and literate letter not the ravings of a beast but a letter searching for dignity from a man who was frightened she leaned forward her hands groped past the backpack given by ham her hands found penns she held tight to his hands she whispered there is something you must know perhaps you already know it something that is important he hissed for her to be quiet she pressed to you now he is an animal when you have him when he is taken he will be weak he will be human you must not soften then penn when he is weak when he pleads i am sorry penn but then you will have to be cruel his hand freed from hers was across her mouth the sounds were the slight splashing of the paddle and the wash of the river current against the side of the inflatable his hand dropped from her mouth she eased back from him if you are weak then you betray so many you walk for those who are dead and for the dispossessed the tortured it will be for you difficult to be cruel she could see the dark high outline of the steep bank ahead it had seemed important to her to tell him behind was the greater darkness only a single light to see far down river from where they had launched the inflatable perhaps it was why she had come to give him the edge of cruelty she had seen the convoys of unprofor troops going through the turanj crossing point and heading for bosnia in their personnel carriers she had seen the vapour trails of the american jets as they arced in the skies for their threatening flights over bosnia she had seen on the satellite television the politicians talk about the sanction of war crimes tribunals for bosnia and nothing happened the misery continued nothing changed the darkness was around her the blackness of the bank was ahead of her ulrike whispered it is left to the small people to do something he slapped her face quite sharp stinging her her anger surged a moment then lapsed he slapped her she thought to give her the reality the reality was danger she bobbed her head as if in apology and he would not have seen it he would believe he was responsible for her the front of the inflatable hit the bank then sidled into the broken reeds he threw the backpack up the bank and then she felt her arm taken roughly he dragged her forward had firm hold of her then pitched her off the inflatable she was in the void her fingers clawed into wet mud and her feet splashed in the water among the reeds and his hands were at her hips and heaving her higher she scrambled up the bank fists and knees and toes she heard the murmur of voices behind her the time of the pickup and the place of the rendezvous he jumped and he fell half onto her and his weight beat the breath from her chest his hand scraped up across the fatigue jacket and found a grip by her armpit and he pulled her up to the top of the bank she heard the soft wash of the paddle in the water fading seventeen who is he some drone from the stone age whats he doing here he comes in two days a month he ferrets into files that werent annotated at the time hes supposed to get them into shape so they can go onto disk for archive only lowgrade stuff he was in century way back when there were carrier pigeons onetime pads when it was boy scouts time their voices murmured in henry carters ears god he stinks look there food grease the wretched mans been eating in here i suppose its a sort of charity really finding people like that a bit of work nothing that can be said to be useful its something about former yugoslavia out of which nothing good ever came it cant be important or they wouldnt have let him near it im trying to remember what he did when he was here certainly wasnt senior executive rank well hes certainly noticeable now is it his socks extraordinary really theres a file that nobody is remotely interested in and it gets dug out and worked all over and then its reburied on disk and still nobody is remotely interested in it waste of time henry carter his head across his elbows on the desk opened his eyes he saw the day supervisor and a callow skinny young man that he assumed to be from inhouse management the woman who was the day supervisor laughed hollow amazing hes alive mr carter you do not have permission to camp in here like a dosser you do not have permission to eat hot fatridden food in library so sorry the young man said its not exactly pleasant mr carter for the people who work here to have a man who smells most times henry carter would have grovelled a further apology but he had been dreaming because he had been dreaming he did not offer a second apology his voice rose not important of course not a waste of time of course you wouldnt have the faintest idea it shouldnt have been asked of him no human being in their right mind would have driven penn back across that river that river its what european history is stuffed solid with its a barrier its a demarcation line beyond that river is the sort of danger and risk that you in your smug and complacent little lives would not comprehend its always the people who are smug and complacent who send young men across rivers through minefields into the heart of danger and in their arrogance they never pause to consider the consequences now if you will please excuse me i have work to get on with they backed off none of the women at their consoles lifted their heads to stare at him they left him at his desk the memory of the dream was with him it was a damnable dream a nightmare what he knew of those young men who pressed forward towards the heart of danger was that they were frightened of spitting back into the faces of those who urged them further down the road they were compelled towards the brink of the precipice dragged towards the edge he seemed to have seen in his dream the young man going forward as a shadow shape in darkness and he still saw penn and the image of penn shut out the languid movement around him of the personnel of library he coughed some phlegm from his chest into the mess of his handkerchief he had more bronchial problems now than ever before god and he needed to be out of london needed to be on the old railway line at tregaron needed to be alone with the big kites manoeuvring above him but not before the file was prepared the matter was settled the day supervisor was a few paces behind him stood back as if she were nervous that the old drone still had enough teeth in his old mouth to bite there was the hissing of the air freshener aerosol he was drawn back towards the pain of the memories the memories were of men who had trusted him johnny donoghue schoolteacher persuaded to travel into east germany had trusted him mattie furniss pompous and decent had trusted him but the damned job took precedence over trust almost as if he wished that this young man fleshing in the file had trusted him what they said the old men of century and the new men of vauxhall cross was that there was no escape from the job and never would be he smelled the fragrance that fell around him he seemed to feel not just at his feet and in his shoes but across the whole of his body the cold damp of the great kupa river he led her up the bank penn held ulrikes hand as he took her up the bank and beyond the line of the reeds he did not hold her hand because he thought she was weak or because he thought she needed comfort he held her hand so that he could dictate the speed of each step that she took and so that he could communicate the need for absolute quiet in the darkness with the black depth of the river behind them it seemed to him an age before he was satisfied and prepared to move forward perhaps it was two minutes perhaps three but he was crouched down and she was kneeling close to him and he held her hand and he could hear just the heave of her breathing he could not hear the soft splash of the paddles any longer and there was no sound from back across the river to tell him that ham had successfully reached the other bank and had taken the inflatable out of the water and had dragged it to the hiding place among the scrub in the swamp ground it was not good to think of the swamp ground on the other side of the river to think of safe territory was facile dangerous penn released ulrikes hand his fingers ran the length of her arm and across her neck and he touched the hair on her head and he brought her head close to him so that her ear was against his lips he whispered so quietly into her ear that she was not to speak on no account should she speak to speak was to hazard them no bloody way should she open her bloody mouth again his hand took hers they began to move forward he did not want her too close to him so that she stumbled against him nor so far back that she might lose contact with him and then hurry to regain it he went the way he had gone before and it had to be that way because ham knew no other route he led her across the path that was set back from the rivers bank and he groped down with his free hand so that he could find the single strand of wire and he made the circle of his thumb and forefinger around the wire and soon he had reopened the scratches in his hand they went faster than he had gone the last time she stepped on a twig which his own boots had missed and he jerked her arm hard as if it were a capital sin to step on and break a twig when moving in the total darkness of a night forest they made good time a lone dog barked at the farmhouse and there was one small lamp burning in the outbuildings all the while that they moved he held tight to her hand controlling her he had told ham they would be in fast there for the minimum time out fast and he should have the inflatable waiting ham had nodded dont you worry on it piece of cake squire they were past the farm they were far behind the lines where do they come back to he tried to back his head away twist his neck away but the interrogators punch came too fast for his reaction the punch caught him on the tip of his nose and his eyes watered they had been waiting for him at the old police station ham had done as he had been told to do driven ulrikes car to her apartment block parked it pushed her keys through her letter box and then walked back to the old police station where they had been waiting where is the rendezvous on the river when is the rendezvous her hand came up fast from beside the trouser pocket of her fatigues and took him behind the ear jackknifing his head forward and as his head bucked her other hand with the clenched knuckles drove into his lips two of the military police had been waiting for him when he had come back into the yard behind the old police station and they had taken his arms with no explanation and marched him up the steps and into the room of the intelligence officer who fronted as liaison dont be boring dont be slow to help yourself dont believe that i wont hurt you the interrogator hit as if his head was a punch ball in a gymnasium with the leftright combination and each blow was harder and there was the first warm trickle of blood from his upper lip that ran sweet to his gums the two military policemen had pushed him in through the door of the intelligence officers room and he had seen the first secretary and tried to raise something of a cheerful smile to be met only by cold hostility and the intelligence officer had gazed at him like he was reptiles dirt he had seen the chill in the eyes of the interrogator she wore fatigue uniform baggy because it was too large for her smallness and she had a heavy pistol holster belted to her wa sped waist the woman had motioned him to the chair and when he had sat on it straightbacked she had hit him the first time you can be a very sensible man ham or you can be a silly man where when is the rendezvous she punched straight into the fullness of his mouth and the wide dulled gold of her wedding ring clipped the cap of his front tooth and broke it he reckoned the interrogator was a pretty woman but fanny always looked good in uniform always looked best with a webbing belt and a holster she had no cosmetics and there was a great weariness at her bagged eyes and her breasts were heavy in their fall into the fatigue tunic when she stretched her back after each blow like theyd suckled children he couldnt see the first secretary because the bastard was behind him and he couldnt see the intelligence officer because he was away to the right of him and his right eye was already closing from the interrogators blows he could read her face and her face was iced calm from what he read in her face the fanny was bloody tired but she would go on hitting him until she dropped and she wouldnt care if she rasped her fists and she wouldnt care if she hurt him he thought she was without mercy he knew that sort of fanny in the defence force all the fucking same all the same because theyd had a man killed somewhere on the fucking line some time in the war and theyd parked the kiddies with their mothers and theyd put on the uniform and they hated there was no mercy from the fucking women the women were the fucking worst he had his hands up tried to cover his face you dont leave here ham before i have the time and the place of the rendezvous when where because he tried to protect his face he did not see the short swing of the interrogators boot she kicked him hard boot into his shin toecap onto the bone of his leg he cried out he didnt doubt her he seemed to see himself bloodstained and screaming and cringing he seemed to see the guys who had been behind in the open field amongst the trees he seemed to see her with the knife bent over the guys who had been wounded and could not save themselves all the goddamn same fucking serb bastards and fucking croat bastards he did not know how long it had been whether he had been in the chair in the intelligence officers room for half an hour or an hour a goddamn awful pain in his leg and penn was nothing to him goddamn nothing he should come first second tenth he should come ahead of goddamn penn every fucking time he owed penn nothing come on ham whats the time and whats the place she had hold of his head the interrogators fingers and sharp nails seemed to be able to take a grip on the folds of the skin over his scalp and she shook his head until he thought his mind would explode dumb and stupid enough to let himself get hacked around kicked around he owed penn nothing ham told where he was to be waiting to take the inflatable across the kupa river to collect penn and the german woman and the eyewitness and the prisoner the first secretary said thats a good boy ham told when he was to be beside the kupa river to pick up penn and the german woman and the eyewitness and the prisoner the first secretary said relieved thats a sensible boy will you please close your mouth but she didnt he thought it was excitement adrenaline whatever unnamed chemicals were screwing about in her bloodstream that made her need to talk he supposed she was a town person and had to communicate and he knew that he was a country person able to subsist on his own company he didnt bloody well need to talk she did they had been on the move for ten hours before he had signalled the long halt they had gone slow through the darkness and faster in the dawn light and quickest when the sun had started to stream down through the thickening foliage above them the sun was up now throwing down gold shards picking out and spotlighting the mulch floor of the forest if we dont talk then you dont know why it should be important to you why you must wish to know why i have come what i know is that sound carries in the forest you think you are quiet you are like a rhino what is a rhino god a rhino moves like a doubledecker what is a doubledecker a rhinoceros is a very big very fat noisy animal a doubledecker is a twofloor very big very heavy noisy bus i know what is a rhinoceros and what is a bus how can you say i am like a rhinoceros and a bus god ulrike will you say what you have to say and then please be quiet dont you need to know why they were off the track he thought they might be an hour going fast probably more than an hour from the place where there were the bones and the cases and the bags he felt so tired he lay on his back and his head was crooked up against the backpack and she sat crosslegged beside him his eyes were opening closing opening again and he could see the excitement in her face the adrenaline and the chemicals and he thought that if he slept and she stayed awake then he would have lost control of her he was frightened to lose control of her in case a dog came in case a patrol came in case a group of loggers came in case he had not told her about the skeletons of the refugees and their bags and their cases and he did not know if he could bypass the place so that she would not see them it is not required for me to know why i have told you that i am grateful that you have come it does not help me to know but you insist so tell me why then be quiet so serious you have to know why tell me it is about a future brutal he said not our future we have no future she hissed peeved there is more than our future there is the future of the principle his eyes closed again he forced them open i know nothing of principles rubbish you are not here without principles you are a man of principle principles get people killed thats not for me silly stupid man without principle you would have been on the aircraft you would have been at your home you sell yourself too cheap you have principle and you have anger the anger is because you wont shut your mouth you have anger and principle and they ride together that is why i came brilliant thank you good night lights out and silence please and he could not push open his eyes eyes closed and the tiredness clinging in him typical of a bloody woman that there must be a bloody discussion just like at five just like the women graduates in general intelligence group why must the mountain be climbed analysis and thought and team discussion as to why the mountain must be climbed best to have a paper written on aims and objects for climbing the mountain then have a subcommittee report on the paper to the full team penn was climbing the mountain because the bloody mountain was there penn was going up the bloody mountain because mrs mary bloody braddock was holding a bayonet sharp as hell against his backside for him to impale himself on if he should bloody well stop climbing the bloody mountain penn was crawling up the bloody scree slope of the mountain because she was there dorrie was at the top with the wind in her hair and the rain on her face and the mist about her bloody laughing and mocking him ulrike was close to him he sensed her bent over him there was a garlic taste on her breath her fingers were smoothing the hair from his forehead because the bloody mountain was there with dorrie astride it she said into his ear i understand that there is no future and the future for us is not important but the future of the principle is everything if nobody speaks if nobody calls out if there is only silence then there is a new dark age of barbarity he murmured principles are not important what is important if we take milan stankovic when we run with milan stankovic then the wasps nest is well stirred its shitfrightened running then and when youre running its not bloody principles thatll help you along and if we try to take the eyewitness shes old slow needing to be carried maybe it was just the movement of her lips speaking into his ear maybe she kissed his ear but they had no future the future was jane was tom it was not important whether he wanted it or what he wanted there was no future with ulrike it is the difference between us and them we have principle and they have only barbarism christ ulrike principles dont stop bullets cant blunt knives tenn yes so tired and slipping and her lips breathing the words to his ear tenn if you had him if you have taken him but you are blocked and you cannot bring him out would you kill him i dont know you have to make an answer would you kill him as justice would you kill him as revenge for what he did to the wounded i dont know kill him for what he did to dorrie i dont know you will remember what i told you if he is begging you for his life you will have to be cruel do you have it inside you good and ordinary and decent man to be cruel please dont talk please i want to know what he is like i want to see his face hear his speech watch him move i want to know how he is different he is married he has a child he is a leader of his people i understand all of those things i do not understand how he could have beaten the wounded and knifed them and shot them i do not understand how he could have looked into the face of your dorrie and beaten her and knifed her and shot her i have to believe that i will find something of him that is different if he is not different then we are all lost i see only victims i do not know those who make the victims i see the results of their violence but i am not able to see the source of the violence penn surely you dont believe that i came here only because i was afraid for you penn i despise sentiment there are souls in the transit centre and they do not even own hope and their number is minimal in comparison with the greater number who have suffered they deserve some however small act of retribution half a century ago it was my own country that bred the evil and the evil was made by men and women that you would have passed in the street and thought no different from yourself the evil must be isolated stopped if he is a good and ordinary and decent man then there is no hope for any of us none then it is indeed the beginning of that dark age i have to pray that he is different penn slept you will give me the wit to believe that you are not joking with me no sir i am most serious would that it were a joke it was a part of the first secretarys upbringing that he would address a more senior man with respect and a lesson of his teenage years at marlborough school well learned that evasion of a problem came back to haunt he sat stiffly in the chair while the director of civilian affairs paced heaving on his cigar he got himself out and now he has gone back in thats what i am saying the smoke of the cigar spat from the directors mouth you appreciate the implications of what you tell me it is because i appreciate them that i have come to you i am not a highly educated man just a fucking paddy i have a bad degree out of dublin business management crap maybe i dont have the intellect for this job maybe a man with a greater intellect could do this job without having to spend fifteen seventeen hours a day stuck at this desk or sitting in on meetings with the most godawful people christ ever invented maybe i spend those hours every day trying to stamp out the nastiest brush fire europe has seen in half a century i hate this place i hate its bestiality and its barbarity its love of slitting the throats of old friends and former neighbours i understand sir what i am trying to do with my pisspoor intellect is create some sort of ceasefire so that the killing stops are you following me very clearly i have these war crimes groupies fucking about in my backyard at the moment they are little more than a nuisance but each day theyre here each day they dig their hole deeper so their power of sabotage increases i appreciate that sir let me tell you something in confidence right now this week there is a meeting in budapest between croat bureaucrats and serb bureaucrats there is a meeting scheduled tomorrow in detroit out of the limelight between a croatian constitutional lawyer and a serb with the same education two days ago in athens there wound up a session involving bosnian muslims and serbs thank christ those bloody journalists down in sarajevo and belgrade and zagreb are too preoccupied with getting hero medals on the front lines they dont know the half of whats being worked the first secretary knew of all three meetings and disguised his knowledge small mercies under the fucking carpet we are working night and day for a ceasefire and talk of war crimes tribunals is an obstruction shit the serbs have monsters in their ranks but so do the croats so do the bosnian muslims everybody in this mess is guilty if an alleged war criminal is kidnapped and brought out of sector north then i can kiss goodbye to a ceasefire most especially if they also bring out an eyewitness got me for six months now i have oiled these bastards towards talking with each other you know what you should see them get a croat and a serb together in a quiet hotel with a bar and you sure as hell wouldnt know theyve been beating double shades of shit out of each other they want a deal they laugh together drink together probably go looking for tail together they want out i wouldnt wish you to think that my government in any way condones the action of this freelancer quite the opposite and who will believe you there might have been a microphone in the room best to assume there were microphones recording the conversation the first secretary spoke softly which is why i brought you the information which is why we will do our damnedest to make certain no alleged war criminal is brought out from sector north i think we are running on the same rails it wont happen the face of the director lightened as if he were now amused but it was your prime minister who called for tribunals should never pay too much attention to political ramblings and this penn interfering fucking nobody hes your man the first secretary was smiling pity that he didnt stay home i met him not very impressive but hes been caught up in the emotion of the place capable in a technical sense but not very bright capable enough perhaps to make it back to the kupa river but not bright enough to see the implications of his actions if he takes his man then well hear about it as you know better than me the dust sheets will be coming off the artillery pieces and the cladding will be off the groundtoground missiles that can reach southern zagreb they might even get to loading up i dont think theyd fire unless this wretched clerk from salika village is actually out of their territory penn will not be allowed to cross the river with his prisoner i thought you should know he saw the spreading astonishment crack the directors face youd see him go to the wall your man the first secretary had served one tour two years in dublin as a junior six person covered by diplomatic status he thought he knew the southern irish he thought they reckoned that the british were always totally devious quite ruthless well hes not our man everything of note everything sensitive to his work marty had locked away in the floor safe he was checking his shopping list and beside him as he stood was the howl of the mainspowered electric drill they were cheerful young guys the two swedish soldiers with the drill perhaps carpenters or engine mechanics back home before their turn in the armed forces when they had made the deep screw sockets in the floor they would fix down the metal ring that he had demanded they did not ask him why he wanted a metal ring fastened to the floor of the converted freight container and he would not have told them the reason for it he checked his list carefully typed out bed collapsible sleeping bag plus blanket food bread margarine jam sliced ham sausage milk lit res hotel room reservation kd eyewitness chain metres padlocks keys each pair handcuffs keys he told the swedish soldiers that they should close the door when they had finished fastening the ring in the floor the ring would hold a padlock the padlock would hold a chain the chain would hold a second padlock the second padlock would hold a pair of handcuffs the pair of handcuffs would hold a war criminal marty jones had told anyone who would listen since he had come to zagreb that it was the means that were important not the end he reckoned himself entitled to change his mind he said to the swedes that he would be out for the rest of the afternoon gone shopping the sun was lowering behind the trees edging for the summit crest of the hillside the woodland that blanketed the long valley steamed from the heat of the day and now there was the first freshness from the coming of the evening they were past the skeletons un cared for and untouched since he had last seen them and he had watched the control settle on ulrikes face as if the refugees shot down were not a part of her business the way she had gone by the skeletons told him of her strength so small so fragile so bloody strong he had pointed down to the swaddled bodies of the babies and ulrike had not flinched and he had felt the tears welling in his eyes he no longer held her hand he felt his trust for her down from the trees below in the width of the valley he could hear the drive of two tractor engines but the tractors and the fields were still masked from them by the thickness of the trees foliage when they came to the minefield to the needle lengths of wire rising up through the leaf carpet he broke the rule that he had made for himself he spoke he told her of the cat and he swayed his hips to show the way that the cat had eased itself against the antennae of the mines just for a moment of lightness almost of clowning then he caught a grip on himself this was no bloody place to go clowning but if they didnt laugh they would cry and if they cried they would be broken they pushed on she went easily she could have been on a forest ramble ulrike would know the reality because she took in the refugees she would know they were moving into the eye of the storm the stream was silver and black between the trees they stopped still they stood against a wide oaks trunk and they could see beyond the stream to the orchard blossoms and the smoke wreath above the chimneys of salika gold light fell on the valley they saw two old tractors moving in the fields across the stream the one spread manure and the other ploughed and across the stream they saw a man and a child walking away from the village and penn shuddered he did not need to tell her milan stankovic held the childs hand and he carried on his shoulder two fishing rods and a landing net milan and the child were coming away from the village and were walking on the far bank of the stream past the silver spate water towards a dark slow pool they had a plan the plan dictated that first they should find the eyewitness he estimated the village was a mile from the pool and the tractors were half a mile from milan stankovic and his boy ulrike understood the dilemma she said you must have the eyewitness first you must it is our opportunity the eyewitness is evidence evidence is necessary we get the eyewitness as if she were speaking to a juvenile they have not even begun they will be there when we want them to be there penn you have to be cruel he was looking at the child who skipped along beside his father and he could faintly hear the excited squeals of the child who held his fathers hand they went back into the depth of the trees where the trunks were set closer he looked twice into her face to see if the sight of the target man had changed her if the sight of the child with the target man disturbed her and he saw nothing but a chilled and steadfast determination they pushed on they moved now in short rushes he would select a big tree ahead and he would go fast to it and hug against it and she would come to him and they would wait would listen and he would choose the next tree he recognized that he made more noise than she did that his feet were heavier and his footfall clumsier he could see the jagged rooftops of rosenovici back to domes place back again into dorries war he could see through the trees the broken tower of the church and he could see the lane that led to katica dubeljs hovel home he caught at ulrikes arm when she came lightstepped to him and his hand was across his mouth to demand her silence and he pointed to the greyblack smear of the earth among the weeds in the corner of the field and he seemed to hear again the horrid young woman laughing at him mocking him it was a madness and it was for her and her laughter clamoured in his mind they came to the path that climbed the hill slope behind the village that had died he could have turned then when he came to the path he saw the worn mess of the path mud stamped by boots he remembered how the path had been covered in fallen and undisturbed leaves at that point he could have gone back into the wood he went at the side of the path he came to the mouth of the cave where the grass was broken where the boots had gathered he took the small torch from the backpack side pouch ulrikes hand was on his arm holding tight to him as if to give him courage he stood in the entrance of the cave he shone the torch beam forward and from the dark recess twin lights amber blazed back at him the beam found the cat wideeyed crouched on the rag bundle snarling at the light he saw the parchment skin of the face of katica dubelj and he saw the darkened slashes of the knives work he saw the cat was across her stomach and past the cats tail were the spindlethin legs of katica dubelj and the long black material of her dress was forced up to her waist and he saw the white death of the skin of her thighs he swung the light away away from the cat who guarded her he reeled out of the cave ulrike held him it is what they always do they violate old women they rape old women perhaps you are responsible penn dont every time for the rest of your life that you take a woman to your bed perhaps it was you that led them to her penn dont say that every time you take a woman to your bed for warmth and for love you will remember her it is what you have to live with here penn your responsibility dont let me hear you say that because you are not man enough to hear it its not boys games it is about survival it is about the code of living that you believe in you do not have an eyewitness so you have to take him and you have to make him convict himself are you strong enough to make him convict himself i have to be and he has the child with him are you strong enough she had walked the city all of the afternoon not shopping and not window gazing but a restless striding as if walking the streets was an escape from the isolation of her hotel room dogtired her feet killing mary braddock found a cafe on the trg bana jelacica a table to herself a cappuccino was brought to her it was none of it fair not fair of charles to shout down the telephone at her god mary do you understand what youve done not fair of the earnest young american investigator to challenge her as long as you know maam what youre asking that man to do not fair of penn to tell her simply i doubt you ever listened to your daughter nothing was fair it was what any mother would have done suddenly they came around her they were noisy bouncing with humour they didnt ask her if they could take the rest of the table she sat huddled amongst the young students they ignored her they were squashed close to her and they had their study books on the table and one tried to read what she thought was poetry and there was happy mocking from her friends she drank the dregs of her coffee and amongst them there was a pale and gauntfaced young man with cropped blond hair and the young man was struggling to lift an unmounted canvas from a wide bag she saw that he struggled because he used his left hand only and she saw the way that the right sleeve of his jacket hung empty the work on the canvas violent and bold and crude showed a young woman crucified and the cross had fallen in filth and their laughter was around her and she was not a part of them and their babble at the merit of the work it was not fair because she craved to be included they were her domes people damn her it was a warm spring evening a long valley and the trees from the woodland threw broad bold shadows on the grassland it was an idyllic setting a father inserted a fishing hook into a writhing worm and cast the line into the hidden darkness of a slow pool and handed the rod to his child son it was a place of calm of peace they had worked the plan through when they had still been in the tree line of the wood how they would shatter the evening break the idyll crack the calm and the peace they had talked it through coldly and penn had said what he would do and ulrike had agreed the plan he took off his trousers and she unzipped her jeans and kicked them off over her boots and there was no shyness between them nor any humour it was a small part of the plan that it would be better for them when they crossed the stream to keep their trousers dry it was part of the plan methodical and point by point that it would be better for them when they fled with the prisoner to have dry trousers they heard the excited squeal of the child and saw him arc his rod up but there was no fish it was a good moment for penn to go he saw the father bent over the grass and the man milan stankovic the man who was the killer of dorrie mowat would be searching in a tin or a jar for a fresh worm to thread onto the hook penn had such confidence in her he did not feel the need to look back at her for reassurance he left the tree line and as he ran across the weeded and untended grassland of the field towards the stream he could see the hunched lowset shoulders of the man and the child he took a line towards a mess of fallen willows that were up the valley from the deep pool where they fished he was running blind because all of his attention was on the lowered shoulders of the man and the child and the skin of his shins and thighs was nicked by the old thistles of the field that had not been worked since the fall of rosenovici since the death of dorrie mowat he saw the man straighten and the child was pointing to where the fish had taken the worm and was trying to wrestle the rod back from his father so that he might cast again more quickly penn had dived to the ground fallen among nettles that pricked at the bared skin of his legs he was crawling towards the bushes of willow the worm was in the water they were both of them watching the line penn hesitated when he reached the willows cover there was a high bank to the stream cut deep by the winters flow where the willow branches fell into the water penn looked up into the closing dusk and he saw far away that the tractors were retreating towards the dulled blossom of the orchards and the climbing smoke of the village it was so quiet he slid down the bank he dropped into the pressure power of the current it was shallow water above the pool going quickly they were both of them man and child rapt and staring into the dark water in front of them it was the chance that he must take his body was bent so that the water broke against his chest as he took chopped strides on the smoothed big stones of the streams bed he made the crossing he came to the far bank and grabbed at a root and dribbled the streams water from his mouth penn came up the bank he lay in the grass and he felt for the soaked fine rope that was a part of the plan and for the torn cloth strip from the tail of his shirt he was forty yards perhaps fifty along the bank of the stream from the man and the child there was a shout the happiness of the child gave a moment of opportunity to penn he was behind them going cat quick closing on them the rod was arched above them they were both clinging to the rod and the child was yelling and the father was trying to calm him he had the opportunity penn came on them when he was close when he was a stride away from them the father turned when his hand was raised for the blow milan stankovic saw him when he had the heel of his hand high the killer of dorrie mowat gazed at him in bewilderment penn hit him penn hit the neck of milan stankovic defenceless because his hands were still clasping the rod above the shoulder and below the ear it was not a blow that would have felled a readied man but milan stankovic was in bewilderment and his hands came off the rod and he went down so fast the man on the grass of the field and penn rolling him onto his stomach and driving his knee down into the mans back and snatching clear the pistol at his waist and dragging up his right arm as if to break the socket at the shoulder the child held the curved and quivering rod and for that moment did not understand he saw ulrike break the cover of the trees and she was running whitened legs pumping to the far bank of the stream he had the noose on the wet rope around milan stankovics right wrist and then he was pulling the left arm back to meet the right wrist and binding the wrists together it was about advantage and the advantage of surprise diminished milan stankovic shouted in his fear and he heaved with his hips his buttocks to throw off penn with the fear was recognition it was the struggle of the animal that senses in fear the open doorway of the abattoir she was coming dripping along the streams bank hurrying to him and the child had thrown down the rod they came together at penn ulrike and the child he pulled milan stankovic upright the child clung to his fathers legs he hit milan stankovic hard across the back of the skull with the barrel of the pistol to hurt and to stun the child beat at penn with small clenched fists penn had one hand on the roped wrists of milan stankovic and the other hand held the pistol under the chin of the man who had killed dorrie mowat and he was trying to propel milan stankovic away and back towards the fast spate waters above the pool and he could not move him because the child held at his fathers legs and punched and kicked at his fathers attacker ulrike was there penn saw the cold in her eyes ulrike had said that he would have to be cruel she caught the child she broke the childs grip she threw the child down viciously onto the grass of the field penn and ulrike ran on the bank to the upper end of the pool and they had the weight of milan stankovic between them they scrambled him down the bank and into the flow of the stream he slumped once between them his feet slipping and he was doused over his head and was spluttering water when they pulled him up just before they reached the tree line penn swung to look behind him he saw the rod sliding away into the pool ulrike amongst the trees retrieved the backpack he saw the child running demented across the empty fields and back towards the village and the smoke and the blossom dull in the dusk evica shook him shook her marko she shook him hard to kill the hysteria in her son and then she held him against her until the panted sobbing subsided until he could tell her eighteen she ran fast down the lane of the village punishing herself carrying the weight of her son she had pulled her coat from the hook on the door she had left the dog in the kitchen she had swept the food cooking in the pots off the stove fleetingly she saw the priest sitting bowed at his window table with the oil lamp lit and the chessboard laid out she saw the wife of the headmaster sitting hunched near to the barred window she ran through the stillness of the village in the greying light past the garage where gasoline used to be sold before the war and the sanctions past the shop where food could be bought before the war and the sanctions she ran through the silence of the village her feet clattering the quiet she ran until she no longer had the strength to carry her son and then she dragged him his stumbling feet slipping in the potholes of the lane she came to the building used now by the territorial defence force of salika village that had been filled with agricultural stores before the war and the sanctions she went across the yard and past the barns where the big agricultural plant was kept idle because it was impossible to obtain spare machinery parts and tyres and fuel she burst into the office area she saw the guns of the killers and the playing cards and the bottles heaped on the table of the office area she was the acting headmistress of the school and she was the woman who had been to university in belgrade and she saw the dislike of her in the faces of the killers they stared up at her from the chairs around the table that was heaped with their guns and their playing cards and their bottles evica said in not more than a whisper milan milan has been taken milan is captured she looked into each of their faces brankos stevos milos and she had never hidden that she despised each of them equally evica did not plead you have to search for him you have to find him you have to bring him back to me there was the stink of their bodies and the smoke of their cigarettes and the stench of the alcohol she held marko tight against her and there had been first their amusement at the superior bitch fighting for breath then the fuddled confusion of the drink then they were listening evica would not beg search because he had gone fishing find him gone fishing with marko taken across the river from the postman by whom i cant know from the gravedigger who took him i was not there from the carpenter why i do not know you have to find him marko was there the hand of the chief of the irregulars snaked out a rough and calloused and large hand the hand snatched at the shoulder of her sons anorak and the boy was pulled from her for a moment she tried to hold the boy she saw fear in the face of her son and she could not protect him the boy was dragged to the table her grip on him was broken and the time was rushing and the darkness was closing rough and guttural questions small and frightened answers they had gone fishing they were fishing the big pool up the valley there was no one near to them while they were fishing she watched and she realized the patience of the chief of the irregulars that he let her son regain his confidence through the story of their fishing the big fish the good trout had taken the worm stripped it from the hook they had bent to put another worm on the hook they had cast again into the pool the fish had taken the worm taken the hook a big fish pulling at the rod and his father helping him to hold the rod up but the time was running and the darkness was gathering hurry marko what you saw and she was cut to silence by the slashed wave of the chief of the irregulars he stood amongst them her son and he told his story the man had come from behind them as they held the rod together to fight the fish his father had loosed the rod he had looked round his father was on the ground on the grass of the field the man was without trousers the man knelt on his father and was binding his arms the man had pulled his father up and hit him he fought the man he tried to kick the mans legs a woman had come he tried to stop them from taking his father the woman had thrown him down the woman had hurt him what was he like the man some of them already knew she trembled she remembered she heard the voice that she had translated i have the evidence for my report that dorrie mowat was killed by was murdered by milan stankovic she saw the face of the man beaten and scarred and cut they shared the guilt pandemonium breaking out of the office area of the tdf headquarters shouts cries in the night and the gathering up of weapons and the howling of awakened dogs and who was the leader now the one from the irregulars but he did not know the terrain of the valley the postman the gravedigger the carpenter and was there a working telephone line out of the village and where was the man to link the radio to glina military and where should the search begin in the woodland across the stream in darkness at the deep pool where her milan had been captured she heard the babble of argument and time was running she shouted above their voices cowards you all share the guilt it was not just him that did it idiots if milan is taken your leader it is all of you who are threatened murderers in confusion in disordered chaos the village was armed the link was made and interrupted and made again and interrupted again with glina military and the search party moved out into the lane in front of the old agricultural store and the debate of tactics began they had no leader she remembered the man what he had said and what he had seemed to be tell dorries mother the name of the man who killed her daughter dignified brave remote from the law of the bastard village that was her home not intimidated by the violence threatening him if that man had her milan evica reckoned that the man and the woman who had taken her husband had a start on them of near to an hour at the first halt an hour gone since they had moved into the haven of the tree line on the west side of the valley he had given milan stankovics pistol to ulrike and he had shone the torch full into the face of milan stankovic and he had held the smallbladed knife against the bearded throat of the man she knew their language she interpreted into the wide greyblue eyes he had said that if they were trapped if they were intercepted if they could go no further he would slit that throat and at the rest stop two minutes on his watch he and ulrike had taken their turn in watching him close and they had slipped on again their dry trousers he had whisper growled the threat to slit milan stankovics throat and he did not think he was then believed he attempted to be cruel because it was what ulrike had ordered of him and as the second hand of his watch was slipping for the end of the two minutes he had summoned what he hoped was ferocity and he had told milan stankovic that if he shouted screamed howled he would cut his throat penn dragged him forward ulrike led with the torch cupped in the palm of her hand so that it made a short cone of light ahead of her feet penn had the knife close to milan stankovics neck so that when they pitched or stumbled then the tip of the blade would waver against the fullness of the mans beard it was not important to him that the man had spat contempt at him the man did not shout but instead talked softly he was not gagged because penn had thought that if he were gagged with the torn strip off the tail of his shirt then his breathing would be impaired and he would not be able to go as fast as was required of him a low and calm voice he could hear the murmur of the voice and the staccato bursts of ulrikes sideofmouth interpretation you think you can succeed then you are a lunatic the whole village will be coming man and boy guns you are the stranger here dont know the ways in the forest they know them you only took me because i had the boy with me because i was distracted with the boy if i had not had the boy you would not have taken me you are shit shit when you came the first time shit now they will be coming after you coming close to you it is our forest not yours why you have no possibility you say you will kill me you would not dare there was a change in ulrikes voice there was no longer an automaton translation but something said softly in the mans language and the mans words dried penn asked what did you tell him ulrike said not looking back you might not kill him but i would thats what i told him that i would kill him he may not believe you he should believe me and i asked him if he felt guilt she was so strong he wondered if she had ever felt weakness and everything of her was denied him he wondered where she had been five years before when he had waited on the railway station for the delayed train and chatted to the stranger jane and taken the taxi down to raynes park where jane lived he wondered if ulrike schmidt who allowed no sentiment would have looked at him then admired him or wanted to share with him his best friend dougal gray would have understood penn had heard that dougal gray in belfast now lived with the separated wife of a policeman in the heart of danger men and women were thrown together and thought they found love when they squirmed only for comfort in a year when dougal gray finished his extended tour and was posted back to gower street there would be no chance that the separated wife of a policeman would up sticks to travel with him there was no future he had a hold of the wrists of milan stankovic that were knotted with the fine rope at the pit of his back each time that they had gone a hundred metres each moment that they stopped he strained for the sounds of pursuit and milan stankovic was listening too each time he bent his neck that he would hear better the first signs of the chasing pack they went on into the depth of the woodland climbing from the valley there were some who said they should take cars and the jeep and go up the road beyond bovic towards the pokupsko bridge where the kupa river was the ceasefire line there were others who said they should drive up the vrginmost road and then take the turning towards the artillery position and fan out into the woods from there and there was delay while the cars were filled with gasoline from the pump in the yard of the old agricultural store and there were some who said they should go on foot into the woodland from the rosenovici side of the stream and others said they should go first to where the boy had told them his father had been taken more delay for the argument some said they should wait for the army to come from glina military some said they should do the work for themselves she listened she wept they decided they had filled the cars with gasoline but they would not use them they would go on foot they would go across the bridge and through the village of rosenovici and they would make a beating line through the woodland she wept because she saw the wild excitement in torchlit faces as if they were away and off to drive a boar from thicket scrub to rouse a deer for shooting she watched the column of bouncing lights raucously tailing away towards the bridge evica stankovic realized how greatly she loathed them all of them and she wiped the tears off her face and she led marko away she went to the house of the priest the priest should have been her friend as the headmaster should have been her friend she gave her son into the care of the priest and his wife she despised the man as she despised herself the priest and the headmaster and herself were the only three souls of the village with education but amongst them only the headmaster had stood up for what he believed she told the priest that milan had been taken as a war criminal and she saw the shallow sneer on the priests face and she knew him to be an ambivalent bastard he told a story in his low singing voice it was the story of a croat the story of matija gubec the leader of a revolt in the year of against the tyrant franjo tahi he said it was the story of a little man who had risen to great power he wanted gubec to be a big man amongst the peasants and he made an organization of revolt the sign of recognition with his people was a sprig of evergreen the simple people followed him but they were tricked by the superior intellect of the tyrant they were told that while they went with the peasant rabble so the turks were gathering to pillage their homes and they deserted gubec he was taken he was brought to zagreb he was led to st marks square for a coronation but the crown was iron and the crown was heated by fire until the iron was white hot he was crowned and then he was dismembered it is a story of long ago before we were civilized the story of a man who reached too far he would have known that she was desperate for speed and he had held her with the mincing words of the story and with the tail of the story he had kicked her so many times the priest had walked to her house and wheedled for favours from her milan and patted the head of her marko the chess set was laid out on the table of rough stained oak the priest the bastard had not had the courage to stand beside his friend when the headmaster faced death then the priest the bastard had stayed quiet that the priest dared taunt her was absolute proof of how alone she was they blamed her the priest and his wife for the humbling and the killing of a friend she left her son there whimpering with the thinboned fingers of the ambivalent bastard resting on the boys shoulder she went back to her home and she put on heavy boots and took the rusted bayonet down from the high wall hook and she called for the dog to come with her she knew the name of the dog the name given it by the ustase croat people and she took the big flashlight with the dog at her heel she went away across the fields on the east side of the river she could see their torches going through rosenovici village and she could hear them she went alone with the dog and she called it with its ustase name to be close to her she knew how it would be they would search a small area the area around the villages their own area they were tribal they would not move beyond the boundary of their own area she could recall when some of the young men of the village had been volunteered for duty last year outside petrinja in the trenches facing sisak and they had drifted home within twelve days because it was not their own war beyond their own area her dog would know the scent of milan her torch found the jar of worms and the landing net and one of the rods her dog whined at the bank beyond the pool and her torch showed the sliding marks of boots and bodies she had the dog on a lead and she tugged it down into the fierce flow of the stream you sort of people you always back a loser the first secretary said it drily he drove his big rover along the nightempty highway from karlovac towards zagreb a heavy brute to drive but it was weighted with armour plating on the side doors and with bulletproof glass for the windows and the selfsealing tyres that could absorb small shrapnel and lowvelocity gunfire were unresponsive ham whined whatll happen good to know you care whatll happen to me god just for one moment for one fleeting second of time i thought you were concerned with someone other than your own miserable self a constant disappointment freefall you have been to me whatll happen to you youll be shovelled on like any other bag of rubbish thats dumped on someone elses front step nagorny karabakh wasnt it not nagorno best you learn how to say it first theyre welcome to entertain you myself if i were you id choose the armenian side rather than the azeris but knowing your track record itll be the azeris because theyre the losers he prided himself that he retained some small influence in this awful corner of europe he had done an insignificant deal with the croat military a personal arrangement with the intelligence officer involving an insubstantial roll of german banknotes and the promise of future contact anyone could be bought in this awful corner surprisingly cheaply in this case he had won the release of sidney ernest hamilton code name freefall into his personal custody just the matter of handing in the wretchs uniform his kit his id and the dragunov and the little list of contacts for the moving on of black market supplies of marlboro cigarettes and he had been given the wretch in handcuffs will you snitch him i beg your pardon try to speak english please shop him tell the serbs where to be waiting for him will you you should just stick to losing affairs of state arent your business freefall never were and never will be theyll make you watch theyll put you in a chair so that you are comfortable and theyll make you watch it was close to dawn they could start to see the way ahead of them and there was no longer a need for her to shine the torch in front of her feet penn had stopped twice to rest and he had allowed milan stankovic to eat a small piece of bread and he had given him a broken piece of sharp cheese and once he had unzipped the mans trousers and handled him so that he could urinate without messing his trousers he felt exhaustion and milan stankovic also fought tiredness but she still had strength and she set a pace that was hard and from the side of her mouth she gave briskly and without feeling the interpretation of what he said when they have you sitting down and comfortable then they will put her down onto the floor and they will strip off the trousers from her and they will take the knickers from the bitch and they will all come to her all serve her what its like when a big boar pig comes to serve a sow big so that it hurts one after the other all of them in the village old men young men me last of all and they will make you watch he did not know how she could translate and how she could not cringe he did not know how she could not turn on him and hit him each time that they made the short stops he would listen and sometimes he would hear far distant shouts and then they would press ahead faster the decision that he had to make was where to lie up whether they should go forward as the light grew and lie up until darkness at the bank of the kupa river to wait for the inflatable to come across at the rendezvous point or whether they should lie up through the daylight and then make the charge in the dusk to the river he was not ready to make the decision and he could not think clearly while the voice of the man droned on and while she gave her clipped interpretation before they shoot her we will play with you which do you prefer electricity fire knife cuts electricity on your balls is that what you would prefer fire on your feet on your body needles from the fire under your fingernails knife cuts at your testicles and your penis on your fingers at your ears the knife going into your eyes the last you will know of the electricity and the fire and the knife will be from me you will be crying for me to finish it and you will be shouting for me to go to her with the electricity and the fire and the knife cuts but you can let me go free penn understood he remembered the arrogant conceit a long time ago of an irishman not a big provo but a secondrater from the feeble irish national liberation army faction who had been picked up when five their role as watchers completed had deigned to call in the antiterrorist branch for the formality of the arrest the irishman skinny little creep had been spreadeagled on the carpet of his pigsty living room and he had been silent but the arrogance and the conceit had been large on his bloody face as if to say theyd crack nothing out of him is that what you want do you want to sit comfortably and watch all of the men and me screw the arse off her before she dies do you want to let me go free do you want to feel the electricity wires on you and the fire burns and the knife cuts they make pain but they dont make death not till we are ready do you want that or do you want to let me go free ulrike spoke in his language and his words withered they heard vehicles they were straining fourwheeldrive jeeps and they were manoeuvring in the slipping rutted mud of the loggers track they were crouched down and he held the knife so tight against the bulged adams apple at the bearded throat of milan stankovic that the skin was nicked and he drew blood they were away from the track in the depths of the trees and they could see the soldiers in the jeeps and he could see the guns that the soldiers held he held the knife so close against the throat of milan stankovic and the images were splayed in his mind of ulrike laid out on a floor of concrete and her legs held open and the electricity wires clipped to his skin the vehicles bucked on the track and passed his decision was taken they would go on until they reached the kupa river what did you tell him ulrike said i told him that i wanted to hear him speak of his shame when he killed dorrie mowat what does it fucking mean in a simpletons terms he stood in front of the wall map not a military man the director of civilian affairs found the big wall maps so beloved of the military to be sanitized and cold viewing he assumed that the neat laundered officers around him the canadian colonel and the jordanian major and the argentine captain could make sense of the whorls and lines the wall map nine feet in height and equally broad covered the entire area of former yugoslavia and was draped with a clear plastic sheet on which had been written in china graph crayon the disposition of unprofor units the jordanian major held a long pointer and identified sector north and then salika village the argentine captain said they have a mass of radio traffic mostly out of glina but hooked in to vojnic where they have command and control and linked to petrinja and lasinja and skakavac and brezova glava which are close to the ceasefire demarcation line we have the situation reports from our monitoring of their units that have been put to state red alert along the kupa river we have the transcripts of the radio transmissions made by the field troops that are deployed we have visual confirmation of their movement from the dan batt fixed observation posts xray and xray and it means the canadian said it means that hes coming coming with his prisoner coming to the river it means that hes being hunted what chance theyve lost him in the immediate vicinity of his snatch they reckon to block him on the river i said what chance if the serbs were to know where he planned to cross the river no chance they do not have that information he has a slight chance he was looking up and the tip of the pointer was against the bland green of the map surface cut only by the kupa river no roads he imagined it as a morass of swamp the director thought he was playing god almighty with the life of a man coming to the river with his prisoner and he thought that the man coming to the river with his prisoner was playing god almighty with the lives of all those within reach of the artillery and the missiles he turned his back on the map went slowly and subdued out of the operations room he wondered what it was like the swamp morass to which the man was coming with his prisoner it was a small farm not more than five hectares where zoran pelnak and his wife lived the farm gave at best a hard living and it was poorer now that his two sons were taken by the army before the boys had gone one to the garrison at osijek and one down in the south at gospic zoran pelnak had had their help in the never finished work of cleaning and deepening the drainage ditches that cut his land the fields were too low set for good farming ground too near to the river that flooded its banks most winters and most winters the farmhouse of brick and wood was set upon a small island in a shallow lake it was zoran pelnaks home had been his fathers home and his grandfathers and his greatgrandfathers home his greatgrandfather and his grandfather and his father had dug the drainage ditches and cleaned them and deepened them there were three fields for the farm and in two of them he harvested a hay crop and grazed animals and in one of them he and his wife grew their vegetables for their own eating and for sale in the market at karlovac he and his wife could survive the isolation of their life on the farm that fronted the north bank of the kupa river their neighbours had long gone left their homes and their farms and their livestock abandoned them he would not leave he would not have cared to have gone to the graves of his greatgrandfather and his grandfather and his father sat on his haunches beside the stones and explained why he was running from the drainage ditches they had dug he moved slowly from the front door of the farmhouse from the porch of the door he could see across the field and the bog land where the cattle could go only in summer the far bank of the kupa river and the trees he moved slowly from the rheumatism that came from living in a place so damp towards the barn where his four cows were bedded and the pigs and the goats and the hens on the far bank behind the trees maybe the bastard fuck partizans watched him and he was too old to care if they saw him zoran pelnak knew most of what happened each day and each night on the far bank of the kupa river he pressed on into the barn and he hoped that the soldiers would soon be down from their camp for their well water because the soldiers would help him lift down the baled hay for the animals it was many hours since evica had last heard the advance behind her of the search party and their shouts she guessed they would have turned by now cold from the night down because of their failure she guessed they would be heading back to their village arguing between themselves going back to food and warmth and going back to dispute the new command of salika and to fight for control of the diesel supplies and the sacks of seed potatoes two would fall she thought branko and milo would fall one would rise stevo would command the village she thought the wife of stevo the most stupid woman she knew and the wife of stevo would take her place as the villages queen they would turn back when they reached the perimeter line of their vicious and ignorant world and her village would become an armed camp isolated guarded close the dog had the scent and moved easily ahead of her loping on the trail on which her man had been taken marty was told it by an austrian of uncivpol told that the balloon was up in sector north he was a good friend of the austrian policeman because they had shared a house when the snow had fallen in january on bosnia away down east in srebrenica and it had been goddamn cold because the house had only half a roof a place where men became good friends the austrian policeman had been coming off duty he had a new posting at the uncivpol desk in the operations room and he had told marty that all hell was loose across in sector north and that the crossing points were closed at turanj and at sisak that a bigshot guy from a village in glina municipality had been kidnapped that it was some crazy stuff about a war crimes investigator and more crazy that there was the german woman from the unhcr transit centre at karlovac in tow the austrian policeman had told him all of this and his eyes had been going past where marty stood in the doorway of the converted freight container hooked on the shining steel ring set in the floor of the container and the chain that was padlocked to it and the collapsible bed that was made up in the far corner behind marty with the sleeping bag laid on it and the folded blanket and the handcuffs and marty had told him dead serious that because he was homesick hed gotten a big brute of a bear a proper grizzly being crated in from anchorage and he had gotten rid of the austrian policeman as fast as was half decent he drove into central zagreb marty thought of the photographs on the walls of the freight container pictures of the weak and the outnumbered and the defenceless who had been caught behind the lines he parked among the new black bmws in their sleek rows the wheels of the fat cat bastards who were doing fine he went up to her room marty jones told mary braddock that penn was coming with his prisoner towards the river he looked for her excitement that penn had taken milan stankovic away from the village of salika he watched for her triumph that a huge manhunt was in progress in sector north between the village of salika and the kupa river he expected to see her flinch that the whole of the goddamn place beyond the ceasefire line was alive roused he expected to see her wilt i want to look into his face i want him to know that he murdered my daughter i want to be there when hes brought across thats positive thinking maam and positive thinking is always good could just be premature thinking do you have any appreciation of the odds against pennll bring him across the river i dont doubt it he felt almost an anger she was sitting in an armchair and her legs narrow and fine were crossed in elegance and ulrike schmidt the best woman hed known was hacking through a bucket of hell with penn and the prisoner and the jaws of the goddamn trap were closing tight as they had closed on those who were photographed on the walls of his converted freight container one thing to goddamn talk about it one thing to make the great goddamn plan quite another to maam its not a picnic he didnt have to go he never met my daughter of course not but he talked some unpleasant rubbish about loving her i find that repulsive i dont need lectures in motherhood but i have the right to demand the punishment of my daughters killer he took our money it was like a dismissal he said he would go ring the mercenary down in karlovac it was a recklessness that pushed penn forward thought through well considered he would have made the decision to lie up through that long day and then after the fall of dusk complete the last charge for the river bank he did not ask her for her opinion and she did not challenge his decision he was drawn towards the river bank goaded towards it so tired and wanting only to be there where he could gaze out across the slow depth of the water he was driven towards it towards the danger of the last barrier the sun was up above them and slanted down diffused by the upper branches the danger would be at the last obstacle and that was where they would set their men where they would run their tripwires where they would make their ambushes he had now used the gag cloth wedged it between milan stankovics teeth and knotted the ends tight against the shaggy longgrown hair at the back of his neck milan stankovic accepted the gag and at the last stop of two minutes penn had thought he had seen the first slipping of his arrogance the first breaking of the conceit as if fear had begun to gnaw at the man and penn heard the breaking of a branch behind him they were away from the path they were far into the cover of the trees and ulrike had heard what he had heard and swung on her hips to look into his face they were frozen the movement of the forest woodland was around them and both were straining to hear the sound again of the breaking of a branch and penn held the knife hard against milan stankovics throat she broke the moment of stillness she moved on he went after her pushing the man forward and he did not know if they were followed he would not tell her that it was all ahead of them that the worst was in front of them the day supervisor scowled down at him oh youre so kind thank you so much and another thing id be very grateful if you could get me a few guidebooks former yugoslavia god what a miserable woman yes im very nearly through those books that get to the secondhand shops full of photographs id appreciate it so much henry carter smiled his sweetest she walked stiffly away and he regretted that he had insufficient courage to call after her and request a beaker of coffee if she brought him coffee she would probably accompany the visit with a further dose of that obnoxious sickly air freshener as a major favour she had brought him a set of photocopied newspaper clippings he was indeed nearly through perhaps he was nitpicking perhaps he was far beyond his brief but he did not care a job worth doing that sort of thing he was sifting the clippings believing they had a place in the file even though they were dated months after the events that consumed him the secretary general of the united nations should know what he was talking about guaranteeing his organizations support for the international war crimes tribunal we will put on trial those who have contributed to civilian suffering and it will not be forgiven will deal not only with the people accused of committing the crimes but also those who inspired the human rights violations we have to denounce it civilians are being bombed starved and mistreated and children are targeted by killers in the shadows good solid stuff and a pity that no one had bothered to tell the bureaucrats in their offices above library and not told the foreign and commonwealth office and not told unprofor worth entering in the file because penn that ordinary and decent man and maybe a bit of a clairvoyant and most certainly blessed with common sense would not have believed a word of it he grasped at another clipping and wrote a brief summary to go into the file with the clipping and hoped quite fervently that one fine day the file would be examined by a mandarin or an apparatchik with enough honesty to feel humility some chance frits kalshoven dutch academic had been appointed to job of chief prosecutor but resigned cited refusal of great britain and france and germany and italy to cooperate noted positive attitude of united states of america canada and norway also blamed obstruction of sister un agencies ah getting better gratifying to read it another clipping another digest henry carter squirmed but it was necessary for the full picture to be drawn if it were ever to be understood why penn had made that desperate and poorly considered expedition behind the lines into the heart of danger leave it to those bastards to sort out and a man may as well wait for his bath chair more brave talk a new prosecutor named ramon escovarsalom venezuelan attorneygeneral total budget of million eleven judges appointed nice work if you can get it at salary of per annum payable regardless of whether charges are brought the voice was cold behind him i have your guidebooks mr carter i have also to tell you that i will be complaining most forcibly to inhouse management about the demands you have placed upon us and your quite disgusting lack of personal hygiene henry carter breezed not much longer nearly finished nineteen the man was snivelling penn reckoned milan stankovic to be in bad shape and there were low grunting sounds in his throat that were muffled by the gag maybe it was exhaustion or maybe it was the tightness of the fine rope binding his wrists they were going slower they were close now to the inner line of the forward zone he reckoned the forward zone would be five miles a mile either way deep and in the forward zone would be the maximum concentration of strong points and minefields and tripwires and patrols and the forward zone could not be avoided could not be skirted he had shown her the way they should move weigh each footfall stop and listen and go and he thought she had learned well he had the knife so hard against milan stankovics beard that the man no longer seemed to doubt him and took as great a care with each stride as they did she would go forward she would stop she would listen she would flick her fingers for him to come with the prisoner they would both listen for a moment and then she would move forward again it was when the tears were coming faster on milan stankovics cheeks that she began again to interpret what the man said through the gag he is telling you about his grandparents his grandparents were taken out of salika village there was a cordon round the village made at first light by the germans and by the ustase fascists before the german troops and the fascists moved into the village his grandparents were able to hide his father in the barn where they kept two cows and their cart his father was eleven years old going forward again stopping listening when the german troops and the fascists came into the village they took all the men and women they could find and then the german troops stood back many of the ustase fascists were from rosenovici village and the german troops allowed them to take charge of the villagers from salika they were walked his grandparents and many others to glina town it was said to them when they reached glina without food or water that the serb villages provided help and support for the partizans who were hidden in the petrova gora forest which is near they were put into the church at glina his grandparents and the other people from the village and from other villages he says that many of the ustase fascists were from rosenovici and many would have known his grandparents and the other people the church was set on fire by the ustase fascists going forward stopping again listening he says the german troops were from a regiment of wurtemberg and they were country boys and they would have no part of it he says the fascists and there were many from rosenovici had blocked the doors of the burning church and they fired their rifles at the windows so that there was no escape from the fire he says it is the first story that his father told him going forward stopping listening again he says the story of what the ustase fascists did to his grandparents what the people from rosenovici did to their neighbours burning them with fire is in his bones and his blood and his mind and has been since he was a small child he says that you do not understand and that you cannot understand he says that you have no quarrel with him and that he has no quarrel with you he says now that you should try to understand he begs you to permit him to return to his people to his wife and to his son going forward stopping listening he felt the cold in him even when they crossed the small clearings where old trees had rotted and fallen where the sun caught him he felt cold she spoke to the man the whisper of the local language and again she killed the words and the pleading what did you say to him i asked him could he describe the face of dorrie mowat when he hit her knifed her and shot her the man was broken he took the lead he did not know how she could find the cruelty he let ulrike have charge of moving milan stankovic forward he handed her the knife and she held it against the mans throat as he had done she would use the knife of that he was certain ahead were the strong points and the minefields and the tripwires and the patrols as his defence he had only the skills he had learned as a child going to the badger sett or the vixens den stalking the fallow hind he remembered about the inla man and what the detective sergeant of the antiterrorist branch had told him weeks after the arrest meeting in a pub to hand over surveillance evidence notes that the arrogance and conceit had been stripped off the man with his clothes that the man had sat in his cell wearing his paper overall suit and wept there was nothing definite that he could tell her it was just his instinct each time they stopped and listened his instinct told him they were being followed but he saw nothing behind and heard nothing and it was all ahead of them the worst i dont know how well pick up the pieces again it was the usual way of their sessions they were in the kitchen the bulk of charles braddocks body was slumped on the table and he spoke muffled through his hands ive always made the decisions for her ive always said whatll happen damn it shes always been here waiting available arnold browne leaned against the sink pretty rare for him to be invited inside the manor house and not outside to the snug shed at the bottom of the garden but it was usual that he should play the punch bag for his neighbours monologue he supposed that he was attracted by the power of the man but he found the whined selfpity quite unpleasant lost her to that damned child i mean its hardly as if she can just walk back through the door and we carry on like nothing ever humiliated me in my own house at my own table with my own friends i mean its not even for the child living its for the child thats bloody dead not what i want not at all ive done everything that mary could have wished for needed asked for arnold she scrapped on me bloody ungrateful woman he went to the kitchen door it was not arnold brownes way to tell his neighbour that he thought him the most opinionated bully he had ever met or to inform his neighbour that he thought his wife to be the most selfish woman he had ever known it was not his way to tell his neighbour that a young man had been exploited when vulnerable and it was not his way to reveal that in his own mind he was tormented by guilt for his part in the matter he let himself out yes penn hes bill penn might be under william penn she stiffened mary braddock could endure no longer the isolation of her room she sat in a low chair in the lobby she waited for the telephone call from the earnest young american she straightened taut he was here this is where he was staying bill penn the reception clerk bored and superior was shaking his head reluctantly leafing through the guest list this is where he was booked in a nasal english voice she saw a small man overweight and bald he was leaning over the desk trying to read the lists as the reception clerks pencil moved languidly over the names he wore dirty jeans that were smeared in engine grease and an open shirt with a pullover that was ragged at the cuffs ah yes here but gone gone two days ago two days ago he checked out yes i remember mr penn i think he had had an accident but gone she saw his disappointment he looked jewish she saw him mouth a curse and he turned away she was up fast out of the low chair and she intercepted him by the glass swing doors excuse me you were asking for mr penn right its impertinent but in what connection depends who needs to know well if it doesnt seem ridiculous i suppose i could say im his employer the girls mother dorrie mowats mother im benny stein i met bill penn benjamin benny stein crown agent lorry driver brit aid convoy rescued me life threatened situation from sector north at considerable risk to himself his colleagues and the future shipment of aid through serboccupied territory she had recited it as if it were learned by heart you were in his report we were geared up to go back today down to knin but theres some flap over there crossing points closed we got put on hold seems i missed him just wanted to put alcohol down his throat good guy but you know that lucky guy so hes gone home not home mr stein back inside sector north i asked him to return there and thats what he did i asked him to bring out my daughters murderer thats what hes doing she stared him straight in the eyes she saw him shudder she thought that for a moment his mind was working like a slow mechanism but when they came his words had the deliberation of a quite total dislike do you know oscar wilde mrs braddock maybe you dont women have a wonderful instinct about things they can discover everything except the obvious what is obvious to me but not obvious to you is that over there inside sector north is a bloody awful corner of hell so you asked him to go back inside when i got to meet him he was kicked half to death they were taking him out to shoot him you know what he said he said that you told the worst stories about your daughter a story about her for every year of her life the stories seemed to queue up to foulmouth her and for your peace of mind you asked him to go back into that place well done mrs braddock for missing the obvious he pushed past her hammered into the swing doors she thought that benny stein if he had not pushed past her and run across the pavement would have hit her they played it as a game and the director watched the tip of the wand moved high on the wall map of the operations room and the canadian officer described the moves but there was no passion to the commentary initially there was a search mounted out of salika village that search did not make a trace and was wound down this morning the activity of the search is now in their prime militarized zone fronting onto the kupa river theyve cancelled leave beefed up the duty rosters they believe they have sealed the militarized zone its out of the hands now of the rabble because their main force military have taken charge we have no idea of the location of their target whether he is pressing on whether he has decided to go to ground while the heats hot from our monitoring of their radio it is clear that they do not as of this moment know his position nor his approximate position they seem however confident of blocking him in their militarized zone thats about where it stands youll excuse me for asking you sir but do you have that information where hes coming to they waited on him the argentine captain held the sheaf of papers that carried the monitored radio messages they watched him the jordanian major lowered the pointer from the map they searched him for truth the canadian colonel smiled dryly the director said in sadness more than anger i bloody well dont were only the united nations you see only the world body only the one international authority that every clown politician pays lip service to we are good enough to be derided humiliated insulted kicked from one fucking end of this place to the other good enough to shuffle aid round without being thanked not good enough to be trusted its what ive made a career at advancement without trust thank you gentlemen he went back with heavy steps up the flight to his office his secretary greeted him at the outer door messages in hand and with a gesture towards the three men sitting uncomfortably in the outer office and waiting for their delayed meeting he waved her away the director closed the door hard behind him he sat long at his desk and he smoked his cigar and loathed himself for the habit there were many telephones on his desk big decision of the day he reached for the white telephone and he dialled hard belting the buttons your guarantee he does not cross with his prisoner i want that as a promise i have that as an unequivocal promise i accept your guarantee he had the promise from the first secretary of the british mission that the man who was disowned would not be permitted to cross the river that night with his prisoner he must place his trust in the guarantee she did not know how much longer she could keep up the pace the dog could hold the pace whining for food in its hunger when she stopped to rest sometimes veering away from the scent to lap at a pool of old rainwater but the dog kept strength while she faded sometimes she had a kaleidoscope of lights in her mind hallucinations at her eyes she knew this part of the forest not well but she had been there as a teenager with the pioneers of the party when the young people had gone on long hiking marches with their tents and cooking gear when they were brought to the place of the massacre where the dog led her was within a halfhours walk of the place of the massacre at the place the teenagers had been lined up by the officials the rain dripping on them and the croat children and the serb children had listened to the officials tell of the shooting in cold blood by the ustase men of the group of women who were taking food to the partizans and after the speeches the teenagers croat and serb had murmured their factional insults at each other it was why she knew this part of the forest she had thought all through the length of the day that she would find soldiers and that the soldiers would go with her as the dog led them on the scent she had found no soldiers and now the light amongst the trees was fading she had only the bayonet evica stankovic had seen them first an hour before when darkness came they would be close to the river she had seen them for a moment where the haphazard growth of the trees made a clean corridor for her vision when darkness came again when they were near the river she would lose them she went on and all the time her eyes sometimes blinded in tiredness sometimes seared by the leaping lights searched for the shape of them evica stankovic had seen in that moment an hour before the man leading and the woman and her husband who was called a murderer was dragged between them the two military policemen were waiting on the platform of the station they were tall men and their heads were above the mass of passengers friends relations who crowded and waited for the instruction that they should board the train what i dont understand wrap it up freefall the first secretary threaded through the crush going towards the military policemen ham had spent the day imprisoned without ceremony in the basement cellar of the first secretarys villa on the high northern outskirts of zagreb among the firewood and the coal sacks with a thermos and a plate of sandwiches and a bucket i dont understand never was your strong point freefall understanding ham was given into the custody of the military policemen and they looked at him with a savagery that stripped off his face the first trace of the cheeky smile he was handcuffed to the younger of them he was handed the envelope of travel documents and checked them awkwardly onehanded why did you help me why didnt you leave me with the bastards now dont dally not in budapest not in sofia not in istanbul just get yourself straight through to yerevan frankly if you survive that train journey then youll come through any war intact even nagorny karabakhs little scrap part of the code freefall i dont like to leave colleagues dangling not in midstream the announcement was made over the loudspeakers and the passengers surged to the trains doors the cases were being passed up and the knotted bundles and the cardboard boxes reinforced with string the older military policeman elbowed a way through and ham was pulled forward and the first secretary trailed him you think i let him down penn you think i caved too bloody easy im having you met off the train at istanbul youll be given the ticket for yerevan armenia is the side to be on freefall keep your nose clean and your bottom wiped and you can be quite a useful asset to us there it would be very sad if you were silly could have dangerous consequences for you of course you let him down of course you caved too quickly youre a coward freefall but not an idiot that pleasant lady would have killed you if you hadnt been a coward and she would not have lost five minutes of sleep over it he was taken up the steep steps and the handcuff ring cut at the flesh of his wrist he looked down onto the first secretary and the man was peering at his watch as though already bored where is he somewhere behind that bloody line stumbling forward yes with his prisoner stumbling forward towards your promised rendezvous enjoy nagorny karabakh the door slammed behind him the handcuff jerked him towards the corridor of the carriage he stood his ground sod the buggers there was the whistles blast and the first shudder of the train lurching away ham shouted tell him it wasnt my fault tell him i wasnt to blame a faint reply through the filthy window of the door goodbye freefall if i see him ill tell him the train ground out of zagreb station three passengers bosnian refugees with all that they owned around them were cleared from their seats by the military policemen they would be with him until the slovenian border then the military policemen would free him leave him from ljubljana he would go on alone into austria and at vienna he would start the long journey via budapest and sofia and istanbul and yerevan to the war in nagorny karabakh wherever the fuck that was of course it was not his fault of course he was not to blame nothing in his life had ever been the fault of sidney ernest hamilton in the dropping light the train cleared the concrete outer suburbs of zagreb he was without blame he reached with his free hand into his pocket for the carton of marlboro cigarettes and for his playing cards she said it softly he says that you have seen his wife his wife is a fine woman he says that you have seen his boy and that i hurt his boy his boy is a good son everything that he knows is in the village of salika and everything that he loves is there he asks you begs you pleads with you he looked away from the wreckage of the man he remembered the power of the man and the glory of him in the hall of the villages school and his boots and fists he could not make the link she said it quietly he says that his wife should have a husband and his son should have a father he says that he will swear to you promise to you on his mothers life that he will never hold a gun again will never fight again he says that you are a man of honour a person of courage and that you will understand his weakness he begs you to let him go back to his wife he pleads with you to let him return to his son her voice dripped in his ear he stared again into the face of the broken man the eyes of milan stankovic ran wet and his mouth dribbled saliva against the folded material of the gag the man was pitiful he could not make the link between the man who was laden with conceit and the man who grovelled for his freedom the birds clattered in the branches above him and there was the panting of ulrikes breath spurts and the moaning in milan stankovics throat i told you her face and her eyes and her short bobcut hair were close to him you told me to be cruel and it is hard for you to be cruel it is hard because you do not see the evil in him i cannot make the link between what he was what he did and what he is now pathetic she was so strong he could see that she did not waver and that she had no doubt ulrike said it is what they are all like it was the same long ago and it is the same now it was the same long ago in my country when the men and women who had committed acts of evil were stripped of that power and put in the cells to await trial and left in the cells to await execution and when they were taken to the scaffold some had dignity and some were pitiful they could not be recognized for what they had been what they had done penn hissed dont worry dont bloody worry your pretty head because i will try to be cruel he went on penn led it came to him again the instinct he thought they might be a mile from the farm with the outbuildings where the troops were billeted twice he looked behind him long and hard and his eyes that were drifting with tiredness saw only the swaying trunks of the trees and the spreading shadows he thought that the worst would begin after the farmhouse where the troops were billeted and the worst would be all the way to the kupa river and he still could not escape the instinct that they were followed in their flight there was no minute taken of the meeting no stenographer present no tape recorder in use the room allocated for the meeting was on the third floor of the ministry of defence building with windows that looked down onto the central courtyard where the lights now burned bright the room was the office of a senior civil servant young and harvardtrained it will be done with discretion there will be special forces of the black hawk unit under the direct command of the intelligence officer of nd bn karlovac brigade they are to be given no help the german woman and the englishman in crossing the kupa river they are in charge of their own destiny under no circumstances none will they be permitted to bring milan stankovic across the river from what i hear if stankovic crosses then karlovac and sisak will be shelled zagreb will be attacked by missiles there can be no misunderstandings in this matter the first secretary leaned forward elbows on the table no misunderstandings because if stankovic comes across and into your jurisdiction then international opinion would demand your own dark corners be examined your own psychopaths be arraigned and that would never do parked in the courtyard below was the mercedes of un profors director of civilian affairs the meetings that we are brokering from what i hear from my sources on the other side will be immediately curtailed if a serbian is kidnapped and brought before a war crimes tribunal gestures are unimportant it cannot be allowed to happen gestures are trivial and cost lives a substantial window for peace would have been closed the first secretary swung back in his chair and we must not block the path to the appeasement of violence good god no peace in our time peace at any price why not and you should know what i now realize she was a very fine young woman miss dorothy mowat and such a shame that her murderer by our hand should walk free if youll excuse me its my job to be on that bloody river bank tonight he had made four telephone calls and all had been deflected four separate times he had dialled the number of the old police station the number of the nd bn karlovac brigade he had asked in turn of the duty officer and the commanding officer and the liaison officer and the adjutant if he could be hooked through to hamilton sidney ernest on a matter of importance four times asked to wait no problem four times asked the business of the call personal four times asked his name mumbled and unintelligible four times told that hamilton was not available to come to the telephone and asked again for the nature of the business and the repetition of his name marty jones was not easily unsettled less often now that he had been in croatia and bosnia for close to a year but now apprehension crawled in him dusk was coming to the parade ground beyond his converted freight container hell he was not going to take goddamn crap from them after the fourth deflection marty telephoned mary braddock told her he was coming soonest to collect her that she should have warm clothes he did not know the place of the rendezvous on the bank of the kupa river and ham should have rung him he felt a bad night was taking shape before he locked the door of the freight container behind him he looked a last time longingly and almost lovingly at the camp bed with the sleeping bag and the blanket primly folded at the brightness of the handcuffs at the length of the chain and the strength of the ring set in the floor the last of the sun rich gold came from the trees on the far side of the river and made sweet lines on the moving water and bathed the worn face of zoran pelnak and hurled his shadow back against the old timbers and the weathered brick of his home too much of his time he liked to joke with the soldiers who came from their tent camp for his well water was spent gazing at the great mother the force that was the kupa river he could spend more hours than the day gave him just watching the movement and the flow of the river each day each hour he could find something that was new in the movement and power of the river and the river was something to respect as worthy of respect as had been his own mother because the river was strength they did not comprehend the soldiers who came with the scrubbed old milk churns for their water from his well the force of the great mother zoran pelnak did his respect his awe of the river had been with him since he was a child since the evening that the sunken log had come without warning to beat against the bow of his small boat and trip it he had lost his footing fallen scrabbled slid into the dark cold of the water what he could remember was the helplessness that he had felt long ago as a child thrashing against that force and his father had pulled him clear the force would never be forgotten by zoran pelnak never trifled with he had not swum in the river that bordered his fields since that day when he had struggled in panic against the cold darkness of the current he knew the force of the great mother and there was always something new to see he paused at the door of his home and he scratched the debris from the animals fodder off the sleeves of his greatcoat there was a place in the first line of the trees opposite where the herons made their nest he could not look into the low sun at the nest but he could see the male bird erect in the shallow water by the reeds poised and waiting perhaps for a frog he considered the male heron to be the most beautiful of the rivers birds and when he was inside warm from the fire his meal taken then he would sit by the window and light his lamp and wait for the moon to climb and the gold would have gone from the great mother replaced by silver the pistol was aimed at her the man was crouched down beside the tree and he held the pistol aimed at her with his arms extended the woman stood beside the man and held the knife against milans beard against his throat she stopped and she took the weight of the dog and the farm twine tied to the dogs collar cut at the palm of her hand she stopped and she clutched the rusted bayonet the pistol was aimed at her across the width of the track that divided them she said it in the mans language deliberate let him go evica had come fast closed the last gap run noisily through the final metres and she had blundered from the cover of a corner of evergreen holly they would have heard her come the final metres but they would only have seen her when she broke the cover of the holly the dog strained to cross the track the aim of the pistol wavered let him come to me penn blinked at her across the track and she saw the raw tiredness of his eyes that tried to lock along the barrel length of the pistol it was as if the birds had gone fled the place because the silence crawled around her there were scars on his face he was the man who had come into her life the man who would destroy them the weight of the dog cut the farm twine across the palm of her hand if she let go of the twine if she released the dog then the dog going forward forty kilos weight would overwhelm the man penn with exhaustion in his eyes if she let go of the twine let him be free she looked away from the man penn away from the muzzle of the pistol the womans hand did not move the man penn whispered to the woman as if he placed and identified her the knife was steady against the hair of milans beard against his throat she saw the chilled certainty in the womans face as if tiredness had not washed it clear the knife was sharp and clean evica had seen before such chilled certainty seen it on the faces of the men as they had gone away across the bridge early on the last day of the battle for rosenovici and she had heard later that day and not looked from her window the rumble of the bulldozer in the field across the stream and heard the final shots and she had seen the chilling certainty on the faces of the men who had gone to the headquarters to take the headmaster from his cell she knew in her exhaustion that the dog could take the man penn even if he fired even if he hit she knew in the anguish of her mind that if she loosed the dog then the woman determined cold would gouge the blade of the sharp clean knife deep into the throat of milan would not hesitate because it was in the certainty of the womans face please you should let him come to me there was a wetness on the face of milan and she could see where the tears had run from his eyes and across the dirtied skin of his cheeks and gone to the matt of his beard and evica saw the fear in milans eyes as if he too knew the certainty of the woman i beg of you let me take him home the man gazed at her dulled she remembered a long time ago many years when she had gone with the beaters and the dogs to flush a boar a long hard run and chase and they had found the boar against a rock outcrop that it could not climb and it had turned to face the leashed dogs and the guns and she had seen the dulled eyes of the boar the man with the pistol did not have the cold certainty of the woman who held the knife so steady against milans beard and throat but it was not the man who spoke she had a clipped voice controlled what was done at rosenovici was a crime what has been done through former yugoslavia is a crime at stake is the rule of law what we do is small because we are only small people but it is necessary to find a point for a beginning you are the wife of milan stankovic you know what he did after the flag of surrender he took the wounded from rosenovici and he had a grave dug and he butchered those wounded you are his wife you know what he did you know the scale of his evil and with the wounded was a young woman the young woman the girl coming to the school at evicas invitation speaking english that evica might improve her language coming in torn jeans and sweaters that were holed at the elbow sitting with the fun laughter bubbling in her dead and buried the crime of the young woman was that she stayed when others ran she stayed with those who were wounded she gave them help and love your husband made the chain the chain is from the young woman to her mother to penn to your village to your husband he made the chain when he killed that young woman we do what small people mrs stankovic have always done through history we make a beginning and the law mrs stankovic belongs to small people and i am small and penn is small and the law belongs to us we cannot give him back to you and to your child because the rule of law without which we all fall demands that your husband be brought to account evica thought the woman was without mercy the fingers that clasped the knife against milans beard had no gold wedding ring she could see the tight waist of the woman behind her opened coat and there was not the slackness at her stomach of childbirth evica thought the woman was without love that night when he came back from rosenovici did he tell you what he had done did you hold him and tell him that it did not matter did you cuddle him and tell him he was without guilt or did you feel shame mrs stankovic did you feel that when he lay beside you he dirtied you you should go home you should go home to your son and tell the child that his father is a murderer and you should tell the child that the rule of law demands his fathers punishment she looked into her husbands face she remembered the night she remembered how she had lain awake how she had pushed him away from her how he had slept and she had not how he had cried out twice but not woken how he had once thrashed with his arms as if to beat away a nightmare and how in the first light of the morning she had stood at the window of their bedroom and looked across the fields across the stream and seen the smoke rising from the buildings and seen the greyblack scar in the corner of the field penn said he has nothing to fear from me it will not be as it was for dorrie mowat she let the bayonet fall from her hand i protect my prisoner with my life she turned away evica pulled the dog reluctant after her she twisted her back on her husband the dusk was falling on the woodland she could not answer the argument of the woman she could not fault the promise of the man she heard them moving first loud and then fainter evica never looked back never turned to see her husband taken as a prisoner towards the kupa river he turned the pages perhaps it had been stupid of him to ask for the books he leafed through photographs in expensive colour that showed children in national costume and wedding dances and the archaeology of the national heritage and roman amphitheatres and the beauty of polyptych work from churches henry carter thought it an obscenity that a nation of such ageold talent should have stooped to such fardown barbarity god and since when had he been qualified to criticize he leafed the pages searched patiently there was an aerial view across two pages of the old quarter of karlovac and he could make out clearly the former barracks built by napoleons marshal where the german woman had administered the transit centre the searching ended it was a dreadful photograph quite unsuitable for his purpose but it was what he must make do with the photograph showed in foreground the tables and chairs laid out on the patio of that citys principal hotel in bright summer with lolling and burned holidaymakers under gaudy sunshades beyond the patio glared by the sun was a pedestrian road and then there was the bank of the river it was what he had sought to find a view of the kupa river the river of the photograph was low against high banks wide but seemingly harmless it could give him an idea only a frail impression of how the kupa river would be at night swollen by the winter guarded by strong points and minefields and patrols approached by the german woman and the prisoner and penn his eyes misted over twenty they stood so still his heart hammered and his chest heaved and he tried to breathe through his nose because he thought that would be more quiet and she had the bulk of milan stankovic pressed against him and he hoped that she had the knife so hard against the mans throat that the man would not dare to shout the two shadow shapes were on the track that ran above the farm with the outhouses the shadow shapes moved with care they came within five stretched paces of where penn and ulrike schmidt and milan stankovic stood so still the moon was high enough full enough to throw fierce light onto the openness of the track they used penn could see that the shadow shape leading wore metal rank pips on his shoulder epaulettes and the shadow shape who followed was carrying tensed and readied an assault rifle it was where it could end and the worst had not yet begun milan stankovic might not believe him but would believe ulrike milan stankovic knew from her cold certainty that if he made a sound the smallest sound then the knife would be driven into the softness of his throat she could try to make him cruel enough and she would not succeed the shadow shapes moved away he reached back with his hand and his fingers found hers he did not twist his neck so that he could see her because he feared that the material of his camouflage tunic would rustle or grate his fingers found her body they held a pinch of flesh at the flatness of her waist and he squeezed the pinch with his fingers hard so that he would hurt her so that he would make her concentrate and the moment before he took the first step he pulled at the pinch as the signal that she should follow him they went onto the path onto the fallen leaves and the wetness of the mud they followed the shadow shapes that were ahead of them there was a low whistle the whistle was like the warning cry of a young owl from his childhood when he had gone at night to the twentyacre plantation there was an answering call from the mature owl that located its position they followed the shadow shapes that led them towards the kupa river he attempted all the time to keep the shadow shapes at the edge of his vision as they meandered along the track it was a bastard the whistle the answering night call and when he strained to hear in the close quiet of the forest there were softly spoken voices murmurs in the trees it was the identification of an ambush position penn understood an officer and his escort moving to inspect the ambush positions that he had designated penn understood that it was necessary for the officer to whistle ahead so that the troops lying up and cold and with their nerves stretched would call back would not blast at the shadow shapes approaching them it was their chance he saw it he led ulrike and milan stankovic wide of the track each time that the officer whistled the owls sound and each time the call was returned and each time that there was the brief whisper murmur of the voices it was the opportunity he must take it the shadow shapes of the officer and his escort took them through the network of the ambush positions four times they heard the whistle the response call and the short whisper of voices four times they were able to skirt the waiting troops all the time the sight of the shadow shapes drew him forward and the ache of the tension was in his legs and there was the hammer of his heart and he wondered how it was possible for ulrike to hold all that time the knife blade so steady against the beard and throat of milan stankovic with cold certainty there was vomit in his throat from fear he depended on milan stankovic on the desperation of the man would the knife go in if the man stumbled and a twig broke would the knife go in if the man spluttered once it would be in milan stankovics mind that if he stepped heavily grunted once then they were gone he was trying to evaluate how desperate the man was and if the man made a noise and ulrike stabbed him in cold cruelty then he and ulrike were gone they were in the hands of their prisoner dependent on the desperation of their prisoner the vomit was in penns throat and sliding forward and he could not spit and he did not dare to swallow they were so close to the shadow shapes and to the voices and once a metal water bottle rattled against a rifle barrel and he trembled and did not know how the faster panting of his breath had not been heard the shadow shapes turned so still again so frozen against a trees trunk so quiet and the shadow shapes had gone away and past them retreating until he could no longer see the blurred halfimages weakness dribbled in him they went off the path he glanced at his watch he estimated it had taken one hour and fortyseven minutes to cover one mile and he should too bloody right have listened better to ham and he could not remember the details that ham had given him of ambush positions he should have listened better because there would be ambush positions to a depth of a mile and then there would be tripwires and then there would be the patrols moving on the bank of the river and then there would be the bloody river her hand came to him she took his shoulder and she squeezed it hard as he had squeezed her she squeezed the bone of his shoulder as if to tell him that she thought he had done well he knelt penn brushed the floor of the forest with his hand until he had found a small branch he held the branch ahead of him making a blind mans progress going towards the river its hamilton i want sidney hamilton i expect you call him ham im his friend the warning was there quick marty jones was at the sandbagged entrance to the old police station and the sentry had come out of the protected san gar to block him and the corporal was reaching for the field telephone in the guardhouse the sentry was aggressive and the corporal was evasive marty jones hesitated he knew it had gone foul and the aggression and evasion were the evidence he hesitated and he did not know what his response should be and then in front of him was the blast of the horn and the flashing of headlights two jeeps and a car lined up and trying to get the hell out of the inner courtyard of the old police station and the barrier was down and blocking their leaving the corporal abandoned discipline and the field telephone and came out to lift the barrier two open jeeps came by him and he saw the flashes on the tunic arms of the guys and he knew they were special forces and there was a big rover tailing them out under the raised barrier the barrier came down and the corporal was reaching again for the field telephone and marty was running they could just as well have shouted a warning at him marty jones ran to where he had parked the car flung himself inside twisted the ignition and hit the gears not until he had caught them could see the lights of the rover and the two jeeps going down the big avenue out of karlovac towards the river where there were the tanks teeth of concrete beside the wide road and the artillerydamaged apartment blocks from the war gone by and the bazooka defence bunkers did he kill the lights and let them lead him he hissed to mary braddock through his teeth i dont know what it is i just know its gone bad he was trying to concentrate but his mind was leaping two more hours gone and he reckoned a mile covered for each hour and no longer the surety of the moon to guide him with the flow of silver light he had found one tripwire the taut wire checking the motion of the stick and crouching until his fingers brushed the wire and ulrike and himself lifting the weight of milan stankovic over the wire and the knife blade never leaving his beard and his throat the last stretch before the river and facing the last patrols and the concentration came harder and his mind leapt faster the wind rising and cloud scudding across the moons face too much damn well surging in his mind and that was danger danger was distraction from the gentle loose hold on the stick that wavered in front of his footfall penn took them off the path that ran down alongside the planted mines and on towards the river bank it was a place where brambles were thick near to the path and the moonlight was at that moment gone from above the tree canopy a mile from the river bank his mind leaping concentration failing danger the flashing of the torch shaded and the ripple sounds of ham edging the inflatable into the current of the kupa river the drive to zagreb the prisoner given over a taxi for the airport first flight out she was so strong and there was no future for them he would not know what to say to her gazing into her eyes staring into the depth of them wondering if she would cry if she would laugh if she would kick him on the shin no future for them her going back to the transit centre him going back to alpha security ltd and tramping up the stairs from the street door beside the launderette and seeing basil and jim and henry and deirdre giving him the post that had accumulated two weeks of it no future for them heading back to jane and asking shyly how it had been and a cold kiss on his cheek that was formality and toms wet mouth on his face that was a strangers and nothing but there was no future for them and the morning after the morning after he was home he would go down to the station at raynes park where there was a florist and he would buy the flowers big bunch and bright blooms and walk them home and fill the little living room of b the cedars with life and he would kiss his jane and tell her that he was going out of her life and the morning after the day after tomorrow he would catch the train into london and take the underground to goodge street and walk down gower street and sit in the front reception as if it were his right and not give a shit what the guards thought and wait for arnold bloody browne to take the lift down the day after tomorrow he would make jane laugh and leave her the day after tomorrow he would tell his story to arnold bloody browne and have the pleasure of walking out on him he would go to search for space for himself go where the de wed fields were quiet in the morning and where the trees threw shadows in the evening it was the way that dorrie had shown him and he would go to private places in the months ahead years to come and he would think of dorrie and be with dorrie it was his dream the bramble stems clawed at him held him he did not hate the man he almost felt a pity for the man and the man had a wife who had loved him and a child who fought for him the man was craven barearsed and bareballed because they stripped from him even the love of his wife and the pride of his child for what for principle for the god almighty feel good factor of those who wanted to see something done for mary bloody braddocks peace of mind he wouldnt get the chance ever to talk with the man like he would have talked to the man in a cafe or a bar or on the beach if they jane and him had ever come for a holiday in what they called former yugoslavia and way back and before the madness for what for the killing of dorrie mowat what else was she laughing was she bloody mocking dorrie mowat up high up on the bloody mountain looking down and laughing mocking had caught him caught in the brambles at the side of the path his boot kicked at the clinging bloody mess caught him caught mary caught marty jones caught and hurt them all like shed hurt him like shed hurt milan stankovic would have liked to have talked with the man caught in the brambles hold the wire would have been set across the path that they avoided his boot tripped the wire the wire would have been fastened to a cut peg that had been buried in the brambles mess his boot was held for a moment by the wire as he lurched for balance the wire might have been visible if the bloody moon had not been hidden behind the bloody cloud his boot snagged the wire one movement throwing himself back one movement flattening ulrike and the man the thunder of the explosion numbed his hearing cut the whistle spray of the grenades shrapnel he was pulling her up then grasping for milan stankovic and he felt the wet run of blood because the knife blade had been against the mans beard and throat and the sharpness of the knifes blade had slashed the hair of the beard and the skin of the throat pulled her up grasped and lifted him going for the path and running clutching back behind him for the jacket of milan stankovic and dragging him and ulrike was pushing him it was the start of the stampede run for the river bank high up above the tree canopy and below the cloud that masked the moon away to the east the first flare burst he had taken the telephone call broken his meeting charged from his office and gone like a mad puppy down the stairs to the operations room the director stood in front of the wall map and the tip of the pointer danced against the clear sheeting that covered sector north the canadian colonel said its what were getting from the monitoring hes in trouble theyre in close pursuit hell be running for his life but theres the river ahead of him no rendezvous right sir in the cause of the greater good the director nodded dumb he stared up at the map the jordanian major asked knowing the answer no rendezvous no boat waiting for him in the interest of the greater number the director shuddered numb for a few brief seconds the tip of the wand held the clearcut line of the kupa river the argentine captain lit his cigarette no rendezvous no boat waiting with or without his prisoner there is not a possibility of him coming out it is what you wanted sir yes penn was running trying to see the path trying to take the man and ulrike with him bad pain his hand was behind him gripped deep into the material of the mans coat the pain was the mans teeth buried into his hand penn loosed him he was crushed by the pain he staggered free of the burden of the man there was another flare falling behind them gone from its summit arc and the flare threw brilliant white light down through the trees canopy and he could hear shouting and whistles blowing he gripped his bitten hand and he was bent and he was rocking and he squeezed at the hand as if that way he could shed the pain the pain was his own world and private and the pain brought smarting tears welling from his eyes penn turned light fell from the flare it gleamed on the knifes blade she had lost the knife penn stood and suffered his private pain and watched the knife was beyond her reach as if it had fallen clear when the man had moved she was on the floor of the wood and she was writhing in the leaves and she clung to one leg of the man and the boot of milan stankovic kicked with savagery at her body the flare was guttering failing he saw her body bounce away from the impact of the kick and her hands seemed to have the last clinging hold of his legs if he had had his hands if his hands had been free if the flare had not been fired if there had not been the light penn thought the man realized he was at the edge of freedom one more kick one more blow from the boot at her head and she would loose him it was the last moment before the flare fell he could hear the shouts and the whistles closing in the last moment of the light of the flare the last moment before the final kick that would free the man penn tried to learn to be cruel with the heel of his hand he hit at the back of milan stankovics neck penn hit with his bitten hand and the man fell and they writhed in the coming darkness he punched at milan stankovic as an animal at war penn beat at milan stankovic and he seemed not to hear her voice in the nights blackness and she was calling to him that he had hit enough she had the knife they took the prisoner sullen quiet on towards the bank of the kupa river the knifes blade was back at his throat penn led the charge and his bitten hand dragged the man forward he had needed to be cruel to have hit so hard with the heel of his hand he did not hate the man there were flares all the time bursting high behind them he had respect for the man he knew of the deep and raw courage that was required to make a break he felt that the man was in his care he did not think about mary braddock nor about katica dubelj and he did not think about dorrie mowat the man was in his care and he owed milan stankovic his protection the man would not fight again it was finished for milan stankovic he had fought and failed but respect was won when the flares died when they fell back doused then there was the full moons light and the fastgoing clouds had moved on they ran stumbled charged pulled and pushed the weight of milan stankovic down the path that ran beside the single length of barbed wire that marked the minefield he could not judge how far behind the chasing pack were but all caution was gone ahead through the trees he saw the dark mass of the kupa river there were silver trellis lines on the darkness where the force of the current swirled they burst the last cover of the trees they came onto the narrow path that ran along the upper bank of the great river she was tugging at his coat pecking at him for his attention the cover of the trees was behind him the reeds nestled along the bank ahead of him the shouting and the whistle blasts were behind him the river and the silver network of lines were ahead of him there was a killing flatness in her voice we came too early we are an hour ahead of the rendezvous you said we should lie up but we cannot we came too early for ham for the rendezvous for the boat did you not know that she was at his back the barrier was ahead of him another flare soared high behind him and he saw the far width of the river ahead of him milan stankovic rocked with muffled laughter and he would not have understood what she said only the tone of despair penn turned eyes going past the babbled laughter of the man who croaked under the gag and he was trying to speak as he laughed as if now the knife at his beard and his throat no longer terrorized him she destroyed him because he had not thought it through when he had led the stampede flight towards the kupa river he rifled at her pockets felt first the weight of the pistol then the bulk of the torch he stood on the path above the deep flow of the river and he shaded with the palm of his hand the beam of the torch he made the signal he flicked the button of the torch on and off on and off waited for the answering light on and off on and off waited to see the boat dragged down the faraway bank on and off on and off the voice carried by the loudhailer echoed sharply across the river width penn you have no boat there is not going to be a boat you should abandon your prisoner penn you and the woman schmidt should take your chance in the water penn hamilton is not here there is no boat you should immediately release your prisoner it was a long and straight track and it went by a wellconstructed building that was roofless and abandoned the track went all the way to the river marty saw the flares that lit the skyline and the flares silhouetted the group at the end of the track he was leading mary braddock towards the group and the jeeps and the rover car below the flares beyond the group separated by the width of darkness and silver marty saw the winking on and off of the light if you try to bring your prisoner across you will be identified by flashlight we have authority to shoot if you attempt to cross with your prisoner release him immediately he had snapped off the torch the amplified voice bayed across the river you have to take your chance in the river just you and the german woman for fucks sake penn move yourself penn are you coming we are forbidden to give covering fire just you and the german woman not the prisoner get into the water penn you dont have time do it he could let the man go he could walk away from the man he could turn the man loose to turn the man loose to permit the man to walk away might save her life penns life she could hear the voices now behind her carried towards the bank by the amplification of the megaphone he had a hold of milan stankovic and he seemed to look into her face and she did not challenge him and she felt no fear she wriggled clear of the straps of the backpack let it fall he pulled milan stankovic down the bank and she slithered after them they splashed into the cold of the water and she clung to the man and tried to hold the knife blade steady against his beard and his throat he never turned to her never asked it of her just assumed it that she would follow him the mud of the rivers edge was over her boots the slime was round her feet the water was at her waist the cold groping at her groin there were three four metres of reeds at the side of the river in mud against the bank she had her free hand not the hand with the knife blade against milan stankovics throat tight on the mouth of the man they made strong waded steps through the reeds each step sinking in the mud bed they were going away from the flares away from the megaphone that was silenced away from the closing crash of the pursuit he was to her a simple and decent and ordinary and obstinate man and she felt a love of him they went down river they went with the flow goading them on and once they foundered and the chill of the water was at her shoulders and the water was in milan stankovics nostrils and the water was over penns head she wanted so much to tell her father of penn tell her father how she had known always that he was a man penn of principle tell her father how they had gone down the river bank hidden by the first summer growth of the reeds low against the waters surface the power of the current restrained by the reeds she could see across the full width of the river and it did not seem possible to her that she could ever get to tell her father of the man she loved on and on more mud more slips putting further behind them the flares and the shouting and the chasing pack she wanted so badly to tell her father if he freed the man if he left the man then the chance to cross was theirs but he would not and she did not ask it a long distance gone there was a cacophony of flapping movement in the trees above a heron flew across the face of the moon there was a pallet held by the reeds across the river a small light burned the light was in a window the pallet was one that would have had stacked on it fertilizer bags or seed sacks the pallet of coarse wooden strips must have been discarded in a field upstream and taken by the winters flood water it was for the principle and he did not speak to her made no effort to strengthen her but she saw that he took in his fingers the mans beard the hair on his cheek and he gave the hair a small pull as if to reassure the man as if to give him his protection he dragged the pallet out from the reeds and held it against the flow of the current and he levered the torso of the man up onto the surface of the pallet he kicked off from the mud bed in which the reeds grew she swam beside him they pushed the pallet clear from the bank the current caught them milan stankovic flailed with his legs and penn was one side of the pallet and she was the other and they tried to steer a course against the power a small light burned in the window that was downstream across the river they were crouched behind the wheels and body work of the jeeps because the intelligence officer had said that from the serb side they might shoot and he had the grim dry smile on his face washed in the moonlight of a man who enjoys a fuckedup failure beside him was the first secretary behind him were marty jones and mary braddock ahead of him and lying prone were the special forces troops marty jones trembled mary braddock gazed ahead without voice without feeling they watched the torch beams cavort on the far bank up into the trees onto the path down among the reeds and out across the darkness and silver lines of the river far down the river bank way too far the first secretary saw a single light steady like a beacon he fought to drive the pallet forward he no longer felt the cold of the water he seemed to hear domes mocking and domes laughter the man no longer kicked with his legs as if the weight of his riverlogged boots was too great penn thought that milan stankovic had surrendered to the power of the river he no longer had the support of ulrike knew that she was beaten by the pressure of the current they were lower in the water than they had first been and the level of the water was above his shoulders and washed over the wood strips of the pallet and the water lapped on the hips of milan stankovic they were not halfway across he could see the small constant light ahead beneath them was the great dark depth of the river pulling at them tugging at them to take them down if they were no longer able to drive the pallet forward if they drifted then the river would take them down they went slower and the current was greater and the small light ahead did not seem closer he kicked harder kicked from the last of his strength and when he tried to drag the night air into his lungs then he was sucking in the foulness of the river her body was beside him but she could only paddle her feet could not kick penn spluttered tell them that we tried tell them someone had to try he had a hold of her hand it was not difficult for penn to break her grip on the pallet he seemed to show her the small light that did not waver he did it quickly he broke her grip on the pallet and he pushed her away from him from the sinking pallet from the motionless weight of milan stankovic he saw that she was clear in the water he saw the whiteness of her face and the brightness of her eyes and the slicked hair of her head the man was sliding back from the pallet she had tried to teach him to be cruel and she had failed he held the man as best he could and he kicked the power of the current hacked at his strength penn did not see her again the water was rising around him penn did not see the light again it was what i saw from my window because it was a full moon i saw them very easily i saw them from the time that they made the heron fly when they came out of the reed bed with their raft thing they made good speed at first and they would have felt that it was possible but if you think that you find weakness in the great mother that is the kupa river then you fool yourself the river plays the game of tricking you there is no weakness the river brings you on away from the safety of the bank then tricks you he sat in his chair of stained oak beside the window and the oil lamp threw a feeble light across the room he spoke gently but with respect as if he had a fear of giving offence to the great mother i could see them all of the time good speed at first but that is the way of the great mother because from the south bank from their bank the river bed is more shallow and the current is less strong when you come further into the flow of the river then you will find the true strength of the great mother of course it is possible to cross if you have a good boat if you have oars and you have been godgiven good muscles of course it is easy if you have the engine for the boat but the river watches for your weakness and if you are weak then the river will punish you the woman sat bowed on the bare boards she was in front of the stove with the pistol close to her feet she wore a faded old dressing gown tight around her borrowed from the farmers wife who had bought it in the market at karlovac thirtyone years before and draped over the dressing gown was the farmers greatcoat she did not speak her clothes sodden from the river were across a chair beside her the strength of the great mother where she finds your weakness is when you come to the centre where the current is most powerful at the centre coming from the far side is where the drag pulls at you when they were coming the year before the last year the partizan bastards there were deer that ran ahead of their gunfire i saw a deer come into the water running in fear a big stag a good head on it and it could swim until it reached the centre of the river i can only say what i saw it was at the centre that he pushed the woman away i heard his voice but i do not know what he said because it was foreign and because the river makes its own sound the voice of the great mother is never silenced i think that he pushed her away so that she could swim free she was so lucky perhaps the attention of the great mother was on him and his friend perhaps the great mother ignored the woman swimming free i could see it from my window the man and his friend taken down the river they listened they were crowded into the room the mud fell onto the board floor from the boots of the intelligence officer from the shoes of the first secretary and marty jones and mary braddock she did not understand a word that was said by the old farmer but there was a grim sadness on his face and she felt a release they were all touched by dorrie her daughter she felt her freedom they were taken down the river the great mother held them they could not go from the hold of the current at the centre of the river the raft thing was lower in the water he tried to kick a last time but the strength was gone from him was his friend wounded i think his friend was wounded because his friend had no use of his arms they lost the raft thing i saw him hold his friend up in the water as if he supported him he would not be able to save his friend i could see that if he had loosed his friend given his friend to the great mother then perhaps perhaps i do not know all the time he tried to help his friend they went under i saw them again and they were held in the current and i knew it would not be long just their heads for one moment i saw just their heads and still he tried to protect him his friend i did not see them another time who was his friend that he would not leave they were so small they were against such power i did not see them another time they took the woman with them and the old farmer was told that his wifes dressing gown and his greatcoat would be returned in the morning later the intelligence officer would use the field telephone to communicate a satisfactory situation to his enemy later the first secretary would send a threeline encoded message to the dishes on the roof of vauxhall cross later marty jones would return to his converted freight container to dismantle a camp bed and unfasten a chain linked to a pair of handcuffs and to arrange for ballistic tests to be made on a makharov pistol later mary braddock would take her small suitcase to the airport later the shells would be taken from the artillery pieces that faced karlovac and sisak and technicians would stand down the groundtoground missiles that could reach the southern suburbs of zagreb later the troops of the ustase bastards and the partizan bastards would search the reed beds on their side of the kupa river and find nothing they went out into the bright moonlight and walked away from domes place turned their backs on domes war epilogue he had tried three times to dial the number and each time the telephone had given him an unobtainable tone henry carter pushed himself up he stretched his hands were behind his neck and he arched his back and let out a short squeaked cry he went to the desk nearest his own no she was not eating chocolate that morning yes she wore a prim new blouse she looked up at him away from her screen nervously he smiled he apologized he said it had been disgraceful of him to have shocked her with that quite revolting photograph the morning before and he was reaching into his wallet he offered her a fivepound note and said it was for the drycleaning of her blouse and if there was anything left over then she should purchase some little trifle god what sort of little trifles did young women buy with the change from the drycleaning of a chocolatestained blouse and he needed her help the senior dragon was not in sight please he needed to dial an outoflondon number and couldnt seem to manage it of course the telephones could only be used for inlondon calls but there had to be a way she knew the way she put the fivepound banknote into her purse and blushed and told him what digits he should dial to obtain it and he made a little joke about a nephew in australia she was gazing up at him and his fingers rubbed embarrassed across his cheek stubble and he should have taken the time to find that hidden razor and should have brushed his teeth and should have changed his socks in her face he thought he saw simple kindness has it been awful mr carter it must have been a pretty awful file to have kept you here all yesterday all through the night is it something really sad sorry shouldnt have asked that should i im not needtoknow he said quietly do you know my dear there was only one thing that i ever did well when i worked here i was good at standing in safety on the right side of some of lifes most hideous barricades waiting for some poor devil to come back from the wrong side i wish so much that i had been there waiting not able to intervene but sharing so kind of you to help me with the telephone he sat on his desk he dialled again he heard the clip of her voice he kept his silence who was there what did they have to say he heard the annoyance of her voice would they whoever they were not waste her time who was it he put down the telephone cut from his ear the growing anger of mary braddock mother of miss dorothy mowat so tired now it had all been such a long time ago he had cut from his ear the authority annoyance confidence and anger of her voice a little while ago only a few minutes it had seemed important to speak to her to tell her that an old desk warrior had bludgeoned a file into shape made it ready for burial on a disk he gathered up the papers of the file the photographs and the maps and his own crude plan of the two villages separated by the stream he walked across the openplan space of library to the day supervisors position finished then mr carter she was leafing through the material that would be transferred to the disk she turned the typewritten pages and the photographs of the grave site and the cadaver and of bill penn and the maps and his sketch plan and there was that curl at her lip to indicate that in her opinion the material had not warranted the smelling socks and the stubble on his cheeks and the demands made of her staff she came to the last page in the order he had assembled the material he had written a heading in his own copperplate writing she read they may be able to run but they cant hide l eagleburger sofs usa geneva brussels airborne brief eagleburger announces programme to prosecute war criminals in former yugoslavia list below of those prosecuted by unsponsored tribunal but the sheet was blank she flushed she wondered if he ridiculed her he intervened in her confusion best dress smile the one that he kept for christmas and family assuming that somebody some day for some reason should actually read the file i thought they might be interested to know what was achieved in the two years after mr eagleburgers brave words if only our masters would abstain from saying things they dont mean then life would be so much more bearable dont you agree thank you for the kindness of your staff whistling for the stars ami good day he cleared his desk packed away his empty thermos in his briefcase and shrugged into his coat quite chill that morning it was behind him all of it it was as if it had never happened as if by conspiracy brave words became hollow and empty quite a brisk wind off the old thames catching him as he strode towards the station all of it was behind a sentimental old desk warrior his step was lively ahead of him was the short train journey the quick change of clothes and socks and the brushing of his teeth a good shave with a new blade then the drive to midwales and the railway line at tregaron and the sight of the soaring freedom of the kites henry carter thought that after where he had been he needed to find a place of freedom
