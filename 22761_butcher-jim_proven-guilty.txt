jim butcher proven guilty dresden files chapter one blood leaves no stain on a wardens grey cloak i didnt know that until the day i watched morgan second in command of the white councils wardens lift his sword over the kneeling form of a young man guilty of the practice of black magic the boy sixteen years old at the most screamed and ranted in korean underneath his black hood his mouth spilling hatred and rage convinced by his youth and power of his own immortality he never knew it when the blade came down which i guess was a small mercy microscopic really his blood flew in a scarlet arc i wasnt ten feet away i felt hot droplets strike one cheek and more blood covered the left side of the cloak in blotches of angry red the head fell to the ground and i saw the cloth over it moving as if the boys mouth were still screaming imprecations the body fell onto its side one calf muscle twitched spasmodically and then stopped after maybe five seconds the head did too morgan stood over the still form for a moment the bright silver sword of the white council of wizards justice in his hands besides him and me there were a dozen wardens present and two members of the senior councilthe merlin and my onetime mentor ebenezar mccoy the covered head stopped its feeble movements morgan glanced up at the merlin and nodded once the merlin returned the nod may he find peace peace the wardens all replied together except me i turned my back on them and made it two steps away before i threw up on the warehouse floor i stood there shaking for a moment until i was sure i was finished then straightened slowly i felt a presence draw near me and looked up to see ebenezar standing there he was an old man bald but for wisps of white hair short stocky his face half covered in a ferociouslooking grey beard his nose and cheeks and bald scalp were all ruddy except for a recent purplish scar on his pate though he was centuries old he carried himself with vibrant energy and his eyes were alert and pensive behind goldrimmed spectacles he wore the formal black robes of a meeting of the council along with the deep purple stole of a member of the senior council harry he said quietly you all right after that i snarled loudly enough to make sure everyone there heard me no one in this damned building should be all right i felt a sudden tension in the air behind me no they shouldnt ebenezar said i saw him look back at the other wizards there his jaw setting stubbornly the merlin came over to us also in his formal robes and stole he looked like a wizard should looktall long white hair long white beard piercing blue eyes his face seamed with age and wisdom well with age anyway warden dresden he said he had the sonorous voice of a trained speaker and spoke english with a highclass british accent if you had some evidence that you felt would prove the boys innocence you should have presented it during the trial i didnt have anything like that and you know it i replied he was proven guilty the merlin said i soulgazed him myself i examined more than two dozen mortals whose minds he had altered three of them might eventually recover their sanity he forced four others to commit suicide and had hidden nine corpses from the local authorities as well and every one of them was a blood relation the merlin stepped toward me and the air in the room suddenly felt hot his eyes flashed with azure anger and his voice rumbled with deep unyielding power the powers he had used had already broken his mind we did what was necessary i turned and faced the merlin i didnt push out my jaw and try to stare him down i didnt put anything belligerent or challenging into my posture i didnt show any anger on my face or slur any disrespect into my tone when i spoke the past several months had taught me that the merlin hadnt gotten his job through an ad on a matchbook he was quite simply the strongest wizard on the planet and he had talent skill and experience to go along with that strength if i ever came to magical blows with him there wouldnt be enough left of me to fill a lunch sack i did not want a fight but i didnt back down either he was a kid i said we all have been he made a mistake weve all done that too the merlin regarded me with an expression somewhere between irritation and contempt you know what the use of black magic can do to a person he said marvelously subtle shading and emphasis over his words added in a perfectly clear unspoken thought you know it because youve done it sooner or later youll slip up and then it will be your turn one use leads to another and another thats what i keep hearing merlin i answered just say no to black magic but that boy had no one to tell him the rules to teach him if someone had known about his gift and done something in time he lifted a hand and the simple gesture had such absolute authority to it that i stopped to let him speak the point you are missing warden dresden he said is that the boy who made that foolish mistake died long before we discovered the damage hed done what was left of him was nothing more nor less than a monster who would have spent his life inflicting horror and death on anyone near him i know that i said and i couldnt keep the anger and frustration out of my voice and i know what had to be done i know it was the only measure that could stop him i thought i was going to throw up again and i closed my eyes and leaned on the solid oak length of my carved staff i got my stomach under control and opened my eyes to face the merlin but it doesnt change the fact that weve just murdered a boy who probably never knew enough to understand what was happening to him accusing someone else of murder is hardly a stone you are in a position to cast warden dresden the merlin arched a silver brow at me did you not discharge a firearm into the back of the head of a woman you merely believed to be the corpsetaker from a distance of a few feet away fatally wounding her i swallowed i sure as hell had last year it had been one of the bigger coin tosses of my life had i incorrectly judged that a bodytransferring wizard known as the corpsetaker had jumped into the original body of warden luccio i would have murdered an innocent woman and a lawenforcing member of the white council i hadnt been wrongbut id never never just killed anyone before ive killed things in the heat of battle yes ive killed people by less direct means but corpsetakers death had been intimate and coldly calculated and not at all indirect just me the gun and the limp corpse i could still vividly remember the decision to shoot the feel of the cold metal in my hands the stiff pull of my revolvers trigger the thunder of the guns report and the way the body had settled into a limp bundle of limbs on the ground the motion somehow too simple for the horrible significance of the event id killed deliberately rationally ended anothers life and it still haunted my dreams at night id had little choice given the smallest amount of time the corpsetaker could have called up lethal magic and the best i could have hoped for was a death curse that killed me as i struck down the necromancer it had been a bad day or two and i was pretty strung out even if i hadnt been i had a feeling that corpsetaker could have taken me in a fair fight so i hadnt given corpsetaker anything like a fair fight i shot the necromancer in the back of the head because the corpsetaker had to be stopped and id had no other option i had executed her on suspicion no trial no soulgaze no judgment from a dispassionate arbiter hell i hadnt even taken the chance to get in a good insult bang thump one live wizard one dead bad guy id done it to prevent future harm to myself and others it hadnt been the best solutionbut it had been the only solution i hadnt hesitated for a heartbeat id done it no questions and gone on to face the further perils of that night just like a warden is supposed to do sorta took the wind out of my holierthanthou sails bottomless blue eyes watched my face and he nodded slowly you executed her the merlin said quietly because it was necessary that was different i said indeed your action required far deeper commitment it was dark cold and you were alone the suspect was a great deal stronger than you had you struck and missed you would have died yet you did what had to be done necessary isnt the same as right i said perhaps not he said but the laws of magic are all that prevent wizards from abusing their power over mortals there is no room for compromise you are a warden now dresden you must focus on your duty to both mortals and the council which sometimes means killing children this time i didnt hide the contempt but there wasnt much life to it which means always enforcing the laws the merlin said and his eyes bored into mine flickering with sparks of rigid anger it is your duty now more than ever i broke the stare first looking away before anything bad could happen ebenezar stood a couple of steps from me studying my expression granted that youve seen much for a man your age the merlin said and there was a slight softening in his tone but you havent seen how horrible such things can become not nearly the laws exist for a reason they must stand as written i turned my head and stared at the small pool of scarlet on the warehouse floor beside the kids corpse i hadnt been told his name before theyd ended his life right i said tiredly and wiped a clean corner of the grey cloak over my bloodsprinkled face i can see what theyre written in chapter two i turned my back on them and walked out of the warehouse into chicagos best impression of miami july in the midwest is rarely less than sultry but this year had been especially intense when it came to summer heat and it had rained frequently the warehouse was a part of the wharves down at the lakeside and even the chill waters of lake michigan were warmer than usual they filled the air with more than the average waterscent of mud and mildew and eau de dead fishy i passed the two greycloaked wardens standing watch outside and exchanged nods with them both of them were younger than me some of the most recent additions to the white councils militaryslashpolice organization as i passed them i felt the tingling presence of a veil a spell they were maintaining to conceal the warehouse from any prying eyes it wasnt much of a veil by warden standards but it was probably better than i could do and there werent a whole hell of a lot of wardens to choose from since the red courts successful offensive the previous autumn beggars cant be choosers i tugged off my robe and my cloak i was wearing sneakers khaki shorts and a red tank top underneath it didnt make me any cooler to remove the heavy clothesjust marginally less miserable i walked hurriedly back to my car a battered old volkswagen beetle its windows rolled down to keep the sun from turning the interior into an oven its a jumble of different colors as my mechanic has replaced damaged portions of the body with parts from junked bugs but it started off as a shade of powder blue and that had earned it the sobriquet of the blue beetle i heard quick solid footsteps behind me harry ebenezar called i threw the robe and cloak into the beetles backseat without a word the cars interior had been stripped to its metal bones a couple of years back and i had made hurried repairs with cheap lumber and a lot of duct tape since then id had a friend redo the inside of the car it wasnt standard and it still didnt look pretty but the comfortable bucket seats were a lot nicer than the wooden crates id been using and i had decent seat belts again harry ebenezar said again damnation boy stop i though about getting into the car and leaving but instead stopped until the old wizard approached and shucked off his own formal robes and stole he wore a white tshirt beneath denim levis overalls and heavy leather hiking boots theres something i need to speak to you about i paused and took a second to get some of my emotions under control those and my stomach i didnt want the embarrassment of a repeat performance what is it he stopped a few feet behind me the war isnt going well by which he meant the war of the white council against the red court of vampires the war had been a whole lot of pussyfooting and fights in back alleys for several years but last year the vampires had upped the ante their assault had been timed to coincide with vicious activity from a traitor within the council and with the attack of a number of necromancers outlaw wizards who raised the dead into angry specters and zombiesamong a number of other less savory things the vampires had hit the council hard before the battle was over theyd killed nearly two hundred wizards most of them wardens thats why the wardens had given me a grey cloak they needed the help before theyd finished the vampires killed nearly fortyfive thousand men women and children who happened to be nearby thats why id taken the cloak that wasnt the sort of thing i could ignore ive read the reports i said they say that the venatori umbrorum and the fellowship of st giles have really pitched in its more than that if they hadnt started up an offensive to slow the vamps down the red court would have destroyed the council months ago i blinked theyre doing that much the venatori umbrorum and the fellowship of st giles were the white councils primary allies in the war with the red court the venatori were an ancient secret brotherhood joined together to fight supernatural darkness wherever they could sort of like the masons only with more flamethrowers by and large they were academic sorts and though several of the venatori had various forms of military experience their true strength lay in utilizing human legal systems and analyzing information brought together from widely dispersed sources the fellowship though was a somewhat different story not as many of them as there were of the venatori but not many of them were merely human most of them so i took it were those who had been half turned by the vampires theyd been infested with the dark powers that made the red court such a threat but until they willingly drank anothers lifeblood they never quite stopped being human it could make them stronger and faster and better able to withstand injury than regular folks and it granted them a drastically increased life span assuming they didnt fall prey to their constant base desire for blood or werent slain in operations against their enemies in the red court a woman id once cared for very much had been taken by a red court vampire in point of fact id kicked off the war when i went and took her back by the most violent means at my disposal i brought her back but i didnt save her shed been touched by that darkness and now her life was a battlepartly against the vampires who had done it to her and partly against the bloodthirst theyd imposed upon her now she was a part of the fellowship whose members included those like her and id heard many other people and partpeople with no home anywhere else st giles patron of lepers and outcasts his fellowship while not a milblown powerhouse like the council or one of the vampire courts was nonetheless proving to be a surprisingly formidable ally our allies cant challenge the vampires in facetoface confrontations ebenezar said nodding but theyre wreaking havoc on the red courts supply chains intelligence and support attacking from the mortal end of things red court infiltrators within human society are unmasked humans controlled by the red court have been arrested framed or killedor else abducted to be forcibly freed of their addiction the fellowship and the venatori continue to do all in their power to provide information to the council which has enabled us to make a number of successful raids against the vampires the venatori and the fellowship havent appreciably weakened the vampires but the red court has been slowed down perhaps enough to give us a fighting chance to recover hows the boot camp coming i asked luccio is confident of her eventual success in replacing our losses ebenezar replied dont see what else i can do to help i said unless youre wanting someone to go start fathering new wizards he stepped closer to me and glanced around his expression was casual but he was checking to see if anyone was close enough to overhear theres something you dont know the merlin decided it was not for general knowledge i turned to face him and tilted my head you remember the red courts attack last year he said that they called up outsiders and assaulted us within the realm of faerie itself bad move so ive heard the faeries are going to take it out of their hides so we all thought the old man said in fact summer declared war upon the red court and began preliminary assaults on them but winter hasnt respondedand summer hasnt done much more than secure its borders queen mab didnt declare war no i frowned never thought shed pass up the chance shes all about carnage and bloodshed it surprised us as well he said so i want to ask a favor of you i eyed him without speaking find out why he said you have contacts within the courts find out whats happening find out why the sidhe havent gone to war what i asked the senior council doesnt know dont you have an embassy and highlevel connections and official channels maybe a bright red telephone ebenezar smiled without much mirth the general turbulence of the war has stretched everyones intelligencegathering abilities he replied even those in the spiritual realms theres another level entirely to the war in the conflict between spiritual spies and emissaries of everyone involved and our embassy to the sidhe has been he rolled a weathered strong shoulder in a shrug well you know them as well as anyone theyve been polite open spoken with complete honesty and left you with no idea what is going on i guessed precisely so the senior council is asking me to find out he glanced around again not the senior council myself a few others what others i asked people i trust he said and looked at me directly over the rims of his spectacles i stared at him for a second and then said in a whisper the traitor the vampires of the red court had been a little too on top of the game to be merely lucky somehow they had been obtaining vital secrets about the dispositions of the white councils forces and their plans someone on the inside had been feeding the vampires information and a lot of wizards had died because of itparticularly during their heaviest attack last year in which theyd violated sidhe territory in pursuit of the fleeing council you think the traitor is someone on the senior council i think we cant take any chances he said quietly this isnt official business i cant order you to do it harry ill understand if you dont want to but theres no one better for the joband our allies cannot maintain the current pace of operations for long their best weapon has always been secrecy and their actions have forced them to pay a terrible cost of lives to give us what aid they have i folded my arms over my stomach and said we need to help them sure but every time i look sideways at faerie i get into deeper trouble with them its the last thing i need if i do this how ebenezars weight shifted gravel crunching loudly i glanced up to see the merlin and morgan emerge from the building speaking quietly and intently i wanted to talk to you ebenezar said evidently for the benefit of anyone listening make sure morgan and the other wardens are treating you square i went along with him when they talk to me at all i said about the only other warden i ever see is ramirez decent guy i like him that says a lot for him that the councils ticking time bomb has a good opinion of him i waited for morgan and the merlin to leave but they paused a little way off still talking i stared at the gravel for a long time and then said much more quiedy that could have been me in there today i could have been that kid it was a long time ago ebenezar said you were barely more than a child so was he ebenezars expression became guarded im sorry you had to see that business is that why it happened here i asked him why come to chicago for an execution he exhaled slowly its one of the great crossroads of the world harry more air traffic comes through here than anywhere else its an enormous port city for shipping of any kindtrucks trains ships that means a lot of ways in and out a lot of travelers passing through it makes it difficult for any observers from the red court to spot us or report our movements he gave me a bleak smile and then theres the way chicago seems to be inimical to the health of any vampire who comes here thats a pretty good cover story i said whats the truth ebenezar sighed and held up his hand in a conciliatory gesture it wasnt my idea i looked at him for a minute and then said the merlin called the meeting here ebenezar nodded and arched a shaggy grey brow which means i chewed on my lower lip and scrunched up my eyes it never helped me think any better but that was no reason not to keep trying it he wanted to send me a message kill two birds with one stone ebenezar nodded he wanted you stripped of your position as a warden but luccio is still the technical commander of the wardens though morgan commands in the field she supported you and the rest of the senior council overruled him bet he loved that i said ebenezar chuckled i thought he was having a stroke joy i said i didnt want the job to begin with i know he said you got rocks and hard places boy not much else so the merlin figures hell show me an execution and scare me into toeing the line i frowned thinking i take it theres no word on the attack last year no one found with mysterious sums of money dumped into their bank accounts that would incriminate a traitor not yet ebenezar said then with the traitor running around loose all the merlin has to do is wait for me to screw something up then he can call it treason and squish me ebenezar nodded and i saw the warning in his eyesanother reason to take the job he was offering he genuinely believes that you are a threat to the council if your behavior confirms his belief hell do whatever is necessary to stop you i snorted there was another guy like that once name of mccarthy if the merlin wants to find a traitor hell find one whether or not one actually exists ebenezar scowled a hint of a scots burr creeping into his voice as it did anytime he was angry and he glanced at the merlin aye i thought you should know i nodded still without looking up at him i hated being bullied into anything but i didnt get the vibe that ebenezar was making an effort to maneuver me into a corner he was asking a favor i might well help myself by doing him the favor but he wasnt going to bring anything onto my head if i turned him down it wasnt his style i met his eyes and nodded okay he exhaled slowly and nodded back silent thanks in his expression oh one other thing he said and passed me an envelope whats this i dont know he answered the gatekeeper asked me to give it to you the gatekeeper he was the quietest of the wizards on the senior council and even the merlin showed him plenty of respect he was taller than me which is saying something and he stayed out of most of the partisan politics of the senior council which says even more he knew things he shouldnt be able to knowmore so than most wizards i meanand as far as i could tell hed never been anything but straight with me i opened the envelope a single piece of paper was inside letters in a precise flowing hand read dresden in the past ten days there have been repeated acts of black magic in chicago as the senior warden in the region it falls to you to investigate and find those responsible in my opinion it is vital that you do so immediately to my knowledge no one else is aware of the situation rashid i rubbed at my eyes great more black magic in chicago if it wasnt some raving psychotic blackhatted bad guy it was probably another kid like the one whod died a few minutes ago there wasnt a whole lot of inbetween i was hoping for the murderous madmansorry political correction madperson i could deal with those id had practice i didnt think i could handle the other i put the letter back in the envelope thinking this was between the gatekeeper and me presumably he hadnt asked me publicly or told ebenezar what was going on which meant that i was free to decide how to handle this one if the merlin knew about this and officially gave me the assignment hed make damned sure i didnt have much of a choice in how to handle itand id have to do the whole thing under a microscope the gatekeeper had trusted me to handle whatever was wrong that was almost worse man sometimes i get tired of being the guy who is supposed to deal with undealwithable situations i looked up to find ebenezar squinting at me the expression made his face a mass of wrinkles what i asked you get a haircut or something hoss uh nothing new why you look the old wizards voice trailed off thoughtfully different my heartbeat sped up a little as far as i knew ebenezar was unaware of the entity who was leasing out the unused portions of my brain and i wanted to keep it that way but though he had a reputation for being something of a magical brawler his specialty the summoning up of primal destructive forces he had a lot more on the ball than most of the council gave him credit for it was entirely possible that he had sensed something of the fallen angels presence within me yeah well ive been wearing the cloak of the people i spent most of my adult life resenting i said between that and being a cripple ive been off my sleep for almost a year that can do it ebenezar said nodding hows the hand i bit back my first harsh response that it was still maimed and scarred and that the burns made it look like a badly melted piece of wax sculpture id gone up against a bad guy with a brain a couple of years back and shed worked out that my defensive magic was designed to stop kinetic energy not heat i found that out the hard way when a couple of her psychotic goons sprayed improvised napalm at me my shield had stopped the flaming jelly but the heat had gone right through and dry roasted the hand id held out to focus my shield i held up my gloved left hand and waggled my thumb and the first two fingers in jerky little motions the other two fingers didnt move much unless their neighbors pulled them not much feeling in them yet but i can hold a beer or the steering wheel doctors had me playing guitar trying to move them and use them more good ebenezar said exercise is good for the body but music is good for the soul not the way i play it i said ebenezar grinned wryly and drew a pocket watch from the front pocket of the overalls he squinted at it lunchtime he said you hungry there wasnt anything in his tone to indicate it but i could read the subtext ebenezar had been a mentor to me at a time id badly needed it hed taught me just about everything i thought was important enough to be worth knowing he had been unfailingly generous patient loyal and kind to me but he had been lying to me the whole time ignoring the principles he had been teaching me on the one hand he taught me about what it meant to be a wizard about how a wizards magic comes from his deepest beliefs about how doing evil with magic was more than simply a crime it was a mockery of what magic meant a kind of sacrilege on the other hand hed been the white councils blackstaff the whole whilea wizard with a license to kill to violate the laws of magic to make a mockery of everything noble and good about the power he wielded in the name of political necessity and hed done it many times i had once held the kind of trust and faith in ebenezar that i had given no one else id built a foundation for my life on what hed taught me about the use of magic about right and wrong but hed let me down hed been living a lie and it had been brutally painful to learn about it two years later it still twisted around in my belly a vague and nauseating unease my old teacher was offering me an olive branch trying to set aside the things that had come between us i knew that i should go along with him i knew that he was as human as fallible as anyone else i knew that i should set it aside mend our fences and get on with life it was the smart thing to do it was the compassionate responsible thing to do it was the right thing to do but i couldnt it still hurt too much for me to think straight about it i looked up at him death threats in the guise of formal decapitations sort of ruin my appetite he nodded at me accepting the excuse with a patient and steady expression though i thought i saw regret in his eyes he lifted a hand in a silent wave and turned away to walk toward a beatup old ford truck that had been built during the great depression second thoughts pressed in maybe i should say something maybe i should go for a bite to eat with the old man my excuse hadnt been untrue though there was no way i could eat i could still feel the droplets of hot blood hitting my face still see the body lying unnaturally in a pool of blood my hands started shaking and i closed my eyes forcing the vivid bloody memories out of the forefront of my thoughts then i got in the car and tried to leave the memories behind me the blue beetle is no muscle car but it flung up a respectable amount of gravel as i left the streets werent as bad as they usually were but it was still hotter than hell so i rolled down the windows at the first stoplight and tried to think clearly investigate the faeries great that was absolutely guaranteed to get complicated before i got any useful answers if there was one thing faeries hated doing it was giving you a straight answer about anything getting plain speech out of one is like pulling out teeth your own teeth through your nose but ebenezar was right i was probably the only one on the council with acquaintances in both the summer and winter courts of the sidhe if anyone on the council could find out it was me yippee and just to keep things interesting i needed to hunt down some kind of unspecified black magic and put a stop to it that was what wardens spent all their time doing when they werent fighting a war and what id done two or three times myself but it wasnt ever pretty black magic means a black practitioner of some kind and they tended to be the sorts of people who were both happy to kill an interfering wizard and able to manage it faeries black magic it never rains but it pours chapter three between one heartbeat and the next the passenger seat of the blue beetle was suddenly occupied i let out a yelp and nearly bounced my car off of a delivery truck the tires squealed in protest and i started to slide i turned into it and recovered but if id had another coat of paint on my car id have collided with the one next to me my heart in my throat i got the car moving smoothly again and turned to glare at the sudden passenger lasciel aka the temptress aka the webweaver apparently some kind of photocopy of the personality of a fallen angel sat in the passenger seat she could look like anything she chose but her most common form was that of a tall athletic blonde wearing a white greekstyle tunic that fell almost to her knee she sat with her hands in her lap staring out the front of the car smiling very slightly what the hell do you think youre doing i snarled at her are you trying to get me killed dont be such a baby she replied her tone amused no one was harmed no thanks to you i growled put the seat belt on she gave me a level look mortal i have no physical form i exist nowhere except within your mind i am a mental image an illusion a hologram only you can see there is no reason for me to wear my seat belt its the principle of the thing i said my car my brain my rules put on the damned seat belt or get lost she heaved a sigh very well she twisted around like anyone would drawing the seat belt forward around her waist and clicking it i knew she couldnt have picked up the physical seat belt and done that so what i was seeing was only an illusionbut it was a convincing one i would have had to make a serious effort to see that the actual seat belt hadnt moved lasciel looked at me acceptable barely i said thinking furiously lasciel as she appeared to me now was a portion of a genuine fallen angel the real deal was trapped inside an ancient silver denarius a roman coin which was buried under a couple of feet of concrete in my basement but in touching the coin id created a kind of outlet for the demons personalityembodied as an entirely discrete mental entity living right in my own head presumably in the ninety percent of the brain that humans never use or in my case maybe ninetyfive lasciel could appear to me could see what i saw and sense what i sensed could look through my memories to some degree and most disturbing could create illusions that i had to work hard to see throughjust as she was now creating the illusion of her physical presence in my car her extremely attractive and wholesomelooking and entirely desirable presence the bitch i thought we had an understanding i growled i dont want you coming to see me unless i call you and i have respected our agreement she said i simply came to remind you that my services and resources are at your disposal should you need them and that the whole of my self currently residing beneath the floor of your laboratory is likewise prepared to assist you you act like i wanted you there in the first place if i knew how to erase you from my head without getting killed id do it in a heartbeat i replied the portion of me that shares your mind is nothing but the shadow of my true self lasciel said but have a care mortal i am i exist and i desire to continue to do so like i said if i could do it without getting killed i growled in the meanwhile unless you want me to chain you into a little black closet in my head get out of my sight her mouth twitched maybe in irritation but nothing more than that showed on her face as you wish she said inclining her head but if black magic truly is once more rising within chicago you may well have need of every tool at hand and as you must survive for me to survive i have every reason to aid you a tiny black box i said without holes in the lid smelling like my high school locker room her mouth curled again an expression of wary amusement as you wish my host and she was gone vanishing back into the undeveloped vaults of my mind or wherever she went i shivered making sure my thoughts were contained shielded from her perceptions there was nothing i could do to prevent lasciel from seeing and hearing everything i did or from rummaging randomly in my memories but i had learned that i could at least veil my active thoughts from her i did so constantly in order to prevent her from learning too much too quickly that would only help her reach her goalthat of convincing me to unearth the ancient silver coin buried under my lab and sealed within spells and concrete within the coin the old roman denariusone of a collection of thirtydwelt the whole of the fallen angel lasciel if i chose to ally myself with her it would get me all kinds of strength the power and knowledge of a fallen angel could turn anyone into a deadly and virtually immortal threatat the low low cost of ones soul once you signed on with one of the literal hells angels you werent the only one in the captains chair anymore the more you let them help you the more you surrendered your will to them and sooner or later its the fallen angel thats calling the shots id grabbed the coin a heartbeat before a friends toddler could reach down for it and touching its surface had transferred a portion of the personality the intellect of lasciel into my head she helped me survive several nasty days the previous autumn and her assistance had been invaluable which was the problem i couldnt allow myself to continue relying on her help because sooner or later id get used to it and then id enjoy it and at some point digging up that coin in my basement wouldnt seem like such a bad idea all of which meant that i had to stay on my guard against the fallen angels suggestions the price may have been hidden but it was still there lasciel wasnt wrong though about how dangerous situations involving true black magic could become i might well find myself in need of help i thought about those who had fought beside me before i thought about my friend michael whose kid had been the one about to pick up the coin i hadnt seen michael since then i hadnt called hed called me a couple of times invited me to thanksgiving dinner a couple of times asked if i was all right a couple of times i had turned down his invitations and cut every phone conversation short michael didnt know that id picked up one of the blackened denarü taken possession of a token that could arguably make me a member of the knights of the blackened denarius id fought some of the denarians id killed one of them they were monsters of the worst sort and michael was a knight of the cross he was one of three people on the face of the earth who had been chosen to wield a holy sword an honesttogoodness holy sword each of them with what was supposed to be a nail from the cross capital c worked into the blade michael fought dark and evil things he beat them he saved children and innocents in danger and he would stand up to the darkest creatures imaginable without blinking so strong was his faith that the almighty would give him strength enough to defeat the darkness before him he had no love for his opposites the denarians powerhungry psychopaths as determined to cause and spread pain and suffering as michael was to contain them i never told him about the coin i didnt want him to know that i was sharing brain space with a demon i didnt want him to think less of me michael had integrity most of my adult life the white council at large had been sure that i was some kind of monster just waiting for the right time to morph into its true form and start laying waste to everything around me but michael had been firmly on my side since the first time wed met his unwavering support had made me feel a whole hell of a lot better about my life i didnt want him to look at me the way hed looked at the denarians wed fought so until i got rid of lasciels stupid mental sock puppet i wasnt going to ask him for help i would handle this on my own i was fairly sure that my day couldnt get much worse no sooner had i thought it than there was a horrible crunching sound and my head snapped back hard against the headrest on the back of the drivers seat the beetle shuddered and jounced wildly and i fought to keep it under control youd think i would know better by now chapter four i managed to get one wild look around and it showed me someone in a real battleship of an old chrysler dark grey windows tinted and then the car slammed into the beetle again and nearly sent me into a deadly spin my head snapped to one side and hit the window and i could almost smell the smoldering of my tires as they all slid forward and sideways simultaneously i felt the car hit the curb and then bounce up i wrenched at the steering wheel and the brakes my body responding to things my stunned brain hadnt caught up to yet i think i kept it from becoming a total disaster because instead of spinning off into oncoming traffic or hitting the wall at a sharp angle i managed to slam the beetles passengerside broadside into the building beside the street brick grated on steel until i came to a halt fifty feet later stars swarmed over my vision and i tried to swat them away so that i could get a look at the chryslers platesbut it was gone in a heartbeat or at least i think it was truth be told my head was spinning so much that the car could have been doing interpretive dance in a lilac tutu and i might not have noticed sitting there seemed like a really good idea so i sat after a while i got the vague notion that i should make sure everyone was all right i looked at me no blood which was positive i looked blearily around the car no screaming no corpses in my rearview mirror nothing was on fire there was broken safety glass everywhere from the passengerside window but the rear window had been replaced with a sheet of translucent plastic a while back the beetle stalwart crusader against the forces of evil and alternative fuels was still running though its engine had acquired an odd moaning wheeze as opposed to the usual surly wheeze i tried my door it didnt open i rolled down my window and hauled myself slowly out of the car if i could get up the energy to slide across the hood before i got back in i could audition for the dukes of hazzard here in hazzard county i drawled to myself we dont much cotton to hitandrun automotive assaults it took an unknown number of minutes for the first cop to arrive a patrolman i recognized named grayson grayson was an older cop a big man with a big red nose and a comfortable gut who looked like he could bounce angry drunks or drink them under the table take your pick he got out of his car and started asking me questions in a concerned tone of voice i answered him as best i could but something between my brain and my mouth had shorted out and i found him eyeing me and then looking around the inside of the beetle for open containers before he sat me down on the ground and started routing traffic around i got to sit down on the curb which suited me fine i watched the sidewalk spin around until someone touched my shoulder karrin murphy head of chicago pds special investigations department looked like someones cute kid sister she was maybe a rose petal over five feet tall had blond hair blue eyes a pug nose and nearly invisible freckles she was made all of springy muscle a gymnasts build that did not preclude feminine curves she was in a white cotton shirt and blue jeans that day a cubs ball cap on her head reflective sunglasses over her eyes harry she asked you okay uncle jesse is gonna be awful disappointed that one of boss hoggs flunkies banged up the general lee i told her waving at my car she stared at me for a moment and then said did you know you have a bruise on the side of your head nah i said i poked a finger at it do i murphy sighed and gently pushed my finger down harry seriously if youre so loopy you cant talk to me i need to get you to a hospital sorry murph i told her been a long day already i got my bells rung pretty good ill be fine in a minute she exhaled and then nodded and sat down on the curb with me mind if i have one of the emts look at you just to be careful theyd want to take me to a hospital i said too dangerous i could short out someones life support and the reds are watching the hospitals putting hits on our wounded i could draw fire onto the patients i know that she said quietly i wont let them take you oh okay then i said an emt checked me out he shined a light into my eyes for which i kicked him lightly in the shins he muttered at me for a minute poked me here and there examined and measured and counted and so on then he shook his head and stood up maybe a mild concussion he should see a doctor to be safe lieutenant murphy nodded thanked the emt and looked pointedly at the ambulance he sidled away his expression disapproving murphy sat down with me again all right spill what happened someone in a dark grey chrysler tried to park in my backseat i waved a hand annoyed as she opened her mouth and no i didnt get the plates i was too busy considering a career as a crash test dummy youve got the dummy part down she said you into something lately not yet i complained i mean hells bells murphy i got told half a freaking hour ago that theres bad juju going down somewhere in chicago i havent even had time to start checking into it and someone is already trying to make me into a commercial for seat belts and air bags you sure it was deliberate yeah but whoever it was he wasnt a pro why do you say that if he had been hed have spun me easy no idea he was there until hed hit me could have bumped me into a spin before i could have straightened out flipped my car a few times killed me pretty good i rubbed at the back of my neck a nice allbody ache was already spreading out into my muscles isnt exactly the best place for it either attack of opportunity murphy said whassat she smiled a little when you werent expecting the shot but you see it and take it before the opportunity passes you by oh yeah probably one of those murphy shook her head look maybe i should get you to a doctor anyway no i said really im okay but i want to get off the street soonest murphy inhaled slowly and then nodded ill take you home thanks grayson came ambling over to us wreckers on the way he said what do we got here hit and run murphy said grayson lifted his eyebrows and eyed me yeah looked to me like you got hit a couple of times on purposelike for all i know it was an honest accident i said grayson nodded theres some clothes in your backseat looks like they have blood on them leftovers from last halloween i said its costume stuff a cloak and robes and such had fake blood all over them it looked cheesy as hell grayson snorted youre worse than my kid hes still got some of his football jerseys in his backseat from last fall he probably has a nicer car i glanced up at the beetle it was a real mess and i winced it wasnt like the beetle was a priceless antique or anything but it was my car i drove it places i liked it in fact im sure its a nicer car grayson let out a wry chuckle i need to fill out some papers you okay to help me fill in the blanks sure i told him thanks for the call sergeant murphy said de nada grayson replied touching the brim of his cap with a finger ill get those forms dresden soon as the wrecker gets here cool i said grayson moved off and murphy stared at me steadily for a moment what i asked her quietly you lied to him she said about the clothes and the blood i twitched one shoulder and you did it well i mean if i didnt know you she shook her head it surprises me about you thats all youve always been a terrible liar urn i said i wasnt sure how to take that one thank you she let out a wry chuckle so whats the real story not here i said lets talk in a bit murphy studied my face for a second and her frown deepened harry whats wrong the limp headless body of that nameless young man filled my thoughts it brought up too many emotions with it and i felt my throat tighten until i knew i wouldnt be able to speak so i shook my head a little and shrugged she nodded you going to be all right there was a peculiar gentleness in her voice murphy had been playing in what amounted to a boysonly league in her work with cpd and she put off a toughasnails aura that made her seem almost as formidable as she actually was that exterior almost never varied at least out in the open with other police officers nearby but as she looked at me there was a quiet definite and unashamed vulnerability in her voice weve had our differences in the past but murphy was one hell of a good friend i gave her my best lopsided smile im always all right more or less she reached out and twitched a stray bit of hair from my forehead youre a great big girl dresden one little fender bender and you go all emotional and pathetic her eyes flickered to the beetle again and suddenly burned with a cold blue fire do you know who did this to you not yet i growled as the wrecker arrived but you can bet your ass im going to find out chapter five by the time we got back to my place my head was starting to run at its normal speed the better to inform me how much it hurt i had a nice deepdown body ache to go along with the bruised skull the light of the afternoon sun stabbed at my eyes in a cheerfully vicious fashion and i was glad when i shambled down the steps to my basement apartment disarmed my magical wards unlocked the door and shoved hard at it it didnt open the previous autumn zombies had torn apart my steel security door and wrecked my apartment though i was getting a modest paycheck from the wardens now i still didnt have enough money to pay for all the repairs and i had set out to fix the door on my own i hadnt framed it very well but i try to think positive the new door was arguably even more secure than the old onenow you could barely get the damned thing open even when it wasnt locked while i was in homerenovation mode i put down linoleum in the kitchen carpet on the living room and bedroom floors and tile in the bathroom and let me tell you something it isnt as easy as those timelife homeowner books make it look i had to slam my shoulder against it three or four times but the door finally groaned and squealed and came open i thought you were going to have a contractor fix that murphy said when i get the money i thought you were getting another paycheck now i sighed yeah but the rate of pay was set in and the council hasnt given it a costofliving increase since i think it comes up for review in a few more years wow thats even slower than city hall always thinking positive i went inside stepping onto the large wrinkle that had somehow formed in the carpet before the door my apartment isnt huge theres a fairly roomy living room with a miniature kitchen set in an alcove opposite the door the door to my tiny bedroom and bathroom is on the right as you come in with a redbrick fireplace set in the wall beside it bookshelves tapestries and movie posters line the cold stone walls my original star wars poster had survived the attack though my library of paperbacks had taken a real beating those darned zombies they always dogear the pages and crack the spines the minute theyre done oozing foul goop and smashing up furniture i have a couple of secondhand sofas which arent hard to get cheap so replacing them wasnt too bad a pair of comfortable old easy chairs by the fire a coffee table and a large mound of greyandblack fur rounded out the furnishings theres no electricity and its a dim little hole but its a dim cool little hole and it was a relief to get out of the broiling sun the small mountain of fur shook itself and something thudded against the wall beside it as it rose up into the shape of a large stocky dog covered in a thick shag of grey fur complete with an almost leonine mane of darker fur around his neck throat chest and upper shoulders he went to murphy straightaway sitting and offering up his right front paw murphy laughed and grabbed his paw brieflyher fingers couldnt have stretched around the offered limb hiya mouse she scratched him behind the ears when did you teach him that harry i didnt i said stooping to ruffle mouses ears as i went past him to the fridge wheres thomas i asked the dog mouse made a chuffing sound and looked at the closed door to my bedroom i stopped to listen for a moment and heard the faint gurgle of water in the pipes thomas was in the shower i got a coke out of the fridge and glanced at murphy she nodded i got her one too and doddered over to the couch to sit down slowly and carefully my aches and pains complaining at me the whole while i opened the coke drank and settled back with my eyes closed mouse lumbered over to sit down by the couch and lay his massive head on one knee he pawed at my leg im fine i told him he exhaled through his nose doggie expression somehow skeptical and i scratched his ears to prove it thanks for the ride murph sure she said she brought out a plastic sack shed carried in and tossed it on the floor it held my robe stole and cloak all of them spattered with blood she walked over to the kitchen sink and started filling it with cold water so lets talk i nodded and told her about the korean kid while i did that she put my stole in the sink then started washing it briskly in the cold water that kid is what wizards mean when they talk about warlocks i said someone who has betrayed the purpose of magic gone bad right from the start she waited a moment and then said in a quiet dangerous voice they killed him here in chicago yes i said i felt even more tired this is one of our safer meeting places apparently you saw it yes you didnt stop it i couldnt have i said there were heavyweights there murphy and i took a deep breath im not sure they were completely in the wrong like hell they werent she snarled i dont give a good god damn what the white council does over in england or south america or wherever they want to hang around flapping their beards but they came here had nothing to do with you i said nothing to do with the law that is it was internal stuff they would have done the same to that kid no matter where they were her movements became jerky for a moment and water splashed over the rim of the sink then she visibly forced herself to relax put the stole aside and went to work on the robe why do you think that she asked the kid had gone in for black magic in a big way i said mindcontrol stuff robbing people of their free will she regarded me with cool eyes im not sure i understand its the fourth law of magic i said you arent allowed to control the mind of another human but hell its one of the first things a lot of these stupid kids trythe old jedi mind trick sometimes they start with maybe getting homework overlooked by a teacher or convincing their parents to buy them a car they come into their magic when theyre maybe fifteen or so and by the time theyre seventeen or eighteen theyve got a full grown talent and thats bad a lot of times i said think about how men that age are cant go ten seconds without thinking about sex sooner or later if someone doesnt teach them otherwise theyll put the psychic armlock on the head cheerleader to get a date and more than a date and then more girls or i guess other guys if im going to be pc about it someone else gets upset about losing a girlfriend or a daughter getting pregnant and the kid tries to fix his mistakes with more magic but why does that mandate execution murphy asked it i frowned getting into someones mind like that is difficult and dangerous and sooner or later while youre changing them you start changing yourself too you remember micky malone murphy didnt exactly shudder but her hands stopped moving for a minute micky malone was a retired police officer a few months after hed gotten out of the game an angry and vicious spiritual entity had unleashed a psychic assault on him and bound him in spells of torment to boot the attack had transformed a grandfatherly old retired cop into a screaming maniac totally out of control id done what i could for the poor guy but it had been really bad i remember murphy said quietly when a person gets into someones head it inflicts all kinds of damagesort of like what happened to micky malone but it damages the one doing it too it gets easier to bend others as you get more bent vicious cycle and its dangerous for the victim not just because of what might happen as a direct result of suddenly being forced to believe that the warlock is the godking of the universe it strains their psyche and the more uncharacteristically theyre made to feel and act the more it hurts them most of the time it devolves into a total breakdown murphy shivered like those office workers mavra did it to and the renfields a flash of phantom pain went through my maimed hand at the memory exactly like that i said what can that kind of magic do she asked her voice more subdued too much this kid had forced a bunch of people to commit suicide a bunch more to commit murder hed turned a whole gang of people most of them his family into his personal slaves my god murphy said quietly thats hideous i nodded thats black magic you get enough of it in you and it changes you stains you isnt there anything else the council can do not when the kid is that far gone theyve tried it all i said sometimes the warlock seemed to get better but they all turned back in the end and more people died so unless someone on the council takes personal responsibility for the warlock they just kill them she thought about that for a moment then she asked could you have done that taken responsibility for him i shifted uncomfortably theoretically i guess if i really believed he could be salvaged she pressed her lips together and stared at the sink murph i said as gently as i knew how the law couldnt handle someone like that you couldnt arrest them contain them without some serious magic to neutralize their powers if you tried to bring an angry warlock into holding down at si it would get ugly worse than the loupgarou theres got to be another way murphy said once a dog goes rabid you cant bring him back i said all you can do is keep him from hurting others the best solution is prevention find the kids displaying serious talent and teach them better from the getgo but the world population has grown so much in the past century that the white council cant possibly identify and reach them all especially with this war on there just arent enough of us she tilted her head staring at me us thats the first time ive heard you reference the white council with yourself included in it i wasnt sure what to say to that so i drank the rest of my coke murphy went on washing for a minute set the robe aside and reached for the grey cloak she dropped it into the sink frowned and then held it up look at this she said the blood came out when it hit the water all by itself its like that kid never died cool i said quietly murphy watched me for a moment maybe this is what it feels like for civilians when they see cops doing some of the dirty work a lot of times they dont understand whats happening they see something they dont like and it upsets thembecause they dont have the full story arent personally facing the problem and dont know how much worse the alternative could be maybe i agreed it sucks sorry she cast me a fleeting smile but her expression grew serious again when she crossed the room to sit down near me do you really think what they did was necessary god help me i nodded is this why the council was so hard on you for so long because they thought you were a warlock about to relapse yeah except for the part where youre using the past tense i leaned forward chewing on my lip for a second murph this is one of those things the cops cant get involved in i told you there would be things like this i dont like what happened anymore than you do but please dont push this it wont help anyone i cant ignore a dead body there wont be one she shook her head and stared at the coke for a while more all right she said but if the body shows up or someone reports it i wont have any choice i understand i looked around for a change of subject so theres black magic afoot in chicago according to an annoyingly vague letter from the gatekeeper who is he wizard way mysterious you believe him yeah i said so we should be on the lookout for killings and strange incidents and so on the usual right murphy said ill keep an eye out for corpses weirdos and monsters the door to the bedroom opened and my half brother thomas emerged freshly showered and smelling faintly of cologne he was right around six feet in height and was built like the high priest of bowflexall lean muscle sculpted and well formed not too much of a good thing he wore a pair of black trousers and black shoes and was pulling a pale blue tshirt down over his rippling abs as he came into the room murphy watched him blue eyes gleaming thomas is awfully pretty to look at hes also a vampire of the white court they didnt go in for fangs and blood so much as pale skin and supernaturally hot sex but just because they fed on raw life force rather than blood didnt make them any less dangerous thomas had worked hard to make sure that he kept his hunger under control so that when he fed he wouldnt hurt anyone too badlybut i knew it had been a difficult struggle for him and he carried that strain around with him it was visible in his expression and it made all of his movements those of a lean hungry predator monsters he asked pulling the shirt down over his head he smiled pleasantly and said karrin good afternoon thats lieutenant murphy to you prettyboy she shot back but her face was set in an appreciative smile he grinned back at her from under his hair which even when wet and uncombed was carelessly curling and attractive why thank you for the compliment he said he reached down to scratch mouses ears nodded to me and seized up his big black gym bag you have some more business come to town harry thats the scuttlebutt i said i havent had time to look into it yet he tilted his head to one side and frowned at me what the hell happened to you car trouble uhhuh he said he slung the bags strap over his shoulder look you need some help just let me know he glanced at the clock and said gotta run sure i said to his back he shut the door behind him murphy arched an eyebrow that was abrupt are you still getting along i grimaced and nodded hes i dont know murph hes been very distant lately and gone almost all of the time day and night he sleeps and eats here but mostly when im at work and when i do see him its always like thatin passing hes in a hurry to get somewhere where she asked i shrugged youre worried about him she said yeah hes usually a lot more tense than this you know the whole incubus hunger thing im worried that maybe hes decided appetite control was for the birds do you think hes hurting anyone no i said at once a little too quickly i forced myself to calm down and then said no not as such i dont know i wish hed talk to me but ever since last fall hes kept me at arms length have you asked him murphy said i eyed her no why not it isnt done that way i said why not because guys dont do it like that let me get this straight murphy said you want him to talk to you but you wont actually tell him that or ask him any questions you sit around with the silence and tension and no one says anything thats right i said she stared at me you need a prostate to understand i said she shook her head i understand enough she rose and said youre idiots you should talk to him maybe i said meanwhile ill keep my eyes open if i find anything odd ill get in touch thank you what are you going to do wait for sundown i said then what she asked i rubbed at my aching head feeling a sudden surge of defiance for whoever had run me off the road and whatever blackmagicky jerk had decided to mess around with my hometown then i put on my wizard hat and start finding out whats going on chapter six murphy stayed until she was sure i wasnt going to suddenly drop unconscious but made me promise to call her in a couple of hours to be sure mouse escorted her to the door when she left and murphy swung it shut with two hands and a grunt of effort in order to make it close snugly into the frame her car started departed i prodded my brain with a sharp stick until it figured out my next move my brain pointed out that i knew the current summer knight of the summer court and that the guy owed me some fairly big favors id saved his life when hed just been a terrified changeling trying not to get swallowed up by an incipient war between winter and summer when everything settled he was the new summer knight the mortal champion of the summer court it gave him a lot of influence with fully half of the sidhe realm and hed probably know more about what was going on there than any other native of the real world my brain thought it would be really wonderful if maybe i could make one little phone call to fix and get all the information i needed about the sidhe courts handed to me on a silver platter my brain is sometimes overly optimistic but i indulged it on the off chance that i came up a winner in the investigative lottery i reached for the phone it rang eleven times before someone answered yes fix i asked mmmph answered a rumpledsounding male voice who is this harry dresden harry his voice brightened with immediate if somewhat sleepy cheer which seemed far more appropriate to the summer knight of the sidhe courts hey how are you whats up thats the question of the day i said i need to talk to you about summer business the sleepiness vanished from his voice so did the friendliness oh look its nothing big i started i just need to harry he said his voice sharp fix had never cut me off before in fact if youd asked my professional opinion a year before id have told you he never interrupted anyone in his life we cant talk about this the line might not be secure come on man i said no one can monitor the phone line with a spell itd burn out in a second someone isnt playing by the old rules anymore harry he said and a phone tap is not a difficult thing to engineer i frowned good point i allowed then we need to talk when soonest accorded neutral territory he responded he meant mcanallys pub macs place has always been a hangout for the supernatural crowd in chicago when the war broke out someone managed to get it placed on a list of neutral territories where by the agreements known as the unseelie accords everyone respected the neutrality of the property and was expected to behave in a civil fashion when present it might not have been a private rendezvous but it was probably the safest place in town to discuss this kind of thing fine i said when ive got business tonight the soonest i can do it is tomorrow lunch noon i replied there was a sleepy murmur on the other end of the phonea womans voice shhhhh fix said sure harry ill see you there we hung up and i regarded the phone with pursed lips fix sleeping this late in the day and with a girl in bed with him no less and interrupting wizards without a second thought hed come a ways of course hed had a lot of exposure to the faeries since the last time id seen him and if he had anything like the power that id seen the champions of the sidhe display before hed have had time to get used to his new strength you can never tell how someone is going to handle powernot until you hand it to them and see what they do with it fix had certainly changed i got a little twist in my gut that told me i should employ a great deal more than average caution when i spoke to him i didnt like the feeling before i could think about it for too long i made myself pick up the phone and move on with what my brain told me was a reasonable step two checking around to see if anyone had heard anything about bad juju running around town i called several people billy the werewolf recently married mortimer lindquist ectomancer waldo butters medical examiner and composer of the quasimodo polka a dozen magical smalltimers i knew plus my exs editor at the midwestern arcane none of them had heard of anything and i warned them all to keep an ear to the ground i even put in a call to the archive but all i got was an answering service and no one returned my call i sat and stared at the phones base for a moment the receiver buzzing a dial tone in my gloved left hand i hadnt called michael or father forthill i probably should have working on the basic notion that more help was better help then again if the home office wanted michael on the case hed be there regardless of whether or not anyone called him and how many immovable objects stood in the way ive seen it happen often enough to trust that it was true it was a good rationalization but it wasnt fooling anyone not even me the truth was that i didnt want to talk to either one of them unless i really really really had to the dial tone turned into that annoying buzzbuzzbuzz of a noconnection signal i hung the phone back up my hand unsteady then i got up reached down to the clumsily trimmed area of carpet that covered the trapdoor set in the apartments floor and pulled it open onto a wooden stepladder that folded out and led down into my laboratory the lab is in the subbasement which is a much better name for it than the basementbasement its little more than a big concrete box with a ladder leading up and out of it the walls are lined with overflowing white wire shelves the cheap kind you can get at walmart in my lab they store containers of every kind from plastic bags to microwavesafe plastic dinnerware to heavy wooden boxesand even one leadlined leadsealed box where i store a tiny amount of depleted uranium dust other books notebooks envelopes paper bags pencils and apparently random objects of many kinds crowd each other for space on the shelvesall except for one plain homemade wooden shelf which held only candles at either end four romance novels a victorias secret catalog and a bleached human skull a long table ran down the middle of the room leaving a blank section of floor at the far end kept perfectly clear of any clutter whatsoever a ring of plain silver was set into the floormy summoning circle underneath it lay a foot and a half or so of concrete and then another heavy metal box wrapped with its own little circle of wards and spells inside the box was a blackened silver coin my left palm which had been so badly burned except for an outline of skin in the shape of lasciels angelic symbol suddenly itched i rubbed it against my leg and ignored it my worktable had been crowded with material for most of the time it had been down in my lab but that no longer was the case at that point i felt i owed someone an apology when murphy had asked me about the money from the council the answer id given her was true enough theyd set the pay rate for wardens in the fiftiesbut even the council wasnt quite hidebound enough to ignore things like standard inflation and the wardens paychecks had kept pace through discretionary funding inmy god im starting to sound like part of the establishment long story short the wardens have sneaky ways of getting paid more and the money i was getting from them while not stellar was nothing to sneeze at either but i hadnt been spending it on things like fixing up my apartment id been spending it on what was on my worktable bob i said wake up orangish flames kindled wearily to life inside the open eye sockets of the skull oh for crying out loud a voice from within complained cant you take a night off itll be finished when its finished harry no rest for the wicked bob i said cheerfully and that means we cant slack off either or theyll outwork us the skulls voice took on a whiny tone but weve been tinkering with that stupid thing every night for six months youre growing a cowlick and buck teeth by the way you keep this up and youll have to retire to a home for magical geeks and nerds pish tosh i said you cant say pish tosh to that bob grumped you dont even know what it means sure i do it means spirits of air should shut up and assist their wizard before he sends them out to patrol for fungus demons again i get no respect bob sighed okay okay what do you want to do now i gestured at the table is it ready ready bob said it isnt ever going to be ready harry your subject is fluid always changing your model must change too if you want it to be as accurate as possible its going to be a headache keeping it up to date i do and i know i told him so talk where are we is it ready for a test run put me in the lake bob said i reached up to the shelf obligingly picked up the skull and set it down on the eastern edge of the table the skull settled down beside the model city of chicago id built it onto my table in as much detail as id been able to afford with my new paycheck the skyline rose up more than a foot from the tabletop models of each building made from cast pewteralso expensive given id had to get each one made individually streets made of real asphalt ran between the buildings lined with streetlights and mailboxes in exacting detailand all in all i had the city mapped out to almost two miles from burnham harbor in every direction detail began to fail toward the outskirts of the model but as far as id been able to i modeled every building every road every waterway every bridge and every tree with as much accuracy as i knew how id also spent months out on the town collecting bits and pieces from every feature on my map bark from trees usually chips of asphalt from the streets id taken a hammer and knocked a chip or two off every building modeled there and those pieces of the originals had been worked into the structure of their modeled counterparts if id done it correctly the model would be of enormous value to my work id be able to use various techniques to do all kinds of things in towntrack down lost objects listen in on conversations happening within the area depicted by the model follow people through town from the relative safety of my lablots of cool stuff the model would let me send my magic throughout chicago with a great deal more facility and with a far broader range of applications than i could currently manage of course if i hadnt done it correctly this map bob said is pretty cool id have thought you would have shown it off to someone by now nah i said tiny model of the city down here in my basement laboratory sort of projects more of that evil psychotic lex luthor vibe than id like bah bob said none of the evil geniuses i ever worked for could have handled something like this he paused though some of the psychotics could have i guess if thats meant to be flattering you need some practice what am i if not good for your ego boss the skull turned slowly left to right candleflame eyes studying the model citynot its physical makeup i knew but the miniature ley lines that id built into the surface of the table the courses of magical energy that flowed through the city like blood through the human body it looks he made a sound like someone idly sucking a breath through his teeth hey it looks not bad harry youve got a gift for this kind of work that model of the museum really altered the flow around the stadium into something mostly accurate speaking thaumaturgically is that even a real word i asked it should be he said with a superior sniff little chicago might be able to handle something if you want to give it a test run the skull spun around to face me tell me that this doesnt have something to do with the bruises on your face im not sure it does i said i got word today that the gatekeeper bob shivered thinks that theres black magic afoot in town and that i need to do something about it and you want to try to use little chicago to find it maybe i said do you think it will work i think that the wright brothers tested their new stuff at kitty hawk instead of trying it over the grand canyon for a reason bob said specifically because if the plane folded due to flawed design they might survive it at kitty hawk or maybe they couldnt afford to travel i said besides how dangerous could it be bob stared at me for a second then he said youve been pouring energy into this thing every night for six months harry and right now its holding about three hundred times the amount of energy that kinetic ring you wear will contain i blinked at full power that ring could almost knock a car onto its side three hundred times that kind of energy translated to well something id rather not experience within the cramped confines of the lab its got that much in it yes and you havent tested it yet if youve screwed up some of the harmonics it could blow up in your face worstcase scenario best case you only blow out the project and set yourself back to ground zero to square one i corrected him square one is the beginning of a project ground zero is the area immediately under a bomb blast one may tend to resemble the other bob said sourly ill just have to live with the risk i said thats the exciting life of a professional wizard and his daring assistant oh please assistants get paid in answer i reached down to a paper bag out of sight below the table and withdrew two paperback romances bob let out a squeaking sound and his skull jounced and jittered on the bluepainted surface of the table that represented lake michigan is that it is that it he squeaked yes i said theyre rated burning hot by some kind of romance society lots of sex and kink bob caroled gimme i dropped them back into the bag and looked from bob to little chicago the skull spun back around you know what kind of black magic he asked no clue just black vague yet unhelpful bob said annoyingly so oh the gatekeeper didnt do it to annoy you bob said he did it to prevent any chance of paradox he i blinked he what he got this from hindsight he had to bob said hindsight i murmured you mean he went to the future for this well bob hedged that would break one of the laws so probably not but he might have sent himself a message from there or maybe gotten it from some kind of prognosticating spirit he might even have developed some ability for that himself some wizards do meaning what i asked meaning that its possible nothing has happened yet but that he wanted to put you on your guard against something thats coming in the immediate future why not just tell me i asked bob sighed you just dont get this do you i guess not okay lets say he finds out that someone is going to steal your car tomorrow heh i said bitterly okay lets say that right well he cant just call you up and tell you to move your car why not because if he significantly altered what happened with his knowledge of the future it could cause all sorts of temporal instabilities it could cause new parallel realities to split off from the point of the alteration ripple out into multiple alterations he couldnt predict or kind of backlash into his consciousness and drive him insane bob glanced at me again which you know might not do much to deter you but other wizards take that kind of thing seriously thank you bob i said but i still dont get why any of those things would happen bob sighed okay temporal studies lets say that he hears about your car being stolen he comes back to warn you and as a result you keep your car sounds good so far but if your car never got stolen bob said then how did he know to come back and warn you i frowned thats paradox and it can have all kinds of nasty backlash theory holds that it could even destroy our reality if it happened in a weak enough spot but thats never been proven and never happened you can tell on account of how everything keeps existing okay i said so whats the point in sending the message at all if it cant change anything oh it can bob said if its done subtly enough indirectly enough you can get all kinds of things changed like for example he tells you that your car is going to be stolen so you move it to a parking garage where instead of getting stolen by the junkie who was going to shoot you and take the car on the street you get jacked by a professional who takes the car without hurting youbecause by slightly altering the fate of the car he indirectly alters yours i frowned thats a pretty fine line yes which is why not mucking around with time is one of the laws bob said its possible to change the pastbut you have to do it indirectly and if you screw it up you run the risk of paradoxegeddon so what youre saying is that by sending me this warning hes indirectly working some other angle completely im saying that the gatekeeper is usually a hell of a lot more specific about this kind of thing bob said all of the senior council take black magic seriously theres got to be a reason hes throwing it at you like this my gut says hes working from a temporal angle you dont have any guts i said sourly your jealousy of my intellect is an ugly ugly thing harry bob said i scowled get to the point right boss said the skull the point is that black magic is very hard to find when you look for it directly if you try to bring up instances of black magic on your model like little chicago is some kind of eviljuju radar array its probably going to blow up in your face the gatekeeper put me on guard against black magic i said but maybe hes telling me that so that i can watch for something else something blackmagic related which might be a lot easier to find with your model bob said cheerfully sure i said if i had the vaguest idea of what to look for i frowned scowling so instead of looking for black magic we look for the things that go along with black magic bingo bob said and the more normal the better i pulled out my stool and sat down frowning so how about we look for corpses blood fear those are pretty standard black wizardry accessories pain too bob said theyre into pain sos the bdsm community i said in a city of eight million there are tens of thousands like that oh good point bob said one would almost think you should have thought of that one i gloated but for the bdsm crowd the pain isnt something they fear so you just look for the fear instead real fear not movietheater fear terror and there cant be a lot of spilled human blood in places with no violent activity unless someone slips at the hospital or something ditto the corpses i drummed the fingers of my good hand thoughtfully on the table beside bob do you think little chicago could handle that he considered for a long moment before he said in a cautious tone maybe one of them but this will be a very difficult very long and very dangerous spell for you harry youre good for your years but you still dont have the kind of fine control youll get as you age its going to take all of your focus and it will take a lot out of youassuming you can manage it at all i took a deep breath and nodded slowly fine we treat it as a fullblown ritual then cleansing meditation incense the works even if you do everything right bob said it might not work and if little chicago turns out to be flawed it would be very bad for you i nodded slowly staring at the model city there were eight million people in my town and out of all of them there were maybe two or three who could stand up to black magic who had the kind of knowledge and power it took to stop a black wizard not only that but odds were good that i was the only one who could actively find and counter someone before he got the murderball rolling i was also presumably the only one who was forewarned maybe it would be better to slow this down wait for developments my friends would report to me then i could get a better read on the threat and how to deal with it i mean was it worth as much as my life to try this spell when patience would get me information that was almost as good it might not be worth my life but it would probably cost someone elses black magic isnt the kind of thing that leaves people whole behind itand sometimes the victims it kills are the lucky ones if i didnt employ the model id have to wait for the bad guys to make the first move so i had to do it i was tired of looking at corpses and victims pull together everything you know about this kind of spell bob i told him quietly im going to get some food and then well lay out the ritual ill start looking for fear come sundown will do bob said and for once he was serious and didnt sass me yikes i started back up my ladder before i thought about it too much and changed my mind chapter seven ritual magic is not my favorite thing in the whole world it doesnt matter what im trying to accomplish i still feel sort of silly when it comes time to bathe and then dress myself up in a white robe with a hood lighting candles and incense chanting and mucking around with a small arsenal of candles wands rods liquids and other props used in ritual magic selfconscious as i might be though the props and the process offered an overriding advantage when it came to working with heavy magicthey freed up my attention from the dozens of little details that i would normally be forced to imagine and keep firmly in mind most of the time i never gave the proper visualization a second thought id been doing it for so long that it was practically second nature that was fine for shortterm work where i had to hold my thoughts in perfect balance only for a few seconds but for a longer spell i would need an exponentially greater amount of focus and concentration it took someone with a lot more mental discipline than me to cast a spell through a halfhour ritual without help and while there were probably experienced wizards who could manage it few bothered to try it when the alternative was usually simpler safer and more likely to work i rounded up the props i would need for the ritual with the elements first a silver cup which i would fill with wine for water a geode the size of my fist its internal crystals vibrant shades of purple and green for earth fire would be represented by a faeriemade candle formed from unused beeswax its wick braided from the hairs of a unicorns mane air would be anchored by a pair of hawkwing feathers wrought from gold with impossibly fine detail and precision by a band of svartalves whose mortal contact sold examples of their craftsmanship out of a shop in norway and for the fifth element spirit i would use my mothers silver pentacle amulet other props followed to engage the senses incense for scent and fresh grapes for taste tactile forces would depend upon a doublesided threeinch square id made from velvet on one side and sandpaper on the other a rather large deeply colored opal set within a silver frame reflected back every color of the rainbow and would hold down the sight portion of the spell and when i got rolling i would strike my old tuning fork against the floor for sound mind body and heart came last for mind i would use an old kbar military knife as my ritual athame as i usually did fresh droplets of my blood upon a clean white cloth would symbolize my physical body for heart i placed several photos of those who were dear to me inside a sack of silverwhite silk my parents susan murphy thomas mouse and mister my thirtypound grey tomcat currently on walkabout and after a brief hesitation michael and his family i prepared the ritual circle on my lab floor carefully sweeping it mopping it sweeping it again then cleansing it with captured rainwater poured from a small silver ewer i brought in all the props and laid them out ready to go then i prepared myself i lit sandalwood incense and more faeriecandles in the bathroom started up the shower then went step by step through a routine of washing while focusing my mind on the task at hand the water sluicing over me would drain away any random magical energies a crucial step in the spellcontaminating the spells energy with other forces would cause it to fail i finished bathing dried and slipped into my white robe then i knelt on the floor at the head of the stairs down to the lab closed my eyes and began meditating just as no other energies could be allowed into the ritual my concentration had to be of similar purity random thoughts worries fears and emotions would sabotage the spell i focused on my breathing upon stilling my thoughts and felt my limbs grow a little chill as my heartbeat slowed worries of the day my aches and pains my thoughts of the futureall had to go it took a while to get myself in the proper frame of mind and by the time i was finished it had been dark for two hours and my knees ached somewhere in the background i opened my eyes and everything came into a brilliantly sharp focus that discounted the existence of anything except myself my magic and the ritual awaiting me it had been a long wearying preparation and i hadnt even started with the magic yet but if the spell could help me nail the bad guys quicker the hours of effort would be well worth it silence and focus ruled i was ready and then the fucking phone rang about a foot from my ear it is possible that i made some kind of unmanly noise when i jumped my posturenumbed legs didnt respond as quickly as i needed them to and i lurched awkwardly to one side half falling onto the nearest couch dammit i screamed in sudden frustration dammit dammit dammit mouse looked up from his lazy drowse and tilted his head to one side ears up and forward what are you looking at i snarled mouses jaw dropped open into a grin and his tail wagged i rubbed my hand at my face while the phone kept on ringing it had been a while since id done any seriously focused magic like that and granted i really dont get very many calls but all the same i should have remembered to unplug the phone four hours of preparation gone to waste the phone kept ringing and my head pounded in time with it i ached stupid phone stupid car crash i tried to think positive because i read somewhere that its important to do that at times of stress and frustration whoever wrote that was probably selling something i picked up the phone and growled screw thinking positive into the handset urn said a womans voice what did you say screw thinking positive i half shouted what the hell do you want well maybe i have the wrong number i was calling to speak to harry dresden i frowned my mind taking in details despite my tempers bid to take over the show the voice was familiar to me rich smooth adultbut the speakers speech patterns had an odd hesitancy to them her words had an odd thick edge on them too an accent speaking i said annoyed as hell but speaking oh is this a bad time i rubbed at my eyes and choked down a vicious response who is this oh she said as if the question surprised her harry its molly molly carpenter ah i said i clapped one palm to my face my friend michaels oldest daughter way to rolemodel harry you sure do come off like a calm responsible adult molly didnt recognize you at first im sorry she said the s sound was a little bit thick had she been drinking not your fault i said which it hadnt been for that matter the interruption might have been a stroke of luck if my head was still too scrambled from that afternoons automobile hijinks to remember to unplug the phone i didnt have any business trying to cast that spell probably would have blown my own head off what do you need molly urn she said and there was nervous tension in her voice i need i need you to come bail me out bail i said youre being literal yes youre in jail yes she said oh my god i said molly i dont know if i can do that youre sixteen seventeen she said with sparks of indignation and another thick s whatever i said youre a juvenile you should call your parents no she said something near panic in her voice harry please i cant call them why not because i only get the one call and i used it to call you actually i dont think thats exactly how it works molly i sighed in fact im surprised thati frowned thinking you lied about your age if i hadnt mom and dad would be here already she said harry please look theres theres a lot of trouble at home right now i cant explain it here but if youll come get me i swear ill tell you all about it i sighed again i dont know molly please she said its just this once and ill pay you back and ill never ask something like this of you again i promise molly had long since earned her phd in wheedling she managed to sound vulnerable and hopeful and sad and desperate and sweet all at the same time im pretty sure she wouldnt need half that much effort to wrap her father around a finger her mother charity was probably a different story though i sighed why me i asked i hadnt been talking to molly but she answered i couldnt think who else to call she said i need your help ill call your dad ill come down with him please no she said quietly and i didnt think she was feigning the quiet desperation in her voice please why fight the inevitable ive always been a sucker for ye olde damsel in distress maybe not as big a sucker now as i had been in the past but the insanity did not seem much less potent than it had always been all right i said where she gave me the location of one of the precincts not too far from my apartment im coming i told her and this is the deal ill listen to what you have to say if i dont like it im going to your parents but you dont molly i said and i felt my voice harden youre already asking me for a lot more than i feel comfortable with ill come down there to get you you tell me whats up after that i make the call and you abide by it but this isnt a negotiation i said do you want my help or not there was a long pause and she made a frustrated little sound all right she said after a beat she hurried to add and thank you yeah i said and eyed the candles and incense and thought about all the time id thrown away ill be along within the hour i would have to call a cab it wasnt the most heroic way to ride to the rescue but walkers cant be choosers i got up to dress and told mouse im a sucker for a pretty face when i came out of the bedroom in clean clothes mouse was sitting hopefully by the door he batted a paw at his leash which hung over the doorknob i snorted and said you aint pretty furface but i clipped the leash to his collar and called for a cab chapter eight the cabby drove me to the eighteenth district of the cpd on larrabee the neighborhood around it has seen a couple of better days and thousands of worse ones the onceinfamous cabrini green isnt far away but urban renewal and the efforts of local neighborhood watches community groups church congregations from several faiths and cooperation with the local police department had changed some of chicagos nastier streets into something resembling actual civilization the nasty hadnt left the city of coursebut it had been driven away from what had once been a stronghold of decay and despair what was left behind wasnt the prettiest section of town but it bore the quiet steady signs of a place that had a passing acquaintance with law and order of course the cynical would point out that cabrini green was only a short walk from the gold coast one of the richest areas of the city and that it was no coincidence that funds had been sent that way by the powers that be through various municipal programs the cynical would be right but it didnt change the fact that the people of the area had worked and fought to reclaim their homes from fear crime and chaos on a good day the neighborhood made you feel like there was hope for us as a species that we could drive back the darkness with enough will and faith and help that kind of thinking had taken on whole new dimensions for me in the past year or two the police station wasnt new but it was free of graffiti litter and shady characters of any kindat least until i showed up in jeans and a red tshirt bruised and unshaven i got a weird look from the cabby who probably didnt get all that many sandalwoodscented fares to drop off there mouse presented his head to the cabby while i paid through the drivers window and got a smile and a polite scratching of the ears in reply mouse has better people skills than me i turned to walk up to the station stubbornly putting my money back in my wallet with my stiff left hand as i walked and mouse walked beside me the hair on the back of my neck suddenly crawled and i looked up at the reflection in the glass doors as i approached them a car had pulled up on the far side of the street behind me and was stopped directly under a no parking sign i saw a vague shadow inside the car a white sedan i did not recognize and which certainly wasnt the dark grey car that had run me off the road earlier but my instincts told me i was being tailed by someone you dont park illegally like that in front of a police station no less just because youre bored mouse let out a low rumble of a growl which made me grow a shade more wary mouse rarely made noise at all when he did i had begun to think it was because there was some kind of dark presence aroundevil magic hungry vampires and deadly necromancers had all earned snarls of warning but he never made a peep when the mailman came by so adding it up someone from the nasty end of my side of the supernatural street was following me around town good grief at least i usually know who im pissing off and why by the time an investigation gets to the point where im being followed theres usually been at least one crime scene and maybe even a corpse or two mouse growled another warning i see him i told mouse quietly easy just keep walking he fell silent again and we never broke stride up to the door molly carpenter appeared and opened the door for us the last time id seen molly shed been an awkward adolescent all skinny legs brighteyed interest and hesitation of movement offset by an appealing personal confidence and frequent smiles and laughter but that had been years ago since then molly had gotten all growed up she strongly favored her mother charity both of them were tall for women only an inch or two under six feet both of them blond fair blueeyed and both of them built like the proverbial brick house somehow managing to combine strength grace and beauty that showed as much in their bearing expression and movement as it did in their appearance charity was a rose wrought of stainless steel molly could have been her younger self of course i doubted charity had ever worn an outfit like mollys molly stood facing me in a long gauzy black skirt shredded artistically in several places she wore fishnet tights beneath it showing more leg and hip than any mother would prefer the tights too were artfully torn in patches to display pale smooth skin of thigh and calf she had armysurplus combat boots on her feet laced up with neon pink and blue laces she wore a tight tank top its fabric white thin and strained by the curves of her breasts and a short black bolero jacket bearing a huge gaudy button printed with the logo splattercon in dripping red letters black leather gloves covered her hands but wait thats not all her blond hair had been dyed particolored one half of her head bubblegum pink the other sky blue and it had been cut at a uniform length that ended just below her chin and left most of her face covered by a close veil of hair she wore a lot of makeup way too much eye liner and mascara and black lipstick colored her mouth bright rings of gold gleamed in both nostrils her lower lip and her right eyebrow and there was a bead of gold in that little dent just under her lower lip there were miniature barbellshaped bulges at the tips of her breasts where the thin fabric emphasized rather than concealed them i didnt want to know what else had been pierced i know i didnt because i told myself that very sternly i didnt want to know even if it was hell a little intriguing but wait thats still not all she had a tattoo on the left side of her neck in the shape of a slithering serpent and i could see the barbs and curves of some kind of tribal design flickering out from the neckline of her tank top another design whirling loops and spirals covered the back of her right hand and vanished up under the sleeve of the jacket she watched me with one eyebrow arched waiting for me to react her posture and expression both made the effort to say that she was way too cool to care what i thought but i could practically taste the uncertainty she was working to hide and her anxiety long time no see i said finally hello harry she replied the words came out a little thick and i saw more gold flash near the tip of her tongue of course its odd i said from here it doesnt look like youre in jail at all i know she said she managed to keep her voice mostly steady but her face and throat colored pink in a guilty flush she shifted her weight restlessly and an odd clicking sound came from her mouth good grief shed picked up a tic of rattling her tongue piercing against her teeth when she was nervous urn i should apologize i guess uh she floundered i let her a long silence made her look more flustered but i had no intention of politely helping her out of it mouse sat down between me and molly watching her intently molly smiled at the dog and reached down to pet him mouse tensed up and a low rumbling came from his chest molly moved her hand toward him again and my dogs chest suddenly rumbled with a deep and warning growl the last time mouse had growled at anythingfor that matter made much noise at allit had been a crazed sorcerer who made fair headway toward eviscerating me and summoned a twentyfootlong demon cobra to kill my dog mouse killed it instead then at my command mouse killed the sorcerer too and now he was growling at molly be polite i told him firmly shes a friend mouse gave me a look and then fell quiet again he sat calmly as molly let him sniff her hand and scratch at his ears but his wary body language didnt change when did you get a dog molly asked mouse was spooked though not the way he was when serious bad guys were around interesting i kept my tone neutral couple years ago his name is mouse what breed is he hes a west highlands dogasaurus i said hes huge i said nothing and the girl floundered some more im sorry she said finally i lied to you to get you to come down here really she grimaced im sorry i just i really need your help i just thought that if i could talk to you in person about it you might be i mean i sighed regardless of how intriguingly rounded her tight shirt was she was still a kid call a spade a spade molly i said you figured if you could get me to come all the way down here youd have a chance to flutter your eyelashes and get me to do whatever it is you really want me to do she glanced aside it isnt like that its just like that no she began i didnt want this to be a bad thing you manipulated me you took advantage of my friendship how is that not a bad thing my headache started rising up again give me one reason i shouldnt turn and walk away right now because my friend is in trouble she said i cant help him but you can what friend his name is nelson in jail he didnt do it she assured me they never did hes your age i asked almost i arched an eyebrow two years older she amended then tell legaladult nelson he should call a bail bondsman we tried that they cant get to him before tomorrow then tell him to bite the bullet and spend a night in the lockup or else to call his parents i turned to go molly caught my wrist he cant she said desperation in her voice theres no one for him to call hes an orphan harry i stopped walking well dammit id been an orphan too it hadnt been fun i could tell you some stories but i make it a personal policy not to review them often they amount to a nightmare that started with my fathers death followed by years and years of feeling acutely perpetually alone sure theres a system in place to care for orphans but its far from perfect and it is after all a system it isnt a person looking out for you its forms and carbon copies and people with names you quickly forget the lucky kids more or less randomly get tapped by foster parents who genuinely care but for all the puppies at the pound who dont get chosen life turns into one big lesson on how to look out for yourselfbecause theres no one in this world who cares enough to do it for you its a horrible feeling i dont care to experience even the faded memory of itbut if i just hear the word orphan aloud that empty fear and quiet pain come rushing back from the darker corners of my mind for a long time id been stupid enough to assume that i could handle everything on my own thats vanity though nobody can handle everything by themselves sometimes you need someones helpeven if that help is only giving you a little of their time and attention or bailing you out of jail whats your friend nelson in for reckless endangerment and aggravated assault she took a breath and said its kind of a long story but hes a sweet guy harry there isnt a violent bone in his body which emphasized to me just how young molly really was there are violent bones in everyones body if you look deep enough about two hundred and six of them what about your dad he saves people all the time molly hesitated for a second and her cheeks turned pink urn my parents dont like nelson very much especially my dad ah i said nelsons that kind of friend things started adding up i asked the loaded question why is it so important for him to get out tonight wait for it molly let go of my wrist because he might be in danger the weird kind of danger he needs your help and there it was sometimes its almost as though im psychic chapter nine boyfriend nelson had been arraigned two hours before his bail had been set at enough money to make me glad that over the past year i had made it a habit to keep a chunk of cash around just in case i needed it in a hurry i got the fisheye from a hardfaced office matron as i counted it out in twenties she counted it too thank you i said its a wonderful feeling to be trusted she did not look amused she pushed some papers at me sign here please and here i signed while molly hovered nervously in the background holding mouses leash then we sat down and waited molly fidgeted until they brought her honeybunny out to sign the last couple of papers before being released boyfriend nelson wasnt what id expected he was an inch or two taller than molly he had a long narrow face and i would have hesitated to touch his cheekbones for fear of slicing my fingers on them he was thin but it was that kind of lean whipcord thinness rather than anything that would denote frailty he moved well and i pegged him as a fencer or a martial artist of some other kind dark hair fell around his head in an even mop he wore squareshaped silverrimmed spectacles chinos and a black tshirt with another splattercon logo on it he looked tired and needed a shave the second he was free he hurried over to molly and they hugged speaking quietly to one another i didnt listen in it didnt seem right to invade their privacy besides body language told me enough the hug went on a second or two longer than molly wanted it to then when nelson bent his head down to kiss her she gave him a sweet smile turning her cheek to meet his lips after that he got the point he bit his lower lip a little and stepped back from her rubbing his hands on his pants as if unsure what else to do with them save me from awkward relationship melodrama i muttered to mouse under my breath and got onto a pay phone to call a cab being a learned wizardly type i had of course discovered the cure for tangling up an otherwise orderly life with relationship issues dont have a relationship it was better that way if i repeated it to myself often enough i almost believed it molly and boyfriend nelson walked over to me a minute later nelson didnt look up at me when he offered me his hand uh i guess thank you i shook his hand and squeezed hard enough to hurt a little me annoyed alpha male ungh how could i refuse such a polite and straightforward request for help i took mouses leash from molly who looked away turning pink again i dont want to seem ungrateful nelson said but i have to get moving now no you dont i said his weight had already shifted to move into his first step and he blinked at me excuse me i just got you out of a cage now comes the part where you tell me what happened to you then you can go his eyes narrowed and his weight shifted again centering his balance definitely a student of martial arts are you threatening me im telling you how its going to be kid so talk and if i dont he demanded i shrugged if you dont maybe ill knock your block off id like to see you try he said more anger in his voice suit yourself i said but were in sight of the cop at the entry desk he probably wont see who threw the first punch you just got out on bail youll go back probably for assault committed within two minutes of being freed there isnt a judge in town who would grant you bail again i saw him think about it furiously which impressed me a lot of men his age when angry wouldnt bother with actual thought then he shook his head youre bluffing youd be arrested too hells bells kid i said when did you fall off the turnip truck theyll interview me ill tell them you threw the first punch who do you think theyre going to believe ill be out in an hour nelsons knuckles popped as he clenched his fists he stared at me and then at the building behind him nelson molly urged quietly hes trying to help you hes got a hell of a way of showing it nelson spat just balancing the scales a bit i said glancing at molly then i sighed nelson was holding on to his pride he didnt want to back down in front of molly insecurity thy name is teenager it wouldnt kill me to help nelson save face come on kid give me five minutes to talk to you and ill pay your fare back to wherever youre heading ill throw in some fast food nelsons stomach made a gurgling sound and he licked his lips glancing aside at molly the wary focus slid out of his posture and he nodded brushing his hand back through his hair he let out a long exhale and said sorry just been a bad day i had one of those once i said so talk howd you wind up in jail he shook his head im not sure what actually happened i was in the bathroom i held up my hand interrupting him with the gesture eat your heart out merlin what bathroom where at the convention he said convention i asked splattercon molly offered she waved a hand at her button and at nelsons shirt its a horror movie convention theres a convention for that theres a convention for everything nelson said this one screens horror movies invites in directors specialeffects guys actors authors too there are discussion panels costume contests vendors fans show up to the convention to get together and meet the industry guests that kind of thing uhhuh youre a fan then staff he said im supposed to be in charge of security okay i said get back to the bathroom right he said well id had a lot of coffee and potato chips and pretzels and stuff so i was just sitting in there with the stall door closed what happened i heard someone come in nelson said the door was really squeaky he licked his lips nervously and then he started screaming i arched an eyebrow who clark pell he said he owns the old movie theater next to the hotel we rented it out for the weekend so we could play our favorites on the big screen nice old guy always supports the convention why was he screaming nelson hesitated for a second clearly uncomfortable he you have to understand that i didnt actually see anything sure i said it sounded like a fight scuffling sounds i heard him let out a noise right like someone had startled him he shook his head thats when he started screaming what happened i jumped up to help him but his cheeks turned red you know i was kind of in the middle of something it took me a second to get out of the stall and and mr pell was there he said he was unconscious and bleeding not real bad but he looked like hed taken a real pounding broken nose maybe his jaw too they took him to the hospital i frowned could someone have slipped in or out no nelson said and his voice was confident on that point that damned door all but screams every time it swings could someone have come in at the same time as pell i asked maybe he said on the same opening of the door but i know i said but they would have had to open the door to leave i rubbed at my chin could someone have held the door open the hall was crowded you could hear the people when the door was open nelson said and there was a cop standing right outside he was the first one in in fact i grunted and with no other obvious suspects they blamed you nelson nodded yes i mused for a moment and then said what do you think happened he shook his head several times and very firmly i dont know someone must have gotten in and out somehow maybe theres an air vent or something yeah i said maybe thats it nelson checked his watch and swallowed oh god ive got to get to the airport im supposed to meet darby in thirty minutes and take him to the hotel darby i asked darby crane molly supplied producer and director of horror films guest of honor at splattercon he do any work i might have seen i asked molly nodded maybe did you ever see harvest the one with the scarecrow uh i said thinking where it smashes through the wall of the convent and eats the nuns and the librarian sets it on fire and it burns down the library and himself with it thats the one heh i said not bad but ill take a corman flick any day excuse me nelson said but i really need to get moving as he spoke the cab id called pulled up to the curb i checked and found my shadowy tail still outside patient and motionless mouse let out another almost subaudible growl my shadow wasnt exactly going out of his way not to be noticed which meant that he almost certainly wasnt a hit man a hired gun would do everything he could to stay invisible preferably until several hours after i was cold and dead of course he could be trying reverse psychology i supposed but that kind of circular reasoning could trigger a paranoiagasm and drive me loopy fast odds were good he was just supposed to keep an eye on me whoever he was better then to keep him in sight rather than trying to shake him i was happier knowing where he was than worrying about him being out of sight id play it coolgive him a while to see if i could figure out what he was up to i nodded to myself and strode out to the curb mouse at my side okay kids i called over my shoulder get in the cab mouse and i took the backseat molly didnt give nelson a chance to choose she got into the passenger seat in front and boyfriend nelson settled into the backseat beside me which i asked him ohare i told the driver and we took off for the airport i watched my shadow in vague reflections in the windows the cars lights came on and followed us all the way out to ohare we got nelson there in time to meet his bmovie mogul and he all but leapt from the car molly opened her door to follow him wait i said not you she shot me a glance over her shoulder frowning what nelsons out of jail and hes talked to me about what happened and hes in time to meet darby crane i think i pretty much lived up to what i said i would do she frowned prettily yes so so now its your turn close the door she shook her head harry dont you see that hes in some kind of trouble and he doesnt believe in she glanced at the cabby and back to me you know maybe he is i said maybe not im going to get over to the convention tonight and see if theres anything supernatural about the assault on mr pell right after we get done talking to your parents molly blanched what we had a deal i said and in my judgment molly we need to go see them but she sputtered it isnt as though i need them to bail me out or anything you should have thought about that before you made the deal i said im not going there she said and folded her arms i dont want to i felt cold stone flow into the features of my face into the timbre of my voice miss carpenter is there any doubt in your mindany at all that i could take you there regardless of what you want to do the change in tone hit her hard she blinked at me in surprise for a second lips parted but empty of sound im taking you to see them i said because its the smart thing to do the legal thing to do the right thing to do you agreed to do it and by the stars and stones if you try to weasel out on me i will wrap you in duct tape box you up and send you ups she stared at me in utter shock im not your mom or your dad molly and these days im not a very nice person youve already abused my friendship tonight and diverted my attention from work that could have saved lives people who really need my help might get hurt or die because of this stupid stunt i leaned closer staring coldly and she leaned away declining to make eye contact now buckle the fuck up she did i gave the cabby the address and closed my eyes i hadnt seen michael in nearly two years i regretted that of course not seeing michael meant not seeing charity either which i did not regret and now i was going to drive up in a cab with their daughter charity was going to like that almost as much as i like cleaning up after mouse on our walks in her eyes my mere presence near her daughter would make me guilty of uncounted if imaginary transgressions the angelic sigil on my left palm burned and itched furiously i poked at it through the leather glove but it didnt help id have to keep the glove on if michael saw the sigil or if he somehow sensed the shadow of lasciel running around in my head he might react in a manner similar to his wifesand that didnt take into consideration a fathers desire to protect his physically matured daughter from any wouldbe ah invaders i predicted fireworks of one kind or another fun fun fun should i survive the conversation i would then be off to a horror convention where a supernatural assault might or might not have happened with a mysterious stranger following me while an unknown wouldbe assassin ran around loose somewhere probably practicing his offensive driving skills so that he could polish me off the next time he saw me let the good times roll chapter ten i told the cabby to keep the meter running and headed for the carpenters front door molly remained cool distant and untouchably silent all the way over the small lawn she walked calmly up the steps to the porch she faced the door calmlyand then broke out into a sweat the moment i rang the bell nice to know i wasnt the only one i wasnt looking forward to speaking with michael as long as i kept the conversation brief and didnt get too close to him he might not sense the presence of the demon inside me things might work out my already sore head twinged a little more beside me molly rolled her shoulders in a few jerky motions and pushed at her hair in fitful little gestures she tugged at her welltattered skirts and grimaced at her boots can you see if theres any mud on them i paused to consider her for a second then i said you have two tattoos showing right now and you probably used a fake id to get them your piercings would set off any metal detector worth the name and youre featuring them in parts of your anatomy your parents wish you didnt yet realize you had youre dressed like frankenhooker and your hair has been dyed colors i previously thought existed only in cotton candy i turned to face the door again i wouldnt waste time worrying about a little mud on the boots in the corner of my eye molly swallowed nervously staring at me until the door opened molly shrieked a little girls voice there was a blur of pink cotton pajamas a happy squeal and then molly caught one of her little sisters in her arms in a mutual hug hiya hobbit molly said catching the girl by an ankle and dangling her in the air this elicited screams of delight from the girl molly swung her upright again how have you been daniel is the boss kid now but he isnt as good as you the girl said he yells lots more why is your hair blue hey i said its pink too the girl a goldenhaired moppet of six or seven noticed me for the first time and promptly buried her face against mollys neck you remember hope molly said say hello to mister dresden my name is hobbit the little girl declared boldlythen lowered her face into the curve of mollys neck and hid from me meanwhile the house erupted with thudding feet and more shouts lights started flicking on upstairs and the stairwell shuddered as brothers and sisters pounded down it and ran for the front door another pair of girls made it there first both of them older than hope they both assaulted molly with shrieks and flying hugs bill the smaller of the pair greeted me afterward you came back to visit my name is harry actually i said and i remember you amanda right im amanda she allowed cautiously but we already have a harry thats why youre bill and this is alicia molly said of the other a child as gawky and skinny as molly had been when i first met her her hair was darker than the others trimmed short and she wore blackrimmed glasses over a serious expression shes the next oldest girl you remember mister dresden dont you leech dont call me leech she said in the patient tone of someone who has said something a million times and plans on saying it a million times more hello sir she told me alicia i said nodding evidently the use of her actual name constituted a gesture of partisanship she gave me a somewhat relieved and conspiratorial smile a pair of boys showed up the oldest might have been almost ready to take a drivers test the next was balanced precariously between grade school and pimples both had michaels dark hair and solid sober expression the younger boy almost threw himself at molly upon seeing her but restrained himself to a hello and a hug the older boy only folded his arms and frowned my brother matthew molly said of the younger i nodded at him where have you been the oldest boy said he stood there frowning at molly for a moment nice to see you too daniel she replied you know mister dresden he gave me a nod said to molly im not kidding you just took off do you have any idea of how much it messed things up here mollys mouth firmed into a line you didnt think i was going to just hang around forever did you is it halloween wherever it is you live daniel demanded look at you mom is going to freak out molly stepped forward and half tossed hope into daniels chest when does she do anything else shouldnt these two be in bed daniel grimaced as he caught hope and said thats what i was trying to do before someone interrupted bedtime he took amandas hand and over halfhearted protests took the two youngest girls back into the house there was a creak from the upstairs of the house and alicia thumped matthew firmly with her elbow the two vanished as heavy steps descended from the second floor michael carpenter was almost as tall as me and packed a lot more muscle he had the kind of face that told anyone who looked that he was a man of honesty and kindness who nonetheless could probably kick the crap out of you if you offered him violence i wasnt sure how he managed that something about the strength of his jawline maybe bespoke the steady power of both body and mind but as for the kindness that went all the way down to his soul you could see it in the warmth of his grey eyes he wore khaki pants and a light blue tshirt a hardcased plastic cylinder doubtless the one he used to transport his sword hung from a strap over one shoulder an overnight bag hung over the other and his hair was damp from the shower he came down the stairs at the pace of a man with places to beuntil he looked up and saw molly and me standing in the doorway he froze in place a smile of surprised delight illuminating his face as he saw molly the overnight bag thumped to the floor as he strode forward and crushed his oldest daughter to his chest in a hug daddy she protested hush he told her let me hug you her eyes flickered to the case still held against one shoulder and her expression became tainted with a sudden worry when are you going you just caught me he said im glad she hugged her father back and closed her eyes its just a visit she said he rose from the hug a moment later studying her face worry in his eyes then he nodded smiled and said im glad anyway he jerked his head back a moment later as if the rest of her appearance had only then registered on him and his eyes widened margaret katherine amanda carpenter he said his voice hushed gods blood what have you done to your he looked her up and down gentle dismay on his face your self i suggested yourself yourself michael sighed he looked molly up and down again she was doing that thing where she tried to display how much she didnt care what her daddy thought of her look and it was almost painfully obvious that she cared a great deal tattoos the hair wasnt so bad but he shook his head and offered me his hand tell me harry am i just too old i didnt want to shake michaels hand lasciels presence in me even if it wasnt the fullblown version wasnt something he would missnot if he made actual physical contact with me for a couple of years i had been avoiding him with every excuse i had hoping i could take care of my little demon issue without bothering him about it more accurately i supposed i had been too ashamed to let him see what had happened michael was probably the most honest decent human being i had ever had the privilege to know he had always thought well of me it had been something that had given me comfort in a low spot or two and i hated the thought of losing his trust and friendship lasciels presence the collaboration of a literal fallen angel would destroy that but friendship isnt a oneway street i had brought his daughter back because i had thought it was the right thing to doand because i thought hed do the same for someone else in a similar circumstance i respected him enough to do that and i respected him too much to lie to him i had avoided the confrontation long enough i shook his hand and nothing in his manner or expression changed not an ounce he hadnt sensed lasciels presence or mark well he asked smiling if you think she looks silly youre too old i said after a moment im moderately ancient by the standards of the younger generation and i think she only looks a little over the top molly rolled her eyes at us both her cheeks pink i suppose a good christian should be willing to turn the other cheek when it comes to matters of fashion michael said let he who hath never stonewashed his jeans cast the first stone i said nodding michael laughed and gripped my shoulder briefly its good to see you harry and you i said trying a smile i glanced at the plastic case on his shoulder business trip yes he said where to he smiled ill know when i get there i shook my head michael was entrusted to wield one of the blades of the knights of the cross he was one of only two men in the world who were entrusted with such potent weapons against dark powers as such he had a lot of planet to cover i wasnt clear exactly how his itinerary was established but he was often called away from his home and family apparently summoned to where his strength was most needed i dont go in big for religionbut i believe in the almighty i had seen a vast power at work supporting michaels actions coincidence seemed to go to insane lengths at times to make sure he was where he needed to be to help someone in trouble i had seen that power strike down seriously twisted foes without michael so much as raising his voice that power that faith had carried him through dangers and battles he had no business surviving much less winning but i hadnt ever thought too much about how hard it must be for him to leave his home when the archangels or god or whoever sent up a flare and called him off to a crisis i glanced aside at molly she was smiling but i could see the strain and worry beneath the surface hard on his family too havent you left called a womans voice from upstairs the house creaked again and michaels wife appeared at the top of the stairway saying youll be her voice cut off suddenly i hadnt ever seen charity in a red silk kimono before like michael her hair was damp from the shower even wet it still looked blond charity had nice legs clearly defined muscles in her calves shifting as she stepped to the head of the stairs and what i could see of the rest of her looked much the samestrong fit healthy she bore a sleeping child on one hipmy namesake harry the youngest of the bunch his arms and legs splayed in perfect relaxation and his head was pillowed on her shoulder his cheeks were pink with that look very young children get while sleeping blue eyes widened in utter surprise and for just a moment she froze staring at molly she opened her mouth for a second words hesitating on her tongue then her eyes shifted to me and surprise fell to recognition which was followed by a melange of anger worry and fear she clutched her kimono a little more tightly to her her mouth working for a second more then said excuse me for a moment she vanished and reappeared a moment later sans little harry this time covered in a long terrycloth bathrobe her feet inside fuzzy slippers molly she said quietly and came down the stairs the girl averted her eyes mother and the wizard she said her mouth hardening into a line of course hes here she titled her head to one side her expression hardening further is this who youve been with molly the air pressure in the room quadrupled and mollys face darkened from pink to scarlet so what if it is she demanded defiance making the words ring thats no business of yours i opened my mouth to assure charity that i had nothing to do with anything not that it would actually alter the nature of the conversation but michael glanced at me and shook his head i zipped my lips and awaited developments wrong charity said her stance belligerent and unyielding you are a child and i am your mother it is precisely my business but its my life molly replied which you clearly lack the discipline and intelligence to manage here we go again molly said go go gadget control freak do not take that tone of voice with me young lady young lady molly singsonged back in a nasal impersonation of her mothers voice her fists now on her hips whats the point stupid of me to think that you might actually be willing to talk with me instead of telling me how to live every second of my life i fail to see the error in that when you clearly have no idea what youre doing young lady look at you you look like like a savage my mouth went off on reflex ah yes a savage of the famous chromotonsorial cahokian goth tribe michael winced the look charity turned on me could have withered the life from small animals and turned potted flowers black excuse me mister dresden she said words clipped i do not recall speaking to you beg pardon i said and gave her my sweetest smile dont mind me just thinking out loud molly turned to glare at me too but hers was a pale imitation of her mothers i do not need you to defend me charitys attention shifted back to her daughter you will not speak to an adult in that tone of voice so long as you are in this house young lady not a problem molly shot back and then she whirled on her heel and opened the door michael put his hand out not with any particular effort and the door slammed shut again with a sharp booming impact sudden silence fell over the carpenter household both molly and charity stared at michael with expressions of utter shock michael took a deep breath and then said ladies i try not to involve myself in these discussions but obviously your conversation this evening is unlikely to resolve the differences youve had he looked at them in turn and his voice while still gentle became something more immovable than a mountains bones i dont have any feeling that my trip will be an extended one he said but we never know what he has planned for us or how much time is left to any of us this house has been upset long enough the strife is hurting everyone find a way to resolve your troubles before i return but molly began molly michael said his tone of voice inexorable she is your mother she deserves your respect and courtesy you will give them to her for the length of a conversation molly set her jaw but looked away from her father he stared at her for a moment until she gave him a brief nod thank you he said i want you both to make an effort to set the anger aside and talk by god ladies i will not go forth to answer the call only to come home to more conflict and strife i get enough of that while im gone charity stared at him for a second longer and then said but michael surely you arent going to leave now not when she gestured vaguely at me there will be trouble michael stepped over to his wife and kissed her gently then he said faith my love she closed her eyes and looked away from him after the kiss are you sure im needed he said with quiet certainty he touched her face with one hand and said harry would you walk me to the car i did thank you i said once we were outside im glad to get out of there tension knife michael nodded its been a long year what happened to them i asked michael tossed his case and his bag into the back of his white pickup truck molly was arrested possession i blinked at him she was possessed he sighed and looked at me possession marijuana and ecstasy she was at a party and the police raided it she was caught holding them wow i said my voice subdued what happened community service he said we talked about it she was clearly repentant i thought that the humiliation and the sentence of the law were enough to settle matters but charity thought we were being too gentle she tried to restrict which people molly was allowed to spend time with i winced ah i think i can see how this played out michael nodded got into his truck and leaned on the open window looking up at me yes both of them are proud and stubborn friction rose until it exploded this spring molly left home dropped out of school its been difficult i can see that i said and sighed maybe you should pitch in with charity maybe the two of you could sit on her until she gets back on the straight and narrow michael smiled a little shes charitys daughter a hundred parents sitting on her couldnt make her surrender he shook his head a parents authority can only go so far molly has to start thinking and choosing for herself at this point twisting her arm until she cries uncle isnt going to help her do that doesnt seem like charity agrees with you i said michael nodded she loves molly very much shes terrified of the kinds of things that could happen to her little girl he glanced at the house which brings me to a question for you yeah is there some kind of dangerous situation developing i chewed on my lip and then nodded it seems probable but i dont have anything specific yet is my daughter involved in it not to my knowledge i told him her boyfriend got arrested tonight she talked me into bailing him out michaels eyes narrowed a little but then he caught himself and i saw him force the angry expression from his face i see how in the world did you get her to come here it was what i charged for my help i said she tried to back out but i convinced her not to michael grunted you threatened her politely i said id never hurt her i know that michael said his tone gently reproving behind us the front door opened molly stepped out onto the porch hugging herself with her arms she stood that way for a moment ignoring us a few seconds later a light on the second floor came on charity presumably had gone back upstairs michael watched his daughter for a moment pain in his eyes then he took a deep breath and said may i ask a favor of you yes talk to her michael said she likes you respects you a few words from you might do more than anything i could tell her right now whoa i said i dont know you dont have to negotiate a treaty michael said smiling just ask her to talk to her mother to be willing to give a little compromise has to work both ways i said what about charity shell come around am i the only one who has noticed that charity really doesnt regard me with what most of the world thinks of as fairness or fondness i am the last person in the world likely to get her to sit down for a reconciliation talk he smiled have a little faith oh please i sighed but there wasnt any real feeling behind it will you try to help michael asked i scowled at him yes he smiled at me mostly in his eyes thank you im sorry you walked into the cross fire tonight molly told me there had been trouble at home bringing her here seemed like the right thing to do i appreciate it michael frowned his eyes distant for a moment then said ive got to get moving sure i said he met my eyes and said if something arises will you keep an eye on them for me it would make me feel a lot better to know you were watching over them until i return i glanced back at his house what happened to having faith he smiled seems a bit lazy to expect the lord to do all the work doesnt it his expression grew serious again besides i do have faith harry in himand in you demoninfested me writhed in uncomfortable guilt on the inside ill keep an eye on them of course thank you michael said and put the truck in gear when i get back i need to talk business with you if you have the time i nodded sure good hunting god be with you he replied with a deep nod and then he pulled out and left have sword will travel hiyo silver away get molly and charity to sit down and talk things out right i had about as much chance to do that as i did of backpacking my car to the top of mount rushmore i was gloomily certain that even if i did manage to get them together it would only make things go more spectacularly wrong once they were there the whole house would probably go up in an explosion when mother met antimother no good could come of this one why in the world had i agreed to it because michael was my friend and because i was in general too stupid to turn down people in need and maybe because of something more michaels house had always been fulll of hectic life but it had been a place in general of talk and warmth and laughter and good food the ugly shouts and snarls of molly and charitys quarrel had stained the place they didnt belong there i had never had a home like that growing up even now that thomas and i had found one another when i thought of a family i thought of the carpenter household i had never had that kind of intimacy closeness those who have such a family seldom realize how rare and precious it is it was something worth preserving i wanted to help and michael had a point i might have a chance to get through to molly that was only half the battle so to speak but it was probably more than he could manage from his own position but whatever higher power arranged these things had a demented sense of timing given how much i had on my plate already hells bells molly came over to me after michaels truck had vanished she stood beside me in the quiet summer evening silent i guess you need a ride back to your place i said i dont have any money she replied quietly okay i said where do you need to go the convention she replied i have friends there a room for the weekend she glanced over her shoulder at the house the rug rats seemed glad to see you i observed she smiled fleetingly and her voice warmed i didnt realize how much i missed them dumb little jawas i thought about nudging her toward her mother for a second and decided against it she might decide to do it if she wasnt pressured but the second she thought i was trying to force her into something shed dig in her heels so all i said was theyre cute kids yes she replied quietly im heading for the convention anyway i told her get in the cab thank you she said youre welcome i said chapter eleven when people say the word convention they are usually referring to large gatherings of the employees of companies and corporations who attend a mass assembly usually in a big hotel somewhere for the purpose of pretending to learn stuff when they are in fact enjoying a free trip somewhere time off work and the opportunity to flirt with strangers drink and otherwise indulge themselves the first major difference between a business convention and a fandom convention is that fandom doesnt bother with the pretenses theyre just there to have a good time the second difference is the dress code the ensembles at a fan convention tend to be considerably more novel splattercon apparently the name of the con was misspelled if the three exclamation points were left out had populated the hotel with all kinds of costumed fans unless maybe the costumes were actually clothing trends once in a while it gets hard to tell makebelieve and avantgarde fashion apart the hotel had an entry atrium which in turn branched off into a pair of long wide hallways leading to combination ball and dining rooms the ones with those long folding partitions that can be used to break the larger rooms up into smaller halls for seminars and talk panels and so on there were a couple hundred people in sight and i could see more entering and leaving various panel rooms i kind of expected a few more people to be here i said to molly i had stopped at my apartment to grab my stuff and drop off mouse its thursday night she said as if that should be significant and its getting late at least for a weeknight we have more than three thousand people already registered is that a lot for a firstyear convention its a mongol horde there was pride in her voice as she spoke and we have a really young staff to boot but old hands at putting conventions together she went on like that for a few moments naming names and citing their experience as though she expected me to whip out a licensing manual or something to make sure the convention was up to code two girls both too young for me to think adult thoughts about sidled by in blackandpurple clothing and makeup that left a lot of skin bare their faces painted pale trickles of fake blood at the corners of their mouths one of them smiled at me and she had fangs i had my hand on my staff and the harsh clear scent of wood smoke filled my nose before i stopped myself from unleashing an instant violent and noisily pyrotechnic assault upon the vampire five feet from me a seconds study showed irregular lumps and finger marks on the teeththe girls had probably made them with their own fingers from craft plastic i let out my breath in a steady exhalation and relaxed again releasing the power id begun to channel through my staff relax harry hells bells that would be a great story for the papers professional wizard incinerates amateur vampire news at ten the two girls went on by none the wiser and even molly only frowned at them and then back at me for a second her face tilted into an expression of silent inquiry i shook my head sorry sorry been a long day already look i need to get a look at the bathroom where this theater owner was attacked all right molly said but first well get you a name tag at registration we will i asked why because youre not supposed to have access to the convention if you havent registered for it she said con security and hotel security might get confused it would be inconvenient for you right i said good thinking im not sure how id react to inconvenience i followed her over to a set of tables set up to receive dozens or hundreds of people at once each designated with white paper signs marked with ad ej and so on down the alphabet a tiredlooking brownhaired woman of early middle age sat behind the first table doing some kind of paperwork molly she said and her voice warmed with tired but genuine pleasure who is your friend harry dresden molly said this is sandra marling shes the convention chair youre a horror fan sandra marling asked me my life is all about horror these days you should find plenty here to entertain you she assured me were showing movies in several rooms as well as in the theater and theres the vendors room and some autograph signings tomorrow and of course there are several parties active already and the costume contests are always fun to watch isnt that something i said and tried not to drown in my enthusiasm sandy molly said stepping in i want to use my freebie for harry here sandra nodded oh rosanna was looking for you a few minutes ago have you spoken to her yet not since this afternoon molly said and fretted at her lower lip did she remember to take her vitamins rest easy girl i reminded her for you molly looked visibly relieved thank you sandra meanwhile had me filling out a registration form which i scribbled through fairly quickly at the end she passed me a plastic badge folded around a card that said splattercon hi im she gave me a black ink marker to go with it and said sorry the printers been offline all day just write your name in i promptly wrote the words an innocent bystander onto the name tag before folding it up in the plastic badge and pinning it to my shirt i hope you enjoy splattercon harry sandra said i picked up a schedule and glanced at it make your own blood and custom fangs at ten am to be followed by how to scream like a pro i dont see how i can avoid being entertained molly gave me a level look as we walked away you dont have to make fun of it actually i do i said i make fun of almost everything its mean she said sandra has poured her whole life into this convention for a year and i dont want to see her feelings hurt where do you know her from i asked not church i guess molly looked at me obliquely for a second and then said shes a parttime volunteer at one of the shelters where im doing community service she helped nelson out when he was younger rosie too and her boyfriend i lifted a hand in acquiescence fine fine ill play nice thank you she said her voice still prim its very adult of you i started to get annoyed but was struck by the disturbing thought that if i did i would be coming down on the same side of the situation as charity which might be one of the signs of the apocalypse molly led me down to the end of one of the long conference room hallways where there were the usual restroom doors one of them had been marked over with three bars of police tape shutting it and a uniformed cop sat in a chair beside the door the cop was a large black man grey in his hair at the temples and he sat with the chair leaned on its rear two legs so that his head rested back against the wall he had on his uniform but had added on a splattercon name tag he had filled in the name on the card with a marker too though his blocky script under the hi im read an authority figure the uniform name stripe on his shirt read rawlins well now the cop said as i walked over to him he opened his mostly closed eyes and gave me a wary smile he read my name tag and snorted its the consultant guy thinks hes a wizard rawlins i said smiling and offered him my hand he took it his grip lazily strong so youre one of those horror movie fans huh he rumbled um yes i said he snorted again i was sort of hoping i could get into the bathroom there rawlins pursed his lips theres two more on this floor ones back near the front desk and theres another at the end of the other conference hall i like this one i said rawlins squinted at me and said maybe you cant read so good you see that tape there says crime scene and such the bright yellow and black stuff i asked thats it exactly yep well thats what we police use when we have a crime scene and we dont want nosy private investigators stomping all over it in their big boots and contaminating everything he drawled what if i promise to walk on tippy toe then i promise i will stop bouncing you off walls just as soon as i think youre not resisting arrest he said in a cheerful tone the smile faded a little and his eyes hardened its a crime scene no molly i said quietly would you mind if i talked to the officer alone sure she said there are things i need to handle anyway excuse me she walked away without looking back do you mind talking about it i asked rawlins naw he said look you seem okay dresden ill talk but im not letting you in there why not i asked because it might make things harder on the kid we took in for it i frowned and tilted my head yeah rawlins nodded kid didnt do it he said but hotel security cameras show him going in there then the victim and no one else and i was sitting right here in this spot the whole time im sure no one else went in or out so how do you know the kid didnt attack the old man i asked rawlins gave an easy shrug didnt fit him he wasnt breathing hard and giving a beating runs you out of breath quick no damage to his hands or knuckles no blood on him so whyd you arrest him i asked because the record shows that theres no one else who could have done it rawlins said and because the old man was too out of it to talk and clear him kid didnt beat on the old man but that doesnt mean that he wasnt in with whoever did i figured maybe he knows how the attacker got in and out unseen so i took him down and booked him i figured if he was an accomplice hed spill rather than take the whole fall himself rawlins grimaced but he didnt spill didnt know a damn thing then whyd he get put away i asked didnt know he had a record until the paperwork was already going repeat offender got a real steep hill to climb as a suspect makes it look bad for him he might take the fall on this even if hes innocent i shook my head youre sure no one could have gone in or out i was right here he said anyone went past me without me noticing they were a jedi knight or something or something i muttered glancing at the door the girlfriend rawlins said nodding after the departed molly she get you involved in this daughter of a friend i said nodding bailed him out rawlins grunted damn shame for that kid i played it by the book but he shook his head sometimes the book dont do enough the girl thinks hes innocent i said the girl always thinks theyre innocent dresden rawlins said without malice problem is that theres pretty good evidence that says he aint good enough to send a repeat offender upstate unless the lab guys find something in there or on the old man to clear him which brings us back to why you aint going in i nodded frowning what if i told you it might be something weird he shrugged what if you did might be something that i could recognize if i could just get a look at the room i might be able to help the kid he squinted at me you think theres spooky afoot i told the girl id look into it rawlins frowned but then shook his head cant let you in there could i just look i asked you open the door and i dont even go in i just look that couldnt hurt anything could it and youve already been in there the emts maybe a detective am i right i couldnt contaminate it all that much just from looking in the door rawlins gave me a long level stare and then sighed he grunted and the front legs of his chair thunked down to the floor he rose and said all right not one step inside youre an officer and a gentleman i told him i used my elbow to nudge the restroom door open it squealed ferociously i leaned my head in my chin just over the level of the top strip of tape and looked around the bathroom standard stuff a bathroom white tile stalls urinals sinks a long mirror the blood wasnt standard of course there was a large splotch of it on the floor and it had been smeared around when it had been making the tile all slippery there were a couple of different footmarks on the floor outlined in blood and more smears of it on one of the sinks where the victim had apparently tried to pull himself up off the floor it looked fairly gruesome which wasnt really a surprise there wasnt as much blood as there would have been at say a murder but there was plenty all the same someone had laid into clark pell the victim with a will i picked out small blood splatter on the mirror high on the wall and in a spot on the ceiling jesus i muttered it was an unarmed assault no knives or anything rawlins grunted old man had broken ribs bruises gashes from being slammed around no cuts or stabs though no kid did this i said wasnt a professional either crowded spot like this witness in the bathroom cop twenty feet away dumbest thug in chicago wouldnt open up that big a can of whoopass where hed be seen and caught someone strong i muttered and really really vicious he had to have hit the old guy a few times after he went down rawlins grunted again sound like anyone you know i shook my head i stared at the room for a second and then chewed on my lower lip for a second coming to a decision i closed my eyes clearing my thoughts thats enough rawlins said shut the door before people start to stare one second i murmured then with an effort of focus and will and a faint sense of illusory pressure on my forehead i opened my wizards sight the sight is something anyone born with enough talent has its an extra sense though when using it almost everyone experiences it as a kind of augmented vision it shows you the primal nature of things the true and emotional core of what they are it also shows you the presence of magical energies that course through pretty much everything on the planet showing you how that energy flowed and pulsed and swirled through the world the sight was especially useful for looking for any active magical constructs thats spells for the newbieand for cutting through illusions and spells meant to obfuscate what was true i opened my sight and it showed me what my physical eyes could not see about the room it showed me something that with as many bad things as i had seen in my life still made me clench my fists and fight to keep from losing control of my stomach the site of the attack the blood the brutality and pain inflicted upon the victim had not been a simple matter of desire conflict and violence it had been a deliberate gleeful work of art i could see patterns in the bloodstain patterns that showed me the terrified face of an old man pounded into a lumpy unrecognizable mass by sledgehammer fists each one a miniature portrait painted in the medium of terror and pain when i looked at the smears on the sink i could hear a short series of grunts meant to be desperate cries for help and then the old man was hurled back down for another round of splatter portraits of pain and just for a second i saw a shadow on the walla brief glimpse a form a shape something that left an outline of itself on the wall where it had absorbed the agonized energy of the old mans suffering i fought to push the sight away from my perceptions again and staggered that was the drawback to using the sight the sight could show you a lot of things but everything you saw with it was there to stay it wrote everything you perceived with it upon your memory in indelible ink and those memories were always there fresh and harsh when you went back to them never blurring with the passage of time never growing easier to endure the little demonic diorama of bad vibes painted over the white tiles of that bathroom was going to make some appearances in my darker dreams it looked like id found the black magic the gatekeeper warned me about just as well that i hadnt tried the dangerous spell with little chicago i took a couple of steps away shaking away the flickers of color and sparkles of light on my vision that remained for a time when the sight was gone once more rawlins had a hand under one of my elbows you all right man he rumbled a moment later his voice very quiet yeah i said yeah thanks he looked from me to the closed door and back what did you see in there im not sure yet i said my voice sounded shaky something bad almost too quietly to be heard he said this wasnt just some thug was it my stomach twisted again in my minds eye i could see a malicious smile reflected in the eyes of the old man the memory absolutely crystalline maybe not i mumbled it could have been a person i think someone really sick or maybe not i dont know more words struggled to bubble out of my mouth and i clamped my lips resolutely shut until id gotten my thoughts back under control i looked around me and realized that the hairs on the back of my neck were not crawling around at the memory of the energy id just brushed they were reacting to more of it drifting through the air now nearby rawlins i said how many other cops are here just me now he said quietly he took a look at my face and then peered around his heavylidded eyes deceptively alert his hand on his gun we got trouble we got trouble i said quietly shifting my staff into my right hand the lights went out all of them at once plunging the hotel into pure blackness and the screaming started chapter twelve no more than two or three seconds went by before rawlins had his flashlight out and he flicked it on the light flashed white and clean for maybe half a second and then it dimmed down as though some kind of greasy soot had coated it until the light though still bright was so vague and veiled that it accomplished little more than to cast a faint glow to maybe an arms length from rawlins what the hell he said and shook the light a few times he had his hand on his gun the restraining strap off but he hadnt drawn it yet good man he knew as well as i did that the hotel was going to have far more panicked attendees than potential threats well try mine i said and got the silver pentacle on its chain from around my neck a gentle whisper and an effort of will and the amulet began to emit a pure silverblue light that reached into the darkness around us burning it away as swiftly as it pressed in until we could see for maybe fifteen feet around us beyond that was just a murky vagueness not so much a cloud or a mist as a simple lack of light i gripped my staff in my right hand and more of my will thrummed through it setting the winding spirals of runes and sigils along its length to burning with a gentle ember orange light rawlins stared at me for a second and then said what the hell is going on there were running footsteps and shouts and cries in the gloom all of them sounded choked muffled somehow one of the two teenaged vampires stumbled into the circle of my azure wizards light sobbing several young men blundered along a moment later blindly and all but trampled her rawlins grabbed the girl with a grunt of excuse me miss and hauled her from their path he lifted her more or less by main strength and pushed her gently against the wall he forced her to look at him and said follow the wall that way to the door stay close to the wall until you get out she nodded tears making her makeup run in a mascara mudslide and stumbled off following rawlins directions fire rawlins blurted turning back to me is this smoke no i said believe me i know burning buildings he gave me an odd look grabbed an older woman who was passing blindly and sent her off to follow the wall to the door out he shivered then and when he exhaled his breath came out in a long frosty plume the temperature had dropped maybe forty degrees in the space of a minute i struggled to ignore the sounds of frightened people in the dark and focused on my magical senses i reached out to the cold and the gloom and found it a vaguely familiar kind of spellworking though i couldnt remember precisely where id encountered it before i spun in a slow circle with my eyes closed and felt the murk grow deeper darker as i faced back down the hall to the hotels front desk i took a step that way and the murk thickened marginally the spells source had to be that way i gritted my teeth and started forward hey rawlins said where are you going our bad guy is this way i said or something is maybe youd better stay here help get these people outside safely maybe you ought to shut your fool mouth rawlins replied his tone one of forced cheer he looked scared but he drew his gun and kept the barrel down close to his side and held his mostly useless flashlight in his other hand ill cover you i nodded once at him turned and plunged into the darkness rawlins at my back screams erupted around us sometimes accompanied by the sight of stumbling terrified people rawlins nudged them toward the walls barked at them in a tone of pure paternal authority to stay near them to move carefully for the exits the gloom began to press in closer to me and it became an effort of will to hold up the light in my amulet against it a few steps more and the air grew even colder walking forward became an effort like wading through waistdeep water i had to lean against it and i heard a grunt of effort come out of my mouth whats wrong rawlins asked his voice tight we passed under one of the hotels emergency light fixtures its floodlights only dim orange rings in the murk until my amulets light burned the shadows away dark magic i growled through clenched teeth a kind of ward trying to keep me from moving ahead he huffed out a breath and muttered christ magic that isnt real i stopped and gave him a steady look over my shoulder are you with me or not he swallowed staring up at the dim circles of light that were all he could see of another set of emergency lights crap he muttered wiping a sudden beading of sweat from his brow despite the cold air you need me to push you or something i let out a bark of tense laughter and forced my power harder against the gloomy ward hacking at it with the machete of my will until i began to chop a path through the dark working picking up speed as i did the sense of the spell became more clear to me its coming from up ahead of us i said the first conference room in this hall they got it set up for movies rawlins said he seized a sobbing and terrified man in his middle years and deflected him bodily to the wall snapping the same orders to him god it was packed in there if the crowd panicked he didnt finish the sentence and he didnt need to chicago has seen more than a few deaths due to a sudden panic in a movie theater i redoubled my efforts and broke into a heavy labored jog that led us to a pair of doors leading into the first conference room one of the doors was shut and the other had been slammed open so hard that it had wrenched its way clear of one of the hinges from inside the room came a sudden burst of terrified screamsnot the canned screams you get in horror movies real screams screams of such base feral intensity that you could hardly tell they had come from a human throat screams you only really hear when there are terrible things happening rawlins knew what they meant he spat out a low curse lifting his gun to a ready position and we rushed forward to the room side by side the murk began to do more than simply drag at me when i hit the doorway the air almost seemed to congeal into a kind of gelatin and it suddenly became a fight to keep my legs moving forward i snarled in sudden frustration and transformed it into more will that i sent coursing down through my silver pentacle amulet the soft radiance emanating from the symbol became a whiteandcobalt floodlight driving back the gloom burning it from my path it left the large room still coated in shadow but it was no longer the total occlusion of the magical murk it was a long room about sixty feet maybe half that wide at the far end of the room was a very large projection screen chairs faced it in two columns at one point in the aisle between them a projector sat running at such a frantic speed that smoke was rising from the reels of celluloid the projected movie still appeared clearly on the screen in a frantic fastmotion blur of faces and images from a classic horror film from the early eighties the soundtrack could only be heard as a single long piercing howl there were still about twenty people in the room immediately beside the door was an old woman curled on her side on the ground sobbing in pain nearby a wheelchair lay overturned and a man with braces of some kind on his legs and hips had fallen into an awkward painfullooking sprawl from which he could not arise one of his arms was visibly broken bone pushing at skin other people cringed against the walls and beneath chairs when my wizard light flooded the place they got up and started staggering away still screaming in horror straight ahead of me were bodies and blood i couldnt see much of them three people were down there was a lot of blood around a fourth person a young woman crawled toward the door making frantic mewling sounds a man stood over her he was nearly seven feet tall and so thick with slabs of muscle that he almost seemed deformednot pretty bodybuilder muscle either but the thick dull slabs that come from endless physical labor he wore overalls a blue shirt and a hockey mask and there was a long curved sickle in his right hand as i watched he took a pair of long steps forward seized the whimpering girl by her hair and jerked her body into a backward bow he raised the sickle in his right hand rawlins didnt bother to offer him a chance to surrender he took a stance not ten feet away aimed and put three shots into the masked maniacs head the man jerked twisting a bit and released the girls hair abruptly tossing her aside with a terrible casual strength she hit a row of chairs and let out a cry of pain then the maniac turned toward rawlins and even though the mask hid his features the tilt of his head and the tension of his posture showed that he was furious he went toward rawlins the cop shot him four more times flashes of bright white burning the image of the maniac and the room onto my eyes he brought the sickle down on rawlins the cop managed to catch the force of it upon his long flashlight sparks flew from the steel case but the light held the maniac twisted the sickle so that the tip plowed a furrow across rawlinss forearm the cop snarled the flashlight spun to the ground the maniac raised the sickle again i braced myself raised my staff and my will and cried forzare unseen power lashed from my staff pure kinetic energy that ripped through the air and hit the maniac like a wrecking ball the blow drove him back down the aisle through the air he hit the projector on its stand it shattered he went through it without slowing down he kept going the flight of his passage tearing through the large projection screen and hit the back wall with a thunderous impact i sagged in sudden exhaustion the effort of the spell an enormous drain on me and had to plant my staff on the ground to keep from falling over my headache flared up with a vengeance and the light of my amulet and staff both faded there were a few more screams the quick light sound of frightened feet and i whirled i saw someone flee the room from the corner of my eye but i didnt get much of a look at them a second later the room returned to normal the lights back the broken projector still spinning one reel at reduced speed a loose tongue of film slapslapslapping the broken casing rawlins advanced gun still out his eyes very wide down to the far end of the room he went past the screen and looked behind it gun in firing position he looked around for a second then back at me his expression baffled hes not here rawlins said did you see him go that way i just didnt have enough left in me to speak right at that moment i shook my head theres a dent in the wall he reported covered in i dunno what some kind of slime hes gone i grunted then i started forward toward the downed people two of them were young men the third a young woman help me rawlins holstered his weapon and did one of the young men was dead there was a crescentshaped cut in his thigh that had opened an artery another lay mercifully unconscious a bruise on his head several hideous inches of bloody innards protruding from a slash across his belly i was afraid that if we moved him his guts might come popping out the girl was alive but the sickles tip had drawn a pair of long lines down her back along the spine and the cuts had been vicious and deep bits of bone showed and she lay on her belly her eyes open and blinking but utterly unfocused either unwilling or unable to move we did what we could for them which wasnt much more than jerking the tablecloths off the water tables in the corner and improvising soft pads out of them to apply to open wounds the second girl lay on her side nearby sobbing hysterically i checked on the old woman who had just had the wind knocked out of her i hauled the guy whod fallen from his wheelchair into a slightly more comfortable position and he nodded thanks at me see to the other victim rawlins said he held the pad against the boys opened abdomen putting gentle pressure on it as he jerked out his radio it squealed with feedback and static when he used it but he managed to get emergency help headed our way i went to the sobbing girl a tiny little brunette wearing much the same clothes as molly had been shed been bruised up pretty well and from the way she lay on the floor she could evidently not move without feeling agony i went to her and felt over her left shoulder gently be still i told her quietly its your collarbone i think i know it hurts like hell but youre going to be all right it hurts it hurts hurts hurts hurts she panted i found her hand with mine and squeezed tight she returned it with a desperate pressure youll be all right i told her dont leave me she whimpered her hand was all but crushing mine dont leave its all right i said im right here what the hell is this rawlins said panting he looked around him at the corpse at the movie screen at the dent in the wall beyond that was the reaper the freaking reaper from the suburban slasher films what kind of psycho dresses up as the reaper and starts his face twisted in sudden nausea what the hell is this rawlins i said in a sharp voice to get his attention his frightened eyes darted to me call murphy i told him he stared at me blankly for a second then said my captain is the one who has to make the call on that one hell decide up to you i said but murphy and her boys might actually be able to do something with this your captain cant i nodded at the corpse and we arent playing for pennies here rawlins looked at me then at the dead boy then he nodded once and picked up his radio again hurts the girl whimpered breathless with pain hurts hurts hurts i held her hand i patted it awkwardly with my gloved left hand while we heard sirens approach my god rawlins said again he shook his head my god dresden what happened here i stared at the enormous rip in the movie screen and at the reapershaped dent in the wooden panels of the wall behind it clear gelatin the physical form of ectoplasm the matter of the spirit world gleamed there against the broken wood in minutes it would evaporate and there would be nothing left behind my god rawlins whispered again his voice still stunned what happened here yeah good question chapter thirteen the authorities arrived and replaced crisis with aftermath the emts rushed the more badly injured girl and the eviscerated young man to an emergency room while police officers who arrived on the scene did what they could to take care of the other injured attendees until more medical teams could show up i stayed with the injured girl holding her hand one of the emts had examined her briefly saw that though in considerable pain she was not in immediate danger and ordered me to stay with her and keep anyone from moving her until the next team could arrive that suited me fine the thought of standing up again was daunting i sat with the girl as more police arrived she had become quiet and listless as her fear faded and her body produced endorphins to dull the pain i heard a gasp and the sudden sound of pounding feet i looked up to see molly slip by a patrolman and fling herself down beside the girl rosie she cried her face very pale oh my god easy easy i told her putting a hand against mollys shoulder to prevent her from embracing the wounded girl dont jostle her shes hurt molly protested why havent they put her in an ambulance shes not in immediate danger i said two other people were the ambulance took them first she goes on the next one what happened molly asked i shook my head im not sure yet i didnt see much of it they were attacked the girl on the floor suddenly stirred and opened her eyes molly she said im here rosie molly said she touched the injured girls cheek im right here my god the girl said tears welled from her eyes he killed them he killed them her breathing began to come faster building toward panic shhhhhhh molly said and stroked rosies hair back from her forehead as one might a frightened child youre safe now its all right the baby rosie said she slid her hand from mine and laid it over her belly is the baby all right molly bit her lip and looked at me shes pregnant i asked three months molly confirmed she just found out the baby rosie said will the baby be all right theyre going to do everything possible to make sure that youre both all right i said immediately try not to worry about it too much rosie closed her eyes tears still streaming all right rosie molly asked can you tell me what happened im not sure she whispered i was sitting with ken and drea wed already seen our favorite scene in the movie and we decided to go i was bending over to get my purse and drea was checking her makeup and then the lights went out and she started screaming and then when i could see again he was there she shuddered he was there who molly pressed rosies eyes opened too wide showing white all around her voice dropped to a whisper the reaper molly frowned like in the movie someone in a costume it couldnt be rosie said her trembling growing more pronounced it was him it was really him the next medical team arrived and headed right for us rosie seemed to be on the verge of another panic attack when she saw them and started thrashing around molly leaned in close whispering to her and continually touching her head until the emts could get to work i stepped back they got rosie loaded onto a stretcher when they laid her arm down by her side i could see several small round marks irregular bruises and damaged capillaries just under the surface of the skin at the bend of her arm molly stared at me for a second her eyes wide then she helped the emts throw a blanket over rosie and her track marks the emts counted to three and lifted the stretcher flicked out the wheels underneath and rolled her toward the doors the girl stirred and thrashed weakly as they did this letting out whimpering little cries shes frightened molly told the emts let me ride with her help keep her calm the men traded a look and then one of them nodded molly let out a breath of relief nodded to them and went to walk by the head of the stretcher where rosie could see her dont worry said the other emt well be right back for you sir what this i asked and waved vaguely at my head nah i didnt get hurt here this is from earlier im good the mans expression was dubious you sure yep they took the girl out i dragged myself to the wall and propped my back up against it a minute later a man in a tweed suit came in and walked directly to rawlins he spoke to the officer for a moment glancing over at me once as they talked then turned and walked over to me of only average height the man was in his late forties thirty pounds overweight balding and had watery blue eyes he nodded at me grabbed a chair and settled down into it looking down at me youre dresden most days i said my name is detective sergeant greene im with homicide tough job i said most days he agreed now rawlins back there tells me you were an eyewitness to what happened is that correct mostly i said i only saw what happened at the very end in here uhhuh he said he blinked his watery eyes and absently removed a pen and a small notebook from his pocket behind him cops were surrounding the area where the victims had lain with a circle of chairs and stringing crime scene tape between them can you tell me what happened the lights went out i said people panicked we heard screams rawlins went to help and i went with him why he asked what why greene said his tone mild youre a civilian mr dresden its rawlinss job to help people in emergencies why didnt you just head for the door it was an emergency i said i helped youre a hero greene said is that it i shrugged i was there people needed help i tried to sure sure greene said blinking his eyes so what were you doing to help holding the light i said didnt rawlins have his own flashlight cant have too many flashlights i replied sure greene said writing things so you held the light for rawlins what then we heard screams in here we came in i saw the attacker over that girl they just took out can you describe him greene asked almost seven feet tall i said built like a battleship maybe three hundred three twentyfive hockey mask sickle greene nodded what happened he attacked the girl there were other people behind him already down he was about to cut her throat with the sickle rawlins shot him shot at him greene asked since we dont have a dead bad guy on the floor shot at him i amended i dont know if he hit him the bad guy dropped the girl and swung that sickle at rawlins rawlins blocked it with his flashlight then what then i hit the guy i said hit him how greene asked i used magic blew him thirty feet down the aisle and through the projector and the movie screen greene slapped his pen down onto the notebook and gave me a flat look hey i said you asked or maybe he turned to run greene said knocked the projector over and jumped through the screen to get to the back of the room if that makes you feel better i said he gave me another hard look and said and then what and then he was gone i said he ran out the door no i said we were pretty much right next to the door he went through the screen hit the wall behind it and poof gone i dont know how greene wrote that down do you know where nelson lenhardt is i blinked no why would i he apparently attacked someone else at this convention today and beat him savagely you bailed him out of jail maybe youre friends with him not really i said seems a little odd then that you dropped two thousand dollars to bail out this guy youre not friends with yeah why did you do it i got annoyed i had personal reasons which are personal i said greene regarded me with his watery blue eyes silent for a long minute then he said patiently and politely im not sure i understand all of this id appreciate it if you could help me out could you tell me again what happened starting with when the lights went out i sighed we started over four more times greene was never so much as impolite to me and his mild voice and watery eyes made him seem more like an apologetic clerk than a detective but i had a gut instinct that there was a steely and dangerous man underneath the tweed camouflage and that he had me pegged as an accomplice or at least as someone who knew more than he was saying which i suppose was true but going on about black magic and ectoplasm and boogeymen that disappeared at will wasnt going to make him like me any better that was par for the course when it came to cops some of them guys like rawlins had run into something nasty at some point in their careers they never talked much about it with anyone other cops tend to worry about it when one of their partners starts talking about seeing monsters and all kinds of wellintentioned counseling and psychological evaluations were sure to follow so if a cop found himself facetoface with a vampire or a ghoul and survived it its only existence tended to be in the landscape of memory time has a way of wearing the sharpest edges away from that kind of thing and its easy to avoid thinking about terrifying monsters and even more terrifying implications and get back to the daily routine if enough time went by a lot of cops could even convince themselves that what happened had been exaggerated in their heads bad memories amplified by darkness and fear and that since everyone around them knew monsters didnt exist they must therefore have seen something normal something explainable but when the heat was on those same cops changed somewhere deep down they know that its for real and when something supernatural went down again they were willing at least for the duration to forget about anything but doing whatever they could to survive it and protect lives even if in retrospect it seemed insane rawlins would poke fun at me for pretending to be a wizard when there was a fan convention in progress but when everything had hit the proverbial fan hed been willing to work with me then there was the other kind of copguys like greene who hadnt ever seen anything remotely supernatural who went home to their house and kids and dog and mowed their lawn on saturdays who watch nova and the science channel and subscribe to national geographic and keep every issue stored neatly and in order in the basement guys like that were dead certain that everything was logical everything was explainable and that nothing existed outside the purview of reason and logic guys like that also tend to make pretty good detectives greene was a guy like that all right mr dresden greene said im still kind of unclear on a few points now when the lights went out what did you do i rubbed at my eyes my head ached i wanted to sleep ive already told you this five times i know i know greene said and offered me a small smile but sometimes repeating things can jiggle forgotten little details loose so if you dont mind can you tell me about when it went dark i closed my eyes and fought a sudden and overwhelming temptation to levitate greene to the ceiling and leave him there for a while someone touched my shoulder and i opened my eyes to find murphy standing over me offering me a white styrofoam cup evening harry oh thank god i muttered and took the cup coffee i sipped some hot and sweet i groaned in pleasure angel of mercy murph thats me she agreed she was wearing jeans a tshirt and a very light cotton blazer she had circles under her eyes and her blond hair was messy someone must have gotten her out of bed for this one detective greene she said lieutenant greene replied all courtesy on the surface i didnt realize id called special investigations for help maybe someone bumped the speed dial on my phone he reached into a pocket and took out a cell he regarded it gravely for a moment and then said oh wait my mistake you arent on my speed dial i must have slipped into some kind of fugue state when i wasnt looking dont worry sergeant murphy said smiling sweetly if i find out whodunit ill tell you so you can get the collar greene shook his head this is messy enough already he said some clown in a horror movie costume cuts a bunch of horror fans to ribbons the press is going to make piranhas look like goldfish yep murphy said seems to me you should take all the help you can get dont want to screw it up in front of all those cameras he gave her another flat look and then shook his head you arent exactly famous for your friendly spirit of cooperation with your fellow officers lieutenant i get the job done murphy said easily i can help you or i can see to it that the press knows that youre refusing assistance in finding a murderer because of departmental rivalry your call greene stared at her for another long minute then said does calling someone an overbearing egotistical bitch constitute sexual harassment murphys smile grew sunnier come to the gym sometime and well discuss it greene grunted and rose stuffing his pad and pen into his pocket dresden dont leave town i might need to speak to you again wont that be nice i mumbled and sipped more coffee greene handed murphy a card my cell number is on it in case you actually do want to cooperate murphy traded him for one of hers ditto greene shook his head gave her a barely polite nod and walked off to speak to the officers near the tapedoff section of floor i think he likes you i told murphy murphy snorted hes had you running in a circle huh for an hour i tried not to sound too disgusted its annoying she said but it really does work greenes probably the best homicide detective in the state if he had a personality hed have made captain by now i dont think hes going to be much help on this one murphy nodded and sat down in the chair greene had vacated so you want to give me the rundown here i havent even finished my coffee i complained but i told her starting with bailing nelson out of jail and skipping over the details of the visit to michaels house i told her about the attack and how rawlins and i had presumably cut it short she exhaled slowly so this thing must have been from the spirit world right if it got shot full of bullets didnt die then dissolved into v goor thats a reasonable conclusion i said but i didnt exactly have time to make a thorough analysis it could have been anything any chance you killed it i didnt hit it all that hard must have had some kind of selfdestruct dammit murphy said missing the reference no one loves the classics anymore will it come back your guess is as good as mine i said thats not good enough i sighed and nodded ill see what i can figure out hows rawlins hospital she reported hell need a bunch of stitches for that cut he took i grunted and rose it was an effort and i wobbled a little but as soon as i got my balance i walked over to the remains of the projector on its stand i bent down and picked up a large round tin the one the movie reel had come in i flipped it over and read the label hunh i said murphy came over and frowned at the tin suburban slasher ii i nodded this means something other than the death of classic cinema movie fascist i said the guy that jumped them looked like the reaper murphy gave me a blank look the reaper i told her come on dont tell me you havent ever seen the reaper the killer from the suburban slasher films he cant be slain brings death to the wickedwhich includes anyone who is having sex or drinking apparently if thats not classic cinema i dont know what is i guess i missed that one murphy said there have been eleven films featuring the reaper so far i replied i guess i missed those eleven murphy amended you think this was someone trying to look like the reaper character someone i murmured with exaggerated menace or some thing she gave me a level look how long have you been waiting to use that one years i said the opportunity doesnt come up as often as youd think murphy smiled but it was forced and we both knew it the jokes didnt change the facts something had killed one young man only a few feet from where we sat and the lives of at least two of the wounded hung on the skills of the doctors attending them murph i said theres a theater right down the street run by a guy named clark pell could you find out what movie was showing there this afternoon murphy flipped to an earlier page of her notebook and said i already did something called hammerhands oldie but a goodie i said ruffians push this farmer out onto train tracks and the train cuts his hands off at the wrist they leave him for dead but he survives insane straps sledgehammer heads to the stumps and hunts them down one at a time and clark pell was the victim beaten here earlier today murphy said badly beaten with some kind of blunt instrument maybe its a coincidence i said she frowned can someone do that bring movie monsters to life sorta looks that way i said how do we stop them she asked i dragged the con schedule out of my pocket and paged through it the real question is how do we stop them before tomorrow night whats tomorrow night movie fest i said and held up the film schedule haifa dozen films showing here another half a dozen in pells theater and most of their monsters arent nearly as friendly as hammerhand and the reaper god almighty murphy breathed any chance this could be regular folks playing dress up i doubt it but its possible she nodded well let greene cover that angle then consider yourself to be on the clock for the department harry whats our next move we talk to the surviving victims i said and i try to figure out how many ways there are for someone to do something this crazy she nodded and then frowned at me first you get some sleep you look like hell thanks i said feel like im about to fall down she nodded ill see if i can talk to pell if hes even awake i doubt well get to the others before morning assuming they survive right i said ill need to get back here and do some snooping tomorrow with any luck we can track down our bad guy before something else jumps off the movie screen murphy nodded and rose she offered me a hand i took it and she hauled me up murphy is a lot stronger than she looks give me a ride home i asked she already had her keys in her hand do i look like your driver thanks murph we headed for the door usually i have to shorten my steps to match murphys but tonight i was so tired that she was waiting for me harry she said what if we cant find out who is doing it in time well find them i said but if we dont then we fight monsters murphy took a deep breath and nodded as we stepped out into the summer night damn right we do chapter fourteen murphy drove me home and parked in the gravel lot next to the centuryold converted boardinghouse she killed the engine in the car and it made those clicking noises they do we sat there with the windows rolled down for a second a cool breeze coming off the lake whispered through the car soothing after the unrelenting heat of the day murphy checked her rearview mirror and then scanned the street who were you watching for what i said what do you mean you rubbernecked so much on the way here im surprised your shoulders arent bruising your ears i grimaced oh that someone was tailing me tonight and youre just now telling me about it i shrugged no sense worrying you over nothing whoever he is hes not there now i described the shadowy man and his car same one who ran you off the road do you think she asked something tells me no i said he wasnt making any effort to avoid being spotted for all i know he could just be a pi gathering information on me for the lawsuit christ murphy said isnt that thing over with i grimaced for a talk show host larry fowler can really hold a grudge he keeps doing one thing after another maybe you shouldnt have burned down his studio and shot up his car then that wasnt my fault thats for a court to decide murphy said in a pious tone you got an attorney i helped a guy find his daughters lost dog five or six years ago hes an attorney hes giving me a hand with the legal process enough so it hasnt actually bankrupted me but it just keeps going and going neither of us got out of the car i closed my eyes and listened to the summer night music played somewhere i could hear the occasional racing engine harry murph asked after a while are you all right hungry little tired you look like youre hurting she said maybe a little achy i said not that kind of hurt i opened my eyes and looked at her and then away oh that that she agreed you look like youre bleeding somehow ill get over it i told her is this about last halloween i shrugged a shoulder she was quiet for a moment then she said there was a lot of confusion in the blackout and right after but they found a corpse in the field museum that had been savaged by an animal lab guessed it was a large dog they found three different blood types on the floor too did they i asked and at kent college they found eight dead bodies there six of them had no discernable means of death one had its head half severed by a surgically sharp blade the other had taken a round to the back of the head i nodded she stared at me for a while frowning and waiting for me to continue then she said in a quiet certain voice you killed them my memory played some bad clips in my head my stomach twisted i didnt do the headless guy her cool blue eyes stayed steady and she nodded you killed them its eating at you it shouldnt ive killed a lot of things true murphy said but they werent faeries or vampires or monsters this time they were people and you werent in the heat of battle when they died you made the choice cold i couldnt lift my eyes for some reason but i nodded and whispered more or less she waited for me to say more but i didnt harry she said youre tearing yourself up over it youve got to talk to someone it doesnt have to be me or here but youve got to do it theres no shame in feeling bad about killing someone not for any reason i let out a short little laugh it tasted bitter youre the last person id expect to tell me not to feel bad about committing murder she shifted uncomfortably sort of surprised myself she said but dammit harry you remember when i shot agent denton yeah took me some time to deal with it too i mean i know hed lost it and he was going to kill you if i didnt do it but it made me feel she squinted out at the chicago night stained to take a life she swallowed and those poor people the vampires had controlled at the shelter that was even worse all of those people were trying to kill you murph you had to do it you didnt have an option you thought about it you knew that when you pulled the trigger do you think you had an option she asked i shrugged and said maybe maybe not i swallowed the point is that i never bothered to consider it never hesitated i just wanted them dead she was quiet for a long time what if the council is right about me i asked murphy quietly what if i grow into some kind of monster one who takes life without consideration for anything but his own will who cares more about end than means more about might than right what if this is the first step do you think it is murphy asked i dont because if you think so harry then it probably is and if you decide that it isnt it probably isnt the power of positive thinking i asked no free will she said you cant change what has already happened but you choose what to do next which means that you only cross over to the dark side if you choose to do it what makes you think that i wont i asked murphy snorted and reached over to touch my chin lightly with the fingers of one hand because im not an idiot unlike some other people in this car i reached up and gripped her fingers with my right hand squeezing gently her hand was steady and warm careful that was almost a compliment youre a decent man murphy said lowering her hand without removing it from my fingers painfully oblivious sometimes but youve got a good heart its why youre so hard on yourself youre tired hungry and hurting and you saw the bad guys do something you couldnt stop your morale is low thats all her words were simple frank and direct there was no sense of false comfort to her tone not a trace of indulgent pity ive known murphy for a while i knew that she meant every single word knowing that i had her support even in the face of violation of the laws she worked to preserve was a sudden and vast comfort ive said it before and ill say it again murphy is good people maybe youre right i said hells bells ive got to stop feeling sorry for myself and get to work start with food and rest she said if you dont hear from me assume ill pick you up in the morning right i said we sat there holding hands for a minute karrin i asked she looked up at me her eyes looked very large very blue i couldnt stare at them too long have you ever thought about you know us sometimes she said me too i said but the timing always seems to be off somehow she smiled a little i noticed do you think itll ever be right she squeezed my hand gently and then withdrew hers from mine i dont know maybe sometime she frowned at her hand and then said it would change a lot of things it would i said youre my friend harry murphy said no matter what happens sometimes in the past i havent really done right by you like when you handcuffed me in my office i said right and when you chipped one of my teeth arresting me murphy blinked i chipped a tooth and when yes all right she said she gave me a mild glare her cheeks pink the point is that i should have seen that you were one of the good guys a lot sooner than i did and i blinked at her ingenuously and waited for her to say it and im sorry she growled jerk that had cost her something murphy has more pride than is good for her and yes i am aware of the proverb about glass houses and stones so i didnt give her any more of a hard time than i already had dont go all romantic on me now murph she smiled a little and rolled her eyes if we ever did get together id kill you inside a week now go get some rest youre useless to me like this i nodded and swung out of the car in the morning then around eight she said and pulled out and back onto the street she called to me be careful i looked after the car and sighed my feelings about murphy were still in a hopelessly complicated tangle maybe i should have said something to her sooner shared my feelings with her sooner acted more swiftly taken the initiative be careful she said why did i feel like id been too careful already chapter fifteen my mickey mouse alarm clock went off at seven and buzzed stubbornly at me until i kicked off the covers sat up and shut it off i ached all over felt stiff all over but that sense of overwhelming exhaustion had faded and since i was already vertical i got moving i got into the shower and tried not to jump too much when the first shock of freezing water hit me ive had some practice at it ive never had a water heater last me more than a week without some kind of technical problem coming upand that was the kind of thing you just did not want to take chances on when you have a gas heater so my showers were always either cold or colder given my dating life and the inhuman charms available to some of the beings who occasionally faced off with me it was probably just as well but especially when i had bumps and bruises and sore muscles i wished i could have a skinblistering hot shower like everyone else in the country and suddenly the water shifted from icecold to piping hot it was a shock and i actually let out a little yelp and danced around in the shower until i could redirect the shower head so that it wasnt scalding my bits and pieces after the initial shock of the temperature change i leaned my aching head and neck into the spray for a second and let out a long groan then i said dammit i told you to stop that lasciels voice murmured in a quiet laugh under the sound of the water the sensation of phantom fingertips dug into the wiretight muscles at the base of my neck easing soreness away you should use the technique i taught you last autumn to block out the discomfort i dont need to i said and tried for grouchy but the heated water and massaging fingers illusory though they were were simply delicious ill be fine your discomfort is my discomfort my host she said and sighed literally as all my perceptions can come only through your own this isnt real i said quietly the water isnt really hot no one is actually massaging my neck its an illusion youre laying over my senses does it not feel soothing her disembodied voice asked does it not ease the tension yes i sighed what matter then it is real enough i waved a hand as though trying to brush off an annoying fly from my neck and the sensation of those strong steady fingers retreated go on i said hands off i dont want to start my day with a psychic cage match but if you push me to it i will as you wish her voice said and the sense of presence retreated then paused my host i note that you made no mention of the hot water i grunted and mumbled something under my breath ducked my head under the seemingly scalding water for a few seconds and then said did you pick up on what happened last night indeed the fallen angel replied what was your read then there was a moment of thoughtful silence and then lasciel responded that karrin feels a certain distance between the pair of you is a professional necessity but that she is considering that time and circumstance might someday render it irrelevant i sighed no i said not that stars and stones i dont want dating advice from a freaking helltart i meant the things that attacked people at the convention ah lasciel said with no trace of offense in her tone it was obviously the attack of a spiritual predator takes one to know one i thought i rolled a stiff shoulder under the hot water if thats true then the attacks werent about violence i said thoughtfully which explains what i saw in that bathroom where the old man had been attacked whatever did it was intent on causing fear causing pain then devouring the what the psychic energy it generated in the victims that is a somewhat simplistic description she said but one that is as close as i expect a mortal can come to understanding what youre a mortality bigot now now and always she replied i mean no insult by it but you should know that your ability to comprehend your environment is very strongly defined by your belief in a number of illusions time truth love that kind of thing it isnt your fault of coursebut it does impose limits upon your ability to perceive and understand some matters im only human i said so enlighten me to do so you would have to release your hold on mortality i blinked and said id have to die she sighed again you have only a partial understanding but in the interest of expediency yes you would have to cease living then dont bother enlightening me i said i have plenty of wouldbe teachers already i rinsed and repeated my shampoo and made myself smell like irish spring the survivors of the attacks then theyre going to have taken a spiritual mauling if the theory is correct lasciels voice responded if they are indeed wounded in spirit it would seem conclusive i shuddered that kind of damage showed itself in a number of ways and none of them were pretty id seen men driven to agonies of madness by spiritual attacks murphy had been subjected to such an assault and spent years learning to cope with the night terrors it had spawned until the spiritual and psychological wounds had finally healed id seen some who had been subjected to a psychic sandblasting by vampires of the black court who had become nearly mindless bodies obeying orders and others of the same ilk who had turned into psychotic killing machines in service to their masters the worst part of it all was that almost the only way for me to see something like that was to open my sight which meant that every horribly mangled psyche id come across remained fresh and bright in my memory always the top shelf of my mental trophy case was getting crowded with hideous keepsakes the nottrulyhot water coursed over me a small but suddenly significant comfort go away i told lasciel then i added leave me the hot water just this once as you wish the fallen angels voice replied polite satisfaction in her tone the sense of her presence vanished entirely i stayed in the shower until my fingers shriveled up or more accurately i stayed there until the fingers of my right hand shriveled up the skin of my burned left hand always looked withered and shriveled these days the second i turned the water off the full sensation of icy cold returned and i shivered violently as i toweled off and got dressed i took care of mouse and misters various needs ate several leftover biscuits from the fridge for breakfast and opened a can of coke after a moments thought i headed down to my lab and grabbed bobs skull from the shelf faint orange lights flickered in the sockets hey bob mumbled in a sleepslurred voice where are we going investigating i said i went back upstairs with the skull and dropped it into my nylon backpack i might need you today but there are going to be straights around so keep your mouth shut unless i open the pack kay bob said with a yawn and the lights in the skulls eye sockets winked out again i strapped on the magical arsenalmy shield bracelet the energy ring and my silver pentacle amulet i slipped my newly carved blasting rod into a side pocket of the pack leaving the handle out where i could reach up behind my right ear and whip it out in a hurry i picked up my staff and eyed my leather duster hanging on its hook by the door i had layered spells over the duster in an effort to provide myself with a measure of protection against various fangs and claws and bullets and such and as a result the coat had effectively become a suit of armor but like most suits of armor it lacked its own airconditioning systemand if i wore it around in the blazing summer heat id probably die of heat prostration before anyone had the chance to bite slice or shoot me hell even the blue jeans i was wearing would feel too heavy long before noon the duster stayed on its hook that rattled me a little im used to the duster and the spells on its leather had saved my life before it made me feel a little vulnerable to think of getting into some kind of supernatural conflict without it so i grabbed mouses lead much to the dogs tailwagging approval and clipped it onto his collar youre with me today i told him i need someone to watch my back maybe to help me eat a hot dog later mouses tail wagged even more at the mention of hot dogs he chuffed out a breath nudged my hip with the side of his head in a fond gesture and we went outside to wait for murphy she pulled up and eyed mouse warily as i opened the back door and he jumped up onto the backseat the car rocked back and forth with his weight and sank a little hes carbroken right mouse wagged his tail and gave murphy an enthusiastic vacant doggie grin tilting his head back and forth quizzically it was easy for my imagination to subtitle the look carbroken what is that wiseass i muttered at the dog and got in the passenger side dont worry murph we did an insane amount of work on the whole bodily function issue as soon as i realized how big he was going to get hell be good i glared at the backseat wont you mouse gave me that same grin and puzzled tilting of his head i frowned at him more deeply he leaned forward to nuzzle my shoulder with his heavy muzzle and settled down in the backseat murphy sighed if it was any other dog id make him ride in the trunk thats right i said you have dog issues big dog issues murphy corrected me just big dogs mouse isnt big hes compactly challenged she gave me an arch look as she pulled out and said youd fit in the trunk too harry then she frowned at me and said your lips are blue long shower i said she gave me a sudden swift grin wanted to keep your mind on business i think ill interpret that as a compliment to my sexual appeal i snorted and buckled in you heard anything from the hospital murphys smile faded and she kept her eyes on the road she nodded without looking at me her face impossible to read bad huh i asked the young man the paramedics carried off died the girl who was already down when you came in is going to make it but shes in some kind of shock catatonic doesnt focus her eyes or anything just lies there yeah i said quietly i was sort of expecting that what about the other girl rosie her injuries were painful but not lifethreatening they closed the cuts and set the bones but when they heard she was pregnant they kept her at the hospital for observation it looks like shell come through without losing the child shes awake and talking thats something i said and pell still in icu hes an old man and his injuries were severe they think hell be all right as long as there arent any complications hes groggy but hes conscious icu i said any chance we could talk to him somewhere else those doctors can be real funny about not wanting people in critical condition to nip out for a walk to the vending machines she said i grunted you might have to solo him then i dont dare go walking in there with all the medical equipment around even if it was just for a few minutes she asked i shrugged i dont have any control over when things break down i paused and said well not exactly i could blow out the whole floor in a few seconds if i was trying to do it but theres not much i can do to keep things from breaking down odds are good that if i was only in there for a few minutes nothing bad would happen but sometimes things go haywire the second i walk by them i cant take any chances when there are people on life support murphy arched a brow at me and then nodded in understanding maybe we can get you on a speaker phone or something or something i rubbed at my eyes i think this is gonna be a long day when you get right down to it all hospitals tend to look pretty much the same but mercy hospital where the victims in the attack had been taken somehow managed to avoid the worst of the sterile disinfected quietly desperate quality of many others the oldest hospital in chicago the sisters of mercy had founded the place and it remained a catholic institution thought ridiculously large when it was first built the famous chicago fires of the late nineteenth century filled mercy to capacity doctors were able to handle six or seven times as many patients as any other hospital during the emergency and everyone stopped complaining about how uselessly big the place was there was a cop on guard in the hallway outside the victims rooms in case the whacko costumed killer came after them again he might also be there to discourage the press whenever they inevitably smelled the blood in the water and showed up for the frenzy it did not surprise me much at all to see that the cop on guard was rawlins he was unshaven and still had his splattercon name tag on one of his forearms was bound up in neatly taped white bandages but other than that he looked surprisingly alert for someone who had been injured and then worked all through the night or maybe his weathered features just took such things in stride dresden rawlins said from his seat hed dragged a chair to the halls intersection he was dedicated not insane you look better cept for those bruises the best ones always show up the day after i said gods truth he agreed murphy looked back and forth between us i guess youll work with anybody harry shoot rawlins drawled smiling is that little karrie murphy i hear down there i didnt bring my opera glasses to work today she grinned back what are you doing down here couldnt they find a real cop to watch the hall he snorted stuck his legs out and crossed his ankles i noted that for all of his indolent posture his holstered weapon was clear and near his right hand he regarded mouse with pursed lips and said dont think dogs are allowed in here hes a police dog i told him rawlins casually offered mouse the back of one hand mouse sniffed it politely and his tail thumped against my legs hmmm rawlins drawled dont think ive seen him around the station the dogs with me i said the wizards with me murphy said makes him a police dog all right rawlins agreed he jerked his head down the hall miss marcella is down that way they got pell and miss becton in icu the boy they brought in didnt make it murphy grimaced thanks rawlins youre welcome little girl rawlins said his deep voice grandfatherly murphy gave him a brief glare and we went down the hall to visit the first of the victims it was a singlebed room molly was there in a chair beside the bed where she had evidently been asleep while mostly sitting up by the time i got in the room and shut the door she was looking around blearily and mopping at the corner of her mouth with her sleeve in the bed beside her was rosie small and pale molly touched the girls arm and gently roused her rosie looked up at us and blinked a few times good morning murphy said i hope you were able to get some rest a llittle the girl said her voice raspy she looked around but molly was already passing her a glass of water with a straw in it rosie sipped and then laid her head tiredly back then murmured a thank you to molly a little she said again her voice stronger who are you my name is karrin murphy im a detective for the chicago police department she gestured at me and took a pen and a small notebook from her hip pocket this is harry dresden hes working with us on the case do you mind if hes here rosie licked her lips and shook her head her uninjured hand moved fitfully stroking over the bandages on the opposite forearm in nervous motions murphy engaged the girl in quiet conversation what are you doing here molly asked me in a half whisper looking into things i replied as quietly theres something spooky going on molly chewed on her lip youre sure definitely i said dont worry ill find whatever hurt your friend friends molly said emphasizing the plural have you heard anything about ken rosies boyfriend no one will tell us anything he the kid that they took from the scene molly nodded anxiously yes i glanced at murphys back and didnt say anything molly got it her face went white and she whispered oh god shell be so she folded her arms and shook her head several times then she said ive got to she looked around and in a louder voice said im dying for coffee anyone else need some nobody did molly picked up her purse and turned around to walk for the door in doing so she brushed within a foot or two of mouse instead of growling though mouse leaned his head affectionately against her leg as she went by and cadged a few ear scratches from the girl before she left i frowned at mouse after molly had gone are you going bipolar on me he settled down again immediately murphy went on asking rosie fairly predictable questions about the attack the clock was running i pushed the question about mouses odd behavior aside for the moment and let mouse watch the door while i reached for my sight it was a slight effort of concentration to push away the concerns of the material world like aches and pains and bruises and why my dog was growling at molly and then the mere light and shadow and color of the everyday world dissolved into the riot of flowing energy and currents of light and power that lay beneath the surface murphy looked like murphy had always looked beneath my sight she appeared almost as herself but clearer somehow her eyes flashing and she was garbed in a quasi angelic tunic of white stained in places with the blood and mud of battle a short straight sword its blade made of almost viciously bright white light hung beneath her left arm where i knew her light cotton blazer hid her gun in its shoulder rig she looked at me and i could see her physical face as a vague shadow beneath the surface of the aspect i saw now she smiled at me a sunny light in it though her bodys face remained a neutral mask i was seeing the life the emotion behind her face now i shied away from staring at her lest i make eye contact for too long but that smile at least was something i wouldnt mind remembering rosie was another story the physical rosie was a small slight pale young woman with thin frail features the rosie my sight revealed to me was entirely different pale skin became a pallid dirty leathery coating large dark eyes looked even bigger and flicked around with darting avian jerks they were furtive eyes giving her the dangerous aspect of a stray dog or maybe some kind of ratthe eyes of a craven desperate survivor winding veins of some kind of greenblack energy pulsed beneath her skin particularly around the inside bend of her left arm the writhing strings of energy ended at the surface of her skin in dozens of tiny mindlessly opening and closing little mouthsthe needle tracks id seen the night before her right hand kept darting back and forth over the other arm as if trying to scratch a persistent itch but her fingers couldnt touch there was a kind of sheath of sparkling motes around her hands almost like mittens and she couldnt actually touch those mindlessly hungry mouths worse there were what looked almost like burn marks on her temples small black neat holes as if someone had bored a hot needle through the skin and skull beneath there was a kind of phantom blood around the injuries but her eyes were wide and vague as if she didnt even notice them what the hell i had seen the victims of spiritual attacks before and theyd never been pretty usually they looked like the victim of a shark attack or someone who had been mauled by a bear i hadnt ever seen someone with damage like rosies it looked almost like some kind of demented surgeon had gone after her with a laser scalpel that pushed the weirdometer a couple of clicks beyond the previous record my head started pounding and i pushed the sight away i leaned my hip against the wall for a second and rubbed at my temples until the throbbing subsided and i was sure that my normal vision had returned rosie i said cutting into the middle of one of murphys questions when was your last fix murphy glanced over her shoulder at me frowning behind her the girl gave me a guilty look her eyes shifting to one side what do you mean rosie asked i figure its heroin i said i kept my voice pitched to the barest level needed to be audible i saw the tracks on you last night im diab she began oh please i said and let the annoyance show in my voice you think im that stupid harry murphy began there was a warning note in her voice but my head hurt too much to let it stop me miss marcella im trying to help you just answer the question she was silent for a long moment then she said two weeks murphy arched a brow and her gaze went back to the girl i quit she said really i mean once i heard that i was pregnant i cant do that anymore really i asked she looked up and her eyes were direct though nothing like confident yes im done with it i dont even miss it the babys more important than that i pursed my lips and then nodded all right miss marcella murphy said thank you for your time wait she said as murphy turned away please no one will tell us anything about ken do you know how hes doing what room hes in kens your boyfriend murphy asked in a careful tone yes i saw them load him in the ambulance last night i know hes here rosie stared at murphy for a second and then her face grew even more pale oh no oh no no no i was glad id gotten a gotten a look at her before she found out about her boyfriend my imagination provided me with a nice image of watching the emotional wounds open up as though an invisible sword had begun slicing into her but at least i didnt have to see it with my sight too im very sorry murphy said quietly her voice was steady her eyes compassionate molly picked that moment to return with a cup of coffee she took one look at rosie put the coffee down and then hurried to her rosie broke down in choking sobs molly immediately sat on the bed beside her and hugged her while she wept well be in touch murphy said quietly come on harry mouse stared at rosie with a mournful expression and i had to tug on his leash a couple of times to get him moving we departed and headed for the nearest stairwell murphy headed for icu which was in the neighboring building i didnt see the track marks on her last night she said after a minute you pushed her pretty hard yes why because it might mean something i dont know what yet but we didnt have time to waste listening to her denial she wasnt straight with you murphy said no one kicks heroin that fast two weeks she should still be feeling some of the withdrawal yeah i said we went outside to go to the other building bright morning sunlight made my head hurt even more and the sidewalk began revolving i stopped to wait for my eyes to adjust to the light you all right murphy asked its hard seeing someone like that i said quietly and shes probably the least mangled of the three she frowned what did you see i tried to tell her what rosie had looked like it sounded surreal and garbled even to me i didnt think i had conveyed it very well you look terrible she said when i finished itll pass just got this damned headache i shook my head and focused on taking steady breaths until i could force the pain to recede okay im good did you learn what you were hoping for murphy asked not yet i said ill need to look at the others too see if the injuries on them give me some kind of pattern theyre in icu yeah i need to find a way to them without getting too close to someone on life support i cant stay around to talk ill need maybe a minute ninety seconds to look at them both then ill get out let you talk murphy took a deep breath and said you sure you should do this no i told her but i cant help you if i dont get to look at them i cant do that any other way if i can stay calm and relaxed it shouldnt hurt anything for me to be there for a minute or two but you cant be sure when can i she frowned at me but nodded let me go ahead of you she said wait here i found a chair and took it down the hall and sat down with mouse and rawlins we shared a companionable silence i leaned my head back against the wall and closed my eyes my headache finally began to fade away just as murphy returned all right she said quietly we need to go down a floor and then use the back stairs a nurse is going to let us in you wont have to walk past any of the other rooms before you get to our witnesses okay i said and stood up lets get this over with chapter seventeen i wasted no time we went up the stairs and i was already preparing my sight a nurse opened the door to the stairway and i simply stepped into the first door on my leftthe catatonic girls miss bectons i stepped into the doorway and raised my sight she was a young girl still in her late teens nervously thin her hair a shocking color of red that for some reason did not strike me as a dye job she lay on her front her head turned to the side muddy brown eyes open and blank her back had been covered in bandages as my sight focused on her i saw more the girls psyche had been savagely mauled and as i watched her phantom bruises darkened a few patches of skin that remained and blood and watery fluids oozed from the rest of her torn flesh her mouth was set in a continual silent wail and beneath the realworld glaze her eyes were wide with terror if thered been enough left of her behind those eyes miss becton would have been screaming my stomach rolled and i barely spotted a trash can in time to throw up into it murphy crouched down at my side her hand on my back harry are you okay anger and empathy and grief warred for first place in my thoughts across the room i was dimly conscious of a clock radio warbling to life and dying in a puff of smoke the rooms fluorescent lights began to flicker as the violent emotions played hell with the aura of magic around me no i said in a vicious halfstrangled growl im not okay murphy stared at me for a second and then looked at the girl is she she isnt coming back i said i spat a few times into the trash can and stood up my headache started to return the girls terrified eyes stayed bright and clear in my imagination shed been out for a fun time a favorite movie maybe coffee or dinner with friends afterward she sure as hell hadnt woken up yesterday morning and wondered if today would be the day some kind of nightmarish thing would rip away her sanity harry murphy said again her voice very gentle you didnt do this to her dammit i said i sounded bitter she found my right hand with hers and i closed my fingers around hers with a kind of quiet desperation dammit murph im going to find this thing and kill it her hand was steady and strong like her voice ill help i nodded and held tight to her hand for a minute there wasnt any tension in that contact no quivering sensation of excitement murphy was human and alive she held my hand to remind me that i was too i somehow managed to push the sense of visceral horror id seen filling the girl from my immediate thoughts until i felt steadier i squeezed her hand once and released it come on i said my voice rough pell are you sure you dont need a minute it wont help i said i gestured at the radio and the lights i need to get this over with and leave she chewed on her lip but nodded at me and led me to the door across the hall i didnt want to do it but i hauled up my sight again and braced myself as i followed on murphys heels and looked at clark pell pell was a sourlooking old cuss made out of shoe leather and gristle one arm and both legs were in casts and he was in traction one side of his face was swollen with bruising a plastic tube for oxygen ran beneath his nose bandages swathed his head though bits of coarse grey hair stuck out one eye was swollen mostly shut the other was open dark and glittering beyond the physical surface his wounds were very nearly as dire as those the girl had suffered he had been brutally beaten phantom bruises slid around his wrinkled skin and the shapes of distorted bones poked disquietingly at the surface and i saw something about the old man too beneath the shoe leather and gristle there were more shoe leather and gristle and iron the old man had been badly beaten but it wasnt the first such he had enduredphysically or spiritually he was a fighter a survivor he was afraid but he was also angry and defiant whatever had done this to him hadnt gotten what it wantednot like it had with the girl it had to settle for a physical beating when its attack hadnt elicited the terror and anguish it had expected the old man had faced it and he didnt have any power of his own beyond a lifetime of stubborn will if hed done it as painful and as frightening as it must have been i could steel myself against looking at the aftermath i released my sight slowly and took a deep breath murphy poised beside me as if she expected me to abruptly collapse tilted her head and peered at me im all right i told her quietly pell made a weak but rude sound whiner not even a cast i faced the old man and said who did this to you he shook his head a feeble motion crazy murphy started to say something but i raised my hand and shook my head at her and she fell silent waiting sir i said to pell i swear to you im not a cop im not a doctor i think you saw something strange he stared at me his one eye narrowed didnt you i asked quietly ha hh he tried to say but the word broke into a wracking quiet cough i held up my hand and waited for him to recover then i said hammerhands pells lip lifted a faint little sneer his good hand moved weakly and i stepped over closer to him you told greene it was someone dressed like hammerhands i guessed pell closed his eye tiredly pretty much i nodded but it wasnt just a costume i said quietly this was something more pell gave a slow shudder before opening his eye again dull with fatigue it was him the old man whispered dont know how dont make no sense but you could feel it i believe you i told him he watched me for a second and then nodded closing his eye thing is that was the only damn movie ever scared me wasnt even all that good he gave a weak shake of his head and said buzz off thank you i told him quietly then i turned and walked toward the door murphy followed at my side and we headed back down the stairs harry she asked what was that pell i said he gave us what we needed he did yeah i said i think he did this thing has got to be some kind of phobophage a what its a spiritual entity that feeds on fear it attacks in order to scare people and feeds on the emotion it didnt give pell those broken bones by shouting boo murphy said yeah its got to manifest a physical body in order to come to the real world pretty standard for all those demon types how do we beat it i shook my head i dont know yet first i have to find out what kind of phobophage it is but ive got a place to pick up a trail now there are only going to be so many beings who could have crossed over to chicago from the nevernever to do what this thing did we emerged into the sunshine and i stopped for a minute lifting my face up to the light the horror and misery id seen on the victims remained in place a clear and terrible image but the sunlight and the equally sharp memory of old pells defiance took the edge off you going to be all right murphy asked i think so i said quietly can you tell me what you saw i did in as few words as i could she listened and then nodded slowly it hardly seems like what happened to them happened to rosie maybe rawlins and i got there in time i said maybe it hadnt had time to do more than a little foreplay or maybe theres another reason murphy said remind me to lecture you about the interest rate on borrowed trouble i said simplest explanation is the one to go with until we find out something to the contrary murphy nodded if this creature hit the convention twice it will probably do it again seems to me that maybe we should advise them to close it down no convention no attacks right too late for that i said she tilted her head what do you mean the creature feeds on fear its attracted to it i said if they shut down the convention it will scare a lot of people news reports will do that too not the same way i said a news report might unsettle some folks but the people at the convention here the ones who knew the victims who were in the same buildingsit will hit them harder it will make what happened here something dangerous something real if the attacker is that dangerous they should be afraid murphy said except that intense fear will attract the attacker again i said in fact enough of it would attract more predators of the same nature more murphy said her voice sharp like blood in the water draws in sharks i said only instead of being at the convention the targets will be scattered all over chicago right now the only advantage we have is that we know generally where the thing is going to strike again if the convention closes we lose that advantage and the next chance we get to pick up its trail will be when the next corpse turns up murphy shook her head what do you need from me for now a ride home i said ill have some consulting to do and i suddenly ground my teeth dammit i almost forgot what ive got a lunch meeting i cant miss more important than this she asked i cant let it slide i said council stuff maybe important she shook her head you take too much responsibility on yourself harry youre just one man a good man but youre still only human this is what happens when i dont wear the coat i opined people start thinking im not a superhero she snorted and we started back toward her car im serious she said you cant be everywhere at once you cant stop all the bad things that are going to happen doesnt mean someone shouldnt try i said maybe but you take it personal you tear yourself up over it like with that girl just now she shook her head i hate to see you like that youve got worries enough without beating yourself up for things you didnt do i shrugged and fell quiet until we got back to the car then i said i just cant stand it i cant stand seeing people get hurt like that i hate it she regarded me steadily and nodded me too mouse thumped his head against my leg and leaned on me so that i could feel his warmth that settled we all got into murphys car so that i could track down i knew not what just as soon as i got done opening an entirely new can of worms with the summer knight chapter eighteen at my request murphy dropped me off a couple of blocks from home so that i could give mouse at least a little chance to stretch his legs he seemed appreciative and walked along sniffing busily his tail fanning the air i kept a watch out behind me meanwhile but my unknown tail did not appear i kept an eye out for any other people or vehicles that might have been following me in case he was working with a team but i didnt spot anyone suspicious that didnt stop me from keeping a paranoid eye over my shoulder until we made it back to the old boardinghouse and i went down the stairs to my apartment door i muttered my defensive wards down temporarily neutralizing powerful constructions of magic that i had placed around my apartment shortly after the beginning of the war with the red court i opened the dead bolt on the steel door twisted the handle and then slammed my shoulder into the door as hard as i could to open it the door flew open to a distance of five or six whole inches i kicked it a few times to open it the rest of the way then tromped in with mouse and looked up to find the barrel of a choppeddown shotgun six inches from my face those things are illegal you know i said thomas scowled at me from the other end of the shotgun and lowered the weapon i heard a metallic click as he put the safety back on youve got to get that door fixed every time you come in it sounds like an assault team boy i replied letting mouse off his lead one little siege and you get all paranoid what can i say he turned and slipped the shotgun into his bulging sports bag which sat on the floor by the door i never counted on starring in my own personal zombie movie dont kid yourself i said mister flew across the room and pitched all thirty pounds of himself into a friendly shoulder block against my legs it was my movie you were a spearcarrier a supporting role tops its nice to be appreciated he said beer sure thomas sauntered over to the icebox he was wearing jeans sneakers and a white cotton tshirt i frowned at the sports bag his trunk an old militarysurplus footlocker sat on the ground beside the bag padlocked shut between the trunk and the bag i figured pretty much every material possession he owned now sat on the floor by my door he came back over to me with a couple of cold brown bottles of macs ale and flicked the tops off of both of them at the same time with his thumbs mac would kill you if he knew you were chilling it i took my bottle studying his face but his expression gave away little mac can come over here and install airconditioning then if he wants me to drink it warm in the middle of summer thomas chuckled we clinked bottles and drank youre leaving i said a minute later he took another sip and said nothing you werent going to tell me i said he rolled a shoulder in a shrug then he nodded at an envelope on the fireplaces mantel my new address and phone number theres some money in there for you thomas i said he swigged beer and shook his head no take it you offered to let me stay with you until i got on my feet ive been here almost two years i owe you no i said he frowned harry please i stared at him for a minute and struggled with a bunch of conflicting emotions part of me was childishly relieved that i would have my tiny apartment to myself again a much larger part of me felt suddenly empty and worried still another part felt a sense of excitement and happiness for thomas ever since he started crashing on my couch thomas had been recovering from wounds of his own for a while there i had feared that despair and selfloathing were going to cause him to implode and i had somehow known that his desire to get out on his own again was a sign of recovery part of that recovery i was sure was thomas regaining a measure of pride and selfconfidence thats why hed left the money on the mantel pride i couldnt turn down the money without taking that pride from him except for scattered memories of my father thomas was the only blood family id ever had thomas had faced danger and death beside me without hesitation had guarded me in my sleep tended me when id been injured and once in a while hed even cooked we got on each others nerves sometimes sure but that hadnt ever altered the fundamental fact of who we were to one another we were brothers everything else was temporary i met his eyes and asked quietly are you going to be all right he smiled a little and shrugged i think so i tilted my head whered the money come from my job i lifted my eyebrows you found a job you could hold he winced a little sorry i said but i know youd had so much trouble specifically hed been subjected to the amorous attentions of various fellow employees who had been drawn to him to such a degree that it had practically been assault being an incubus was probably easier at night clubs and celebrity parties than at a drivethrough or a cash register you found something something without people he said he smiled easily as he spoke but i sensed an undercurrent of deception in it he wasnt telling me the whole truth ive been there a while yeah i asked where he evaded me effortlessly a place down off lake view ive finally earned a little extra i just wanted to pay you back you must be getting all kinds of overtime i said as near as i can figure it youve been putting in eighty and ninetyhour weeks he shrugged his smile a mask working hard i took another sip of beer which was excellent even cold and thought it over if he didnt want to talk about it he wasnt going to talk about it pushing him wouldnt make him any more likely to tell me i didnt get the sense that he was in trouble and while he had one hell of a poker face id lived with him long enough to see through it most of the time thomas hadnt ever supported himself before now that he was sure he could do it it had become something he valued getting out on his own was something he needed to do i wouldnt be doing him any favors by interfering you sure youll be okay i asked him something showed through the mask thenembarrassment ill be all right its past time for me to get out on my own not if you arent ready i said harry come on so far weve been lucky the council hasnt noticed me here but with all of your warden stuff sooner or later somebodys going to show up and find you rooming with a white court vampire i grimaced that would be a mess i agreed but i dont mind chancing it if you need the time and i dont mind getting out on my own to avoid making trouble for you with the council he said besides im just covering my own ass i dont want to cross them myself i wouldnt let them thomas burst out in a brief genuine laugh christ harry youre my brother not my mother ill be fine now that i wont be here to make you look bad maybe you can finally start having girls over again bite me prettyboy i said you need any help moving or anything nah he finished the beer i just have one box and one bag cabs on the way he paused unless you need my help with a case or something ive got until monday to move in i shook my head im working with si on this one so ive got plenty of support i think i can get things locked down by tonight thomas gave me a flat look now youve done it what i asked you predicted quick victory now its going to get hopelessly complicated jesus dont you know any better than that by now i grinned at him youd think that i would i finished my beer and offered my brother my hand he gripped it if you need anything call me he said ditto thank you little brother he said quietly i blinked my eyes a couple of times yeah my couch is always open unless theres a girl over outside wheels crunched on gravel and a car horn sounded theres my ride he said oh do you mind if i borrow the shotgun just until i can replace it go ahead i told him ive still got my thanks he bent over and swung the heavy footlocker onto one shoulder without effort he picked up the sports bag slung the strap over his other shoulder and opened the door easily with one hand he glanced back winked at me and shut the door behind him i stared at the closed door for a minute car doors opened and closed wheels crunched as the cab drove away and my apartment suddenly seemed a couple of sizes too large mouse let out a long sigh and came over to me to nudge his head underneath my hand i scratched his ears for a minute and said hell be all right dont worry about him mouse sighed again ill miss him too i told the dog then i shook myself and told mouse dont get comfortable were going to go visit mac you can meet the summer knight i went around getting everything i needed for a formal meeting with the summer knight called another cab and sat in my tooquiet apartment wondering what it was my brother was hiding from me chapter nineteen mcanallys pub is on the bottom floor of a building not too far from my office chicago being what it isessentially a giant swamp with a city sinking into itthe building had settled over the years and to enter the pub you had to come in the door and take a couple of steps down its a lowceilinged room or at least its always felt that way to me and it offers the added attraction of several whirling ceiling fans at my eye level just as i come in the door and after stepping down into the room theyre still uncomfortably close to my head theres a sign macs got hanging up at the door that reads accorded neutral ground it means that the place was supposed to be a nocombat zone under the terms laid out in the unseelie accords the most recent and influential set of principles agreed upon by most of the various nations of the supernatural maybe ten or twelve years ago by the terms of the accords theres no fighting allowed between members of opposing nations in the bar and were not supposed to attempt to provoke anybody either if things do get hostile the accords say you have to take it outside or risk censure by the signatory nations more importantly at least to me mac was a friend when i came to his place to eat i considered myself a guest and he my host id abide by his declared neutrality out of simple respect but it was good to know that the accords were there in the background not every member of the supernatural community is as polite and neighborly as me macs place is one big room there are a bakers dozen of thick wooden support pillars spread through the room each of them carved with figures from old world nursery tales theres a bar with thirteen stools thirteen tables spread irregularly throughout the room and the whole place has an informal comfortable asymmetrical sort of feel to it i came through the door armed for bear and projecting an attitude to match i bore my staff in my left hand and id slipped my new blasting rod a shaft of wood two feet long and as thick as my two thumbs together through my belt my shield bracelet hung on my left hand my force ring was on my right and mouse walked on my right side on his lead looking huge and sober and alert a couple of people inside looked at my face and immediately tried to look like they had no interest in me i wasnt in a bad mood but i wanted to look that way since the war with the red court had gotten rolling i had learned the hard way that predators human and otherwise sense fear and look for weakness so i walked into the place like i was hoping to kick someone in the neck because it was a hell of a lot easier to discourage potential predators ahead of time than it was to slug it out with them when they followed me out afterward i crossed the room to the bar and mac nodded at me mac was a lean man somewhere between thirty and fifty he wore his usual dark clothes and spotless white apron while simultaneously managing all the bartending and a big woodburning grill where he cooked various dishes for the customers the summer heat was fairly well blunted by the shade and the fans and the partially subterranean nature of the room but there were still dark spots of sweat on his clothes and beading along the bare skin of his scalp mac knew what the toughguy face was about and it clearly didnt bother him he nodded to me as i sat down on a stool mac you got any cold beer back there somewhere he gave me an unamused look i leaned my staff on the bar lifted both hands in a placating gesture and said kidding but tell me youve got cold lemonade its a zillion degrees out there he answered with a glass of lemonade cooled with his patented lemonade ice cubes so that you could drink it cold and not have it get watered down all at the same time mac is pretty much a genius when it comes to drinks and his steak sandwiches should be considered some kind of national resource business he asked me i nodded meeting with fix mac grunted and went out to a corner table one with a clear view of the door he nudged it out a bit from the wall polished it with a cloth and straightened the chairs around it i nodded my thanks to him and settled down at the table with my lemonade i didnt have long to wait a couple of minutes before noon the summer knight opened the door and came in fix had grown and i mean that literally hed been about five foot three maybe an inch or so higher now he had towered up to at least five nine hed been a wiry little guy with whiteblond hair and most of that remained true the wire had thickened to lean cable but the shock of spikes hed worn as a hairdo had gotten traded in on a more typical cut for faerie noblesa shoulderlength do fix hadnt been a goodlooking guy and the extra height and muscle and the hair did absolutely nothing to change that what had changed was his previous manner which had been approximately equal parts nervous and cheerful the summer knight projected confidence and strength they shone from him like light from a star when he opened the door the dim shadows retreated somewhat and a whispering breeze that smelled of pine and honeysuckle rolled through the room the air around him did something to the light throwing it back cleaner more pure more fierce than it had been before it touched him fix wasnt putting on a face like i had this was what he had become the summer knight mortal champion of the seelie court a thunderstorm in blue jeans and a green cotton shirt his gaze went first to mac and he gave the barkeep a polite little bow of respect then he turned to me grinned and nodded harry fix i said been a while youve grown he looked down at himself and looked briefly like the flustered young man i had first met it sort of snuck up on me life has a way of doing that i agreed i hope you dont mind someone else wanted to speak to you too he turned his head and said something and a breath later the summer lady entered the tavern lily had never been hard on the eyes the daughter of one of the sidhe and a mortal shed had the looks usually reserved for magazines and movie stars but like fix she had grown not physically though a somewhat juvenile eye might have made certain comparisons to the past and somehow found them even more appealing what had changed most was the bashful uncertainty that had filled her every word and movement the old lily had hardly been able to take care of herself this was the summer lady youngest of the seelie queens and when she came in the room the whole place suddenly seemed more alive the lingering taste of lemonade on my tongue became more intensely sour and sweet i could hear every whisper of wind around every lazily spinning fan blade in the room and all of them murmured gentle music together she wore a simple sundress of green starkly contrasting the silken waterfall of purest white tresses that fell to her waist more than that she carried around her a sense of purpose a kind of quiet gentle strength something as steady and warming and powerful as summer sunlight her face too had gained character the awkward shyness in her eyes replaced with a kind of gentle perception a continual quiet laughter leavened with just a touch of sadness she stepped forward between two of the carved wooden columns and the flowers wrought into the wood upon them twitched and then burst into sudden blooms of living color everyone there myself included stopped breathing for a second mac recovered first lily he said and bowed his head to her good to see you she smiled warmly at his use of her name mac she replied do you still make those lemonade ice cubes two fix said grinning more broadly he offered his arm to lily and she laid her hand upon it both gestures so familiar to them that they didnt need to think about them anymore they came over to the table and i rose politely until fix had seated lily then we mere menfolk sat down again mac came with drinks and departed so fix said whats up harry lily sipped lemonade through a straw i tried not to stare and drool um ive been asked to get in touch with you i said after the red courts attack last year when they encroached on faerie territory we were kind of expecting a response we were wondering why there hadnt been one we meaning the council lily asked quietly her voice was calm but something just under its surface warned me that the answer might be important we meaning me and some people i know this isnt exactly ah official fix and lily exchanged a look she nodded once and fix exhaled and said good good i was hoping that would be the case i am not permitted to speak for the summer court to the white council lily explained but you have a prior claim of friendship to both myself and my knight and there is nothing to prevent me from speaking to an old friend regarding troubled times i glanced back and forth between them for a moment before i said so why havent the sidhe laid the smack down on the red court lily sighed a complicated matter just start at the beginning and explain it from there i suggested which beginning she asked and whose i felt my eyebrows arch up hells bells lily i wasnt expecting the usual sidhe word games from you calm remote beauty covered her face like a mask i know seems to me that youre a couple of points in the red when it comes to favors given and received i said between that mess in oklahoma and your predecessor i know she said again her expression showing me less than nothing i leaned back into my chair for a second glaring at her feeling that same old frustration rising damn but i hated trying to deal with the sidhe summer or winter they were both an enormous pain in the ass harry fix said with gentle emphasis she isnt always free to speak like hell she isnt i said shes the summer lady but titania is the summer queen fix told me and if youll forgive me for pointing out something so obvious it wasnt so long ago that you murdered titanias daughter what does that have to do with anything i began but snapped my lips closed over the last word of course when lily had become the summer lady she got the whole packageand it went way beyond simply turning her hair white she would have to follow the bizarre set of limits and rules to which all of the faerie queens seemed bound and more importantly it meant she would have to obey the more powerful queens of summer titania and mother summer are you telling me that titania has ordered you both not to help me i asked them they stared back at me with faerie poker faces that told me nothing i nodded beginning to understand you arent permitted to speak officially for summer and titanias laid some kind of compulsion on you both to prevent you from helping me on a personal level i said hasnt she had there been crickets i would have heard them clearly had my table companions been statues id have gotten more reaction from them youre not supposed to help me youre not supposed to tell me about the compulsion i followed the chain of logic a step further but you want to help so here you are which means that the only way i could get information out of you is to approach it indirectly or else the compulsion would force you to shut up am i close cheepcheep if it went on much longer theyd have to worry about inbound pigeons i frowned a little and thought about it for a minute then i asked theoretically speaking i said what kinds of things might prevent winter and summer from reacting to an incursion by another nation lilys eyes sparkled and she nodded to fix the little guy turned to me and said in theory only a few things could do it the simplest would be a lack of respect for the strength of the incurring nation if the queens considered them no threat there would be no need to act uhhuh i said go on a much more serious reason would be an issue of the balance of power between the courts of summer and winter any reaction to the invasion would alter what resources one would have at hand if one court did not act in concert with the other it would provide an ideal opportunity for a surprise assault while the other had its strategic back turned i rubbed my hands along my thighs squinting one eye shut let me see if ive put this together right summers ready to throw down but winter isnt gonna help because apparently theyd rather take a poke at you guys when you were focused on another threat i took fixs silence as an affirmative thats insane i said if that happens both courts are going to suffer both of you will be weakened no matter who came out on top theyd be easy pickings for the reds theoretically speaking an imbalance between winter and summer is nothing new lily said it has existed since the time when we first met you harry it continues today because of the fate of the current winter knight i grimaced christ hes still alive after what almost four years fix shuddered i saw him once the man was a psycho a drug addict and a murderer and a rapist lily interjected in a quiet sad voice and that fix agreed his expression grim i could break his neck and not lose a minutes sleep but no one deserves he swallowed his face going pale that the moron betrayed mab i said quietly he knew the risks when he did it no fix said with another shudder believe me harry he didnt know what would happen to him he couldnt have fixs obvious discomfort made a certain impression on me especially given that mab had displayed an unnerving amount of interest in me and that i still owed her a couple of favors i shifted uneasily in my chair and tried to blow it off whatever i said theres a summer knight theres a winter knight whats unbalanced about that he isnt exerting his power fix replied hes a prisoner and everyone knows it he has no freedom no will he cant stand on the side of winter as its champion so far as the tension between the courts goes the winter knight might as well not exist all right i murmured mabs got a man in the penalty box she wants to take the offensive before summer pushes a power play and shes looking for ways to even the odds if summer goes running off to take on the reds it will give her a chance to strike i shook my head i dont pretend to know mab very well but she isnt suicidal if the imbalance is so dangerous why is she keeping the winter knight alive to begin with and she must see what the consequences of another wintersummer war would be i looked back and forth between them right unfortunately lily said quietly our intelligence about the internal politics of winter is very limitedand mab is not the sort to reveal her mind to another i do not know if she realizes the potential danger her actions of late have been she closed her eyes for a moment and then said with some obvious effort erratic i propped up my chin on the heel of my hand thinking mabs a lot of things i said thoughtfully but she sure as hell isnt erratic shes like some damned big glacier not a thing you can do to stop her but at least you know just how shes going to move whats the bard say constant as the northern star fix frowned as if struggling with an internal decision for a minute then let out an exasperated sigh and said i think many who know the sidhe would agree with you which was neither a confirmation nor a denialtechnically at any rate but then sidhe magic and bindings tended to lean heavily toward the technical details i sat back slowly again thoughts flickering over dozens of ideas and bits of information putting them together into a larger picture and it wasnt a pretty one the last time one of the faerie queens had come a little bit unbalanced the situation had become a potential global catastrophe on the same order of magnitude as a middling large meteor impact or a limited nuclear exchange and that had been the youngest queen of the gentler and more reasonable summer lilys predecessor aurora the late aurora i suppose if mab had blown a gasket matters wouldnt be just as bad they would be worse a lot worse ive got to know more about this one i told them quietly i know lily said she lifted her hand to a temple and closed her eyes in a faint frown of pain but she shook her head and fell silent again as titanias binding sealed her tongue i glanced at fix who managed to whisper sorry harry before he too closed his eyes and looked vaguely ill i need answers i murmured thinking aloud but you cant give them to me and there cant be all that many people who know whats going on silence and faint expressions of pain after a few seconds fix said i think weve done all we can here i racked my brains for a few seconds more and then said no you havent lily opened her eyes and looked at me arching a perfect silverwhite brow i need someone with the right information and who isnt under a compulsion not to help me and i can only think of one person who fits the bill lilys eyes widened a second after i got done speaking can you do it i asked her right now she chewed her lower lip for a second then nodded call her i said fix looked back and forth between us i dont understand what are you doing something stupid probably i said but this is too big i need more information lily closed her eyes and folded her hands on her lap her expression relaxing into one of deep concentration i could feel the subtle stir of energy around her my stomach rumbled i asked mac to whip me up a steak sandwich and settled down to wait it didnt take long my sandwich wasnt halfway done when mouse let out a sudden rumbling growl of warning and the temperature in the bar dropped about ten degrees the whirling ceiling fans let out mechanical moans of protest and spun faster then the door opened and let in sunlight made wan by a patch of dreary grey clouds the light cast a slender black silhouette fixs eyes narrowed his hands slid casually out of sight beneath the table and he said oh her the young woman who entered the bar could have been lilys sister she had the same exotic beauty the same canted feline eyes the same pale flawless skin but this ones hair was worn in long ragged strands of varying lengths like a raggedy ann doll each one dyed a slightly different color from frozen seaspale blues and greens as though each had borrowed its color from a different glacier her eyes were a cold brilliant shade of green almost entirely darkened by pupils dilated as though with drugs or arousal a slender silver hoop gleamed at one side of her nose and a collar of black leather studded with silver snowflakes encircled the graceful line of her slender throat she wore sandals and cutoff blue jean shortsvery cutoff and very tight a tight white tshirt strained across her chest and read in pale blue letters stretched into intriguing curves your boyfriend wants me she prowled across the room to us all hips and lips and fascinating eyes looking far too young to move with such wanton sensuality i knew better she could have been a century old she chose to look the way she did because of what she was the winter lady youngest queen of the unseelie court mabs understudy in wickedness and power when she walked by the flowers that had bloomed in lilys presence they froze over withered and died she gave them no more notice than lily had harry dresden she said her voice low lulling and sweet and i said hello maeve chapter twenty maeve stared at me for a long minute and licked her lips look at you she all but purred all pent up like that you havent had a woman in ages have you i hadnt i really really hadnt but that wasnt the kind of thinking that a professional investigator allowed to clog up the gears in his brain i could have said something back but i decided that if i ignored the taunt maybe shed get bored and leave me alone so instead of taking up the verbal epee i rose and drew out a chair for her politely sit with us maeve her head tilted almost all the way to her shoulder she stared at me with those intense green eyes just boiling over maybe you and i should have a private talk just the two of us my libido seconded the suggestion and heartily my libido and i generally dont see eye to eye dammit id rather just sit and have a nice chat i said to her liar maeve said smiling i sighed all right there are a lot of things id love to do but the only thing thats going to happen is a nice chat so you might as well sit down and let me get you a drink her head tilted the other way her hips shifted in a kind of counterpoint that drew the eye how long has it been for you wizard how long since you sated yourself the answer was depressing last time i saw susan i guess maeve made a disgusted sound no not love wizard need flesh the two arent mutually exclusive i said she waved that off with an expression of contempt i want an answer looks to me like theres all kinds of things you want that you arent going to get i told her i glanced at fix and lily throwing a mute appeal into it fix gave me an apologetic shrug and lily sighed you might as well indulge her harry shes as stubborn as any of us the only one who might give you the answers you need and she knows it i looked back at maeve who gave me that same eerie intensely sensual smile tell me mortal when was the last time flesh new and strange to your hand lay quivering beneath you hmm she leaned down until her eyes were inches from mine i could smell winter mint and something lush and corrupt like rotted flowers on her breath when was the last time you could taste and feel some little lovelys cries i regarded her without any expression and said in a gentle voice technically when i killed aurora maeves expression flickered with an instant of uncertainty you remember aurora i told her quiedy the last summer lady your peer your equal when she died shed been cut several dozen times with cold iron she was bleeding out but she was still trying to stick a knife in lily so i tackled her and held her down she kept struggling until she lost too much blood and then she died in the grass on the hill of the stone table dead silence filled the whole place it sort of surprised me i said never putting any particular emotion on the words how fast it happened it surprised her too she was confused when she died maeve only stared at me i never wanted to kill her but she didnt leave me any choice i let the silence fill the room for a moment and stared at maeves eyes the winter lady swallowed and eased her weight a tiny bit away from me then i gestured with one hand at the chair i still held out for her and said lets be polite to one another maeve please she took a slow breath soulless inhuman eyes on mine and then said i know now why mab wants you she straightened and gave me an odd little bow which might have looked more courtly had she been wearing a gown then she sat and said does the barkeep still have those sweetlemon chips of ice of course i said mac another lemonade for the lady please mac provided it in his usual silence as he did the few people who were in the place cleared out most of the magical community of chicago knew the ladies by reputation if not on sight and they wanted nothing to do with any kind of incident between winter and summer they were safer if they were never noticed hell if i could have snuck out i would have led the way when id defeated aurora there had been a healthy chunk of luck involved i caught her with a sucker punch if shed been focused on taking me out instead of finishing her scheme i doubt i would have survived the evening sure i might have stared maeve down but ultimately i was bluffingtrying to fool the oncoming shark into thinking i might be something that could eat it if the shark decided to start taking bites anyhow things would get unpleasant for me but this time at least the shark didnt know that maeve waited for her lemonade wrapped her lips idly around the straw and sipped then she settled back into her seat chewing crunching sounds came from her mouth the lemonade had frozen solid when it passed her lips which made me feel pretty damned smart for avoiding the whole sexual temptation issue maeve looked at lily steadily as she chewed and then said to me you know my last knight often dragged this one before the court for performances all kinds of performances some of them hurt and some of them didnt though she still cried out prettily enough she smiled her tone polite and conversational do you remember the night he made you dance for me in the red shoes lily lilys green eyes settled on maeve calm and placid as a forest pool maeves smile sharpened do you remember what i did to you after lily smiled a tired little expression and shook her head im sorry maeve i know how much pleasure you take in gloating but you cant hurt me with that now that lily is no more maeve narrowed her eyes and then her gaze shifted to fix and this one ive seen this little man weeping like a child begging for mercy fix sipped at his lemonade and said for the love of god maeve would you give the evil kinkstress act a rest it gets tired pretty fast the winter lady let out an exasperated breath put down her drink and folded her arms sullenly across her chest very well maeve said her tone petulant what is it you wish to know wizard id like to know why mab hasnt been striking back at the red court after they trespassed on sidhe territory during the battle last year maeve arched a brow at me that is knowledge and therefore power what are you prepared to trade for it forgetfulness i said maeve tilted her head i can think of nothing in particular i would like to forget i can think of something you want me to forget maeve can you i smiled with teeth id be willing to forget what you did at billy and georgias wedding pardon maeve said i dont seem to recall being present she knew the score she knew that i knew it too her legality pissed me off of course i replied you werent there but your handmaiden was jenny greenteeth maeves lips parted in sudden surprise i saw through her glamour didnt you know who shut her down i asked her lifting my own eyebrows in faux innocence that was petty cruelty maeve even for you trying to ruin their marriage your wolf children did me a petty wrong maeve replied they killed a favorite hireling of the winter court they owed their loyalty to dresden when they killed the tigress lily murmured even as did the little folk he used against aurora they acted with his consent and upon his will maeve you know our laws maeve gave lily a dirty look that was almost human for what happened that night they were mine i put my hands flat on the table and leaned a little toward maeve speaking with as much quiet intensity as i could i protect what is mine you should know that by now i have lawful reason for a quarrel with you maeves attention moved back to me and her expression became remote and alien what is it you propose im willing to let things go as they are all accounts settled in exchange for an honest answer to my question i settled back in my chair and asked why hasnt winter moved against the red court maeve regarded me with an odd little twinkle in her eye then nodded and said mab has not allowed it fix and lily traded a quick look of surprise sooth maeve said nodding evidently enjoying their reaction the queen has readied her forces to strike at summer and has furthermore given specific orders preventing her captains from conducting operations against the red court thats madness lily said quietly maeve folded her hands on the table frowning at something far away and said it may well be dark things stir in winters heart things even i have never before seen dangerous things i believe they are a portent i tilted my head a little focused on her how so what aurora attempted was insane even among the sidhe maeve replied her actions could have thrown enormous forces out of balance to the ruin of all her heart was in the right place fix said his tone mildly defensive maybe i told him as gently as i could but good intent doesnt amount to much when the consequences are epically screwed up maeve shook her head hearts good evil mortals are always concerned with such nonsense she abruptly rose her mind clearly elsewhere something in her expression or manner gave me a sudden sense that she was worried deeply truly worried little miss overlord was frightened these mortal notions maeve said good evil love all those other things your kind natter on about are they perhaps contagious i rose with her politely some would say so i told her she grimaced in the time since her death i have often thought to myself that aurora was stricken with some mortal madness i believe the queen of air and darkness has been taken by a similar contagion she suddenly shuddered and said voice curt i have answered you with truth and more than needed be said does that satisfy the accounting mortal aye i told her nodding good enough for me then i take my leave she turned took half a step and there was a sudden gust of frozen air that knocked her mostly full glass of lemonade onto the floor it froze in a lumpy puddle somewhere between tabletop and floor maeve vanished the three of us sat there quietly for a moment she was lying fix said she cant lie lily and i said at exactly the same moment lily yielded the issue to me with a gesture of her hand and i told fix she cant speak an outright lie fix none of the sidhe can you know that he frowned and made a frustrated helpless little gesture with his hand but mab insane it does fit with our concerns lily told him quietly fix looked a little green around the edges i loved her like a sister but auroras madness was bad enough if mab sets out to send the world on a downward spiral i mean i cant even imagine the kind of things she could do i can i said quietly i would suggest that you relay word of this to titania lady and take that as official concern from the council please also convey the message that the council is naturally interested in preserving the balance in faerie it would be of value to all of us to cooperate in order to learn more lily nodded once at me indeed i will do so she shivered and closed her eyes for a second her expression distressed harry im very sorry but the bindings on me i stretch the bounds of my proper place fix nodded decisively and rose he took lilys arm i wish we could have done more to help you dont worry about it i said rising politely to my feet again you did what you could i appreciate it lily gave me a strained smile she and fix departed quick and quiet the door never opened but a breath later they were both gone mouse sat there next to the table cocking his head left and right his ears attentively forward as though trying to figure that one out i sat at the table and sipped lemonade without much enthusiasm more trouble in faerie bigger trouble in faerie and id be willing to bet dollars to navel lint that i knew exactly which stupid son of a bitch the council would expect to start poking his nose around in it i put the lemonade down it suddenly tasted very sour mac arrived he took my lemonade he replaced it with a beer i flicked the top off with my thumb and put it away in a long pull it was warm and it tasted too much but the gentle bite of the alcohol in it was pleasant enough to make me want another mac showed up with another mac can sometimes be downright angelic theyve changed i told him fix and lily its like they arent even the same people anymore mac grunted once then he said they grew up maybe thats it i fell back into a brooding silence and mac left me to it i finished the second beer more slowly but i didnt have a lot of time to lose i nodded my thanks to mac left money on the table and took up mouses leash we headed for the door i had other business to take care of nebulous maybethreats would have to wait for the monsters i was sure would show up in a few hours at least id gotten out of the whole situation without someone trying to kill me or declaring war on the council id had a civil conversation with both lady winter and lady summer and come away from it unscathed as i walked toward the door though an idle thought gnawed at me it had hardly been like pulling out teeth at all chapter twentyone i headed back for splattercon before the afternoon was half gone this time with my backpack of wizard toys my staff my blasting rod my dog my gun and a partridge in a pear tree i didnt have a concealedcarry permit for the but working on the theory that it was better to have the gun and not need it than to need it and not have it i put it in the backpack when i got to splattercon i decided that it very well might have been better not to have the damned gun on me there was something of a police presence in evidence two patrol cars were parked in plain sight outside the hotel and one cop in uniform stood sweating and miserablelooking outside the doors as i paid off the cabby i picked out at least two loiterers in street clothes who were paying too much attention to who and what approached the building to be casual strollers taking advantage of spots of shade outside the hotel i clipped on my splattercon name tag the cops eyes flicked over me and i could all but see him take stock of metall guy gaunt mussed hair dark eyes big dog sticks backpack i one hand in a leather glove and a horror convention name tag evidently in this guys head a name tag gave you carte blanche to look weird without being threatening because when his eyes got to that he just traded a nod with me and waved me through inside not only was the convention in full swing but they had added a press conference to it to boot the conference wing outside the room where the killer struck was packed with a half circle of reporters and photographers while industrious satellite personnel held up lights and even a couple of boom microphones from the door i could see three more uniformed officers between the cops the conference and the passersby that whole section of the hotel was packed with a lot of noisy people the airconditioning had been pushed well beyond its limits and it was stuffy and smelled like most crowded buildings mouse sneezed and looked mournful i agreed with him murphy appeared out of the crowd and made her way to me she gave me a tight nod and knelt down to speak to mouse and scratch behind his ears howd your meeting go she asked survived it storm clouds on the horizon i looked around the place a minute more and said for crying out loud its a zoo it gets better murphy said ive been speaking with the convention staff and they say that since the story hit the news and the radio stations at noon theyve almost doubled the number of attendees crap i sighed theres more greene called in the feds she said i frowned last time the feds showed up was less than fun tell me about it she hesitated and then said rick is with them i blinked at her for a second and then remembered oh right the ex exhusband murphy said her tone sour her back was rigidly straight and her eyes flickered with stormy emotions current brotherinlaw which is icky i said and i dont like him being here murphy said but it isnt my call and its possible that i have issues i snorted she gave me a brief smile this has been splashy enough that theyve got one of the major forensics units from the east coast on the way i scowled maybe he should have blown a few trumpets too or brought in a marching band i think if he hurries he can probably rent some of those big swiveling spotlights before dark she rolled her eyes i get the point harry you dont like all the noise i dont like all the potential victims i said fifty bucks says the extra attendees are mostly minors no bet she replied does it matter maybe in general young people especially adolescents feel emotions much more intensely the whole hormone thing it can make them easier targets richer sources of energy then why did it hit an old geezer like pell first i opened my mouth and then closed it again good point besides she continued isnt it a good thing if more people are paying attention from what youve told me things from the spooky side of the street dont like crowds in general no i said but the place wasnt exactly a ghost town yesterday when the phobophage showed up you think it will appear right in front of all these people she asked i think crowds arent going to deter it i think that if something bad happens the more people there are around the more fear its going to generate and the more our killer gets to eat and a panic with more people means even more people get hurt murphys pale golden brows knitted into a frown so what options can you give me theres no guarantee but i think well have until nightfall why because it will be stronger after dark murphy frowned you think thats why pell survived his attack she murmured it was still daylight got it in one i said assuming we have until sundown it gives us a little time to work doing what setting up some wards i said like at your place i shook my head nothing that complex theres no time i cant build a moat around this place but i think i can throw together a web that will let us know when and where something comes over from the nevernever ill need to walk around a lot of the building to cover it all she nodded that doesnt address the crowd issue i grimaced you know anyone in the fire department a cousin she said this place must be over maximum occupancy maybe if the fire marshal heard about how crowded it was theyd clear at least some of these people out we only need a crowd big enough to tempt the killer in she nodded ill see to it and i know its a long shot but has cpd turned up anything or the me nothing on the autopsy they didnt give this one to butters brioche handled it and he didnt find anything out of the ordinary naturally i sighed greene theories he had some vague notion that the attack might have been some kind of publicity stunt to attract attention to the convention thats a little cynical i said greene isnt a believer murphy said and hes a trained investigator looking for a solid motive if he accepts that the killer was just some kind of lunatic it means hes got almost nothing to work with so hes grasping at straws and hoping he can find something familiar he can use to nail the killer fast i grunted guess i can see that i dont envy him murphy said i dont like him much but hes a cop and hes in a tight spot chances are theres not a damned thing he could do about it and he doesnt even know it there was a little extra weight on the last phrase something that contained personal pain murphy had faced the same situations as greene more or less something wild happened and none of it made any sense murphy had her first faceoff with the supernatural while she was still a beat cop on patrol it gave her an advantage as a detective because at least she knew how much she didnt know greene didnt even have that much going for him i hated to see her like that feeling helpless to do anything hurting even if only in memory how about you i asked you see anything that you think is worth mentioning not yet someone around here has got to know something useful even if they dont know that they do she tilted her head and frowned at me wait youre asking me i shrugged a shoulder murph youve seen as much weird as most wizards i think youre more capable than you know she studied my face for a long moment what do you mean i shrugged again i mean that youve been there a time or two you know what its like when something is lurking around theres commonality to it youll know it when you feel it what am i supposed to be a wizard now i grinned just a savvy cop chick murph cop chick she asked menace in her voice sorry i said police chick she grunted thats better just dont ignore your instincts i said theyre there for a reason murphy wasnt listening to that last part because shed turned her head sharply to one side blue eyes narrowing as she focused on a man who had emerged from a conference room doorway and was slipping down the hall and mouse let out a low growl whos that i asked murphy darby crane murphy said ah i said the horror movie director mouse growled again murphy and he started after crane why fight the inevitable i started walking before mouse pulled my arms out of their sockets hey howsabout we go talk to him you think murphy said take him ill back you up she nodded without turning around excuse me she told a gang of conventiongoers in front of her coming through please we tried to hurry through the crowd but it was like trying to run in chestdeep water the faster you try to move the more resistance there is crane moved through them like an eel a spare man of medium height in slacks and a dark blazer murphy forged ahead making room for me to follow while i put my height to good use to keep an eye on crane he beat us to a comparatively empty side hallway that led back to groundfloor guest rooms and elevators by the time we got into the clear the elevator doors had opened murphy hurried forward and shot a glance over her shoulder at me then jerked her chin at the elevators i grinned there are times when i hate it that technology has such problems operating around wizards and then there are the times when its sort of fan i made a mild effort of will focused my thoughts on the elevators and murmured hexus nebulous and unseen energy fluttered down the hallway and when the hex hit the elevators there was a sudden hiss of sparks at one edge of the panel with the call button and an oozing smoke dribbled out a moment later the doors started to close then a bell went bing the doors sprang open again that happened a couple of more times before murphy closed to the elevator and caught up to darby crane i slowed my pace holding on to mouse and lurked several feet away trying to blend in by reading a wall full of flyers announcing various parties at the convention crane was a surprisingly goodlooking manslender stark cheekbones and his demeanor was more like an actors than that of someone on the production side his dark hair was in a short neat cut dark eyes deepset and opaque and he carried himself in a posture that read nothing but relaxed nonaggression before id finished looking him over i was sure that the whole thing was a calculated lie there was cruelty lurking below the calm of his features contempt hiding within the modest posture of his body as murphy approached he stepped out of the elevator frowning at the smoke his eyes snapped to her and around the hallway at once there were several other people standing not far away outside of a guest room with an open door he judged them then murphy for a moment and then turned to face her his mouth settling into a polite bland little perjury of a smile so hard to rely upon technology these days he said his glance moving over me as part of the background scenery i thought he had a surprisingly deep resonant voice may i help you officer lieutenant actually she told him without rancor my name is karrin murphy im with chicago police department special investigations crane said i know alarm bells went off in my head i doubted crane would recognize it but murphys stance shifted subtly becoming more wary have we met mr crane in a way ive seen secondhand copies of the film of you gunning down a madman and some sort of animal several years ago very impressive lieutenant have you ever considered work in film she shook her head ive been told the camera adds ten pounds i have problems enough may i take a few moments of your time mister crane he grinned at her then a grin im sure he meant to be boyish and flirty the weasel i suppose that depends on what you intend to do with them murphy studied his face for just a moment as though in wary amusement i had a few questions regarding the incident here and i hope that you can help me out with them i cant imagine what i know that would help you crane replied he glanced at the unmoving elevator doors and sighed bother he drew a small black cell phone from his jacket pocket hit a button without looking and lifted it to his ear then he lowered it again and frowned down at it in silence hah take that weasel it wont take much of your time murphy said im sure that you can see how important it is for us to be thorough in this investigation we would all hate for anyone else to be harmed im sure i dont know anything of any importance lieutenant crane said his voice turning a little impatient i was present during the blackout last night but i was already in my room i didnt even come downstairs until this morning i see did anyone see you at that time crane let out a little laugh am i a suspect that i need an alibi as a celebrity guest its entirely possible that the person or persons responsible for this attack might have an unhealthy interest in you murphy replied matching his fake laugh with her politely professional smile i certainly dont mean to imply any sort of accusationonly concern for your safety someone shoved open a door that showed a set of stairs behind it and a small man in an expensive grey suit emerged from it he was sort of frogfacedhe had the mouth of someone much larger than he almost grotesquely thick and wide he had fine black hair all limp and stringy and someone had cut it with the ancient but trusty saladbowl method he had bulgy watery eyes that required extralarge widerimmed glasses to properly encircle ah mr crane the newcomer said he had a wheezy nasal voice i received your call but it was apparently cut off just as i answered crane took out his phone again and tossed it underhand to the newcomer it seems to have died quite abruptly lucius like this elevator the man caught it and frowned at the phone then at murphy with equal amounts of disapproval i see lieutenant murphy may i present lucius glau my personal advisor and legal counsel mouse tensed as glau turned to regard murphy with his froggy eyes the little lawyer made a swallowing sound in his throat and then said is my client under arrest no she said naturally n then i must insist that this conversation be cut short glau said over her for a pasty little guy he had a lot of confidence he squared off in front of murphy just to one side of crane murphys arms relaxed to her sides and i saw her blue eyes flick down to the floor and back up gauging distances the tension level went higher we were just talking murphy told glau id seen her wearing that look right before she went for her gun more than once in an amiable and cooperative fashion as i informed both the fbi and the investigator in charge of the scene with chicagos police department my client was in his rooms all night and neither witnessed what happened nor even knew of what had transpired until he came down to breakfast this morning glaus voice was clipped his bulgy eyes impossible to read i got the feeling it was the expression he used whenever he did anything be it eating ice cream or drowning puppies continued contact could well be construed as harassment lucius lucius crane said holding out his hand between them his voice soothing honestly you react so strongly to the smallest things he turned that dazzling smile on murphy and said im sorry lucius has worked for me for a very long time and hes seen a number of unreasonable people approach me i certainly dont think of the attentions of so striking a woman as harassment murphys eyes left glau for a second as she cocked a golden brow at crane really truly crane said the model of modern gallantry lucius is doubtless concerned about my timetable for today and i would hate to disappoint any of the fans here to meet me by falling behind my schedule he glanced at froggy as he spoke and froggy took a very small step back from murphy crane nodded at him continuing to speak but if you would permit it perhaps you would care to let me get you a drink of something later this evening by way of apology murphy hesitated which wasnt much like her i dont know she said crane extended his hand to her to be shaken still smiling if you still had questions id be happy to answer them then please as a token of my intentions i insist i would hate you to have the wrong impression of me murphy gave him a look of wary amusement and lifted her hand im not sure how i got across that much carpet that fast but i put my hand on murphys shoulder and gripped lightly just before she touched him she froze sensing the warning in the gesture and drew her hand back cranes eyes narrowed studying me his hand still sticking out and who is this harry dresden i said crane went still not still like people go still where you can see them blinking and swaying slightly and adjusting their balance he went still like corpses and plastic dressing dummies and said nothing as i am a highly experienced investigator i drew the conclusion that he recognized the name froggy made a gulping sound in his throat bulging eyes switching to me i thought he shrunk in on himself a little as if suddenly losing an inch or two of heightor tensing to crouch he recognized it too i felt famous mouse let out a relaxed ripsaw of a growl so low that it could hardly be heard froggys eyes went to the dog and widened he shot a look at crane everyone froze like that for a moment crane and murphy still smiled their professional smiles froggy looked froglike i went for bored but i felt my heart speed up as my instincts told me that violence was a hell of a lot closer to the surface than it looked there are witnesses here dresden crane said you cant move on me it would be seen i tilted my head and pursed my lips thoughtfully youre right and youre a public figure which means this is a great opportunity for advertising i havent been on tv since the last time i was on the larry fowler show his expression changed then that cold sneer coming out of the background to twist his lips you wouldnt dare reveal yourself to the world i snorted at him and said go read the yellow pages in your room im in there under wizards froggy gulped again youre insane crane said wizards is the kwayzeeest people i confirmed and you dont look very much like a darby cranes chin lifted his eyes glittering with some sort of sudden approval i had no idea why dammit i hate it when someone knows more than me about exactly how deep a hole im digging under myself no and what does a darby look like i confess the only one i ever saw was in that leprechaun movie with sean connery i said call it an instinct he pursed his lips and fell silent we all enjoyed another two minutes of wordless increasingly tense standoff then murphy said deadpan say ten oclock for that drink darby the hotels lounge wed hate to keep you from your busy schedule he glanced from murphy to me and back and then lowered his hand he gave her a little bow of the head then turned and walked away back toward the crowd froggy watched us for a three count then turned and hurried after his boss checking frequently over his shoulder i exhaled slowly and leaned against the wall adrenaline without an outlet is a funny thing the long muscles in my legs twitched and flexed without me telling them too and the lights in the hallway suddenly seemed a little too bright my bruised head twinged some more murphy just stood there not moving but i could hear her consciously regulating her breathing keeping it smooth mouse sat down and looked bored but his ears kept twitching in the direction the pair had vanished well murphy said a second later keeping her voice low what was that all about we almost started a fight i said i noticed that murphy said her tone patient but why hes spooky i murmured she frowned looking over her shoulder and up at me what is he i told you spooky i shook my head other than that i dont know she blinked what do you mean you dont know i dont know i said something about him hit me wrong when he offered you his hand it seemed off dangerous murphy shook her head i figured he was going to go for the holdandcaress routine she said its a little bit insulting but it isnt all that dangerous unless maybe it is i said youre sure hes from your side of things she asked yeah he recognized me he started pulling out the standard old world reasons for avoiding public confrontation and mouse didnt like himor his lawyer either vampire she asked could be i said chewing on my lip could be a lot of things hell could be human for that matter without knowing more we shouldnt make any assumptions think hes involved in the attacks i like him for it i said if i was making the call alone hed definitely be our asshole hes got all the earmarks if hes the guy hes out of my reach she said hes got a hairtrigger attorney and has already spoken to greene and rick any police pressure i brought against him would be harassment greene wont act on my suspicions well i said good thing im not greene chapter twentytwo murphy and i walked around the hotel and as we did i popped open a fresh can of blue playdoh at the corners of major intersections and at the exterior exits i pinched off bits and plunked them down on top of the molding over doorways inside flowerpots inside fire extinguisher cabinets and anywhere else where they wouldnt be easily or immediately noticed i made sure to leave plenty of them in unnoticed little spots along the hallways chiefly in use for the convention especially dutside the rooms that the schedule designated as showing films as evening approached what are we doing again murphy asked setting up a spell i said with playdoh yes she gave me a level look i shook out the can that still had most of the original material in it and showed it to her the little pieces ive been leaving around are part of this piece see not yet she said they used to be one piece even when theyre separated they still have a thaumaturgical connection to the original i told her it means that ill be able to use the big piece to reach out and connect to the little pieces thats what you meant by a web yes ill be able to i twisted up my face searching for the words to explain i can extend energy out to all the smaller pieces ill set it up so that if one of the little pieces picks up on a disturbance of the energies ill be able to feel it through the larger piece like seismographs sort of murphy said yeah i said and we use blue playdoh blue for defense she arched a brow at me does the color really matter yes i said then thought about it for a second well probably no but yes for me huh a lot of the use of magic is all tied up with your emotions with what you believe is real when i was younger i learned a lot of stuff like the role of colors in the casting of spells green for fertility and prosperity red for passion and energy white for purity black for vengeance and so on it could be that the color doesnt matter at allbut if i expect the spell to work because of the color used then that color is important if i dont believe in it the spell wont ever get off the ground like dumbos magic feather murphy asked it was his confidence that was really important yes i said the feather was just a symbolbut it was an important symbol i gestured with the can so i use blue because i dont have to do too much introspection and i dont introduce new doubts in a crisis situation and because it was cheap at walmart murphy laughed walmart huh wizarding doesnt pay much i said youd be surprised how much stuff i get from walmart i checked a clock on the wall weve got about two hours before the first movie starts showing she nodded what do you need a quiet space to work in i told her at least six or seven feet across the more private and secure the better ive got to assume that the bad guy knows im around here somewhere i dont want to get a machete in the back when im busy running the spell how long do you need to set it up i shrugged twenty minutes give or take what im really concerned about is mister dresden called a voice from across the crowded convention hallway i looked up to see sandra marling hurrying through the crowd toward me the conventions chairwoman looked exhausted and too nervous to be awake much less standing much less politely pushing her way through a crowd but she did it anyway she still wore the same black tshirt with the red splattercon logo on it presumably the same id seen her in the night before ms marling i said nodding to her as she approached good afternoon she shook her head wearily im such this is such an enormous amount of but i dont know who else i can turn to about this her words failed her and she started trembling with nerves and weariness i traded a frown with murphy sandra whats wrong its molly she said i frowned what about her she came here from the hospital a couple of hours ago the police came to talk to her and i dont think shes come out since then and none of the officers ive spoken to know where she is i think sandra i told her take a breath slow down do you know where molly is the woman closed her eyes and shook her head bringing herself under control lowering her voice several pitches theyre still interrogating her i think isnt that what they say when they try to scare you and ask questions i narrowed my eyes yeah i said was she arrested sandra shook her head jerkily i dont think so they didnt handcuff her or read from that little card or anything can they do that just drag her into a room well see i said which room other wing second door on the right she said i nodded slung my pack off my back and took out a small notebook i scribbled some phone numbers and names on a page and gave it to sandra call both of these people she blinked at the paper what do i tell them the truth tell them whats going on and that harry dresden said they need to get down here immediately sandra blinked down at the page what are you going to do oh you know the usual i said get to that phone ill catch up in a minute murphy said i nodded slung the pack back on jerked my head at mouse and started walking with purposeful strides toward the knot of reporters that had begun to dissolve at the conclusion of the official statements to the press my dog fell in to pace at my side until i spotted lydia stern at the rear of the crowd lydia stern was a formidable woman a reporter for the midwestern arcane a yellow journal based out of chicago that did its best to report on the supernatural sometimes they managed to get close to the truth but more often they ran stories that had headlines like lizard baby born in trailer park or maybe bigfoot and the chupacabra the unholy alliance by and large the stories were amusing and fairly harmless but once in a while someone stumbled into something strange and it made it into the paper susan rodriguez had been a lead reporter for the arcane until shed run into exactly the wrong story now she lived her life somewhere in south america fighting off the infection in her soul that wanted to turn her into one of the red court while she and her halfvampire buddies campaigned against their wouldbe recruiters when lydia stern took over susans old job a couple of years back her reporting had taken a different angle shed investigated strange events and then demanded to know why the appropriate institutions had been ignoring them the woman had a scathing intellect and penetrating wit and she employed both liberally and with considerable panache in her writing she was unafraid to challenge anyone in her articles from some smalltown animal control unit to the fbi it was a shame she was working at a rag like the arcane instead of at a reputable paper in dc or new york shed have been a pulitzer nominee inside of five years city officials who had to deal with the cases id brushed up against had developed a nearly supernatural ability to vanish whenever she was around none of them wanted to be the next person lydia stern eviscerated in print she had a growing reputation as an investigative terror ms stern i said in a low grave voice extra emphasis on the z in ms i wonder if you might have a few moments the terror of the midwest arcane whirled to face me and her face broke into a cherubic grin she was a little over five feet tall pleasantly plump and of asian ancestry she had a sparkling smile thick glasses curly black hair and was wearing a pair of denim overalls over an old queensryche tshirt her tennis shoes had bright pink laces on them harry dresden she said she had a sort of breathless bubbling voice the kind that seemed like it could barely contain laughter beneath almost every word hah i knew this one smelled right could be i said i hadnt been real forthcoming with lydia it hadnt worked out well with reporters in the past whenever i spoke to her little daggers of guilt stabbed at me reminders that i could not afford to let careless words get her into too much trouble despite that wed gotten along and id never lied to her i hadnt bothered to try you busy she gestured at the bag whose strap hung over her shoulder ive got recordings and ill want to jot down some notes shortly she tilted her head to one side why do you ask i need a thug to scare some guys for me i said the dimples in her cheeks deepened oh yeah i said do this for me ill give you ten minutes on this i waved my hand vaguely at the hotel around us as soon as i have some time free her eyes brightened done she said what do i do hang around outside a doorway and i grinned just be yourself good i can do that she nodded once curls bouncing and followed me to the room where they were grilling my friends daughter i opened the door like i owned the place and walked in the room wasnt a big onemaybe the size of a large elementaryschool classroom there was a raised platform about a foot high at one end with chairs on it behind a long table more chairs faced it in rows a sign now discarded on the floor behind the door declared that the room was scheduled for something called filking between noon and five oclock today filking sounded suspiciously like it might be an activity somehow related to spawning salmon or maybe some kind of bizarre mammalian discussion i decided that it was probably one of those things i was happier not knowing greene was in the room standing on the platform with his arms folded a sour frown on his face molly sat in the first row of chairs still in the same clothes as the night before she looked tired shed been crying next to her was a man of medium build and unremarkable height with brown hair just tousled enough to be fashionable he wore a grey suit its gravity somewhat offset by a black tie that featured marvin the martian i recognized him rick murphys ex he stood over molly passing her a cup of water the good cop of the usual interrogation equation he was here in his official capacity then agent rick excuse me greene said without looking over at me this room isnt open to the public it isnt i said overly ingenuous man i was really looking forward to a nice afternoon of filking too molly looked up and her eyes widened in recognition and what looked like sudden hope harry heya kid i told her and ambled in mouse in tow the dog went right over to molly wagging his tail and subtly begging for affection by thrusting his broad muzzle underneath her folded hands molly let out a little laugh and leaned down hugging the dog talking baby talk to him like she did to her youngest siblings greene turned to glower at me after a moment agent rick did too dresden greene said his tone peremptory you are interfering in an investigation get out i ignored him to speak to molly hows rosie she left her cheek on top of mouses broad head and said unconscious she was very upset by the news and the doctors gave her something to help her sleep they were afraid she would freak out and it would hurt the baby dresden greene snarled best thing for her right now i told molly shell handle it better when shes had some rest she nodded and said i hope so greene spat a curse and reached for his radio presumably to summon goons greene was an ass maybe i was going a little hexhappy but i muttered something under my breath and made a little effort sparks shot out of the radio and were followed by curls of smoke greene stood there cursing as he tried to get the thing to work dammit dresden he snarled get out before i have you taken downtown i kept ignoring him hi there rick how was the wedding thats it greene said rick pursed his lips and then held up a hand toward greene a placating gesture everyone survived it agent rick responded studying me with a steady frown looking between me and molly harry were working here you should go yeah i asked i plopped down into the chair beside molly and grinned at him im thinking maybe not i mean im working too im a consultant youre obstructing an investigation dresden greene growled youre going to lose your jobs with the city your investigative license hell ill even get you stuck in jail for a month or two no you wont have it your way tough guy greene said and started for the door molly maybe taking it for a cue rose herself sit down greene said his voice hard you arent finished yet she hesitated for a second and then sat greene greene greene i said theres something youre missing here he paused agent rick watched me steadily see miss carpenter here can go any time she damned well pleases not until shes answered a few questions he said i made a gameshow buzzing sound wrong this is a free country she can walk out and theres not a damned thing you can do about it unless you want to arrest her i grinned at him some more you didnt arrest her did you molly watched the exchange from the corner of her vision being very still and keeping her face down were questioning her in relation to an ongoing investigation rick said yeah one of you guys got the subpoena then they hadnt of course no one spoke see youre the one out on a limb here greene youve got nothing on the young lady no court order you havent arrested her so anything she chooses to tell you is entirely voluntary molly blinked up at me it is i put a hand to my chest and mimed an expression of shock greene i can hardly believe this did you lie to this young woman to frighten her to make her think she was under arrest i didnt lie greene snarled you just led her on i said nodding sure sure not your fault if she interpreted you wrong say lets go back and check the tape and see where the mistake was i paused you are recording this arent you all on the record and aboveboard greene looked at me like he wanted to kick my nuts up into my skull youve got nothing but speculation get out or as lead investigator i will have you barred from the hotel that a threat i asked him believe it i made a show of rubbing at my mouth oh man im having quite the moral quandary because if you do that to me then hell maybe the press would find out that youre dismissing professional consultants with a positive track record with the city i leaned forward and added casualty oh and they might find out that you are illegally interrogating a juvenile greene stared at me shock on his face even agent rick arched an eyebrow what a juvenile i enunciated ie one who cannot give you legal consent on her own i took the liberty of sending for her parents im sure that they and their attorney will have a whole lot of questions for you thats blackmail greene said no its due process i replied youre the one who tried the end run around the law greene scowled at me and said you can talk all you want but youve got no proof my cheeks ached from smiling so much and i chuckled the door which had never fully closed opened on cue lydia stern stood there behind it her press badge around her neck a minitape recorder in her hand held up so that greene could clearly see it so detective she asked could you please explain why as a part of your investigation you are interrogating a juvenile without her parents consent is she a suspect in the crime or a witness to any of the events and what about these rumors of interdepartmental noncooperation slowing down the investigation greene stared at the reporter he shot a glance at agent rick rick shrugged hes got you you took a chance it didnt pay off greene spat a word that authority figures oughtnt say in front of juveniles and then stomped out lydia stern winked at me then followed on his heels recorder held out toward him asking a steady stream of questions whose only reasonable answers would make greene look like an idiot rick watched him go and shook his head then he said to me whats your stake in this the girl is my friends daughter i said just looking out for her he gave me a slight nod i see greenes under a lot of pressure im sorry you got treated like that rick i said in a patient voice im not a teenage girl please dont try to goodcop me his polite interested expression vanished for a second behind a quick boyish grin then he shrugged and said it was worth trying i snorted you know he can get the subpoena its just a question of running through channels i rose thats not my problem ill leave it to the carpenters attorney i see he said you actually are interfering with the investigation he could probably make it stick come on agent im protecting the rights of a juvenile the aclu would eat that raw i shook my head besides what youre doing is wrong bullying girls hells bells man thats low a flicker of anger touched agent ricks expression dresden i know you dont have a concealed carry permit you want me to suspect you of carrying a weapon and search you for it oops i thought nervously of the revolver in my backpack if agent rick wanted to make an issue of it i could be in troublebut i didnt want him to know that i tried to shake it off with a nonchalant shrug how is that going to help stop the killer before he strikes again rick tilted his head to one side and frowned at me dammit ive got to get a better poker face he oriented on me eyes searching over me for possible places to hide a gun irrelevant he replied if youre breaking the law youre breaking the law from the doorway there was an impatient sigh and then murphy said would it kill you to stop being an asshole for five minutes rick i hadnt noticed her arrival and judging from agent ricks expression neither had he hes a consultant for si which is also working the case we dont have the time to get involved in a pissing contest people are in danger we need to work together rick glared at her then reined in his temper and shrugged a shoulder you may be right but dresden i want you to consider leaving of your own will if you keep interfering ill arrest you and toss you in the clink for twentyfour hours no murphy said entering the room you wont he rounded on her eyes narrowed dammit karrin you never know when to quit do you of course i do she said setting her jaw never agent rick shook his head he slammed open the door and departed murphy watched him go then she sighed and asked are you all right miss molly nodded somewhat numbly yes just tired a moment later sandra marling hurried in looked around at all of us and then went over to give molly a hug the girl hugged back tight did you reach them i asked sandra yes mrs carpenter is on the way molly shuddered good i said could you stay with molly until she arrives of course i nodded and said to molly kid things are getting complicated i want you to go with your mom all right she nodded slowly without looking up i sighed and got up out of my chair good i left murphy and mouse flanking me as i headed back into the hotel nice guy rick i commented maybe a little manipulative just a tad murphy said what happened i told her she let out a wicked chuckle wish i could have seen the look on their faces next time ill take a picture she nodded so whats our next move hey were in a hotel i bobbed my eyebrows at her lets get a room under peaceful circumstances im sure that no rooms would have been available obviously though circumstances were far from peaceful and there had been a minor avalanche of cancellations and early departures from the hotelwhich only goes to show that people occasionally demonstrate evidence of sound judgment the convention might have doubled the number of folks attending but that didnt mean that they wanted to sleep here there was a room available on the fifth floor i paid an extra fee to allow mouse to stay and we got checked in there was no one else in the elevator and we rode in a silence that became increasingly tense i shifted my weight from side to side and fiddled with one of the two plastic cards the desk clerk had given us i cleared my throat so here we are i said heading up to our hotel room murphys cheeks turned pink you are a pig dresden hey i didnt put any innuendo into that you did it yourself she rolled her eyes smiling a little i watched numbers change on the elevator panel i coughed yes sirree alone together its a little weird she admitted a little weird i agreed should it be she asked i mean were just working together weve done that before we havent done it in a hotel room yes we have murphy said but they all had corpses in them ah true no corpses this time i said heh murphy said the night is young her reminder of the dangers before us put a bullet through the head of that conversation her smile vanished and her face regained its usual color we went the rest of the way in silence until the elevator doors opened neither one of us moved to get out it almost felt like there was some kind of invisible line drawn across the floor the silence stretched the doors tried to close murphy mashed down on the door open button with her thumb harry she said finally her voice very quiet her blue eyes focused into distance ive been thinking about you know us yeah yeah how much thinking she smiled a little im not sure really i dont think i wanted to admit that you know things might change between us yes she frowned at me im not sure this is something you would want between the two of us i said i think i probably have more insight into that one she frowned how do you know its what you want last halloween i said i wanted to murder kincaid murphy glanced down as her cheeks turned pink oh not literally i said then paused well i guess it was literally but the urge died down a little i see she said are you and him i asked leaving the question open i saw him at new years she said but we arent in anything deep neither of us want that were friends we enjoy the company thats all i frowned were friends too i said but ive never taken your pants off were different she said her blush renewing she gave me an oblique look from beneath pale eyelashes is it something you want my heart sped up a little uh pants removal she arched a brow and tilted her head waiting for an answer murph i havent been with a woman fori shook my head look you ask any guy if he wants to have sex and hes going to say yes generally speaking its in the union manual her eyes sparkled including you she pressed im a guy i said so yes i frowned thinking about it and and no she smiled at me and nodded i know you couldnt do casual you commit yourself too deeply you care too much we couldnt have something light you would never settle for that she was probably right i nodded i dont know if i could give you what you want harry then she took a deep breath and said and there are other reasons we work together i noticed she didnt quite smile what i mean is i cant let relationships come close to my job it isnt good for either i said nothing im a cop harry my belly twisted a little as i realized the rejection in the words and the lack of any room for compromise i know you are i serve the law you do i said you always have i cant walk away from it i wont walk away from it i know that too and were so different our worlds not really i said we sort of hang around in the same one most of the time thats work she said quietly my work isnt everything about me or it shouldnt be ive tried a relationship built on having that in common rick i said she nodded pain flickered in her eyes i never would have seen that a few years before but id seen murphy in good times and badmostly bad shed never say it never want me to say anything about it but i knew that her failed marriages had wounded her more deeply than she would ever admit in a way i suspected that they explained some of her professional drive and ambition she was determined to make the career work something had to and maybe shed been hurt even more deeply than that maybe badly enough that she wouldnt want to leave herself open to it again longterm relationships have the potential for longterm pain maybe she didnt want to go through it again what if you werent a cop she smiled faintly what if you werent a wizard touche but indulge me she tilted her head and studied me for a minute then she said what happens when susan comes back i shook my head she isnt her tone turned dry indulge me i frowned i dont know i said quietly we decided to break it off and i suspect wed see a lot of things very differently now but if she wanted to try again murphy asked i shrugged i dont know lets say we get together murphy said how many kids do you want i blinked what you heard me i dont i blinked a few more times i hadnt really thought about it so i thought about it for a second i thought about the merry chaos of the carpenter household god id have given anything for that when i was little but any child of mine would inherit more than my eyes and killer chin there were a lot of people who didnt think much of me a lot of notpeople thought that way too any child of mine would be bound to inherit some of my enemies and worse maybe some of my allies my own mother had left me a legacy of perpetual suspicion and doubt and nasty little surprises that occasionally popped out of the hoary past murphy watched me blue eyes steady and serious its a big question she said quietly i nodded slowly maybe youre thinking about this too much murph i said logic and reason and planning for the future whats in your heart doesnt need that i used to think that too she shook her head i was wrong love isnt all you need and i just dont see us together harry youre dear to me i couldnt ask for a kinder friend id walk through fire for you you already did i said but i dont think i could be the kind of lover you want we wouldnt go together why not at the end of the day she said quietly were too different youre going to live for a long time if you dont get killed centuries im going to be around another forty fifty years at the most yeah i said it was one of those things i tried really hard not to dwell on she said even more quietly i dont know if ill get serious with a man again but if i do i want it to be someone who will build a family with me grow old with me she reached up and touched the side of my face with warm fingers youre a good man harry but you couldnt be what i need either murphy took her thumb from the button and left the elevator i didnt follow her right away she didnt look back stab twist god i love being a wizard chapter twentythree the room was typical of my usual hotel experience clean plain and empty i made sure the blinds were pulled looked around and shoved the small round table at one side of the room over against the wall to leave me some open space in the middle of the floor i slung my backpack down on the bed need anything murphy asked she stood in the doorway to the room she didnt want to come in think i have it all just need some quiet to get it set up there was no reason not to give murphy a way out of the awkwardness the conversation had brought on theres something im curious about maybe you could check it out pells theater murphy guessed i could hear some relief in her voice yes maybe you could cruise by it and see whats to be seen she frowned think there might be something in there i dont know enough to think anything yet but its possible i said you get a bad feeling about anything dont hang around just vamoose dont worry she said i already planned to do that she went to the door shouldnt take me long ill contact you in half an hour lets say sure i said neither one of us voiced what we both were thinking that if murphy missed the checkin shed probably be dead or dying or worse half an hour she nodded and left shutting the door behind her mouse went over to the door sniffed at it for a moment then walked in a little circle three times and settled down on the floor to sleep i frowned down at the carpet and opened my backpack chalk wouldnt do for a circle not on carpet like that id have to go with the old standby of fine white sand the maids would doubtless find it annoying to clean up but life could be hard sometimes i pulled out a glass bottle of specially prepared sand and put it on the table along with the main blob of playdoh and bob the skull orange lights kindled in the skulls eye sockets can i talk now yeah i said you been listening to things yeah bob said depressed you are never going to get laid i glared at the skull im just sayin he said voice defensive it isnt my fault harry shed probably bang you if you didnt take it so godawful seriously the subject change it i suggested in a flat voice were working now right bob said so youre planning on a standard detection webward for the building yeah i said it isnt going to be very helpful bob said i mean by the time something manifests enough to set off your web its going to be all the way into the real world while youre running for the stairs its already going to be tearing into somebody it isnt perfect i said but its all ive got unless you have a better idea the thing about having several centuries of experience and knowledge at my disposal is that it doesnt do me any good unless i know what it is you want me to help you fight bob said so far all you know is that youve got an inbound phobophage thats not specific enough no bob said i can think of about two hundred different kinds of phobophages off the top of my head and i could probably come up with two hundred more if i took a minute to think about it that many of them who can do what this thing did take a solid form and attack bob blinked his eyes at me as though he thought me very thick believe it or not the old take the form of the victims worst fear routine is pretty much the most common move in the phobophage handbook oh right i shook my head but this whole place is open territory theres no threshold to use to anchor anything heavier than a web at least if i do that much maybe i can get into position fast enough to directly intervene when the thing shows up again things bob corrected me plural phages are like ants first one shows up then two then a hundred i exhaled crap i said maybe we can come at this from a different angle is there any way i can redirect them while theyre crossing over make it harder for them to get here bobs eyelights brightened maybe maybe yes you might be able to raise a veil over this whole placefrom the other side urk i said youre saying i could hide this place from the phages but only from the nevernever pretty much bob said even then it would be a calculated risk how so it all depends on how theyre finding this place bob said i mean if these are just naturally arriving phages finding a hunting ground a veil wont stop them it might slow them down but it wont stop them lets assume that it isnt a coincidence i said okay assuming that the next variable is finding out whether theyre being summoned or sent i frowned there are things strong enough to send them through from the other side i didnt think that ever happened anymore hence the popularity of working through mortal summoners oh its doable bob assured me it just takes a hell of a lot more juice to open the way to the mortal world from the other side i frowned how much power are we talking big bob assured me like the erlking or an archangel or one of the old gods i got a shivery feeling in my stomach a faerie queen oh sure i guess so he frowned you think this is faerie work something is definitely screwy in elfland i said more so than normal i mean bob made a gulping sound oh were not going to go visiting the faeries or anything are we not if i can help it i said i wouldnt take you with me if it came to that oh he sighed good one of these days youre gonna have to tell me what you did to make mab want to kill you yeah sure bob said in that tone of voice you use while sweeping things under the rug but we should also consider the third possibility a summoner i said given that someone actually threw a ward in my way the last time the phage showed up that seems to be the most likely of the three i think so too bob said in which case youre in trouble i grunted and started unpacking candles matches and my old armysurplus knife why without a threshold to build on you cant put up any proper defense and even if you do cross over and set up a veil to try to keep the phages from finding the place their summoner is going to draw them in i finished following the line of reasoning its like i could blanket the surrounding area in fog but if they have someone on this end the phages will have a beacon they can use to home in on the hotel right bob said and then the summoner just opens the door from his side and theyre in i frowned and said its all about finding the summoner then which you cant do until they actually summon something bob said hells bells i complained theres got to be something we can do to prevent it not especially bob said sorry boss until you know more you cant do anything but react i scowled dammit then its the web or nothing at least if i use that i might be able to identify the summoner at the low low cost of the phages mauling or killing someone else unless bob i said frowning over the idea what if i didnt try to hide the hotel or keep these things away what if i uh just put a little topspin on the phages on the way in bobs eyelights brightened even more ooooooo classic white council doctrine when the phages come through you point them straight at the guy who summoned them give him a dose of his own medicine right up the ass i confirmed theres an image bob said a summoning suppository its doable isnt it sure bob said i mean you have everything you need for that you know the phages are after fear and that theyre probably using his power as a beacon your web tells you something is stirring you conjure up a big ball of fear target the same beacon the phages are using and let it fly itll be like hanging a steak around his neck and throwing him to the lions i said grinning hail caesar bob confirmed the phages will go right after him and once hes out of the game i veil the hotel from the phages no more convention attendees get hurt bad guy gets a lethal dose of dramatic irony the good guys win bob cheered or at least you do youre still a good guy right you know how confusing the whole goodevil concept is for me im thinking about changing it to them and us for simplicitys sake i said i like this plan so theres got to be a catch to it somewhere true bob admitted its gonna be a little tricky when it comes to the timing you wont be able to sense the beacon until the phages actually step through from the nevernever and take material form if you havent redirected them by then itll be too late i nodded frowning that gives me what maybe twenty seconds only if theyre really lame bob said probably ten seconds maybe even less i frowned dammit thats a small window i thought of another problem not only that but ill be shooting blind there wont be any way to tell who im setting the phages after what if hes standing in a crowd hes going to be summoning fiends from the netherworld to wreak horror and death on the populace bob pointed out in a patient voice that wont lend itself to blending into a crowd good point hell probably be somewhere private quiet i shook my head even so id be a lot happier if this was a little less dicey but i dont see any other way to stop these things from hurting anyone else until we have more information i dont see what else you could do boss i grunted id better get this web up and running then mouses collar tag clinked against the buckle and i looked over my shoulder the dog had lifted his head from the floor staring intently at the door a second later someone knocked mouse hadnt started growling and his tail thumped the wall a few times as i went to the door sounding the allclear that was fast i said opening the door i thought you were going to be half an hour murph molly stood in the hallway an overnight bag hung over her shoulder she drooped the way my house plants always used to when i was still optimistic enough to keep buying new ones her pinkandblue hair hung down listlessly and her cheeks were marked with the remains of several mascaraladen tear tracks she looked rumpled tired uncertain and lonely hi she said her voice wasnt much more than a whisper hey i told her i thought you were waiting for your mom i was she said i am but im kind of messed up she waved her hand gingerly at herself i wanted to clean up a little but they wont let me use the bathroom in nelsons room i was hoping i could borrow yours just for a minute it would have been easier to dropkick a puppy than to turn the kid away sure i said just keep it quiet okay i stepped back into the room and molly followed me pausing to scratch mouse behind the ears she looked past me to the open floor space and the things i had sat out what are you doing she asked me magic i said whats it look like im doing she smiled a little oh right i waved a hand at my materials im going to try to prevent another attack from hurting anyone can you do that she asked maybe i said i hope so i cant believe i mean i knew there were things out there but my friends rosie her lower lip quivered and her eyes filled with tears that didnt quite fall i didnt have much i could say to comfort her im going to stop it from happening again i said quietly im sorry i didnt move fast enough the first time she looked down again and nodded without speaking she swallowed several times listen i told her quietly this is serious stuff you need to talk about it not with me i added as she looked up at me with your mom molly shook her head she isnt molly i sighed life can be short and cruel you saw that last night you got a look at the kind of thing your dad deals with all the time she didnt respond i said quietly even knights can die molly shiro did it could happen to michael too she lifted her head abruptly staring at me as if in shock how does that make you feel i asked she chewed on her lip scared it scares your mom too it scares her a lot she deals with it by holding on hard to the people around her maybe too hard sometimes thats why you feel like shes trying to keep you a little kid she probably is but it isnt because shes a control freak its because she loves you all so muchyou your dad your familyand shes frightened that something bad could happen shes desperate to do everything she can to keep you all safe molly didnt look up or respond life is short i said too short to waste it on stupid arguments im not saying your mom is perfect because god knows she isnt but my god molly youve got the kind of family people like me would kill for you think theyll always be there laterbut they might not be life doesnt give you any guarantees i let that sink in for a minute and then said i promised your dad that id ask you to talk to her i told him id do my best to get the two of you to work things out she looked up at me crying now silently more dark makeup trailed down her cheeks will you sit down with her molly talk she took a shaking breath and said i dont know if it will do any good weve said so much i cant force you to do it no one can do that but you she sniffled for a moment it wont do any good i dont expect miracles just try to talk to her please she took a breath and then nodded once thank you i said she tried to smile once and hovered outside the bathroom door for a moment more molly i asked are you okay she nodded but she didnt move either i frowned something you want to say she looked up at me for just a second no she said then and shook her head no its nothing really thank you i wont be long she stepped into the bathroom shut the door and locked it the shower started a moment later wow bob said from behind me somehow inserting a leer into the word i didnt realize you liked them quite that fresh harry i glared at him what did you see the body on her magnificent rack blond nordic babeage but all pierced and dressed in black which means shes probably into at least one kind of kink and all tender and emotional and vulnerable to boot taking her clothes off right here in your room kink you dontlook theres no way to i sputtered no bob just no for crying out loud shes seventeen better move quick then bob said before anything starts to droop taste of perfection while you can thats what i always say bob what he said that isnt how things are not now bob said but you go get in that shower with her and youve got your own personal cable tv erotic movie come true i rubbed at the bridge of my nose hells bells the whole idea is wrong bob just wrong harry even a nerd should know that its no coincidence when a girl shows up at a mans hotel room you know all she really wants is to bob i snapped cutting him off even if she wanted to which she doesnt nothing is happening with the girl im trying to work here you arent helping id hate to disrupt your most recent attempt to court death and agony he said brightly you should stick me somewhere else where i wont distract you on the counter in the bathroom for example i slapped open one of the empty dresser drawers and tossed the skull in there instead bob sputtered a few muffled curses in ancient greek something about sheep and a skin rash i looked up from the drawer into the rooms mirror and found myself facing not my reflection but lasciels image instead angelic and lovely and poised the perverted little creep has a point my host she said i jabbed a finger at the mirror and said bob is my little creep and the only one who gets to call him names is me now go away ah lasciel said and the image faded to translucence my own reflection appearing to replace it fascinating though she added just before vanishing that boyfriend nelson bears quite the striking physical resemblance to you then she was gone dammit stupid demons always with the last word worse she had a point i eyed the bathroom door and reviewed the past day or so and my interactions with the girl before that i had always been someone her father respected and her mother disapproved of i showed up once in a blue moon in a big black coat usually looking roughedup and dangerous and id been doing so since she was young enough to be very impressionable hell when you got right down to it charitys disapproval alone might have been enough to make me seem interesting to a rebellious teenage girl i came to the reluctant conclusion that it was possible molly might have certain ideas in her head it might well explain the most recent awkward silences and halting pauses shed always liked me and it wasnt outrageous to think that it might have developed into something moreand that id be a right bastard to do anything that might encourage those ideas even inadvertently maybe bob and lasciel were wrong and in fact nothing like that was going on but the passions of youth its attractions and desires were a minefield one took lightly at ones own peril magnificent rack notwithstanding molly was still in every important way a childmy friends child to boot she was hurting it bothered me and i wanted to help her but i had to be aware of the fact that my sympathy could be misinterpreted the kid had issues and she needed someone to help her work things out she didnt need someone who would only make her more confused steam curled out from under the bathroom door an actual hot shower not merely the illusion of one i shook my head and got back to the detection web as spells went this one was pretty big but it wasnt complicated id created a longterm version of the same basic working in the neighborhood around my apartment in order to detect approaching mystical entities the one i wanted for the hotel was the same thing but i didnt have to bother with setting it up as a longterm construct a sunrise or two at most would erode the spell but with any luck i wouldnt need it for any longer i took the playdoh in hand grabbed three candles in their own wooden holders poured the sand in a circle around me and began gathering in my power painstakingly creating mental images of the web of energy i needed to weave between the points of the hotel id marked out with playdoh it didnt take me a terribly long time to set it up anyone with some basic skills and desire enough could have done something like this or at least they could have done it on a smaller scale weaving a web throughout the whole building took a lot of heavy lifting magically speaking but it wasnt complicated and fifteen minutes later i solidified the image of the energy patterns in my mind and whispered magius orbius spiritus oculus i poured my will and my magic out with the words as i spoke them and my body briefly lit up with a flood of tingling energy that raced along all of my limbs down into the lump of playdoh and swirled in tight spirals around the three candles that would serve as my wardflames the spells energy flashed appearing as a tiny stream of faint flickers like bursts of static electricity and the candles each flickered to life steady little flames born of the spell i broke the circle of sand as i spoke and the power blossomed out through the hotel into the shape id imagined invisible strands flickering into instant shape like ice crystals forming in the space of a heartbeat spreading unseen strands throughout the hotel my balance wobbled a bit as i finished the spell and the energy left me submerging me in a temporary flood of fatigue i sat there with my head down breathing hard for a minute wow murphy said her tone less than impressed i looked up to see her shutting the rooms door behind her what did you do i waved around to indicate the hotel and panted if bad mojo shows up in the hotel the spell will sense it i gestured at the three candles take one with you if you see it flare up it means weve got incoming murphy frowned but nodded how much warning will they give us not much i said a couple minutes maybe less maybe a lot less three candles she said one for you one for me and i thought wed see if rawlins wanted one is he here murphy said gut feeling i said he seems like the kind who sees something through he also seems like the kind whos been injured no chance hed get active duty here he didnt have it at the hospital either i pointed out true murphy said i caught my breath a little and asked anything at pells theater murphy nodded and crossed the room to pick up two of the candles a lot of nothing place was locked up tight chains on the front doors and the back door was locked sign on the door said they were closed until further notice i grunted youd think pell would be wild to have the place open if the convention was providing a significant amount of his incomeeven if he was in a hospital bed hell especially if he was in a hospital bed unless he doesnt have anyone he trusts to run it for him but he does have someone he trusts enough to lock it up i said that doesnt track pell sure as hell didnt lock up after he was attacked murphy frowned but she didnt disagree with me i tried to call him to ask him about it but the nurse said he was sleeping i ran my fingers back through my hair frowning over the situation curiouser and curiouser i said were missing something here like what murphy asked another player i said someone we havent seen yet murphy made a thoughtful sound maybe but imagining invisible perpetrators or hidden conspiracies veers pretty close to paranoia maybe not another suspect then i said thoughtfully maybe another motive like what she asked though i could see the wheels turning in her head as she followed the logic chain from the notion these phage attacks look fairly simple at first glance like i dont know shark attacks something hungry shows up to eat someone and then leaves natural occurrences or rather typical supernatural occurrences but they arent random murphy said someone is sending them to a specific place someone who used magic to try to stop you when you interfered with one of the phages which begs the obvious question i began murphy nodded and finished the thought why do it in the first place i stuck my left hand out to one side of me and said look over here then i mimed a short jab with my right fist its a ropeadope murphy said her eyes narrowing a distraction but from what something worse than homicidal shapeshifting supernatural predators apparently i mused something wed want to stop a lot more like what i shook my head and shrugged i dont know not yet anyway murphy grimaced leave it to you to make paranoia sound plausible its only paranoia if im wrong i said murphy glanced over her shoulder and shivered a little yeah she turned back to me squared her shoulders and took a steadying breath okay whats the play here i assume youve got something in mind beyond having a minute or two of warning yes i said what she asked it gets kind of technical i said ill try to keep up she said i nodded anytime something from the spirit world wants to cross into the mortal world it has to do a number of things to cross the border it has to have a point of origin a point of destination and enough energy to open the way then it has to cross over summon ectoplasm from the nevernever and infuse it with more energy to give itself a physical body she frowned what do you mean by points of origin and destination links i told her sort of like landmarks usually the creature youre calling up can serve as its own point of origin whoever is opening the way across is usually the destination can anyone be the destination she asked no i said you cant call up anything that isnt i frowned looking for words you cant call up anything that doesnt have some kind of reflection inside you a kind of point of reference for the spirit being if you want evil nasty hungry beings theres got to be evil nasty and hunger inside of you she nodded does the way have to be opened from this side generally i said it takes a hell of a lot more oomph to get it done from the other side she nodded go on i told her about my plan to turn the phages back upon their summoner i like that she said using their own monsters against them but what does that leave me to do you buy me time i said there will be a moment just when the phage or phages cross over where they will be vulnerable if youre able to see one and distract it it will give me more time to aim them back at their summoner and its possible that my spell might not work if it goes south youll be near enough to help clear people out maybe do them some good murphy began to speakthen she paused turned around and asked harry is there someone in the shower uh yeah i said and rubbed at the back of my neck she arched a brow and waited but i didnt offer any explanation maybe it was my way of getting petty vengeance for her brutal honesty in the elevator all right then she said and took up the candles ill get downstairs and look for rawlins otherwise ill grab one of my guys from si sounds good i said murphy left while i started planning out my redirection spell it didnt take me long mouse lifted his head suddenly and a second later someone knocked at the door i went over and opened it charity stood on the other side dressed in jeans a knit tank top and a blue blouse of light cotton her features were drawn with stress her shoulders clenched in unconscious tension when she saw me her features became remote and neutral very controlled hello mister dresden it was probably the friendliest greeting i could expect from her heya i said standing beside her was an old man a little under average height what was left of his hair was grey trimmed neatly though hardly a fringe remained he had eyes the color of robins eggs spectacles a comfortably heavy build and wore black slacks and a black shirt the white square of his clerical collar stood out distinctively against the shirt he smiled when he saw me and offered me his hand i shook it smiling and had no need to fake it father forthill what are you doing here harry he said amiably lending some moral support by and large hes my attorney charity added i blinked he is he is forthill said smiling i passed the bar before i entered the orders ive kept my hand in on behalf of the diocese and my parishioners i do some pro bono work from time to time too hes a lawyer i said hes a priest this does not compute forthill let out a belly laugh oxymoronic hey did i start calling you names i grinned at him what can i do for you molly was supposed to be waiting for us downstairs charity said but we havent found her do you know where she is the universe conspired against me if charity had asked the question ten seconds sooner i would have been fine but instead the bathroom door opened and molly appeared in a swirl of steam she had a towel wrapped around her hair and was holding another around her torso hotel towels and mollys torso being what they were the towel didnt quite get all the way around her and barely maintained modesty harry she said i left my bag out he she broke off suddenly staring at charity this uh isnt what it looks like i stammered turning back to charity her eyes blazed with cold righteous rage an old kipling axiom about the female of the species being more deadly than the male flashed through my mind right about the time charity introduced my chin to her right hook light flashed behind my eyes and i found myself flat on my back while the ceiling spun around a little mother molly said in a shocked voice i looked up in time to see forthill put a firm hand on charitys arm preventing her from following up the first blow she narrowed her eyes at forthill but the old mans fingers dug into her biceps until she gave him a slight nod and took a small step back into the hallway dress she told molly implacable authority in her tone were leaving the kid looked like she might just start falling apart on the spot she grabbed her bag ducked into the bathroom and was dressed in under a minute there was nothing going on i mumbled it came out sounding more like mmrphg ggggh oonng i may not be able to keep you away from my husband charity said her tone cold her diction precise but if you come near one of my children again i will kill you thank you for calling me she left the weary molly following her there was nothing going on i said again to forthill this time it sounded mostly like english he sighed looking after the pair i believe you he gave me a smile that was one part amusement to four parts apology and followed them murphy must not have reached the elevators before charity and forthill had arrived she appeared in the doorway peering inside the room and then back the way charity had gone ah she said you all right i guess i sighed her mouth twitched but she didnt quite smile or laugh at me seems to me that you should have seen that one coming dont laugh at me i said it hurts youve had worse she said heartlessly and it serves you right for letting a little girl into your hotel room now get up ill be downstairs she left too mouse came over and started patiently nuzzling my chin and putting slobbering dog kisses on the bruise i could feel forming there women confuse me i told him mouse sat down jaws dropping open into a doggie grin i groaned pushed myself to my feet and set about preparing the redirection spell while outside my rooms window the sun raced for its nightly rendezvous with the western horizon chapter twentyfour i shut the door again and rushed to prepare the beacon spell hurrying certain that every second counted i would only get one shot at diverting the phages and i finished my preparations in feverish haste nothing happened the sun set leaving me mostly in the dark since i hadnt bothered to turn on any lights nothing continued happening i knelt in my circle of sand until my legs cramped and then went numb and my knees felt like they were resting in molten lead and all that nothing just kept on coming oh come on i snarled bring on the doom already from his spot near the door mouse heaved a sigh oh shut up i told him i didnt dare take a break if the bad guys moved and i wasnt ready people would get hurt so i knelt there holding the spell ready in my mind uncomfortable as hell and swearing sulfurously under my breath stupid lameass summoner what the hell was he waiting for any halfcompetent villain would have had monsters roaming the halls hours ago mouses tail thumped against the wall and a moment later the rooms lock clicked and rawlins opened the door he was wearing jeans and a longsleeved shirt that concealed the bandages on his wounded arm and he carried a wardflame candle in one hand the blocky darkskinned officer leaned down and held his hand out to mouse who sniffed rawlins in typical canine fashion and wagged his tail some more rawlins remained in the doorway and said hello dresden here i muttered rawlins thumped at the wall until he found the lights and flicked them on he stared at me for a minute eyebrows slowly rising uhhuh theres something i dont see every day i grimaced murphy found you i see almost like shes a detective rawlins said grinning your boss know youre here i asked not so far he replied but i expect someone might notice and tell him about me at some point he wont be happy i said i just hope i can live with myself later he waved his little candle murphy sent me up here to make sure you was still alive im going to need knee surgery i sighed i never planned on it taking this long uhhuh rawlins said again you aint one of those satan worshipers are you no i said more like pythagoras pihwho he invented triangles ah rawlins said as if that had explained everything so what are you doing here i explained it to him though it looked like he was having trouble accepting my words maybe i lacked credibility but i figured he would have moved by now crooks are funny that way he agreed no respect i scrunched up my face in thought i was hungry thirsty tired hurting and i had to use the bathroom in the worst way none of those things were going to become easier to bear as the night went on and i needed to have all the concentration i could get okay i said be smart take a break i leaned down and broke the circle by sweeping the sand aside with my hand letting the energy of the spell id been holding ready drain away at least id already done it once getting it back into position wouldnt take nearly as long as the first time i tried to rise but my legs were incommunicado i grimaced at rawlins and said give me a hand here he set his candle aside and helped me up i wobbled precariously for a couple of seconds but then stumbled to the bathroom and back out you okay he asked im good tell murphy to hold steady rawlins nodded well be downstairs he paused and said hope this happens soon theres some kind of costume contest going on is it bad there are a lot of skimpy getups and some of those people should not be wearing them call the fashion police i said rawlins nodded gravely theyve crossed a line do me a favor i asked him take mouse out for a walk i dug a couple of bills from my back pocket and passed them to rawlins maybe get him a hot dog or something sure rawlins agreed i like dogs the dogs tail thumped rapidly against the wall whatever you do dont give him nachos i didnt bring my gas mask with me rawlins nodded sure keep your eyes open i said tell murph ill be reset in a couple of minutes rawlins grunted and left i had a canteen of fruit punch in my backpack along with some beef jerky and some chocolate i went to the bag and started wolfing down all three while pacing back and forth to stretch my legs holding myself ready to strike had been more than simply a physical strain my head felt like someone had packed it in wool while at the same time my senses seemed slighdy distorted edges made sharper curves more ambiguous the whole combining to make the hotel room feel like a toneddown escher painting there was no help for that the use of magic was mostly in the mind and holding a spell together for a long time often triggered disconcerting side effects i polished off the food as fast as i could gulp it down went easy on the drink in case i was there for another several hours and settled back down in my circle preparing to close it again when the rooms phone rang deja vu i commented to the empty room i stood up my knees creaking and went to the phone dresden taxidermy i said you snuff it well stuff it there was a beat of startled silence from the phone and then a young mans voice said urn is this harry dresden i recognized the voiceboyfriend nelson that made my ears perk up metaphorically speaking yeah this is him i said this is i know who it is i told him how did you know where i was sandra he said i called her cell she told me youd checked in uhhuh why are you calling me molly said she said you helped people he paused to take a breath and then said i think i need your help again why i asked keep the questions open i thought never give him one with a simple answer whats going on last night during the attacks i think i saw something i sighed it was going around i agreed but if you saw something youre a witness to a crime kid you need to show up and work with the cops they get sort of unreasonable with people who go all evasive when they want to ask questions about a murder but i think some thing is following me he said an unsteady tremor shook nelsons voice look theyre just cops man they just have guns i dont think they can help me i hope you can why i asked him what is it that you saw no he said not on the phone i want to meet with you i want you to promise me your help ill tell you then right because it wasnt like i had anything better to be doing look kid nelsons voice suddenly went thready with breathless fear oh god i cant stay here please please fine fine i said trying to keep my voice strong steady the kid was scaredthe bonedeep kneewatering halfcrazy kind of scared that makes rational thinking all but impossible listen to me stay around people as many of them as you can go to saint mary of the angels church its holy ground and youll be safe there ask for father forthill hes a little guy mostly bald glasses bright blue eyes tell him everything and tell him im coming to collect you as soon as i can yes all right thank you nelson said the words hysterically rushed there was a brief clatter and then i heard running footsteps on concrete he hadnt even gotten the phone back into its cradle before hed taken off at a dead sprint i chewed on my lip the kid was definitely in trouble or at least genuinely believed that he was if so it meant that maybe he had seen something last night something that made it important for someone to kill himie some kind of damning evidence that would probably help me figure out what the hell was going on i felt a stab of anxiety holy ground was a powerful deterrent to the things that went bump in the nightor in this case things that went stab stab hack slash rip in the nightbut it wasnt invulnerable if something of sufficient supernatural strength really was after the kid it might be able to force its way into the church dammit but what choice did i have if i left my position here any fresh attack could make last nights look like a friendly round of candyland what could he possibly have seen that would make him worth killing why the hell was he being followed i felt like i was floundering around in the dark inside someone elses house benighted of savoir faire enough to move with assurance i was spread too thin if i didnt start finding more pieces of the puzzle and put them together and soon more people would die i could only be in one place at one time if the kid was in real trouble hed be as safe at the church with forthill as anywhere in town short of the protection of my heavily warded apartment meanwhile there were a bunch of other kids here who looked to be the next meal on the phobophage buffet i had to act where i could do the most good it was a cold sort of equation the calculus of survival but undeniable id get to nelson after i had taken care of business at the hotel i settled down on my knees again carefully closed the circle and began to pick up the pieces of the redirection spell once more the single wardflame candle on the rooms dresser suddenly exploded into lurid red light simultaneously i felt a heavy thrumming in the air where the strands of my web spell had suddenly encountered powerful magic in motion drawing my thoughts and attention to a back hallway in the hotel not far from the kitchens up to the hall outside the hotels exercise room and a swift doublethrum from another of the hotels bathrooms four attackers this time four of them at least i had ten seconds to get the spell off nine maybe less eight i threw myself into the spell seven it had to be fast six it had to be perfect on the first attempt five if i screwed this one up someone else would pay for it four theyd pay for it in blood three two one chapter twentyfive i readied my spell terrified that i was already too late terrified that i had made a critical mistake terrified that more innocents were about to face hideous agony and death that was how it had to be if i wanted to lure the phages from their rampage by directing them after a richer source of fear it had to come from somewherespecifically it had to come from me if id tried to use falsified emotion it would no more have worked on them than an attempt to make a gorilla interested in a plastic banana the fear had to be genuine of course i hadnt really planned on being quite this afraid being taken off my guard and handed a time limit had added an edge of panicked hysteria to the ample anxiety i already had the spell coalesced and time came to an abrupt stop in that illusory stasis my senses were on fire the presence of the dangerous entities now entering the material world rippled through my detection web a jittery fluttering sensation the energy of the spell burned like an invisible star before my outstretched hands and my terror rushed into it and fused with the spell streamers from the lure whipped out along the lines of power that constituted my detection web brushing lightly at the entities attracting their attention giving them a whiff of rich sustenance and somewhere in the middle of all that i felt a single quiet quivering pulsea living presence that could only be the phages summoner and beacon gotcha i hissed and with an effort of will broke the circle and sent the spell winging toward him time resumed its course the energy that powered the spell fled out of me in another rush and left me lying on my side struggling to draw in enough breath i could feel the spell sizzling down the lines of power for the summoner and a heartbeat later there was a sense of impact as the spell went home as it happened the entities my web touched went abruptly still the web ceasing its tremblingand then they all surged forward into sudden motion vanishing from the web and presumably streaking after the lure all but one a breath or two after the entities had departed my web trembled again now growing more agitated its motion a kind of subliminal pressure against my thoughts i had missed one my spell had gotten out in time to draw away the others but either my web had failed me at some point or the remaining phage had been quicker on the draw than his buddies from the nevernever i could feel it moving from the hotels kitchens toward the convention halls i wanted to curl into a fetal position and go into a coma instead i shoved my wobbly way to my feet took up my pack and opened the drawer to get bob did it work he chirped almost i said theres one left keep your head down oh very funny he began i zipped the skull into my pack took up my staff and blasting rod and shuffled wheezily out to find the remaining phage before it found someone else my legs almost gave out just thinking about taking the stairs so i rode the elevator down to the first floor i heard nothing until the floor indicator told me wed just passed the second floor at which point i began to hear frightened muffled screams the elevator hit the first floor and the doors had just begun to roll open when the power went out blackness fell over the hotel the screams redoubled i took out my pentacle amulet and sent enough of my will into it to make it glow with pale blue wizards light i jammed my staff into the slightly open elevator doors and levered them apart then slipped out into the hotel though the sun had set more than an hour before the crowded convention hall had remained stuffy while its air conditioners labored in vain i got my bearings and headed for the kitchen as i did the air temperature plummeted sending the hotels climate from nearsauna to nearfreezing in a handful of seconds the suddenly cooled air could no longer contain the oppressive humidity it had been holding and this resulted in a sudden thick fog that coalesced out of nowhere and cut visibility down to maybe three or four long steps dammit the phages that had appeared so far seemed to be specialists in the upcloseandpersonal venue of violence whereas wheezy wizards like me prefer to do business from across the street or down the block or maybe from a neighboring dimension farther away if possible wizards have a capacity for recovering from injury that might be more than most humans but that was a longterm deal in a bar fight it wasnt going to do me any good hell i didnt even have my duster with me and now that the cold had rolled over the hotel i missed it for multiple reasons i put my amulet back on then shook out my shield bracelet and readied it for use creating a second source of glowing blue lightthough by accident not design the silver bracelet i used to focus magic into a tangible plane of force had been damaged in the same fire that took most of my left hand and sparks of blue light tended to dribble from it whenever i moved my arm around i had to be ready to use the shield at an instants notice it would be the only thing between me and whatever might come rushing from the fog i went with my staff in my right hand when it came to taking apart rampaging monsters i preferred my blasting rod but ive had an incident or two involving buildings and fire if i went blazing away at the thing in a crowded hotel and burned the place down it would kill more people than the rampage would have the staff was a subtle tool not as potent a weapon as the blasting rod but it was more versatile magically speaking plus in a pinch i could brain someone with itwhich isnt subtle but sure as hell is reassuring the emergency lights hadnt snapped on so either someone had sabotaged them or there was enough raw magical energy flying around to take them out but as i moved out toward the kitchens i didnt feel anything like the kind of ambient energy it would take to blow out something as simple as a batterypowered light that meant that someone had deliberately taken the emergency lights offline by magical means or otherwise and it wasnt hard to guess why gunshots rang out weirdly muted by the buildings acoustics flat heavy sounds like someone swinging a baseball bat at a metal trash can screams and sounds of confusion fear worry and even pain continued all around me as people fumbled in the dark tripped fell or collided with furniture and one another the building was already emptying at least here on the first floor but the sudden darkness had resulted in a panicked stampede and people had been injured in the crush the darkness had created confusion slowed the intended prey from fleeing and left wounded behind who could neither defend themselves nor flee the building their helplessness would be driving them mad with fear it would make them juicier targets for the phage a metallic piercing shriek hit my ears in a sudden stunning shock wave and my legs stopped moving i didnt choose to do it the sound just hit something primitive in my brain stem something that made my instincts scream at me to freeze to not be seen i dropped to one knee terror suddenly falling onto my shoulders like a physical weight in the wake of the shriek i could hear human throats screaming in fear nearby to me and i could see the shapes of people moving around lumpy shadows in the faint light from my shield bracelet a flame suddenly appeared ahead of me and i got a look at a young woman who crouched down holding up a cigarette lighter in a hand that shook so badly that it seemed a miracle the lighter stayed aflame no i screamed at her i rose to my feet and lunged toward her put out the light her face swiveled toward me ghostly in the light of the tiny flame her mouth working soundlesslyand then something the size of a mountain lion hit her across the shoulders and flung her to the ground the lighter flew from her hand the little lick of flame showing me something black and gleaming and spattered with scarlet gore the woman screamed the dark hallway became a river of terrified people plunging through the darkness someone fell against me and as i stumbled away from them i stepped on someones fingers in the darkness and tripped when i tried to pull my weight off of them i snarled slammed my back against the wall held up my staff and called up hellfire power flooded down the length of the carved oak its sigils and runes filling with redwhite liquid fire that ran from the base of the staff to its head in a ripple of energy the crisp clean scent of wood smoke filled the air tainted with the barest hint of sulfur and lurid light washed through the hallway i saw people scrambling screaming weeping they were moving away taking advantage of the light while they had it and the hall around me cleared rapidly it left the woman with the lighter she lay on her side curled into a fetal position her arms clasped around her head while the thing mauled her it was equal parts feline and insect all lanky arms powerful legs and a whipping tail tipped with a serrated point its skin was a black shining carapace and it had an elongated eyeless head ending in viscous slimecovered jaws full of teeth though it had no eyes it somehow sensed the light of my powered staff and it whipped around toward me with a hiss body tensing in sinuous grace jaws gaping slime dripping from its teeth while a slow enraged hissing sound emerged from its throat i stared at it for all of a second in the shock of recognition then i gritted my teeth got my feet underneath me pointed the end of my staff at the creature and snarled get away from her you bitch the phage shifted its position the wounded girl now forgotten its limbs weirdly jointed its motion sinuous and eerie it hissed again louder a second pair of jaws emerged from between the first and they too hissed and parted and drooled in challenge is this gonna be a standup fight or just another bug hunt i taunted the phage leapt at me faster than i would have thought possiblebut thats how fast always works lots of people and notpeople are faster than me and id learned to plan for it a long time ago a lot of people think that in a fight speed is the only thing that matters it isnt true oh sure its enormously advantageous to have greater speed but a smart opponent can counter it with good footwork calculating distance to give him the advantage of economy of movement the phage was fast but it had to cross eight or nine feet of carpet to get to me i had to move my hand about ten inches and harden the shield before my left hand with my will it wasnt that fast the phage hit my shield bringing a ghostly blue quarter dome into shape and sending a cascade of blue sparks flying back around me at the last second i turned and angled the shield to deflect the creatures momentum it caromed off the shield and went tumbling along the hallway beyond me for a good twenty feet you want some of this i stepped into the middle of the hall to put myself between the phage and the wounded girl the phage rose turning to flee before it could move i thrust the end of my staff in its direction and cried forzare i hadnt ever used quite that much hellfire before power rushed out of my staff usually when i employed it like this the force i unleashed was invisible this time it rushed out like a scarlet comet like a blazing cannonball the force dipped at the last second then came up at the phage the impact threw it against the ceiling with bonecrushing force and at least twice as much energy as id intended the phage came down limbs thrashing wildly bouncing and skittering frantically like a halfsmashed bug i hit it again the runes in my staff blazing bathing the whole length of the hall in scarlet radiance slamming the phage into a wall with more crunching sounds yellowish liquid splattered there was an absolutely awful smell and sudden holes pocked the wall and the floor where the yellow blood fell i cried havoc in the hellish light and hit it again and again and again i bounced the murdering phage around that hallway until acid burned a hundred holes in the walls ceiling and floor and my blood sang with the battle with the power with triumph i lost track of several seconds the next thing i remember i stood over the crushed twitching phage its the only way to be sure i told it and then with cool deliberation i slammed the end of my staff into the things eyeless skull muscle and magic alike propelling the blow its head crunched and fractured like a cheap taco shell and suddenly there was no phage no creature there was only the damaged hallway the tainted smell of hellish wood smoke and a mound of clear swiftly dissolving ectoplasm my knees shook and i sat down in the hallway i closed my eyes the red light of hellfire continued to pulse through my staff lighting the hall illuminating my eyelids the next thing i knew mouse pressed up against my side an enormous warm silent presence bright lights bobbed toward me flashlights footsteps people were shouting a lot jesus rawlins breathed murphy knelt down by me and touched my shoulder harry im okay i said the girl behind me shes hurt rawlins stood shining his flashlight on a bloody section of the hallway jesus christ the phage had killed three people before i got there i hadnt been able to see much of them during the fight it was a scene of horror worse than any slaughterhouse the phage had taken out a cop i could see a piece of shirt with a bloodstained cpd badge on it the second victim might have been a middleaged man judging by a bloodied orthopedic shoe that still held a foot white leg bone showed two or three inches above the shoe the third victim had been one of the little vampire girls id seen the previous evening i could only tell because her head had landed facing me the rest of her was hopelessly intermixed with the other two bodies theyd need someone good at jigsaw puzzles to put them back together murphy went to the girl with the lighter and knelt over her how is she i asked gone murphy replied i blinked what shes dead no i said i was too tired to feel much of the sudden frustration that went through me hells bells she was moving just a second ago i got here in time murphy grimaced she bled out wait i said staggering to my feet this isnt she shouldnt be i felt a sudden sickness in my stomach was she still alive when the phage had turned to run could i have stopped or slowed the bleeding if i had let the thing retreat to the nevernever i thought of the fight again i thought of the satisfaction of turning the hunter into prey of extracting vengeance for those it had slain i thought about the power that raged through me the sheer precise strength of the hellfireassisted assault and how good it felt to use it on something that had it coming id barely given a thought to the girls condition had i let her die my god i could have let the phage run i could have helped her the girls body lay curled up still like a sleeping child her dead eyes were open and glassy i lunged for a potted plant near me and threw up after i did rawlins observed you dont look so good no i whispered the words tasted bitter i dont mouse let out one of his notwhine breaths and laid his chin on my shoulder my eyes couldnt get away from the dead people not even when they were closed the hellish light in my staff slowly faded and went dark ive got to organize this clusterfuck murphy sighed rawlins keep an eye on him yeah she nodded once and rose briskly moving away snapping orders you you murphy said pointing at two nearby cops get over there and help the wounded airway bleeding heartbeat move she raised her voice and shouted stallings where the hell is my ambulance two minutes a man shouted down a dimly lit hall leading to the lobby it looked like someone had pulled a patrol car or three up to the front of the hotel to shine their headlights into the darkened building clear them a path and call for more emts murphy barked she took her radio off her belt and started giving more orders rawlins looked at the remains and at the acidscarred walls and the enormous areas of smashed drywall and ceiling that looked like theyd been kissed by a wrecking ball he shook his head what the hell happened here bad guy i said i got him not fast enough rawlins grunted come on best we get up to the lobby until they get the lights back on it might not be safe out here what happened on your end i asked damn candle blew up in my face then the lights went out thought for a second id gone blind i grunted sorry some of the civilians were carrying that howling thing went by in the dark and everyone panicked stampede in the dark people got trampled and scared civilians opened fire cops opened fire we got one dead and a couple of dozen wounded by one thing or another we reached the lobby and found more police arriving along with the emergency crews the emts set up shop at once in a makeshift triage area where murphy had brought most of the wounded the emts started stabilizing evaluating resuscitating they had the worst cases loaded in the ambulance and rushing for the hospital within six or seven minutes murphys stream of peremptory commands had slowed to a stop and she stood near the triage area i sidled over to her and loomed mouse pushed his head underneath her hand but murphy only patted him absently i followed her worried blue gaze the emts were working on rick greene sat in a chair nearby he had wiped his face with a towel but it hadnt taken the blood out of the creases it made a sanguine masque of his features he held the towel against his head with his left hand murphy said nothing for a while then she asked did the spell work mostly i said i missed one she tensed is it still no i picked up the spare she pressed her lips firmly together and closed her eyes when the candle went off i hit the fire alarm i wanted to clear the building fast but someone had broken it just like the power and the emergency lights something went right by me and hit greene early on now im the one in charge of this mess what happened to rick she spoke dispassionately hit by panic fire gut shot i dont know how bad hell be all right i told her the emts would have taken him out first if he was in real trouble she watched a pair of them labor over rick yeah she said hell be okay hell be all right she forced herself to look away from her exhusband with a visible effort ive got to get things under control here until we get the chain of command straightened out and i make sure the wounded are cared for families notified god she shook her head and watched the emts lift rick onto a stretcher and carry him out unspoken apology infused her tone after that there will be questions and a rain forest worth of paperwork i get it i told her quietly its your job its my job she focused her eyes in the distance i could feel the trembling tension in her ive known murphy for a while now id seen her like that before when she wanted to fall apart but couldnt take the time to do it she was better at managing that kind of thing than me there was nothing in her expression but calm and confidence ill put off everything i can and get back to you as soon as possible tomorrow sometime dont worry about me murph i told her and dont be too hard on yourself if you hadnt gotten in greenes face and stayed here a lot of people would be dead right now a lot of people are dead right now she said what about our bad guy i felt my mouth stretch into a sharpedged wolfish smile hes entertaining unexpected guests is he going to survive them i doubt it i told her cheerfully if one of those things had jumped me instead of vice versa it would have taken me out three of them would filet me murphys attention was drawn to the door several men in wrinkled suits came in and stood around rubbernecking murphy straightened her clothing what about collateral damage i dont think it will be an issue ill track them and make sure murphy nodded rawlins she called the veteran had been hovering not far away feigning disinterest she hooked a thumb up at me babysit for me shoot rawlins drawled like i got nothing better to do suffer she told him but she smiled when she said it she put her hand on my arm and squeezed hard letting out some of the pressure behind her calm facade through the contact then she strode over to the rubbernecking suits rawlins watched her go his lips pursed that is one castiron bitch he said his tone revealed a quiet respect cast iron hell of a cop i said rawlins grunted problem with cast iron its brittle hit it right and it shatters he looked around the foyer and shook his head this isnt going to go well for her huh i said department is going to crucify someone for it rawlins said they have to i let out a bitter bark of laughter after all she probably saved a lot of lives tonight no good deed goes unpunished rawlins agreed greene blinked blearily at us from his chair and then slurred rawlins what the hell are you doing down here i sent you home anger gathered on his vague expression you son of a bitch youre defying a direct order ill have your ass on a platter rawlins sighed see what i mean i lifted my hand with my thumb and first two fingers extended the others against my palm and moved it in a vaguely mystical gesture from left to right that isnt rawlins green blinked at me and his eyes blurred in and out of focus the distraction derailed the train of thought hed been laboriously assembling it wasnt magic ive taken head shots before it takes a while for your brain to start doing its job again and the vaguest kinds of confusion make things into one big blur i repeated the gesture that isnt rawlins you can go about your business move along greene fumbled with a couple of words then shook his head and closed his eyes and went back to holding the towel against his head rawlins arched an eyebrow you ever handle any divorce negotiations i jerked my head at mouse and said come on before his brains unscramble rawlins fell into pace beside me where are we going i gave him the short version of what id done with the other three phages so now i track them and make sure the guy who called them up is out of play demons rawlins said wizards he shook his head look man he held up a hand no i think about this too much and i wont be any good to you dont explain it dont talk about it let me get through tonight and you can blow my mind all you want cool i told him you got a car yup lets go we went outside and down the street to the nearest parking garage rawlins drove an old blue station wagon a bumper sticker on the back read my kid is too pretty to date your honor student mouse let out a sudden warning growl an engine raced the dog flung his weight at my thigh and sent me slamming up against rawlinss station wagon a van rushed at me in my peripheral vision too fast for me to try to avoid it missed me by less than six inches it didnt miss mouse there was a meaty sound the dog let out a bawl of pain brakes screeched i turned furious and terrified and the runes in my staff seethed with sudden hellfire i had a split second to see darby crane swinging a tire iron then stars exploded in front of my eyes and the parking garage rotated ninety degrees i saw mouse sprawled motionless on the concrete thirty feet away glau cranes lawyer stood beside the open drivers door of the van holding a gun on rawlins see what i mean about head shots fade to black chapter twentysix i came to with a headache and my stomach attempted to slither out of my mouth its escape attempt was blocked by some kind of gag i had the taste of metal in my mouth and my jaws were forced uncomfortably wide the blindfold on my face was almost a mercy given the headache i was pretty sure any light that got into my eyes would hurt like hell my nose was filled with scents old motor oil gasoline vapors dust something metallic and elusively familiar i knew the smell but i couldnt place it i lay prostrate on some cold hard surfaceconcrete at a guess my arms were held up above my head my wrists bound in something cold that prickled with many tiny sharp points thorn manacles then they were meant along with the gag and blindfold to keep me from using my magic if i tried to start focusing my will they would bite and freeze i didnt know where the damned things came from but crane wasnt the first bad guy id met who kept a pair on hand maybe thered been a sale id heard one person claim that theyd been invented by a twothousandyearold lunatic named nicodemus and id heard others claim they were of faerie make personally i figured they were more likely a creation of the red court materiel for their war with the council it would certainly be to their advantage to make sure as many people as possible had a set of restraints with no purpose but to render a mortal wizard helpless hell if i was in the red court id be giving the things away like halloween candy it was a scary notion and for more than one reason i was in trouble up to my eyebrows but my nausea was severe enough that it took me several minutes of effort to care come on harry you arent fighting your way clear of this use your head for starters i was still alive and that told me something all by itself if crane had wanted to kill me hed had all the time he would need to do it he wouldnt even have had to worry about the death curse a wizard could lay down on his enemies on his way into the hereafter unconscious wizards cant throw curses i was still breathing which meant i swallowed which meant that he had other plans for me it did not seem like a promising way to begin thinking my way clear i tried to say rawlins name but my tongue was being held in place by something and it sounded like lahtha here rawlins replied his tone very quiet how you doing la tha yahnah they got me cuffed to a wall he said my own damned cuffs too and they took my keys i cant get to you man sorry ooahahyee where where are we he asked i nodded yah looks like an old auto workshop he replied abandoned metal walls windows are painted over doors chained shut lots and lots of cobwebs ooah lah kuh phruh the light big old shop lamp ah eeoh heh anyone here rawlins asked yah creepy little guy with fish lips he wont talk to me even when i asked pretty please hes sitting in a chair about three feet from you pretending hes a guard dog anger returned to me in full force and made my head pound even harder glau glaud been driving the van glau had killed my dog without consciously making the effort i found myself reaching for my magic for fire enough to cremate the little toad the manacles became a frozen agony that wiped anything resembling thought from my head i bit down on the mouthpiece and forced myself to relax my will i could not afford to allow my impulses to control me or id never get out of this there would come a time when i wouldnt have to bite back on my emotionsbut that time was not yet here wait i promised my anger wait i need to think for now to get clear of my captors and as soon as i did glau was going to have a real bad day i relaxed my will and the pain of the manacles faded patience harry patience a door creaked open and footsteps approached a moment later cranes voice murmured awake i see dresden your head must be as hard as everyone says mr glau if you would be so kind someone fumbled at the hood over my face and it withdrew along with the mouthpiece and i could see that hood and gag were all of a piece charming the mouthpiece had gripped my tongue with two little clamps i spat the taste of metal out of my mouth along with a little bit of blood the hood and muzzle had torn my gums open in a couple of places i lay on my back staring up at a corrugated metal ceiling then looked around at a dim ugly forlornlooking auto shop the nagging sense of familiarity increased the only doors leading out were chained shut and padlocked on the inside and no keys were in sight crane stood over me looking down smiling as tall and dark and handsome as you please my eyes went past him to rawlins the darkskinned cop stood leaning against the wall one wrist cuffed to a metal ring in a steel support beam a bruise severe enough to show even on his dark skin covered one cheek entirely rawlins looked calm remote and unafraid i was fairly sure it was only an act but if so it was a good one crane i said what do you want he smiled a nasty smile to build the future he replied networking is very important in my business cut the crap and talk i said in a flat tone the smile vanished you would be wise not to anger me wizard youre hardly in a position to make demands if you were going to kill me youd have done it already crane let out a rueful laugh i suppose thats true enough i was going to finish you and drop you in the lake but imagine my surprise when i made some calls and it turns out that youre infamous i suggested tough a good dancer crane showed me his teeth marketable for an insignificant young man youve managed to irritate a great many people a little chill went through me i kept it off my face cranes eyes glittered anyway ah yes fear he inhaled deeply his smile turning smug youre smart enough to know when you are powerless at least in my experience most wizards are fairly cowardly when push comes to shove i felt a hot reply coming but again i set my anger asidetemporarily crane was trying to push my buttons he could only get away with it if i allowed him to do so i met his dark eyes and let one corner of my mouth tilt up into a smile in my experience i replied gaze unwavering people who have underestimated me regretted it i didnt feel like being drawn into a soulgaze with crane but i had little to lose if nothing else it might provide me with some valuable insight to his character cranes nerve broke first he turned to walk away from me pretending that hed just received a call on his cell phonehe already had a new one he stood in the shadows on the other side of the room i spat more metal taste out of my mouth and wished i had a glass of water glau sat in a chair nearby watching me the little man had a gun resting in his lap in hand and ready to go a briefcase sat on the floor beside his chair you i said glau looked at me without any readable expression you killed my dog i said get your affairs in order something ugly flickered through his eyes an idle threat you will not live to see the dawn youd best hope i do i said because if i go down i know where my death curse is going glaus lips peeled back from his teeth and i swear to god that they were pointednot like a vampires fangs or a ghouls canines but in solid serrated triangles like a shark he rose the gun twitching in his hand glau snapped crane glau froze for a second and then relaxed and let the gun fall to his side crane shoved the cell phone into his pocket and stalked over to me keep your tongue in your mouth wizard or what i asked youll kill me from where im standing that isnt a worstcase scenario true crane murmured he withdrew a small handgun from his pocket and without so much as blinking shot rawlins in the foot the big cop jerked against the cuffs that held him his face contorted in surprised pain and he fell the cuffs fastened to the beam at shoulder level cut cruelly into his wrists rawlins got his legs underneath him and let out a string of sulfurous curse words crane regarded rawlins for a moment smiled and then pointed the gun at the cops head no i shouted its entirely up to you wizard whether or not his children lose their father behave he smiled again well all be happier again the rage threatened to drown any rational thought in my head threatening me is one thing threatening someone else to get to me is another im sick of seeing decent people suffer im sick of seeing them die patience harry calm rational i was going to have to discourage crane from this tactic with extreme prejudice as a deterrent to future weasels but not yet keep him talking do you understand me crane said i jerked my chin in a brief nod he smirked i want to hear you say it i clenched my jaw and said i understand im so glad we had this talk he said there was a low buzzing sound the almostsilent alert of his cell phone i suppose and he walked away again taking it out of his pocket and lifting it to his ear how long have we been here i asked rawlins hour he mumbled hour and a half i nodded you okay he let out a pained grunt tore open the stitches on my arm he panted foot i dont know cant feel it doesnt look like its bleeding much hang in there i said well get out of this glaus rubbery lips stretched out into a silent little smile though he looked at neither of us bull rawlins said if you can get out you should go once he gets what he wants hes going to kill me anyway dont stay on my account youre siphoning my noble hero vibe i told him cease and desist or ill sue rawlins tried to smile and leaned against the wall weight off his injured foot the lower portion of his left sleeve had soaked through with blood crane returned a moment later smiling like butter wouldnt melt in his mouth start building more tax shelters glau this is going rather well yeah i asked so whos going to pony up for one harry dresden slightly used crane showed me all his teeth im holding an auction as we speak a rather energetic one yeah i asked whos leading his smiled widened why paolo ortegas widow duchess arianna of the red court i suddenly felt cold all over i was captured by the red court once held in the dark by a crowd of hissing monstrous shapes they did things there was nothing i could do about it i still had the nightmares to remind me not every night maybe but often enough often enough crane closed his eyes and inhaled with a satisfied expression shell be quite creative when it comes to dealing with her husbands bane i dont blame you for feeling terrified who wouldnt hey i told him grasping at straws call the white council if nothing else maybe theyll run the bidding up for you crane laughed i already have he said hope twitched somewhere inside me if the council knew i was in trouble then maybe they would be able to do something they might be on the way even now i needed to stall crane keep him occupied yeah what did they say his smile widened that the white councils unyielding policy is one of nonnegotiation with terrorists hopes corpse went through some postmortem twitching his phone buzzed again he stepped away and spoke quietly his back to us after a moment he snapped his fingers and said glau get on the computer the auction is closing in five minutes and theres always a lastsecond rush well need to verify an account he turned back to the phone no unacceptable a numbered account only i dont trust those people at paypal hey i protested are you selling me on ebay crane winked at me ironic eh though i confess a bit of surprise how do you know what it is i read i told him ahhh he said glau computer glau nodded but said they should not be unwatched i can see them crane replied irritation in his voice move by his expression glau clearly did not agree with crane but he went i licked my lips struggling to think through my headache and anxiety and a solid lump of despair there had to be a way out of this there was always a way out i had found ways out of desperate straits before of course id had my magic available then damn those manacles as long as they kept my power constrained i would never be able to free myself or rawlins so moron i thought to myself get rid of the manacles get around them do something ifs your only chance how i muttered out loud i dont know a damned thing about them rawlins blinked at me i grimaced shook my head at him and closed my eyes i shut away the distractions and turned my focus inward it was easy to imagine an empty place flat dark floor illuminated from above by a single light shining without apparent source i imagined myself standing beneath it lasciel my imageself said quietly i seek counsel she appeared at once stepping into the circle of light she wore her most familiar form the functional white tunic the tall lovely figure but her golden hair now appeared as a waistlength sheet of deep auburn she bowed deeply and murmured i am here my host you changed your hair i said her mouth flirted with a smile there are too many blondes in your life my host i feared i would be lost in the press i sighed the manacles i said do you know of them she bowed again indeed my host they are of an ancient make wrought by the trollsmiths of the unseelie court and employed against those of your talents for a thousand years and more i blinked at her faeries made those i was dimly aware that in my surprise i had spoken the words aloud i clenched my physical jaws shut and focused on the imageme briefly wondering just how badly cracked my engine block was going to get by trying to keep track of my own personal internal reality in addition to the actual threatening reality where rawlins and i were in deep trouble hell for that matter i supposed it was entirely possible that i already had snapped it wasnt as though anyone but me had ever seen lasciel perhaps in addition to existing only in my head she was all in my imagination kind of a waking dream for a minute i thought about abandoning the wizarding biz and taking up a career that would let me crawl under rocks and hide professionally you neednt attempt to keep your inner self separate from your physical self lasciel said in a reasonable tone i should be happy to advise you from the outside so to speak oh no i said keeping all the conversation on the inside ive got problems enough without adding a sentient hallucination to the mix as you wish lasciel replied you are i take it seeking a way to overcome the bindings of the thorn manacles obviously can it be done all things are possible lasciel assured me though some of them are extremely unlikely how i demanded of her this is not the time to get coy with me if i die youre coming along for the ride i am aware she replied arching an eyebrow they are a crafting of faerie make my host seek that which is bane to they who made it iron i said at once nodding and sunlight trolls cant stand either i opened my actual eyes and glanced around the interior of the garage sunlights out of town for a few hours yet but weve got lots and lots of iron rawlins has a free hand if i get a tool to him maybe he could shatter a link of the manacles chain then i could break his cuffs or something point of logic the fallen angel pointed out given that you are not free to retrieve a tool getting one to rawlins seems problematic yeah but in addition she continued you are exhausted and it is reasonable to assume that crane will finish his negotiations shortly and turn you over to one of your foes you have insufficient time to recover your strength i guess she continued in the firm tone of a schoolteacher addressing a stubborn child you have in the past expressed much frustration and doubt that your control of physical forces was precise enough to break handcuffs without breaking the person held in them i sighed true but the only egress from this place is chained shut and you do not have the key it isnt and finally she finished lest you forget you are being guarded by at least one supernatural being who will hardly stand gawking while you attempt escape i glowered anyone ever told you that you have a very negative attitude she arched a brow the expression an invitation to continue the line of thought i chewed on my lip and forged another couple of links in the chain of thought which isnt helpful but your ass is as deep in alligators as mine and you want to help so my stomach sank a little you can offer me another option she smiled pleased very good i dont want it i said why ever not because a freaking fallen angel is offering it thats why ever not youre poison lady dont think i dont know it she lifted a longfingered hand to me palm out i ask only that you hear me out if what i offer is not to your liking i will of course support your efforts to form an alternate plan i upgraded the glower to a glare she regarded me in perfect calm dammit the best way to keep yourself from doing something grossly selfdestructive and stupid is to avoid the temptation to do it for example it is far easier to fend off inappropriate amorous desires if one runs screaming from the room every time a pretty girl comes in which sounds silly i know but the same principle applies to everything else if i let her talk to me lasciel would propose something calm and sane and reasonable and effective it would require a small price of me if nothing else by making me a tiny bit more dependent upon her advice and assistance whatever happened shed gain another smidgen of influence over me baby steps on the highway to hell lasciel was an immortal she could afford patience whereas i could not afford temptation it came down to this if i didnt hear her out and didnt get out of this mess rawlinss blood would be on my hands and whoever was behind the slaughter around the convention might well keep right on escalating more people could die oh and id wind up enjoying some kind of torquemadaesque vacation with whichever fiend had the most money and the least lag when a concept like that is an afterthought you know things are bad lasciel watched me with patient blue eyes all right i told her lets hear it chapter twentyseven we plotted the fallen angel and me it went fast it turns out that holding an allmental conversation gets things done at the literal speed of thought without all those clunky phonemes to get in the way barely a minute had passed when i opened my eyes and said very quietly to rawlins youre right theyll kill you we have to get out of here the cop gave me a pained grimace and nodded how i struggled and sat up i rolled my shoulders a little trying to get some blood flowing through my arms which had been manacled together underneath me i tested the chain it had been slipped through an inverted ubolt in the concrete floor the links rattled metallically as they slid back and forth i checked crane at the noise the man kept speaking intently into his cell phone and took no apparent notice of the movement im going to slip one of these manacles off my wrist i told him i nodded at a discarded old rolling tool cabinet there should be something in there i can use ill cut us both out rawlins shook his head those two going to stand there watching while we do all that ill do it fast i said then what i kill the lights and we get out door is chained shut rawlins said let me worry about that rawlins squinted he looked very tired why not he said nodding why not i nodded and closed my eyes slowed my breathing and began to concentrate hey rawlins said how you going to slip your cuffs ever heard about yogis out east yogi berra he said at once and yogi bear not those yogis as in snake charmers oh right they spend a lifetime learning to control their body they can do some fairly amazing stuff rawlins nodded like fold themselves up into a gym bag and sit inside it at the bottom of a pool for half an hour right i said i followed lasciels instructions sinking into deeper and deeper focus some of them can collapse the bones in their hands use their muscles and tendons to alter tensions change the shape i focused on my left hand and for a moment was a bit grateful that it was already so badly maimed and mostly numb what i was about to do even with lasciels instruction was going to hurt like hell keep an eye out and be ready he nodded holding still and not turning his head toward either crane or glau i dismissed him the warehouse my headache and everything else that wasnt my hand from my perceptions i had the general idea of what was supposed to happen but i didnt have any practical secondtosecond knowledge of it it was a terribly odd sensation as though i were a skilled pianist whose fingers had suddenly forgotten their familiarity with the keys not too quickly murmured lasciels voice in my head your muscles and joints have not been conditioned to this there was an odd sensation in my thoughts somehow similar to abruptly remembering how to tie a knot that had once been thoughtlessly familiar like this lasciels presence whispered and that same familiarity suddenly thrummed down my arm i flexed my thumb made a rippling motion of my fingers and tightened every muscle in my hand in a sudden clench i dislocated my thumb with a sickly little crackle of damaged flesh for a second i thought the pain would drop me unconscious no lasciels voice said you must control this you must escape i know i snarled back at her in my mind apparently nerve damage from burns doesnt stop you from feeling it when someone pulls your fingers out of their sockets someone lasciel said you did it to yourself my host would you back off and give me room to work thats ridiculous lasciel replied but the sense of her presence abruptly retreated i took deep quiet breaths and twisted my left hand my flesh screamed protest but i only embraced the pain and continued to move slow and steady i got the fingers of my right hand to lightly grasp the manacle on my left wrist and began to draw my hand steadily against the cold binding circle of metal my hand folded in a way that was utterly alien in sensation and the screaming pain of it stole my breath but it slipped an inch beneath the metal cuff i twisted my hand again in exactly the same motion never letting up the pressure working to encompass the pain as something to aid me rather than distract i slipped an inch closer to freeing my hand the pain became more and more intense despite my efforts to divert it like an afternoon sun that burns brightly into your eyes even though theyre closed only a moment more i only needed to remain silent and focused for a few more seconds i bore the pain i kept up the pressure and abruptly i felt the cold metal of the cuff flick over the outside of my thumb one of the few spots on my fingers where much tactile sensation remained my hand came free and i clutched tightly to the empty cuff with my right hand to keep it from rattling i opened my eyes and glanced around the garage crane paced back and forth in conversation on his phone i waited until his back was mostly turned to move then i rose and slipped the chain through the ubolt on the floor until the circle of the cuff pressed against the bolt i was still tethered by a chain perhaps a foot long but i moved as silently as i could and reached out with my throbbing left hand for the wheeled tool cabinet i had trouble getting my fingers to cooperate but i slipped the cabinet open the tools inside it had been there for a long timeseveral years at least they were spotted with rust i could only see about half the cabinet from where i crouched and there wasnt anything there that could help me i hated to do it but i felt around the unseen portion of the cabinet with my clumsy fingers i was terrified that i wouldnt be able to feel a tool even if my fingers found it and even more frightened by the knowledge that i might knock something over and draw attention my hand shook but i felt through the cabinet as quickly and lightly as i could starting at the top and moving down on the floor of the cabinet i felt an object the handle of some kind of tool i drew it out as quietly as i could and found myself holding a hacksaw my heart leapt with excitement i returned to more or less my original position with my captors seemingly none the wiser and took a grip on the saw my distorted thumb hurt abominably so i took the hacksaw in my right hand took a deep breath and then began slicing at the chain link immediately below the empty manacle i could only cut in strokes eight or nine inches long because of the chain still attached to my right wrist and it made a low buzzing racket that could not be mistaken for anything but a saw i was sure i would not have time to cut myself freebut the heavyduty steel of the hacksaws blade ripped into the silvery metal chain as if it were made of pine three four five strokes of the hacksaw and the link parted i jerked hard with my right hand and the chain slid through the ubolt the broken link snapping as the cuffs struck the bolt i rose free crane let out a sudden startled sound dropped his cell phone and went for his gun there was no time to free rawlins so i tossed him the hacksaw and then threw myself to one side as crane let off a shot sparks leapt up from the rolling cabinets surface and a rush of adrenaline made the pains of my body vanish i kept my head down as low as i could and scurried to one side attempting to put the bulk of an old rusted pickup truck between crane and me i reached for my magic but the cuff still attached to my arm reacted with that same burst of agony splintering my concentration i caught a glimpse of movement crane circled to one side looking for a clear line of fire i maneuvered like a squirrel keeping the truck between us and crouching low to deny him a clean shot i went for the passenger door hoping to find something anything i could use to defend myself in the truck locked glau crane shouted his second shot shattered the trucks passenger window the bullet passing within a few inches of my head i reached up unlocked the trucks door and swung it open the cab was cluttered with empty cigarette packs discarded fastfood wrappers crushed beer cans a heavyduty claw hammer and three or four glass beer bottles perfect i clutched the hammers wrapped steel handle in my teeth scooped up the bottles and threw one at the far side of the garage it shattered loudly i rose at once another bottle ready and hurled it with as much force as i could the first bottle had caused crane to snap his head to one side looking for the source of the sound he looked away from me for only a second but it was distraction enough to allow me to throw the bottle tumbled end over end and smashed into the work lamp with a crash of breaking glass sparks showered up in a brief cloud of electric outrage and then heavy darkness slammed down upon us now i thought to lasciel darkness vanished replaced with lines and planes of silver light that outlined the garage the truck the tool cabinets and workbenches as well as the doors and windows and the bolt on the wall where rawlins was chained i was not actually seeing the garage of course for there was no physical light for my eyes to see instead i was looking at an illusion the portion of lasciel in my head was capable of creating illusory sensations of almost any kind though if i suspected any tampering i could defend myself against it easily enough this illusion however was not meant to deceive shed placed it there to help me gleaning the precise dimensions and arrangements of the garage from my own senses and projecting them to my eyes to enable me to move in the dark it wasnt a perfect illusion of course it was merely a model it didnt keep track of animate objects and if anything moved around i wouldnt know it until id knocked myself unconscious on itbut i wouldnt need it for long i ran for rawlins glau crane screamed no more than ten or twelve feet away cover the door i flung the third bottle to the floor at my feet it was an exceedingly odd sensation for the bottle was outlined in silver light until it left my hand it vanished into the darkness and shattered on the floor near me there was a moment of frozen silence broken only by the rasp of a hacksaw against rawlinss cuffs crane took a couple of steps toward me then hesitated and though i could not see him i could sense the hesitation then he moved again away from me probably assuming i was attempting another distraction my lips stretched into a wolfish smile and i padded to rawlins my steps sure and steady even in the total darkness i reached the bolt on the steel beam and found rawlins standing beneath it breathing hard sawing as fast as he could he jumped when i touched his shoulder but i took the hammer in hand and whispered its harry get your head down he did i looked up at the silvery illusion of the bolt steadied my breathing and drew the hammer back very slowly focusing upon that movement and nothing else then i hissed out a breath and struck at the bolt with every ounce of force i could physically muster im not a weightlifter but no ones ever accused me of being a sissy either more importantly years and years of my metaphysical studies and practice had given me considerable skill at focus and concentration the hammer struck the bolt that held the other ring of rawlinss cuffs sparks flew the bolt as rusted and ruined as the rest of the building snapped rawlins dragged me to the ground a heartbeat before cranes pistol thundered again from the far side of the garage a bullet caromed off the metal beam with an ugly highpitched whine come on i hissed i seized rawlinss shirt he grunted and stumbled blindly after me trying to be quiet but given his injuries there was only so much he could do speed would have to serve where stealth was not available i hauled him directly across the garage floor skipping around a mechanics pit and several stacks of old tires where are we going rawlins gasped where is the door we arent taking the door i whisperedwhich was true i wasnt sure that wed have a way out of the garage but we certainly wouldnt leave via the door the full moon garage had been abandoned since the disappearance of its previous owners a gang of lycanthropes with a notable lack of common sense when it came to choosing enemies it wasnt as big a coincidence as it seemed that crane was using the same building it was old abandoned had no windows was close to the convention center and easy to get in and out of more to the point it had been a place where fairly horrible things happened and the ugly energy of them still lingered in the air i wasnt sure what crane and glau were exactly but a place like this would feel comfortable and familiar to many denizens of the dark side id been held captive in the building before and my means of egress was still therea hole beneath the edge of the cheap corrugated metal wall dug down into the earth and out into the gravel parking lot by a pack of wolves i got to the wall and knelt down to check lasciels mental model against the reality it represented the hole was still there if anything the years had worn it even deeper and wider i shoved rawlinss hands down to let him feel it go i whispered under the wall and out he grunted assent and started hauling himself through it rawlins was built a lot heavier than me but he fit through the timewidened hole i crouched down to follow him but heard running footsteps just behind me i ducked to one side my eyes now adjusting enough to let me see faint ambient city light trickling through the hole i saw a vague shape in the darkness and then saw glaus hands seize rawlinss wounded foot rawlins screamed i lunged forward and smashed the claw hammer down onto glaus forearm it hit with brutal force and a sound of breaking bone glau let out a wild falsetto ululating scream like that of some kind of primitive warrior the hammer jerked out of my hands i heard a whirr in the air and ducked in time to avoid glau returning the favor i twisted swinging the chain still attached to the remaining manacle along at what i estimated to be glaus eye level the chain hit he let out another shrieking cry falling backward i dove for the hole and wriggled through it like a greased weasel cranes gun went off again punching a hole in the wall ten feet away running footsteps retreated and metal clinked i heard myself whimpering and had a flashback to any number of nightmares where i could not move swiftly enough to escape the danger any second i expected to take a bullet or for glau to lay into me with the hammer or his sharklike teeth rawlins grabbed my wrist and pulled me through i got to my feet looking around the little gravel lot wildly for the nearest coverseveral stacks of old tires i didnt have to point at it for rawlins to get the idea we ran for it rawlinss wounded leg almost gave out and i slowed to help him looking back for our pursuers glau wriggled out of the hole just as we had rose to a crouch and threw the claw hammer it tumbled end over end flying as swiftly as a majorleague fastball and hit me in the ass a shock went through me on impact and my balance wavered as half of my lower body went numb i tried to clutch at rawlins for balance but the hand id distorted wasnt strong enough to hold and the force of the blow threw me down to the gravel the impact tore open all the defenses id rallied against my bodys various pains and for a second i could barely move much less flee glau drew a long curved blade from his belt something vaguely arabic in origin he bounded after us it was hopeless but rawlins and i tried to run anyway there were a couple of light footsteps a blurring figure running far too swiftly to be human and crane kicked my functional leg out from underneath me i dropped he delivered a vicious blow to rawlinss belly the cop went down too crane his face pale and furious snarled i warned you to behave wizard he lifted the gun and pointed it at rawlinss head youve just killed this man chapter twentyeight a dark figure stepped out of the deep shadows behind the stacks of tires pointed a sawedoff shotgun at glau and said howdy glau whirled to face the newcomer hand already lifting the knife the interloper pulled the trigger thunder filled the air the blast threw glau to the gravel like an enormous flopping fish thomas stepped out into the wan light of a distant streetlamp dressed all in loose black clothing including my leather duster which fell all the way to his ankles his hair was ragged and windtossed and his grey eyes were cold as he worked the action on the shotgun ejecting the spent shell and levering a fresh one into the chamber the barrel of the shotgun snapped to crane son of a bitch now i knew whod been following me around town you crane said in a hollowsounding voice staring at thomas me thomas agreed insouciant cheer thick in his voice lose the gun madrigal cranes lip lifted into a sneer but he did lower the pistol and drop it to the ground kick it over here thomas said crane did it ignoring me completely i thought youd be dead by now coz god knows you made enemies enough within the house much less the rest of the court i get by thomas drawled then he used a toe to flick the gun over to me cranes eyes widened in surprise then narrowed i picked up the revolver and checked the cylinder my distorted left hand functioned weakly but it hurt like hell and would until i could get enough quiet and focus to get everything back into its proper place my headache intensified to a fine distracting agony as i bent over but i ignored that too though i walk through the valley of the shadow of trauma i will fear no concussion cranes revolver held freshly loaded rounds all six of them i put them back and checked on rawlins between the pain of his recent injuries and the strain of our flight and recapture the big cop did not look well isnt bad he said quietly just hurts tired sit tight i told him well get you out of here he nodded and lay there watching developments his eyes only half aware i made sure he wasnt bleeding too badly then rose pointed the gun at crane and took position between him and rawlins hows it going dresden thomas asked took you long enough i said thomas grinned but it didnt touch his eyes his gaze never left crane have you ever met my cousin madrigal raith i knew he didnt look like a darby i said thomas nodded wasnt that a movie with janet munro and sean connery thought so thomas said madrigal raith watched the exchange through narrowed eyes maybe it was a trick of the light but he looked paler now his features almost eerily fine or maybe now that thomas had identified him as a white court vampire i could correctly interpret the warnings my instincts had shrieked at me during our first talk there was little but contempt in madrigals eyes as he stared at my brother you have no idea what youre getting yourself involved in coz ill not surrender this prize to you oh but you will thomas said in his best snidely whiplash villain voice cranes eyes flickered with something hot and furious dont push me little coz ill make you regret it thomass laugh rang out full of scorn and confidence you couldnt make water run downhill walk away while you still can dont be stupid madrigal replied do you know what kind of money hes worth is it the kind that spends in hell thomas asked because if you keep this up youll need it madrigal sneered youd kill family in cold blood thomas you there are statues that dont have a poker face as good as thomass maybe you havent put it together yet madrigal im banished remember you arent family madrigal regarded thomas for a long minute before he said youre bluffing thomas looked at me a quality of inquiry to his expression and said he thinks im bluffing make sure he can talk i said cool thomas said and shot madrigal in the feet the light and thunder of the shotguns blast rolled away leaving madrigal on the ground hissing out a thready shriek of agony he curled up to clutch at the gory ruins of his ankles and feet blood a few shades too pale to be human spattered the gravel touche grunted rawlins a certain satisfaction in his tone it took madrigal a while to control himself and find his voice youre dead he whispered pain making the words quiver and shake you gutless little swine youre dead uncle will kill you for this my half brother smiled and worked the action of the shotgun again i doubt my father cares he replied he wouldnt mind losing a nephew particularly not one who has been consorting with scum like house malvora aha i said quietly putting two and two together now i get it hes like them like what thomas asked a phobophage i said quietly he feeds on fear the way you feed on lust thomass expression turned a bit nauseated yes a lot of the malvora do madrigals pale strained face twisted into a vicious smile you should try it some night coz its sick mad thomas said there was an almost ghostly sense of sadness or pity in his tone so subtle that i would not have seen it before living with him hell i doubt he realized it was there himself its sick and its made you sick you feed on mortal desires for the little death madrigal said his eyes half closing i feed on their desire for the real thing we both feed in the end we both kill theres no difference the difference is that once youve started you cant let them go running off to report you to the authorities thomas said you keep them until theyre dead madrigal let out a laugh unsettling for how genuine it sounded given his situation i got the sneaking suspicion that the vampire was a couple of peeps short of an easter basket thomas thomas madrigal murmured always the selfrighteous little bleeding heart so concerned for the bucks and doesas though you never tasted them yourself never killed them yourself thomass expression went opaque again but his eyes were flat with sudden anger madrigals smile widened at the response his teeth shone white in the evenings gloom ive been feeding well whereas you well without your little darkeyed whore to take without warning without a flicker of expression on thomass face the shotgun roared again and the blast took madrigal across the knees more toopale blood spattered the gravel holy crap madrigal went prone again body arching in agony the pain choking his scream down to an anemic little echo of a real shriek thomas planted his boot on madrigals neck his expression cold and calm but for the glittering rage in his eyes he pumped the next shell in and held the shotgun in one hand shoving the barrel against madrigals cheekbone madrigal froze quivering in agony eyes wide and desperate never thomas murmured very quietly ever speak of justine madrigal said nothing but my instincts screamed again something in the way he held himself something in his eyes told me that he was acting hed maneuvered the conversation to justine deliberately he was playing on thomass feelings for justine distracting us i spun to see glau on his feet just as though he hadnt been given a lethal dose of buckshot in the chest from ten feet away he shot across the parking lot at a full sprint running for the van parked about fifty feet away he ran in utter silence without the crunch of gravel or the creak of shoes and for a second i thought i saw maybe an inch and a half of space between where he planted his running feet and the ground thomas i said glaus running relax thomas said and his eyes never left madrigal i heard the scrabble of claws on gravel and then mouse shot out of the shadows that had hidden thomas he flashed by me in what was for him a relaxed lope but as glau approached the van mouse accelerated to a full sprint in the last couple of steps before glau reached the van i thought i saw something forming around the great dogs forequarters tiny flickers of pale colors almost like saint elmos fire then mouse threw himself into a leap i saw glaus expression reflected in the vans windshield his toowide eyes goggling in total surprise then mouse slammed his chest and shoulder into glaus back like a living battering ram the force of the impact took glaus balance completely and sent the man into a vicious impact with the vans dented front bumper glau hit hard hard enough that i heard bones breaking from fifty feet away and his head whiplashed down onto the hood and rebounded with neckbreaking force glau bounced off the vans front bumper and hood and landed in a limp boneless pile on the ground mouse landed skidded on the gravel and spun to face glau he watched the downed man for a few seconds legs stiff his back legs dug twice at the gravel throwing up dust and rocks in challenge glau never stirred mouse sniffed and then let out a sneeze that might almost have been actual words so there then the dog turned and trotted right over to me favoring one leg slightly grinning a proud canine grin he shoved his broad head under my hand in his customary demand for an ear scratching i did it while something released in my chest with a painful little snapping sensation my dog was all right maybe my eyes misted up a little i dropped to one knee and slid an arm around the mutts neck good dog i told him mouses tail wagged proudly at the praise and he leaned against me i made sure my eyes were clear then looked up to find madrigal staring at the dog in shock and fear that isnt a dog the vampire whispered but hell do anything for a scooby snack i said spill it madrigal what are you doing in town how are you involved with the attacks he licked his lips and shook his head i dont have to talk to you he said and you dont have time to make me the gunshots even in this neighborhood the police will be here soon true i said so heres how its going to work thomas when you hear a siren pull the trigger madrigal made a choking sound i smiled i want answers thats all give them to me and we go away otherwise i shrugged and made a vague gesture at thomas mouse stared at him and a steady growl bubbled from his throat madrigal shot a look over at the fallen glau who by god was moving his arms and legs in an aimless stunned fashion mouses growl grew louder and madrigal tried to squirm a little farther from my dog even if i did talk whats to keep you from killing me once ive told you madrigal thomas said quietly youre a vicious little bitch but youre still family id rather not kill you we left your jann alive play ball and both of you walk you would side with this mortal buck against your own kind thomas my own kind booted me out thomas replied i take work where i can get it pariah vampire and pariah wizard madrigal murmured i suppose i can see the advantages regardless of how the war turns out he watched thomas steadily for a moment and then looked at me i want your oath on it you have it i said answer me honestly and i let you leave chicago unharmed he swallowed and his eyes flicked to the shotgun still pressed to his cheek my oath as well he said ill speak true and that settled that pretty much everything on the supernatural side of the street abided by a rigid code of traditional conduct that respected things like ones duties as a host ones responsibility as a guest and the integrity of a sworn oath i could trust madrigals oath once hed openly made it probably thomas looked at me i nodded he eased his boot off of madrigals neck and took a step back holding the shotgun at his side though his stance became no less wary madrigal sat up wincing at his legs there was a low crackling kind of noise coming from them the bleeding had already stopped i could see portions of his calf where the pants had been ripped away the skin there actually bubbled and moved and as i watched a round lump the size of a pea formed in the skin and burst expelling a round buckshot that fell to the parking lot lets start simple i said wheres the key to the manacles van he replied his tone calm my stuff van keys i held out my hand madrigal drew a rentalcar key ring from his pocket and tossed it to me underhand thomas i said holding them up you sure he asked mouse can watch him i want this fucking thing off my arm thomas took the keys and paced over to the van he paused to idly check his hair in the reflection in the windshield before opening the van vanity thy name is vampire now for the real question i told madrigal how are you involved with the attacks im not involved he said quietly not in the planning and not in the execution ive been scheduled here for more than a year doesnt scream alibi to me i said im not he insisted of course i thought them entertaining and yes the his eyelids half lowered and his voice went suddenly husky the storm of it the horror empty night so sweet all those souls in fear get off the creepy psychic vampire train i said answer the question he gave me an ugly smile and gestured at his healing legs you see ive fed and fed well tonight particularly but you have my word wizard that whatever these creatures are they are none of my doing i was merely a spectator if thats true i said then why the hell did you grab me and bring me here for gain he said and for enjoyment i dont let any buck talk to me as you did since id planned on replying to your arrogance anyway i thought i might as well turn a profit on it at the same time god bless america i said thomas returned with my magical gear staff backpack a paper sack with my various foci in it and an oldfashioned key with big teeth i popped it in the slot on the manacles fumbling with the stiff uncooperative fingers of my left hand and got the thing off my arm my skin tingled for a moment and i reached experimentally for my magic no whiteout of pain i was a wizard again i put on my amulet bracelet and ring i felt the backpack to make sure bobs skull was still in there it was and i breathed a mental sigh of relief bobs arcane knowledge was exceeded only by his inability to distinguish between moral right and wrong his knowledge in the wrong hands could be dangerous as hell no i said quietly it isnt a coincidence that youre there madrigal i just told you i believe you i said but i dont think it was a coincidence either i think you were there for a reason maybe one you didnt know madrigal frowned at that and looked for a moment a little bit worried i pursed my lips and thought aloud youre highprofile youre known to feed on fear youre at war with the white council two and two make four four and four make eight i glanced up at thomas and said whoever it is behind the phage attacks they wanted me to think that darby here was it thomass eyebrows went up in sudden understanding madrigals supposed to take the fall madrigals face turned even whiter what do you he didnt get to finish the question glau screamed he screamed in pure shrieking terror his voice pitched as high as a womans everyone turned in surprise and we were in time to see something haul the wounded glau out of sight on the other side of the van red sprayed into the air a piece of him probably an arm or a leg flew out from behind the van and tumbled for several paces before falling heavily to earth glaus voice abruptly went silent something arched up from behind the van and landed rolling it bumped over the gravel and came to a stop glaus head it had been physically ripped from his body the flesh and bone torn and wrenched apart by main strength his face was stretched into a scream showing his sharklike teeth and his eyes were glazed and frozen in death orange light rose up behind the van and then something a creature perhaps ten or eleven feet in height rose up and turned to face us it was dressed all in rags like some kind of enormous hobo and was inhumanly slender its head was a bulbous thing and it took me a second to recognize it as a pumpkin carved with evil eyes like a jackolanterns those eyes glowed with a sullen red flame and flashed intensely for a moment as it spied us then it took a long step over the hood of the van and came at us with strides that looked slow but ate up yards with every step good god rawlins breathed mouse snarled harry thomas said another phage in a horror movie costume the scarecrow this time i murmured ill handle it i took my staff in hand and stepped out to meet the oncoming phage i called up the hellfire once more as i had against the other phage until my skin felt like it was about to fly apart i gathered up energy for a strike more deadly than i had used earlier in the night then i cried out and unleashed my will against the creature hitting it as hard as i possibly could the resulting cannonball of blazing force struck the scarecrow headon while it was twenty feet away exploding into a column of searing red flame an inferno of heat and light that went off with enough force to throw the thing halfway across lake michigan imagine my surprise when the scarecrow stepped through my spell as if it had not existed its eyes regarded me with far too much awareness and its arm moved strikingsnake fast fingers as thick and tough as pumpkin vines suddenly closed around my throat and in a rush of sudden terrifying understanding i realized that this phage was stronger than the little one id beaten at the hotel this creature was far older larger stronger more dangerous my vision darkened to a starspangled tunnel as the scarecrow wrapped its other hand around my left thigh lifted me to the horizontal over its head and started to rip me in half chapter twentynine harry thomas shouted i heard a rasp of steel and saw thomas draw an old us cavalry saber from inside my duster he tossed the shotgun to the wounded rawlins and rushed forward mouse beat him there the big dog snarled and threw himself at the scarecrow obliging the creature to release my leg so that it could swing a spindly arm and fist at my dog the scarecrow was strong it struck mouse in midleap and batted him into the corrugated steel wall of the full moon garage like he was a tennis ball there was a crash and mouse bounced off the wall and landed heavily on his side leaving a dent in the steel where hed hit he thrashed his legs and managed to rise to a wobbly stand mouse had given thomas an opening and my brother leapt to the top of an old metal trash bin then bounded fifteen feet through the air whipping the sword down on the wrist of the arm that held me in choke thomas was never weak but he was tapping into his powers as a vampire of the white court as he attacked and his skin was a luminous white his eyes metallic silver the blow parted the scarecrows hand from its arm and dropped me a good five or six feet to the ground even as i fell i knew i had to move away from the creature and fast i managed to have my balance more or less in place when i hit and i fell into a roll using the momentum to help me rise to a running start but a problem developed that damned scarecrows hand had not ceased choking me and had not lost any of its strength my headlong retreat turned into a drunken stumble as my air ran out and i clutched at the tough vinefingers crushing my windpipe shut i went to my knees and one hand and out of the corner of my eye i saw rawlins lift the shotgun and begin pumping rounds into the oncoming scarecrow from where he sat on the ground the rounds slowed the oncoming creature but they did nothing to harm it my throat was on fire and i knew i had only seconds of consciousness left in pure desperation i took my staff and in a dizzying gesture dragged it through a complete circle in the gravel at my feet i touched my hand to the circle willing power into it and felt the field of magic that it formed spring up around me in a silent invisible column the circles power cut the scarecrows severed hand off from the main body of the creature and like the phage in the hallway of the hotel it abruptly transformed into transparent jelly that splattered down onto the gravel beneath my chin and soaked my shirt in sticky goo i sucked in a breath of pure euphoria and though i was on my knees i turned to face the scarecrow and did not retreat so long as the circle around me maintained its integrity there was no way for the phage to get to me it should buy me a little time to get the air back into my lungs and to work out my next attack the scarecrow let out an angry hissing sound and swung its stump of an arm down at rawlins the veteran cop saw it coming and rolled out of the way as though he were an agile young man barely avoiding the blow thomas used an old metal oil drum as a platform for another leap this time driving his heels into the scarecrows back at what would have been the base of its spine on a human the impact sent the scarecrow to the ground but as it landed it kicked a long leg at thomas and struck his saber arm breaking it with a wet snap of bone thomas howled scrambling back leaving his fallen sword on the ground the scarecrow whirled back to me eyes blazing with an alien rage and i could swear that i saw recognition in them it looked from me to rawlins and then with a hissing cackle it went after the cop dammit i waited until the last second and then broke the circle with a sweep of my foot snatching up thomass sword i charged forward the scarecrow whirled the moment the circle went down sweeping out a great fist that could have broken my neck but it hadnt expected me to charge and i was inside its reach before it realized what i had done i let out a shout and struck at one of the scarecrows legs but it was quicker than i thought and the sabers blade barely clipped the thick sturdy viny limb the scarecrow let out a hiss loud and sharp enough to hurt my ears and tried to kick me but i slipped to one side just in time and the blow intended for me instead scattered several stacks of tires madrigal raith rose up from among the fallen tires only a couple of feet away from me shrieking with fear the scarecrows eyes blazed into painfully bright flames when it saw madrigal and it started for him get to the van i shouted hopping back to stand beside madrigal we need wheels if were going to get away from this without so much as a seconds hesitation madrigal stuck out his hand and shoved me between himself and the monster sending me into a sprawl at the scarecrows feet while he turned to flee in the opposite direction before i hit the ground i was already calling power into my shield bracelet and i twisted to land on my right side holding my left hand and its shield up if id been half a second slower the scarecrow would have stomped its foot down onto my skull instead it hit the half sphere of my sorcerous shield with so much force that the shield sent off a flare of light and heat so that it looked like an enormous bluewhite bowl above me furious the scarecrow seized an empty barrel and hurled it down at my shield i hardened my will as it struck and turned the force of the throw sending the barrel bouncing over the gravel but it had gotten closer to me than the first blow a second later its fist hammered down and then it found a bent aluminum ladder in a pile of junk and slammed it down at me i managed to block the attacks but each one came a little closer to my hide i didnt dare to let up my concentration for a moment in an effort to move away the damned thing was so strong i wouldnt survive a mistake a single blow from one of its limbs or improvised weapons would probably kill me outright but if i didnt get away the creature would hammer through the shield anyway mouse charged in again on three legs this time bellowing an almost leonine battle roar as he did so the scarecrow struck out at mouse but the dogs attack had been a feint and he avoided the blow while remaining just out of the scarecrows reach the scarecrow turned back to me but mouse rushed it again forcing the scarecrow to abandon its attack lest mouse close in from behind i rolled clear of the scarecrows reach and regained my feet sword in my right hand shining blue shield blazing on my left id been throwing an awful lot of magic around tonight and i was feeling it my legs trembled and i wasnt sure how much more i could do mouse and i circled the monster opposite one another playing wolf pack to the scarecrows bear each of us menacing the creatures flanks when it turned to the other we held our own for maybe a minute but it was a losing bet longterm mouse was moving on three legs and tiring swiftly i wasnt much better off the second one of us slipped or moved too slowly the scarecrow would drive us into the ground like a fence post a wet red squishy fence post light shone abruptly on my back an engine roared and a car horn blared i hopped to one side madrigals rental van shot past me and slammed into the scarecrow it knocked the creature sprawling all the way across the parking lot to the edge of the street thomas leaned his head out the window and shouted get in i hurried to oblige him snatching up my staff on the way and mouse was hard on my heels we piled into the van where i found rawlins unconscious in the back i slammed the side door shut thomas threw up a cloud of gravel whirling the van around banged over the concrete median between the gravel lot and the street and shot off down the road a wailing whistling shriek of rage and frustration split the air behind us i checked out the window and found the scarecrow pursuing us when thomas reached an intersection and turned the scarecrow cut across the corner bounding over a phone booth with ease and slammed into the back quarter of the van the noise was horrible and the van wobbled tires screeching and slithering while thomas fought to control the slide the scarecrow shrieked and slammed the van again the wounded mouse added his battle roar to the din do something thomas shouted like what i screamed its immune to my fire another crunch blasted my ears rocked the van and sent me sprawling over rawlins were going to find traffic in a minute thomas called figure something out i looked frantically around the vans interior trying to think of something there was little enough there glaus briefcase an overnight bag containing presumably glaus shower kit and foot powder and two flats of expensive spring water in plastic bottles i could hear the scarecrows heavy footsteps outside the van now and a motion in the corner of my eye made me look up to see its blazing terrifying eyes gazing into the vans window left i howled at thomas the van rocked tires protesting the scarecrow drove its arm through the vans side window and its long fingers missed me by an inch do something i had to do something fire couldnt hurt the thing i could summon wind but it was large enough to resist anything but my largest gale and i didnt have the magical muscle to manage that exhausted as i was it would have to be something small something limited something clever i stared at the bottled water then thought of something and shouted get ready for a uturn i shouted what thomas yelled i picked up both flats of bottles and shoved them out the broken window they vanished and i checked out the rear window to see them tumbling along in our wake still held together by heavy plastic wrapping i took up my blasting rod pointed it at them and called up the smallest and most intense point of heat i knew how releasing it with a whispered fuego the rear window glass flashed a hole the size of a peanut suddenly appeared the glass dribbling down molten bottles exploded as their contents heated to boiling in under a second spattering that whole section of road with a thin and expensive layer of water now i hollered uturn thomas promptly did something that made the tires howl and almost threw me out the broken window i got an upclose look at the scarecrow as the van slewed into a bootlegger reverse it reached for me but its claws only raked down the vans quarter panel squealing as they ripped through the paint the scarecrow though swift and strong was also very tall and ungainly and we reversed directions more quickly than it could giving us a couple of seconds worth of a lead i gripped my blasting rod so hard that my knuckles turned white and struggled to work out an evocation on the fly im not much of an evocator thats the whole reason i used tools like my staff and blasting rod to help me control and focus my energy the very thought of spontaneously trying out a new evocation was enough to make sweat bead on my forehead and i tried to remind myself that it wasnt a new evocation it was just a very very very skewed application of an old one i leaned out the broken window blasting rod in hand watching behind us until the scarecrows steps carried it into the clump of empty plastic bottles in a shallow puddle then i gritted my teeth pointed my blasting rod at the sky and reached out for fire instead of drawing the power wholly from within myself i reached out into the environment around meinto the oppressive summer air the burning heat of the vans engine from mouse from rawlins from the blazing streetlights and from the water id spread in front of the scarecrow fuego i howled flame shot up into the chicago sky like a geyser and the explosion of sudden heat broke some windows in the nearest buildings the vans engine stuttered in protest and the temperature inside the van dropped dramatically lights flickered out on the street the abrupt temperature change destroying their fragile filaments as my spell sucked some of the heat out of everything within a hundred yards and the expensive puddle of water instantly froze into a sheet of glittering ice the scarecrows leading foot hit the ice and slid out from under its body its toolong limbs thrashed wildly and then the scarecrow went down awkward limbs flailing its speed and size now worked against it throwing it down the concrete like a tumbleweed until it smacked hard into a municipal bus stop shelter go go go i screamed thomas gunned the engine recovering its power and shot down the street he turned at the nearest corner and when he did the scarecrow had only begun to extricate its tangle of limbs from the impact thomas hardly slowed took a couple more turns and then found a ramp onto the freeway i watched behind us nothing followed i sagged down breathing hard and closed my eyes harry thomas demanded his voice worried are you all right i grunted even that much was an effort it took me a minute to manage to say just tired i recovered from that feat and added madrigal pushed me into that thing and bugged out thomas winced sorry i wasnt there sooner he said i grabbed rawlins i figured youd have told me to get him out anyway i would have i said he looked up at me in the rearview mirror his eyes pale and worried you sure youre all right were all alive thats what counts thomas said nothing more until we slid off the highway and he began to slow the van i busied myself checking rawlins the cop had kept going in the face of severe pain and even more severe weirdness damned heroic really but even heroes are human and human bodies have limits you cant exceed everything had finally caught up to rawlins his breathing was steady and his wounded foot had swollen up so badly that his own shoe held down the bleeding but i dont think a nuclear war could have woken him i ground my teeth at what i had to do next i set my deformed left hand on the floor of the van at the angle lasciel had shown me and let my weight fall suddenly onto it there was an ugly pop more pain and then the agony subsided somewhat it was a giddy feeling and my hand looked human again if bruised and swollen so i said after i had worked up the energy it was you following me around town i didnt want to be seen openly with you he said i figured the council might take it badly if they found out you had taken a white court vampire on a warden ridealong probably i said i take it you followed them from the parking garage no actually thomas said i tried but i lost them mouse didnt i followed him how the hell did they keep him away from you when they grabbed you they hit him with this van i said thomas raised his eyebrows and glanced back at mouse seriously he shook his head mouse led me to you i was trying to figure out how to get into that garage without getting us shot then you made your move you stole my coat i said borrowed he corrected they never talk about this kind of crap when they talk about brothers you werent wearing it he pointed out hell you think im going to walk into one of your patented harry dresden anarchygasms without all the protection i can get i grunted you looked good tonight i always look good he said you know what i mean i told him quietly better stronger faster like the six million dollar man thomas said stop joking thomas i told him in an even tone you used a lot of energy tonight youre feeding again he drove eyes guarded his face blank i chewed on my lip you want to talk about it he ignored me which i took as a no how long have you been active i was sure he was stonewalling when he said in a very quiet voice since last halloween i frowned when we took on those necromancers yeah he said theres look theres something i didnt tell you about that night i tilted my head watching his eyes in the rearview mirror remember i said murphys bike broke down i did i nodded it wasnt the bike thomas said he took a deep breath it was the wild hunt they came across me while i was trying to catch up with you sort of filled up the rest of my evening i arched my eyebrows you didnt have to lie about something like that man i mean everyone who wont join the hunt becomes its prey so its not your fault the hunt chased you around i scratched at my chin stubble i needed a shave hell man you should be damned proud i doubt that more than five or six people in history have ever escaped the hunt he was quiet for a minute and then said i didnt run from them harry my shoulders twitched with sudden tension i joined them he said thomas i began he looked up at the mirror i didnt want to die man and when push comes to shove im a predator a killer part of me wanted to go part of me had a good time i dont like that part of me much but its still there hells bells i said quietly i dont remember very much of it he said he shrugged i let you down that night let myself down that night so i figured this time id try to help you out once you told me you were on a job again youve got a car now too i said quietly yeah youre making money and feeding on people yeah i frowned i didnt know what to say to that thomas had tried to fit in he tried to get himself an honest job he tried it for most of two years but always ended badly because of who and what he was i had begun to wonder if there was anyplace in chicago that hadnt fired him but hed had this job whatever it was for a while now there anything i need to know i asked him he shook his head a tiny gesture his reticence worried me though hed been repeatedly humiliated thomas had never had any trouble talkingcomplaining reallyabout the various jobs hed tried to hold once or twice hed opened up to me about the difficulty of going without the kind of intense feeding hed been used to with justine yet now he was clamming up on me an uncharitable sort of person would have gotten suspicious they would have thought that thomas must have been engaging in something probably illegal and certainly immoral to make his living they would have dwelt on the idea that as a kind of incubus it would be a simple matter for him to seduce and control any wealthy woman he chose providing sustenance and finances in a single package good thing im not one of those uncharitable guys i sighed if he wasnt going to talk he wasnt going to talk time to change the subject glau i said quiedy madrigals sidekick there you said he was a jann thomas nodded scion of a djinn and a mortal he worked for madrigals father then my father arranged to have madrigals father go skydiving naked glau stuck with madrigal after that was he dangerous i asked thomas thought about it for a moment and then said he was thorough details never slipped by he could play a courtroom like some kind of maestro he was never finished with something until it was dissected labeled documented and locked away in storage somewhere but he wasnt a threat in a fight not as such things go he could kill you dead enough but not much better than any number of things funny then i said the scarecrow popped him first thomas glanced back at me arching a brow think about it i said this thing was supposed to be a phobophage right going after the biggest source of fear sure glau was barely conscious when it grabbed him i said it was probably me or madrigal who was feeling the most tension but it took out glau specifically you think someone sent it for glau i think its a reasonable conclusion thomas frowned why would anyone do that to shut him up i said i think madrigal was supposed to go down for these attacks at least in front of the supernatural communities maybe glau was in on it maybe glau arranged for madrigal to be here or maybe the scarecrow went after glau because he was wounded and separate from the rest of us it might have been a coincidence possible i allowed but my gut says it wasnt glau was their cutout man they killed him to cover their trail who do you think they is uhhhhhh i rubbed at my face hoping the stimulation might move some more blood around in my brain and knock loose some ideas not sure my head hurts im missing some details somewhere there should be enough for me to piece this together but damned if i can see it i shook my head and fell quiet where to thomas asked hospital i said well drop rawlins off then what then i pick up the trail of those phages and see if i can find out who summoned them i told him briefly about the events of the afternoon and evening if were lucky all well find is some maniacs corpse with a surprised look on his face what if we arent lucky he asked then it means the summoner is a hell of a lot better than i am to fight off three of those things i rubbed at one eye and well have to take him down before he hurts anyone else the fun never ends thomas said right hospital then circle the block around the hotel the spell i diverted the phages with had the tracking element worked into it sunrise will unravel it and we dont know how long it will take to follow the trail i directed thomas to the nearest hospital and he carried the unconscious rawlins through the emergency room doors he came back a minute later and told me theyre on the job lets go then otherwise someone will want to ask us questions about gunshot wounds thomas was way ahead of me and the van headed back to the hotel i got the spell ready it wasnt a difficult working under normal circumstances but i felt as wrung out as a dirty dishrag it took me three tries to get the spell up and running but i managed it then i climbed into the passenger seat where i could see evidence of the phages passing as a trail of curling pale green vapor in the air i gave thomas directions we followed the trail and it led us toward wrigley not a whole hell of a lot of industry was going on in my aching skull but after a few minutes something began to gnaw at me i looked blearily around and found that the neighborhood looked familiar we kept on the trail the neighborhood got more familiar the vapor grew brighter as we closed in we turned a last street corner my stomach twisted in a spasm of horrified nausea the green vapor trail led to a twostory white house a charming place somehow carrying off the look of suburbia despite being inside the third largest city in america green lawn despite the heat white picket fence childrens toys in evidence the vapor led up to the picket fence first there were three separate large holes in the fence where some enormous force had burst the fence to splinters heavy footprints gouged the lawn an imitation oldstyle wroughtiron gaslight had been bent to parallel with the ground about four feet up the door had been torn from its hinges and flung into the yard a minivan parked in the driveway had been crushed as if by a dropped wrecking ball i couldnt be sure but i thought i saw blood on the doorway the decorative mailbox three feet from me read in cheerfully painted letters the carpenters oh god oh god oh god id sent the phages after molly chapter thirty i got out of the van too shocked to see anything but the destruction it made no sense it made no sense at all how in the hell could this have happened how could my spell have turned the phages and sent them here i stood on the sidewalk outside the house with my mouth hanging open the streetlights were all out only the lights of the van showed the damage and thomas turned them off after only a moment there was no disturbance on the street no outcry no police presence whatever had happened something had taken steps to keep it from disturbing the neighbors i dont know how long i stood there i felt mouses presence at my side then thomass on the other side of me harry he said as if he was repeating himself what is this place its michaels house i whispered his familys home thomas flinched he looked back and forth and said those things came here i nodded i felt unsteady i felt so damned tired whatever happened here it was over there was nothing i could do at this point except see who had been hurt and i did not want to do that so i stood there staring at the house until thomas finally said ill keep watch out here circle the house see if theres anything to be seen okay i whispered i swallowed and my stomach felt like id swallowed a pound of thumbtacks i wanted nothing in the world so much as to run away but instead i dragged my tired ass over the damaged lawn and through the houses broken doorway mouse walking on three legs followed me there were sprinkles of blood already dried on the inside of the doorway i went on inside the house through the entry hall into the living room furniture lay strewn all over the place discarded and broken and tumbled the television lay on its side warbling static on its screen a low sound all white noise and faint interference filled the room there was utter silence in the house otherwise hello i called no one answered i went into the kitchen there were school papers on the fridge most of them written in exaggerated childish hands there were crayon drawings up there too one of a smiling stick figure in a dress had a wavering line of letters underneath that read i low ou mama oh god the thumbtacks in my belly became razor blades if id hurt them i didnt know what i would do harry thomas called from outside harry come here his voice was tense excited i went out the kitchen door to the backyard and found thomas climbing down from a tree house only a little nicer than my apartment built up in the branches of the old oak tree behind the carpenters house he had a still form draped over his shoulder i drew out my amulet and called wizard light as thomas laid the oldest son daniel out on the grass in the backyard he was breathing but looked pale he was wearing flannel pajama pants and a white tshirt soaked with blood there was a cut on his arm not too deep but very messy he had bruises on his face on one arm and the knuckles on both his hands were torn and ragged michaels son had been throwing punches it hadnt done him any good but hed fought coat i said terse hes cold thomas immediately took off my duster and draped it over the boy i propped his feet up on my backpack stay here i told him i went in the house fetched a glass of water and brought it out i knelt down and tried to wake the boy up to get him to drink a little he coughed a little then drank and blinked open his eyes he couldnt focus them daniel i said quietly daniel its harry dresden ddresden he said yeah your dads friend harry harry he said then his eyes flew open wide and he struggled to sit up molly easy easy i told him youre hurt we dont know how bad yet lie still cant he mumbled they took her we were is mom okay are the little ones okay i chewed on my lip i dont know do you know where they are he blinked several times and then he said panic room i frowned what ssecond floor safe room dad built it just in case i traded a look with thomas where is it daniel waved a vague hand mom had the little ones upstairs molly and me couldnt get to the stairs they were there we tried to lead them away who daniel they who the movie monsters reaper hammerhand he shuddered scarecrow i snarled a furious curse thomas stay with him mouse keep watch i stood up and stalked into the house crossed to the stairs and went up them the upstairs hallway had a bunch of bedrooms off it with the oldest childrens rooms being at the opposite end of the hall from the master bedroom the younger children being progressively closer to mom and dad i looked inside each room they were all empty though the two nearest the head of the stairs had been torn up pretty well broken toys and shattered childsized furniture lay everywhere if i hadnt been looking for it i wouldnt have noticed the extra space between the linen closet and the master bedroom i checked the closet in the master bedroom and turned up nothing then i opened the door to the linen closet and found the shelves in complete disarray sheets and towels and blankets strewn on the floor i hunkered down and held up my mothers amulet peering closely and then found a section of the back wall of the closet just slightly misaligned with the corner it met i reached out and touched that part of the wall closed my eyes extending my senses through my fingertips i felt power there it wasnt a ward or at least it was unlike any ward i had ever encountered it was more of a quiet hum of constant power and was similar to the power id felt stirring around michael on several occasionsthe power of faith there was a form of magic protecting that panel lasciel i murmured quietly you getting this she did not appear but her voice rolled through my thoughts yes my host angelic work i exhaled real angels aye rafael or one of his lieutenants from the feel of it dangerous there was an uncertain pause it is possible you are touched by more darkness than my own but it is meant to conceal the room beyond not to strike out at an intruder i took a deep breath and said okay then i reached out and rapped hard on the panel three times i thought i heard a motion weight shifting on a floorboard i knocked again charity i called its harry dresden this time the motion was definite the panel clicked then rolled smoothly to one side and a doublebarreled shotgun slid out aimed right at my chin i swallowed and looked down the barrel charitys cold blue eyes faced me from the other end of the gun you might not be the real dresden she said sure i am prove it she said her tone was quiet balanced deadly charity theres no time for this you want me to show you my drivers license bleed she said instead which was a good point most of the things who could play doppelganger did not have human plumbing or human blood it wasnt an infallible test by any means but it was as solid as anything a nonwizard could use for verification so i pulled out my pen knife and cut my already mangled left hand just a little i couldnt feel it in any case i bled red and showed her she stared at me for a long second and then eased the hammers on the shotgun back down set the weapon aside and wriggled out of the space beyond the panel i saw a candle lit back there the rest of the carpenter children sans molly were inside alicia was sitting up awake her eyes worried the rest were sacked out molly she said once shed gained her feet daniel i found him hiding in the tree house i said hes hurt she nodded once how badly bruised up pretty good groggy but i dont think hes in immediate danger mouse and a friend of mine are with him charity nodded again features calm and remote eyes cold and calculating she had a great coolheaded act going but it wasnt perfect her hands were trembling badly fingers clenching and unclenching arrhythmically and molly i havent found her yet i said quietly daniel might know what happened to her were they denarians she asked i shook my head definitely not is it possible that they may return i shrugged it isnt likely but possible yes she nodded once and her voice had the quality of someone thinking aloud then the next thing to do is to take the children to the church well make sure daniel is cared for ill try to send word to michael then well find molly charity i said wait charity thrust the heel of her hand firmly into my chest and pushed my shoulders back against the opposite wall her voice was quiet and very precise my children are vulnerable im taking them to safety help me or stand aside then she turned from me and began bringing her children out alicia helped as much as she could her studious features tired and worried but the littlest ones were sleepy to the point of hibernation and remained limp as dishrags i pitched in picking up little harry and hope carrying one on each hip charitys expression flashed briefly with both worry and thanks and i saw her control slip tears formed in her eyes she closed them again jaw clenched and when she looked up she had regained her composure thank you she said lets move i replied and we did tough lady very tough wed had our differences but i had to respect the proud core of her she was the kind of mother you read about in the paper the kind who lifts a car off of one of her kids it was entirely possible that id just killed her oldest daughter if charity knew that if she knew that id put her children in danger shed murder me if molly had been hurt because of me id help saint mary of the angels is more than just a church its a monument its huge its dome rising to seventeen stories and covered in every kind of accessory you could name including angelic statues spread over the roof and ledges you could get a lot of people arguing over exactly what its a monument to i suppose but one cannot see the church without being impressed by its size by its artistry by its beauty in a city of architectural mastery saint mary of the angels need bow its head to no one that said the back of the place the delivery doors looked quite modestly functional we went there charity driving her familys minivan thomas me and mouse in madrigals battered rental van mouse and i got out thomas didnt i frowned at him im going to find someplace to park this he said just in case madrigal decides to report it as stolen or something think hell make trouble for us i asked not facetoface thomas said his voice confident hes more jackal than wolf look on the bright side i said maybe the scarecrow turned around and got him thomas sighed keep dreaming hes a greasy little rat but he survives he looked up at the church and then said ill keep an eye on things from out here come on out when youre done i got it thomas didnt want to enter holy ground as a vampire of the white court he was as close to human as vampires got and as far as i knew holy objects had never inconvenienced him so this wasnt about supernatural allergies it was about his perceptions thomas didnt want to go into the church because he wasnt optimistic that the almighty and his institutions would smile on him like me he favored maintaining a low profile with regards to matters temporal and if he had gone back to older patterns doing what came naturally to his predators nature it might incline him to stay off the theological radar worse entering such a place as the church might force him to face his choices to question them to be confronted with the fact that the road hed chosen kept getting darker and further from the light i knew how he felt i hadnt been in a church since id smacked my hand down on lasciels ancient silver coin hell i had a freaking fallen angel in my heador at least a facsimile of one if that wasnt a squirt of lemon juice in gods eye i didnt know what was but i had a job to do be careful i told him quietly call murphy tell her whats up youd better get some rest soon harry he replied you dont look good i never look good i said i offered him my fist he rapped my knuckles gently with his own i nodded and walked over to knock on the delivery doors while he drove off in madrigals van id taken my duster back once daniel had a blanket on him screw the heat i wanted the protection its familiar weight on my shoulders and motion against my legs were reassuring forthill answered my knock fully dressed the white of his clerical collar easily seen in the night his bright blue eyes looked around the parking lot once and he hurried toward the van without a word being exchanged i followed him forthill moved briskly and we unloaded the van alicia shepherding the mobile kids indoors while he and charity carried daniel in between them i followed with the two little wet dishrags trying to keep my tired muscles from shaking too obviously forthill led us to the storage room that sometimes doubled as refugee housing there were half a dozen folded cots against one wall and another one already opened set out and occupied by a lump under a blanket forthill and charity got the wounded daniel onto a cot first and then opened the rest of them we deposited tired children on them what happened forthill asked his voice quiet and calm i didnt want to hear charity talk about it got a cramp i told them need to walk it off come find me when daniel gets coherent very well charity said forthill looked back and forth between us frowning mouse rose with a grunt of effort to limp after me no boy stay and keep an eye on the kids mouse settled down again almost gratefully i beat it and started walking it didnt matter where there were too many things flying around in my head i just walked motion wasnt a cure but i was tired enough that it kept the thoughts the emotions from drowning me i walked down hallways and through empty rooms i wound up in the chapel proper ive been in smaller stadiums gleaming hardwood floors shine over the whole of the chapel wooden pews stand in ranks row upon row upon row and the altar and nave are gorgeously decorated it seats more than a thousand people including the balcony at the rear of the chapel and every sunday they still have to run eight masses in four different languages to fit everyone in more than size and artistry though there is something else about the place that makes it more than simply a building theres a sense of quiet power there deep and warm and reassuring theres peace i stood for a moment in the vast and empty room and closed my eyes right then i needed all the peace i could get i drifted through the room idly admiring it and wound up in the balcony all the way at the top in a dark corner i leaned my head back against a wall lasciels voice came to me very quietly and sounded odd sad it is beautiful here i didnt bother to agree i didnt tell her to get lost i leaned my head back against the rear wall and closed my eyes i woke up when forthills steps drew near i kept my eyes closed half hoping that if i didnt seem to waken he would go away instead he settled a couple of feet down the pew from me and remained patiently quiet the act wasnt working i opened my eyes and looked at him what happened he asked quietly i pressed my lips together and looked away its all right forthill said quietly if you wish to tell me ill speak of it to no one maybe i dont want to talk to you i said of course he said nodding but my offer stands should you wish to talk sometimes the only way to carry a heavy burden is to share it with another it is your choice to make choices sometimes i thought it might be nice not to make any choices if i never had one i could never screw it up there are things i dont care to share with a priest i told him but i was mostly thinking out loud he nodded he took off his collar and set it aside he settled back into the pew reached into his jacket and drew out a slender silver flask he opened it took a sip and offered it to me then share it with your bartender that drew a faint snorting laugh from me i shook my head took the flask and sipped an excellent smooth scotch i sipped again and i told him what happened at the convention and how it had spilled over onto the carpenter household he listened we passed the flask back and forth i finished by saying i sent those things right to her door i never meant it to happen of course not he said it doesnt make me feel any better about it nor should it he said but you must know that you are a man of power how so power he said waving a hand in an allencompassing gesture all power is the same magic physical strength economic strength political strength it all serves a single purposeit gives its possessor a broader spectrum of choices it creates alternative courses of action i guess i said so so he said you have more choices which means that you have much improved odds of making mistakes youre only human once in a while youre going to screw the pooch i dont mind that i said when im the only one who pays for it but that isnt in your control he said you cannot see all outcomes you couldnt have known that those creatures would go to the carpenter house i ground my teeth so daniels still hurt molly could be dead but their condition was not yours to ordain forthill said all power has its limits then whats the point i snarled suddenly furious my voice bounced around the chapel in rasping echoes what good is it to have power enough to kill my friends family but not power enough to protect them what the hell do you expect from me ive got to make these stupid choices what the hell am i supposed to do with them sometimes he replied his tone serious you just have to have faith i laughed and it came out loud and bitter mocking echoes of it drifted through the vast chamber faith i said faith in what that things will unfold as they are meant to forthill said that even in the face of an immediate ugliness the greater picture will resolve into something all the more beautiful show me i spat show me something beautiful about this show me the silver fucking lining he pursed his lips and mused for a moment then he said theres a quote from the founder of my order there is something holy something divine hidden in the most ordinary situations and it is up to each one of you to discover it whats that supposed to mean i asked that the good that will come is not always obvious nor easy to see nor in the place we would expect to find it nor what we personally desire you should consider that the good being created by the events this night may have nothing to do with the defeat of supernatural evils or endangered lives it may be something very quiet very ordinary i frowned at him like what he finished off the little flask and then rose he put it away and put his collar back on im afraid im not the one you should ask he put a hand on my shoulder and nodded toward the altar but i will say this ive been on this earth a fair while and one way or another this too shall pass i have seen worse things reverse themselves there is yet hope for molly harry we must strive to do our utmost and to act with wisdom and compassion but we must also have faith that the things beyond our control are not beyond his i sat quietly for a minute then i said you almost make me believe he arched an eyebrow but i dont know if i can do that i dont know if its possible for me the corners of his eyes wrinkled then perhaps you should try to have faith that you might one day have faith his fingers squeezed and then released my shoulder he turned to go padre i said he paused you wont tell charity he turned his head and i could see sadness in his profile no you arent the only one too afraid to believe sudden footsteps clattered into the chapel and alicia hurried in accompanied by mouse the big grey dog sat down and stared up at the balcony alicia panting looked up father here forthill said come quick she said mama said to tell you daniels awake chapter thirtyone we listened to daniels recounting of the attack it was simple enough hed heard molly moving around downstairs and had come down to talk to his sister there had been a knock at the door molly had gone to answer it there had been an exchange of words and then molly had screamed and slammed the door she came running into the living room daniel said and they broke down the door behind her and came in he shivered they were going upstairs and molly said we had to distract them so i grabbed the poker from the fireplace and just sort of jumped them he shook his head i thought they were just costumes you know like really stupid burglars or something but the reaper grabbed me and he was going to you know cut me with that curved knife he gestured vaguely at his wounded arm molly hit him and he dropped me with what i asked him he shook his head his thin awkward adolescent features were hollow with pain weariness and a kind of lingering disbelief his words were all slightly stiff wooden as if reporting events in an unappealing motion picture rather than actual experiences i couldnt see i think she must have had a bat or something he dropped me then what i asked him he swallowed i fell and bumped my head on the floor and they grabbed her the reaper and the scarecrow and they carried her out the door she was screaming he bit his lip i tried to stop them but hammerhand chased me so i ran out the back and up into the tree house cause i figured you know he doesnt have any hands just hammers so hows he going to climb up after me he looked to charity and said shame in his voice im sorry mom i wanted to stop them they were just too big tears welled up in his eyes and his thin chest heaved charity caught him in a fierce hug squeezing him hard and whispering to him daniel broke down sobbing i got up and walked to the far side of the room forthill joined me there these creatures i told him quietly inflict more than simple physical damage they rip into the psyches of those they attack this happened to daniel forthill asked id have to take a closer look to be certain but its probable kids gonna have it tough for a while i said its like emotional trauma someone dying that kind of thing it tears people up the same way they dont get over it fast ive seen it too forthill said i havent brought this up yet but i thought you should know that nelson came to me earlier this evening i nodded at the cot that had been occupied when we came in that him yes howd he strike you i asked forthill pursed his lips if i didnt know you sent him i would have thought he was having a bad reaction to drugs he was almost incoherent very agitated terrified in point of fact though he would not or could not explain why i managed to get him calmed down and he all but fainted i frowned running the fingers of my right hand back through my hair did you have the sense that anyone was following him not at all though i might have missed something he essayed a tired smile its late and im not as spry as i used to be after ten oclock or so thank you for helping him i said of coursewho is he mollys boyfriend i said i glanced across the room at the mother holding her son maybe charity doesnt need to know that part either he blinked and then sighed oh dear heh yeah i said may i ask you a question he asked sure these creatures these phages if they are what you say beings of the spirit world then how did they manage to cross the houses threshold traditional way i said they got an invitation from whom probably molly i said he frowned i have difficulty believing that she would do such a thing i felt my mouth tighten she probably didnt know they were monsters theyre shapeshifters they probably appeared to her as someone she knew and would invite in forthill said ah i see someone such as you perhaps perhaps i said quietly makes it the second time someone has used my face to get a shot at michaels family forthill said nothing for a moment then he said it occurs to me that these creatures killed without compunction in your previous encounters why would they carry molly away instead of simply murdering her i dont know yet i said i dont know how my spell managed to bring them to molly i dont know precisely what these things are or where they hail from which means i cant figure out why theyve been showing up or where they might have taken the girl i waved a hand in a frustrated gesture its driving me insane ive got tons of facts and none of them are lining up youre tired forthill said perhaps some rest i shook my head no padre the things that took her wont rest the longer shes in their hands the less likely it is well ever see her again i rubbed at my eyes i need to rethink it forthill nodded at me and rose on the other side of the room charity was covering her exhausted son with a blanket even alicia had surrendered to fatigue and now only the adults were awake ill leave you to it then have you eaten recently sometime in the mesozoic era i said sandwich my stomach made a gurgling noise only if you insist ill see to it forthill said excuse me he went over to charity and took her arm leading her out as he spoke quietly to her now that her children had been cared for she looked like she might come apart at the seams they left the room together leaving me in the dimness with mouse and a lot of sleeping kids i thought i thought some more i picked up all the facts i knew turning them every which way trying to figure out something anything that would let me put a stop to this insanity the phages the answer was in the phages once i knew their identity i could begin to work out who might be using them and what i might do to learn more about them there had to be a commonality to them somewhere something that linked them together some fact that could provide me a context in which to judge their motivations and intentions but what the hell could they have in common other than being monsters who fed on fear theyd shown up randomly in a bathroom a kitchen a parking lot a conference room their victims had been disparate seemingly random they had all appeared as figures from horror movies but that fact seemed fairly unremarkable relatively speaking try as i might i could find nothing to join them together to let me recognize them frustrated i rose and went over to daniels cot i called up my sight it took me longer than normal i braced myself and regarded the boy id been right hed taken a psychic flogging the phage had been worrying at his mind his spirit even as it had threatened his flesh i could see the wounds as long bleeding tears in his flesh poor little guy it would haunt him i hoped he would be able to get a little rest before the nightmares woke him up i stared at him for a good while making sure his suffering was burned indelibly into my head i wanted to remember for the rest of my life what the consequences of my screwups might be i heard a sound to the side and glanced up without thinking turning my sight upon the source of the sounda restlessly stirring nelson if little daniel had been the recipient of a savage beating nelsons spirit had been in the hands of hell itself his entire upper body was disfigured under my sight covered in hideous festering boils and raw bleeding burns the damage was worst around his head and faded gradually as it descended his torso and each of his temples bore tiny neat holes sharp and cauterized as if by a laser scalpel just like rosie chains of logic cascaded through my brain my head swam i shoved the sight away from me and my ass fell straight down to the floor i knew i knew why my spell had sent the phages after the carpenters i knew why molly had been taken i could make a good guess at where i knew what the phages all had in common i knew who had sent them the realization terrified me with a fear so cold and sharp that it literally paralyzed me i could barely clap my hand over my mouth to keep from making whimpering sounds it took me a while to force myself to calm down by the time i did forthill had returned bearing sandwiches he settled down on a cot clearly exhausted and went to sleep i ate my sandwiches then i went looking for charity i found her in the chapel sitting up high in the balcony she stared down at the altar and did not react when i came up the steps to her and settled down on the bench beside her i sat with her in silence for a minute charity i whispered i need to ask you something she sat in stony silence her chin moved a fraction of a degree up and down how long i murmured how long since what she asked i took a deep breath how long has it been since youve used your magic chapter thirtytwo i couldnt have gotten more of a reaction if id shot her charitys face turned sheet white the blood draining from it she froze in place grasping the edge of the wooden pew in front of her with both hands her knuckles turned white and the wood creaked she gnashed her teeth and bowed her head i didnt push i waited she opened her eyes again and she wasnt hard to read her thoughts and emotions were clear on her face panic desperation selfloathing her eyes flicked from one possibility to another she considered denying it she considered lying to me she considered simply walking away charity i told her tell me the truth her breathing quickened i saw her desperation growing i reached out with one hand and turned her face toward me your daughter needs you if we dont help her shes going to die charity flinched and pulled away from me her shoulders shook with a silent sob she fought to control her breathing her voice and whispered a lifetime i felt some tension ease in me her reaction confirmed that i was on the right track how did you know she asked just putting lots of little things together i said please charity tell me her voice was rough half strangled as though the breath that carried her words had been tainted with something rotten i had some talent it showed just before my sixteenth birthday you know how awkward that kind of thing can be yeah i said howd your family take it her mouth twisted my parents were wealthy respectable when they had time to notice me they expected me to be normal respectable they found it easier to believe that i was a drug addict emotionally unbalanced i winced there were a lot of situations that could meet someone with a burgeoning magical talent charitys was one of the worst they sent me away to schools she said and to hospitals disguised as schools she waved a hand i eventually left them just left them i struck out on my own and fell in with a bad crowd i said quietly she gave me a bitter smile youve heard this story before it isnt uncommon i said quietly who was it a coven of sorts i suppose she said more of a cult there was a young man leading it gregor he had power he and the others all young people mixed in religion and mysticism and philosophy and well youve probably seen such things before i nodded i had a charismatic leader dedicated followers a collection of strays and homeless runaways it rarely developed into something positive i wasnt strongly gifted she said not like you but i learned about some of what happens out there about the white council the bitter smile returned everyone was terrified of them a warden visited us once he delivered a warning to gregor hed been toying about with some kind of summoning spells and the wardens got wind of it they interviewed each of us evaluated us told us the laws of magic and told us never to break them if we wished to live i nodded and listened she spoke more quickly now the words coming out in a growing rush they had been pent up a long time gregor resented it he grew distant he began practicing magic that walked the crumbling edges of the councils laws he had us all doing it her eyes grew cold the others began disappearing one by one no one knew where they had gone but i saw what was happening i saw gregor growing in power he was trading them i said she nodded once he saw my face when i realized it i was the next one to go he came to take me away and i fought him tried to kill him wanted to kill him but he beat me i remember only parts of it being chained to an iron post the dragon i said she nodded some of the bitterness faded from her smile and michael came and he destroyed the monster and saved me she looked up at me tears filled her eyes and streaked down her cheeks but she did not blink i swore to myself that i would leave that behind me the magic the power i had urges she swallowed to do things only only a monster would do when siriothrax died gregor went mad utterly mad but i wanted to turn my power against him anyway i couldnt think of anything else hard to do i said quietly you were a kid no real training exposed to some nasty uses of power yes she said without michael i would never have been able to leave it behind me he never knew he still doesnt know he remained near me in my life making sure that i was all right and he was such a good soul when he smiled at me it was like all the light in the world was shining out at me i wanted to be worthy of that smile my husband saved my life mister dresden and not only from the dragon he saved me from myself she shook her head i never touched my power again after the night i met michael we married soon after and in time the power withered and good riddance to it so when mollys talent began to manifest i said quietly you tried to get her to abandon it as well i was well aware of how dangerous it could be she said how innocent it could seem she shook her head i did not want her exposed to the things that had nearly destroyed my life but she did it anyway i guessed thats what really came between the two of you thats why she ran away from home charitys voice turned raw yes i couldnt get through to her how dangerous it was what she might be sacrificing she made no effort to stem or hide her tears and you were there a hero who fought beside her father used his power to help people she let out a tired laugh for the love of god you saved my life we named our child for you once she realized she had the talent nothing could keep her from it christ no wonder charity hadnt much liked me not only was i dragging her husband off to who knew where to fight who knew what i was also setting an example to molly of everything charity wanted her to avoid i didnt know i told her she shook her head then she said i have been honest with you no one else knows what you do now not michael not my daughter no one she drew a kleenex from her pocket and wiped at her eyes what has happened to my daughter i exhaled what ive got right now is still mostly guesswork i said but my gut tells me it all fits together i understand she said i nodded and told charity about the attacks at the convention and about how molly had gotten me involved i examined the victims of the first two attacks i said quietly one of them a girl named rosie showed evidence of a land of psychic trauma at the time i attributed it to the phages attack on her charity frowned it wasnt i shook my head i found an identical trauma on nelson i took a deep breath and said molly is the link between them theyre both her friends i think she was the one who hurt them i think she used magic to invade their minds charity stared at me her expression sickened what no she shook her head no molly wouldnt her face grew even more pale oh god shes broken one of the councils laws she shook her head more violently no no no she would not do such a thing i grimaced and said i think i know what she did and why she did it tell me i took a deep breath rosie is pregnant and she showed physical evidence of drug addiction but none of the psychological evidence of withdrawal i think molly took steps when she found out her friend was pregnantto force her away from the drugs i think she did it to protect the baby and then i think she did the same thing to nelson but something went wrong i think what she did to him broke something i shook my head he got paranoid erratic charity stared down at the altar below shaking her head is it the council then that took her no i said no what she did to rosie and nelson left a kind of mark on her a stain i think she forced rosie and nelson to feel fear whenever they came near their drugs fear is a powerful motivator and its easy to exploit she wanted them to be afraid of the drugs she had good intentions but she wanted her friends to be frightened i dont understand whoever called up these phages i said needed a way to guide them from the nevernever to the physical world they needed a beacon someone who would resonate with a sympathetic vibe someone who like the phages wanted to make people feel fear and they used my molly charity whispered then she stared at me for a moment you did it she said quietly you tried to turn the phages back upon their summoner you sent them after my daughter i didnt know i told her my god charity i swear to you that i didnt know people were dead and i didnt want anyone else to be hurt the wooden pew creaked even more sharply in her grip who did this thing she said and her voice was deadly quiet who is responsible for the harm to my children who is the one who called the things that invaded my home i dont think anyone called them i told her quietly i think they were sent she looked up at me and her eyes narrowed sent i nodded i hadnt considered that possibility until i realized what all of the attacks had in common mirrors mirrors charity asked i dont understand that was the common element i said mirrors the bathroom rosies makeup mirror in the conference room plenty of reflective steel surfaces in a commercial kitchen and madrigals rental vans windshield was reflecting images very clearly she shook her head i still dont understand there are plenty of things that can use mirrors as windows or doorways from the spirit world i said but theres only one thing that feeds on fear and uses mirrors as pathways back and forth from the nevernever its called a fetch fetch charity tilted her head her eyes vague as though searching through old memories ive heard of them theyre arent they creatures of faerie yeah i said quietly specifically theyre creatures of deepest darkest winter i swallowed even more specifically theyre queen mabs elite spies and assassins shapeshifters with a lot of power mab she whispered the mab i nodded slowly and theyve taken my daughter she said carried her away to faerie i nodded again shell be a rich resource for them a magically talented young mortal compatible energy not enough experience to defend herself they can feed on her and her magic for hours maybe days thats why they didnt just kill her and have done charity swallowed what can we do im not sure i said it would be nice to have your husband along though she bit her lip and sent what might have been a hateful look down at the altar hes out of reach messages have been left but were on our own i said we must do something she said yeah i agreed the problem is that we dont know where to do it i thought you just said that they had taken her back to faerie yeah i said but just because i tell you ayers rock is in australia doesnt mean youre going to be able to find the damned thing australias big and faerie makes it look like rhode island charity clenched her jaw there must be something im working on it i said what will she paused and cleared her throat how long does she have hard to say i told her time can go by at different rates between here and there a day here but an hour there or vice versa she stared steadily at me i looked away and said not long it depends on how long she holds out theyll get all the fear out of her that they can and then i shook my head a day at most she shook her head no she said quietly i will not let that happen there must be a way to take her back i can get to faerie i said but youve got to understand something were talking about opening a path into deep winter if im strong enough to open the way and if im strong enough to hold it open while simultaneously running a rescue operation against at least one ancient fetch who ate my magic like candy earlier tonight were still talking about defying the will of queen mab if shes there theres not a damned thing i can do i dont have enough power to challenge her in the heart of her domain the whole damned white council doesnt have enough power on top of that id have to know precisely where to cross over into faerie because id have only minutes to grab her and get out and i have no idea where she is what are you saying she asked quietly that i cant do it i told her its suicide charitys back stiffened so youre willing to leave her there no i said but it means that im going to have to find help wherever i can get it maybe from people and things that you wont much like i shook my head and its possible ill get myself killed before i can even make the attempt and even if i get her out there could be a price ill pay it she said her voice was flat strong certain for molly ill pay it i nodded i didnt say the next thought out loudthat even if we did get the girl back there might not be much left of her mind and shed broken one of the laws of magic she could wind up on the floor of some lonely warehouse a black bag over her head until morgans sword took it off her shoulders or maybe worse she could already have been twisted by the power shed used even if i could find molly and bring her home it might already be too late to save her but i could burn that bridge when i came to it first i had to find her the only way to do that was to learn where the fetches had carried her through to the nevernever geography in the nevernever isnt like geography in the normal world the nevernever touches our world only at certain points of sympathetic energy the portion of the nevernever that touched an empty and abandoned warehouse might not be anywhere near the area of the spirit world that touched the full and busy childcare center across the physical street from the warehouse to make it worse the connections between the mortal world and the nevernever changed slowly over time as the world changed there could be a thousand places in chicago where the fetches might have dragged molly back to their lair i had to find the correct one and i had to do it before dawn before the rising sun scattered and dispersed the residual traces of her presence that would be my only trail i had about two hours tops to get my aching body back to my apartment to bathe and prepare for a spell that would have been dangerous had i been rested and entirely whole tired hurting pressured and worried as i was i would probably kill myself on little chicagos trial run but my only other option was walk away and leave the girl in the hands of creatures that made nightmares afraid of the dark ill need something of hers i said rising hair or fingernail clippings would be best charity said i have a lock of her hair in her baby book perfect i said ill pick it up from your place wheres the book she rose ill show you i hesitated i dont know if thats wise chapter thirtythree this is thomas i told charity waving a hand at my brother who had fallen into step beside me as i left the church hes more dangerous than he looks i have a black belt thomas explained charity arched an eyebrow looked at thomas for about a second and said youre the white court vampire who took my husband to that strip bar thomas gave charity a toothy smile and said hey its nice to be remembered and to work with someone who has a clue he hooked a thumb at me and added sotto voce for a change charitys regard didnt change it wasnt icy nor friendly nor touched by emotion it was simply a remote steady gaze the kind one reserves for large dogs who pass nearby cautious observation unexcited and deliberate i appreciate that you have fought beside my husband before but i also want you to understand that what you are gives me reason to regard you with suspicion please do nothing to deepen that sentiment i do not remain passive to threats thomas pursed his lips i half expected anger to touch his gaze but it didnt he simply nodded and said understood maam good she said and we reached her van you ride in the rearmost seat i started to protest but thomas put his hand on my shoulder and shook his head her ride her rules he murmured to me in passing i can respect that so can you so we all got in and headed for the carpenters house hows mouse thomas asked legs hurt i said took one hell of a shot to do it he noted thats why i left him back there i said could be hes pushing his luck besides he can help forthill keep an eye on the kids uhhuh thomas said am i the only one who is starting to think that maybe mouse is something special always thought that i said i wonder if hes an actual breed charity glanced over her shoulder and said he looks something like a caucasian impossible i said he has rhythm and he can dance charity shook her head and said its a dog bred by the soviet union in the caucasus mountains for use in secured military installations its one of the only breeds that grows so large but they tend to be a great deal more aggressive than your dog oh hes aggressive enough for anybody when he needs to be i said thomas engaged charity in a polite conversation about dogs and breeds and i leaned my head against the window and promptly fell asleep i woke up briefly when the van stopped charity and thomas spoke and i dozed as they loaded some things into the van i didnt wake up again until thomas touched my shoulder and said were at your apartment harry yeah i mumbled okay i blinked a couple of times and hopped out of the van thomas i said get in touch with murphy for me and tell her i need her at my place now and here i fumbled in my dusters pockets and found a white napkin and a marker i wrote another number call this number tell them that im calling in my personal marker thomas took the paper and arched a brow cant you be any more specific i dont have to be i said theyll know why i want them this will just tell them that its time for them to get together with me why me thomas asked because i dont have time i said so unless you want to play with dangerous magic divinations call the damned number and stop making me waste energy explaining myself heil harry thomas said his tone a bit sullen but i knew hed do it hair i asked charity she passed me an unmarked white envelope her expression a mask thank you i took it and headed for my apartment the two of them following after me ill be working downstairs the two of you should stay in the living room please be as quiet as you can and dont walk around too much why charity asked i shook my head tiredly and waved a hand no no questions right now ill need everything ive got to find where they took molly and im already rushing this thing let me concentrate ill explain it later if i survive it i thought i felt charitys eyes on me and i glanced back at her she gave her head a brief stiff nod i took down the wards and we went inside mister came over and rammed his shoulder against my legs then wound his way around between thomass legs accepting a few token pats from my half brother then he surprised me by giving charity the same treatment i shook my head cats no accounting for taste charity looked around my apartment frowning and said its very well kept up i had expected more debris he cheats thomas said and headed for the refrigerator i ignored them there wasnt time for the full ritual cleansing and meditation but my day had exposed me to all kinds of stains external and otherwise and i considered the shower to be the most indispensable portion of the preparation so i went into my room stripped lit a candle and got into the shower cool water sluiced over me i scrubbed my skin until it was pink and washed my hair until it got sore the whole while i sought out a quiet place in my mind somewhere sheltered from pain and guilt from fear and anger i pushed out every sensation but for the bathing and without conscious effort my motions took on the steady rhythm of ritual something commonplace transformed into an act of art and meditation like a japanese tea ceremony i longed for my bed i longed for sleep warmth laughter i pinned down those longings one at a time and crucified them suspending them until such time as my world was a place that could afford such desires one last emotion was too big for me though try though i might i could not keep fear from finding a way to slither into my thoughts little chicagos maiden run was an enormous unknown quantity if id done it all right i would have myself one hell of a tool for keeping track of things in my town if id made even a tiny mistake molly was dead or worse than dead and id get to find out what the light at the end of the long tunnel really was i couldnt escape the fear it was built in to the situation so instead i tried to make my peace with it fear properly handled could be turned into something useful so i made a small neat place for its use in my head a kind of psychic litter box and hoped that the fear wouldnt start jumping around at the worst possible moment i got out of the shower dried and slipped into my white robe again i kept my thoughts focused picked up my backpack and the white envelope and went down to the basement lab i shut the door behind me if little chicago went nova preventative spells id laid to keep energies from escaping the lab should mitigate the damage significantly it wasnt a perfect plan by any means but im only human which was a disturbing thought as i stared at the model on the table even a tiny mistake only human i set the envelope at the edge of the table my backpack on a shelf and went around the basement lighting candles with a match a spell would have been faster and neater but i wanted to save every drop of power for managing the divination so i made lighting each candle a ritual of its own focusing on my movements on precision on nothing but the immediate interplay of heat and cold light and darkness fire and shadow i lit the last candle and turned to the model city the buildings shone silver in the candlelight and the air quivered with the power id built into the model some tiny voice of common sense in my head told me that this was a horribly bad idea it told me that i was making decisions because i was in pain and exhausted and that it would be far wiser to get some sleep and attempt the spell when i stood a reasonable chance of pulling it off i crucified that little voice too there was no room for doubts then i turned to the table and to the elongated circle of silver id built into its surface lasciel appeared between me and the table in her usual white tunic her red hair pulled back into a tight braid she held up both hands and said quietly i cannot permit you to do this you i said in a quiet distant voice are almost as annoying as a sudden phone call this is pointless she said my host i beg you to reconsider i dont have time for you i said i have a job to do a job she asked evading your responsibilities you mean i tilted my head slightly in my current mental state the emotions i felt seemed infinitely far away and all but inconsequential how so look at yourself she replied her voice that low quiet reasonable tone one uses around madmen and ugly drunks listen to yourself youre tired youre injured youre wracked by guilt youre frightened you will destroy yourself and you with me i asked her correct she said i do not fear the end of my existence my host but i would not be extinguished by one too selfdeluded to understand what he was about im not deluded i said but you are you know that this effort shall probably kill you and once it has done so you will be free from any onus of what happened to the girl after all you heroically died in the effort to find her and retrieve her you wont have to attend her funeral you wont have to explain yourself to michael you wont have to tell her parents that their daughter is dead because of your incompetence i did not reply the emotions grew a little closer this isnt anything more than an elaborate form of suicide chosen during a moment of weakness lasciel said i do not wish to see you destroy yourself my host i stared at her i thought about it she might be right it didnt matter move i murmured before i move you then i paused and said wait a minute what am i thinking it isnt as though you can stop me then i simply stepped through lasciels image to the table and reached for the white envelope the white envelope began to spin in place on the table and abruptly became dozens of envelopes each identical each whirling like a pinwheel but i can lasciel said quietly i looked up to find her standing on the opposite side of the table from me i witnessed the birth of time itself i watched the mortal coil spring forth from perfect darkness i watched the stars form watched this world coalesce watched as life was breathed into it and as your kind rose to rule it she put both hands on the table and leaned toward me her blue eyes cold and hard thus far i have behaved as a guest ought but do not mistake propriety for weakness mortal i beg you not to oblige me to take further action i narrowed my eyes and reached for my sight before i could use it my left hand exploded into flame pain pain pain fire scorching parboiling my hand as i tried to hold it back with my shield bracelet the memory of my injury in that vampirehaunted basement came rushing back to me in thx and my nerve endings were listening i fought down a scream breathing my teeth snapping together so suddenly and sharply that a fleck of one of my molars chipped away it was an illusion i told myself a memory its a ghost nothing more it cannot harm you if you do not allow it to do so i pushed hard against that memory turning the focus of my will against it i felt the illusionmemory wobble and then the pain was gone the fire out my body pumped endorphins into my bloodstream a heartbeat later and i drifted on them as my focus started to collapse i leaned hard against the table my left hand held close to my chest in pure reflex my right supporting my weight i turned my attention to the envelopes and forced my will against them until the illusions grew translucent i picked up the real envelope lasciel regarded me steadily her beautiful face unyielding determined sooner or later ill push through anything you throw i panted you know that yes she said but you will not be able to focus on the divination until you are quit of me i may force you to exhaust yourself resisting me in which case you will not attempt the divination even if i only delay you until dawn there will be no need for you to attempt it she lifted her chin whatever happens the divination will not be successful i let out a low chuckle which made lasciel frown at me you missed it i said missed what the loophole i can kill myself trying it while you rock the boat and after all this entire exercise is nothing more than a suicide attempt in any case why not go through with it her jaw clenched you would murder yourself rather than yield to reason more manslaughter than murder id say youre mad the fallen angel said get me some alkaseltzer and ill foam at the mouth too this time i hit lasciel with the hard look theres a child out there who needs me id rather die than let her down im doing the spell period so fuck off she shook her head in frustration and looked away frowning you are quite likely to die broken record much i asked i got out the lock of babyfine hair set my knife down on the table and lit the ceremonial candles there the fallen angel was correct dammit the fear stirred dangerously inside me and my fingers shook hard enough to break the first kitchen match instead of kindling it to life if you must do this lasciel said at least attempt to survive it let me help you you can help me by shutting the hell up and going away i told her hellfire isnt going to be any use to me here perhaps not lasciel said but there is another way there was a shimmer of light in the corner of my eye and i turned to see a slowly pulsing silver glow upon the floor in the middle of my summoning circle two feet beneath it lay the blackened denarius where the rest of lasciel was imprisoned take up the coin she urged me i can at least protect you from a backlash i beg you not to throw your life away i bit my lip i didnt want to die dammit and the thought of failing to save molly was almost worse than death the holder of one of the thirty ancient silver coins had access to tremendous power with that kind of boost i could probably pull the spell off and even if it went south i could survive it under lasciels protection somehow i knew that if i chose to do it i could get the coin out from under the concrete in only a moment too i stared at the silver glow for a moment then i rolled my eyes and said are you still here lasciels face smoothed into an emotionless mask but there was a subtle ugly tone of threat in her voice you are much easier to talk to when you are asleep my host and she was gone fear rattled around inside me i tried to calm it but i couldnt regain my earlier detachmentnot until i thought of young daniel mangled beneath my wizard sight wounded defending his family from something i had sent after them i thought of mollys brothers and sisters i thought of her mother her father i thought of the laughter the sheer joyous rowdy life of michaels family then i pinked my fingertip with my ritual knife touched the lock of baby hair to it and laid it down within little chicago i used a second drop of blood and an effort of will to touch the circle on the tabletop closing it up and beginning the spell i closed my eyes focusing murmuring a stream of faux latin as i reached out to the model and brought it to life my senses blurred and suddenly i was standing on the tabletop at the model of my own boardinghouse i thought the silvercolored model had grown to life size at first then realized that the inverse was more accurate i had shrunk to scale with little chicago my awareness now within the spell rather than in my own body which stood over the table like godzilla murmuring the words of the spell i closed my eyes and thought of molly my blood touched upon her lock of hair and to my utter surprise i shot off down the street with no more effort than it took to peddle a bicycle the streets beneath me and the buildings around me glowed with white energy the whole of the place humming like highpower tension lines stars and stones little chicago worked it worked well a surge of jubilation went through me and my speed increased in proportion i flashed through the streets seeing faint images of people like ghosts the unsteady reflections of those now moving through the real chicago around me but then the spell wavered and i found myself moving in a circle like a baffled hound trying to pick up a scent trail it didnt work i made an effort and stood back in my own body staring down at little chicago badly fatigued exhausted i reached for my backpack sat down and fumbled bob into my lap his eyes lit up at once and he said dont get me wrong big guy i like you but not that way shut up i growled at him just tried to use little chicago to find mollys trail it fizzled bob blinked it worked the model actually worked it didnt explode obviously i said it worked fine but i used a simple tracking spell and it couldnt pick up her trail so whats wrong with the damned thing put me on the table bob said i reached up and did so he was quiet for a minute before he said its fine harry i mean its working just fine like hell i growled ive done that tracking spell hundreds of times it must be the model im telling you its perfect bob said im looking at the darn thing if it wasnt your spell and it wasnt the model hey what did you use to focus the tracking spell lock of her hair thats baby hair harry so bob let out a disgusted sound so it wont work harry babies are like one big enormous blank slate molly has changed quite a bit since that lock was taken she doesnt have much to do with the person it got snipped from naturally the spell couldnt track her dammit i snarled i hadnt thought of that but it made sense i hadnt ever used a lock of baby hair in the spell before except once to find a baby dammit dammit dammit a tiny mistake i was only human and i had failed molly chapter thirtyfour i turned away from the table and hauled myself laboriously up the ladder to my living room charity sat on the edge of the couch with her head bowed her lips moving as i emerged she stood up and faced me tension quivering through her thomas who had a kettle on my little woodburning stove glanced over his shoulder i shook my head at them charitys face went white and she slowly sat down again i went to the kitchen found my bottle of aspirin and chewed up three of them grimacing at the taste then i drank a glass of water you make those calls i asked thomas yeah he said in fact murphy should be here in a minute i nodded at him and walked over to settle into one of the easy chairs by the fireplace with my glass of water and told charity i thought i could find her im sorry i i shook my head and trailed off into silence thank you for trying mister dresden she said quietly she didnt look up it was the baby hair i said to charity it didnt work hair was too old i couldnt i sighed just too tired to think straight maybe i said im sorry charity looked up at me i expected fear anger maybe a little bit of contempt in her features but none of that was there there was instead something that id seen in michael when the situation was really really bad it was a kind of quiet calm a surety totally at odds with the situation and i could not fathom its source or substance we will find her she told me quietly well bring her home her voice held the solid confidence of someone stating a fact as simple and obvious as two plus two is four i didnt quite break out into a bitter laugh i was too tired to do that but i shook my head and stared at the empty fireplace mister dresden she said quietly i dont pretend to know as much about magic as you do im quite certain you have a great deal of power just not enough i said not enough to do any good in the corner of my eye i saw charity actually smile its difficult for you to realize that you are at times as helpless as the rest of us she was probably right but i didnt say as much out loud i made a mistake and molly might be hurt because of it i dont know how to live with that youre only human she said and there was a trace of pensive reflection in her voice for all of your power that answer isnt good enough i said quietly i glanced at her to find her watching me her dark eyes intent not good enough for molly have you done all that you can to help her charity asked me i racked my brain for a useless moment and then said yeah she spread her hands then i can hardly ask you for more i blinked at her what she smiled again yes it surprises me to hear myself say it as well i have not been tolerant of you i have not been pleasant to you i waved a tired hand yeah but i get why not i realize that now she said you saw but it took all of this to make me see it see what that much of the anger ive directed at you was not rightfully yours i was afraid i let my fear become something that controlled me that made me harm others you she bowed her head and i let it worsen matters with molly i feared for her safety so much that i went to war with her i drove her toward what i most wished her to avoid all because of my fear i have been afraid and i am ashamed everyone gets scared sometimes i said but i allowed it to rule me i should have been stronger than that mister dresden wiser than that we all should be god did not give us a spirit of fear but of love of power and of selfcontrol i absorbed that for a moment then i asked are you apologizing to me she arched an eyebrow and then said her tone wry i am not yet that wise that actually did pull a quiet laugh from me mister dresden she said weve done all that we can do now we pray we have faith faith i asked she regarded me with calm confident eyes that a hand mightier than yours or mine will shield my daughter that we will be shown a way that he will not leave his faithful when they are in need im not all that faithful i said she smiled again tired but unwavering i have enough for both of us she met my eyes steadily and said there are other powers than your magic or that of the dark spirits that oppose us we are not alone in this fight mister dresden we need not be afraid i averted my eyes before a soulgaze could get going and before she could see them tear up charity regardless of how shed treated me in the past had been there when the chips were down shed cared for me when id been injured shed supported me when she didnt have to do so as abrasive accusatory and harsh as she could be i had never for an instant doubted her love for her husband for her children or the sincerity of her faith id never liked her too muchbut i had always respected her now more than ever i just hoped she was right when she said we werent in this alone i wasnt sure i really believed that deep down dont get me wrong ive got nothing against god except for maybe wishing he was a little less ambiguous and had better taste in hired help people like michael and charity and to a lesser extent murphy had made me take some kind of faith under consideration now and again but i wasnt the sort of guy who did well when it came to matters of belief and i wasnt the sort of guy who i thought god would really want hanging around his house or his people hell there was a fallen angel in my brain i counted myself lucky that i hadnt met michael or one of the other knights from the business end of one of the swords i looked at the gift popcorn tin in the corner by the door where my staff and rod were settled along with my practice fighting staff an unearned double of my wizardly tool my sword cane an umbrella and the wooden cane sheath of fidelacchius one of the three swords borne by michael and his brothers in arms the swords last wielder had told me that i was to keep it and pass it on to the next knight he said i would know who and when and then the sword sat there in my popcorn tin for years when my house had been invaded by bad guys theyd overlooked it thomas who had lived with me for almost two years had never touched it or commented on it i wasnt sure that hed ever noticed it either it just sat there waiting i glanced at the sword and then up at the roof if god wanted to throw a little help our way now would be a good time to get that foreordained knowledge of who to give the sword to at least not that it would do us all that much good i supposed with or without fidelacchius we had a fair amount of power of the asskicking variety what we needed was knowledge without knowledge all the ass kicking in the world wouldnt help i watched the sword for a minute just in case no light show no sound effects not even a burst of vague intuition i guess that wasnt the kind of help heaven was dishing out at the moment i settled back in my chair charity had returned to her quiet prayers i tried to think thoughts that wouldnt clash and hoped that god wouldnt hold it against molly that i was on her side i glanced back over my shoulder thomas had listened to the whole thing with an almost supernatural quality of noninvolvement he was watching charity with troubled eyes he traded a glance with me that seemed to mirror most of what i was feeling then he brought everyone a cup of tea and faded immediately back to the kitchen alcove again while charity prayed maybe ten minutes later murphy knocked at the door and then opened it besides thomas she was the only person id entrusted with an amulet that would let her through my wards without harm she wore one of her usual work outfits black jacket white shirt dark pants comfortable shoes grey predawn light backlit her she took a look around the place frowning before she shut the door whats happened i brought her up to speed finishing with my failure to locate the girls trail so youre trying to find molly murphy asked with a spell yeah i said i thought that was pretty routine for you murphy said i mean i can think of four or five times at least youve done that i shook my head thats tracking down where something is im looking for where mollys been its a different bag of snakes why murphy asked why not go straight to her because the fetches have taken her back home with them i said shes in the nevernever i cant zero in on her there the best i can do is to try to find where they crossed over follow them across and use a regular tracking spell once im through oh she frowned and walked over to me and for that you need her hair yeah i said which we dont have so were stuck she chewed on her lip couldnt you use something else nail clippings i said or blood if it was fresh enough uhhuh murphy said she nodded at charity what about her blood what i said shes the girls mother murphy said blood of her blood wouldnt that work no i said oh murphy said why not because i frowned uh i looked up at charity for a moment actually there was a magical connection between parents and children a strong one my mother had worked a spell linked to thomas and me that would confirm to us that we were brothers the connection had been established even though she had been the only common parent between us the blood connection was the deepest known to magic it might work i said quietly i thought about it some more and breathed stars and stones not just work actually for this spell it might work better charity said nothing but her eyes glowed with that steady unmovable strength i thought to myself thats what faith looks like i nodded my head to her in a bow of acknowledgment then i turned to murphy and gave her a jubilant kiss on the mouth murphy blinked in total surprise yes i whooped laughing murphy you rock go team dresden hey im the one who rocks she said go team murphy thomas snorted even charity had a small smile though her eyes were closed and her head was bowed again murmuring thanks presumably to the almighty murphy had asked the exact question id needed to hear to tip me off to the answer help from above i was not above taking help from on high and given whose child was in danger it was entirely possible that divine intervention was precisely what had happened i touched the brim of my mental hat and nodded my gratitude vaguely heavenward and then turned to hurry back to the lab charity i presume youre willing to donate for the cause of course she said then were in business get ready to move people this will only take me a minute i stopped and put a hand on charitys shoulder and then were going to get your daughter back yes she murmured looking up at me with fire in her eyes yes we are this time the spell worked i should have known where the fetches had found the swiftest passage from their realm to chicago it was one of those things that in retrospect was obvious charitys minivan pulled into the little parking lot behind clark pells rundown old movie theater it was out of view of the street the sun had risen on our way there though heavy cloud cover and grumbling thunder promised unusually bad weather for so early in the day that shouldnt have surprised me either when the queens of faerie were moving around backstage the weather quite often seemed to reflect their presence murphy pulled her car in right behind the minivan and parked beside it all right murph thomas i said getting out of the van faerie fighting i know harry thomas said yeah but im going to go over it anyway so listen up were heading into the nevernever weve got some wicked faeries to handle which means we have to be prepared for illusions i rummaged in my backpack and came out with a small jar this is an ointment that should let you see through most of their bullshit i went to thomas and slapped some on him then did murphys eyes and then did my own the ointment was my own mixture based on the one the gatekeeper used mine smelled better but stained the skin it touched with a heavy brownblack tone i started to put the jar away after we charity calmly took the jar from my hands opened it and put ointment on her own eyes what are you doing i asked her im preparing to take back my daughter she said you arent going with us i told her yes i am no youre not charity this is seriously dangerous we cant afford to babysit you charity put the lid back on the jar and dropped it into my backpack then she opened the sliding door on the minivan and drew out a pair of heavyduty plastic storage bins she opened the first and calmly peeled out of her pullover jersey i noted a couple of things first that charity had won some kind of chromosomal lottery when it came to the body department she wore a sports bra beneath the sweater and she looked like she could have modeled it if she cared to do so molly had definitely gotten her looks from her mother the second thing i noticed was charitys arms she had broad shoulders for a woman but her arms were heavy with muscle and toned her forearms especially looked lean and hard muscles easily seen shifting beneath tight skin i traded a glance with murphy who looked impressed i just watched charity for a minute frowning charity took an arming jacket from the first tub it wasnt some beatup old relic either it was a neat quilted garment heavy black cotton over the quilting which was backed by what looked a lot like kevlar ballistic fabric she pulled it on belted it into place and then withdrew an honesttogod coat of mail from the tub she slipped into it and fastened half a dozen clasps with the swift assurance of long practice a heavy sword belt came next securing the mail coat then she pulled on a tightfitting cap made in the same manner as the jacket tucking her braided hair up into it and then slipped a ridged steel helmet onto her head she opened the second tub and drew out a straight sword with a cruciform hilt the weapon was only slightly more slender and shorter than michaels blessed blade but after she inspected the blade for notches or rust she flicked it around a few times as lightly as she would a rolledup newspaper then slid the weapon into the sheath on the sword belt she tucked a pair of heavy chain gloves through the belt finally she took a hammer from the big tub it had a steelbound handle about four feet long and mounted a head almost as large as a sledgehammers backed by a wickedlooking spike she put the hammer over her shoulder balancing its weight with one arm and turned to me she looked ferocious so armed and armored and the heavy black stain around her eyes didnt do anything to soften the image ferocious hell she looked competentand dangerous everyone just stared at her she arched a golden eyebrow i make all of my husbands armor she said calmly as well as his spare weaponry by hand uh i said no wonder she was buff you know how to fight too she looked at me as though i was a dimwitted child my husband didnt become a master swordsman by osmosis he works hard at it who did you suppose hes practiced against for the last twenty years her eyes smoldered again a direct challenge to me these creatures have taken my molly and i will not remain here while she is in danger maam murphy said quietly practice is very different from the real thing charity nodded this wont be my first fight murphy frowned for a moment and then turned a troubled glance to me i glanced at thomas who was facing away a little apart from the rest of us staying out of the decisionmaking process charity stood there with that warhammer over one shoulder her weight planted her eyes determined hells bells i sighed okay john henry youre on the team i waved a hand and went back to the briefing faeries hate and fear the touch of iron and that includes steel it burns them and neutralizes their magic there are extra weapons in the tub as well as additional coats of mail charity offered though they might not fit you terribly well lieutenant murphy charity had thought ahead i was glad one of us had mail coat is just the thing for discouraging nasty faerie beasties with claws murphy looked skeptical i dont want to break up the battle of hastings dress theme harry but i find guns generally more useful than swords are you serious about this you might not be able to rely on your guns i told her reality doesnt work the same way in the nevernever and it doesnt always warn you when its changing the rules its common to find areas of faerie where gunpowder is noncombustible youre kidding she said nope get some steel on you theres not a thing the faeries can do about that its the biggest edge mortals have on them the only edge charity corrected she passed me a sleeveless mail shirt probably the only one that would fit me i dumped my leather duster armored myself and then put the duster back on over the mail murphy shook her head then she and thomas collected mail and weaponry of their own couple more things i said once were inside dont eat or drink anything dont accept any gifts or any offers from a faerie interested in making a deal you dont want to wind up owing favors to one of the sidhe believe you me i frowned thinking then i took a deep breath and said one thing more each of us must do everything possible to control our fear murphy frowned at me what do you mean we cant afford to carry in too much fear with us the fetches feed on it it makes them stronger if we go in there without keeping our fear under control theyll sense a meal coming were all afraid but we cant let it control our thoughts actions or decisions try to keep your breathing steady and remain as calm as you can murphy nodded frowning faintly all right then everyone hat up and sing out when youre good to go i watched as murphy got her gear into place charity helped her secure the armor her mail was a shortsleeved shirt maybe one of charitys spare suits shed compensated for the oversize armor by belting it in tight but the short sleeves fell to her elbows and the hem reached most of the way to her knees murphy looked like a kid dressing up in an adults clothes her expression grew calm and distant as she worked the way it did when she was focused on shooting or in the middle of one of her five trillion and three formal katas i closed my eyes and tentatively pushed my magical senses toward her i could feel the energy in her the life pulsing and steady there were tremors in it here and there but there was no screaming beacon of violent terror that would trumpet our approach to the bad guys not that i thought there would be what she lacked in height she more than made up for in guts on the other hand murphy had never been in the nevernever and even though faerie was as normal a place as you can find there it could get pretty weird despite training discipline and determination novice deepwater divers can never be sure that they will remain free from the onset of the condition called pressure sickness the nevernever was much the same you cant tell how someone is going to react the first time they fall down the rabbit hole thomas being thomas made the mail into a fashion statement he wore black clothing black combat boots and the arming jacket and mail somehow managed to go with the rest of his wardrobe he had his saber on his belt on his left side carried the shotgun in his right hand and made the whole ensemble look like an upperclass version of the road warrior i checked on thomas with my wizards senses too his presence had never been fully human but like the other members of the white court the vampiric aspects of him were not obvious to casual observation not even to wizards there was something feline about his aura the same quality i would expect in a hungry leopard waiting patiendy for the next meal to approach enormous power held in perfect balance there was a darker portion of him too the part id always associated with the demonic presence that made him a vampire a black and bitter well of energy equal parts lust hunger and selfloathing thomas was no foolhe was certainly afraid but the fear couldnt be sensed under that still black surface charity after she finished helping murphy stepped back from her and went to her knees in the parking lot she folded her hands in her lap bowed her head and continued praying around her i felt a kind of ambient warmth as though she knelt in her own personal sunbeam the same kind of energy that had always characterized her husbands presence faith i suppose she was afraid too but it wasnt the primitive survival fear the fetches required her fear was for her daughter for her safety her future her happiness and as i watched her i saw her lips form my name then thomass then murphys charity was more afraid for us than herself right there i promised myself that i would get her back home with her daughter back to her family and her husband safe and sound and whole i would not by god hesitate for a heartbeat to do whatever was necessary to make my friends family whole again i checked myself out taking inventory leather duster illfitting mail shirt staff and blasting rod check shield bracelet and amulet check my abused left hand ached a little and what i could feel of it felt stiffbut i could move my fingers my head hurt my limbs felt a little bit shaky with fatigue i had to hope that adrenaline would kick in and make that problem go away when it counted everyone good to go i asked murphy nodded thomas drawled yep charity rose and said ready let me sweep the outside of the building first i said this is their doorway home its possible that theyve got the place boobytrapped or that theyve set up wards once i clear it well go in i trudged off to walk a slow circle around pells theater i let my fingertips drag along the side of the building closed my eyes most of the way and extended my wizards senses into the structure it wasnt a quick process but i tried not to dawdle either as i walked i sensed a kind of trapped suffocated energy bouncing around inside the buildingleakage from the nevernever probably from when the fetches took molly across but several times i also felt tiny malevolent surges of energy too random and mobile to be spells or wards their presence was disturbingly similar to that of the fetch id destroyed in the hotel i came back to where id begun about ten minutes later anything thomas asked no wards no mystic land mines i told him but i think theres something in there like what like fetches i said smaller than the big ones were after and probably set to guard the doorway between here and the nevernever theyll try to ambush us when we go in murphy said probably i said but if we know about it we can turn it against them when they come hit them fast and hard even if it seems like overkill we cant afford any injuries murphy nodded what are we waiting for thomas asked more help i replied why because im not strong enough to open a stable passage to deep faerie i said even if i wasnt tired and i managed to get it open i doubt it would stay that way for more than a few seconds which would be bad murphy asked yeah what would happen charity asked quietly wed die i said wed be trapped in deep faerie near the strongholds of all kinds of trouble with no way to escape but to try to find our way to the portions of faerie that are near earth the locals would eat us and spit out the bones before we got anywhere close to escape thomas rolled his eyes and said this isnt exactly helping me keep my mind off my fear man shut up i told him or ill move to my second initiative and start telling you knockknock jokes harry murphy said if you knew you couldnt open the door long enough to let us get the girl how did you plan to manage it i know someone who can help only shes totally unable to help me murphy scowled at me then said youre enjoying this you just love to dance around questions and spring surprises when you know something the rest of us dont its like heroin for wizards i confirmed an engine throbbed nearby and tires made a susurrus on asphalt a motorcycle prowled around the theater to its rear parking lot bearing two helmeted riders the rearmost rider swung down from the bike a shapely woman in leather pants and a denim jacket she reached up took off her green helmet and shook out her snowwhite hair it fell at once into a silken sheet without the aid of a brush or a comb the summer lady lily paused to give me a slight bow and she smiled at me her green eyes particularly luminous the bikes driver proved to be fix the summer knight wore closefitting black pants and a billowing shirt of green silk he bore a rapier with a sturdy guard on his hip and the leather that wrapped its handle had worn smooth and shiny fix put both helmets on a rack on the motorcycle nodded at us and said good morning i made introductions though i went into few details beyond names and titles when that was done i told lily thank you for coming she shook her head i am yet in your debt it was the least i could do though i feel i must warn you that i may not be able to give you the help that you require meaning titanias compulsion to prevent lily from helping me was still in force but id thought of a way to get around that i know you cant help me i said but i wish to tell you that the onus of your debt to me has been passed to another in good faith i must redress a wrong i have done to the girl named molly carpenter to do so i offer her mother your debt to me as payment fix barked out a satisfied laugh hah lilys mouth spread into a delighted smile well done wizard she murmured then she turned to charity and asked do you accept the wizards offer of payment lady charity looked a little lost and she glanced at me i nodded my head at her yyes she said yes so mote it be lily said bowing her head to charity then i owe you a debt lady what may i do to repay it charity glanced at me again i nodded and said just tell her charity turned back to the summer lady help us retrieve my daughter molly she said she is a prisoner of the fetches of the winter court i will be more than happy to do all in my power to aid you lily said charity closed her eyes thank you it will not be as much help as you might desire lily told her her voice serious i dare not directly strike at the servants of winter acting in lawful obligation to their queen except in selfdefense were i to attack the consequences could be grave and retaliation immediate then what can you do charity asked lily opened her mouth to answer but then said the wizard seems to have something in mind yep i said i was just coming to that lily smiled at me and bowed her head gesturing for me to continue this is where they took the girl across i told lily must be why they attacked pell firstto make sure the building was shut down and locked up so that they would have an immediate passage back if they needed it im also fairly sure they left some guardians behind lily frowned at me and walked over to the building she touched it with her fingers and her eyes closed it took her less than a tenth of the time it had me and she never moved from the spot indeed she said three lesser fetches at least they cannot sense us yet but they will know when anyone enters and attack im counting on it i said im going to go in first and let them see me fix lifted his eyebrows at which point they tear you to bits this is a craftier plan than i had anticipated i flashed him a grin wouldnt want you to feel left out fix i want lily to hold a veil over everyone else once the fetches show up to rip off my face lily drops the veil and the rest of you drop them yeah thats a much better plan fix drawled his fingertips tracing over the hilt of his sword and i can cut up vassals of winter so long as it is no inconvenience to you of course mlady lily shook her head not at all sir knight and i will be glad to veil you and your allies lady charity charity paused and said wait a minute do i understand this situation correctly you are not allowed to assist harry but because harry has what passed his debt to me banks buy and sell mortgages all the time i said charity arched a brow and because hes given me your debt to him youre doing whatever you can to help fix and lily exchanged a helpless glance theyre also under a compulsion that prevents them from directly discussing it with anyone i filled in but youve got the basics right charily charity shook her head arent they going to be in trouble for this wont who commands her titania i said charity blinked at me and i could tell shed heard the name before the the faerie queen one of them i said yeah she shook her head i dont enough people are already in danger dont worry about us maam fix assured her and winked titania has already laid down the law weve obeyed it not our fault if what she decreed was not what she wanted translation i said we got around her fair and square she wont like it but shell accept it oh yeah thomas muttered under his breath this isnt coming back to bite anyone in the ass later ixnay i growled at him then turned and walked toward the theaters rear entrance i took up my staff in a firm grip and put its tip against the chains holding the door shut i took a moment to slow my breathing and focus my thoughts this wasnt a grosspower exercise i wouldnt have to put nearly as much oomph into shattering the chain if i kept it small precise focused blasting a door down was a relatively simple exercise for me what i wanted here was to use a minimum of power to snap a single link in the chain i brought my thoughts to a pinpoint focus and muttered forzare power lashed through the length of the staff and there was a hiss and a sharp crack nearly as loud as a gunshot the chain jumped i lowered my staff to find one single link split into two pieces each broken end glowing with heat i nudged the heated links to the ground with the tip of my staff faintly surprised and pleased with how little relative effort it had taken i reached out and tried the doorknob locked hey murph i said look at that zeppelin i heard her sigh and turn around i popped a couple of stiff metal tools out of my dusters pocket and started finagling the lock with them my left hand wasnt much help but it was at least able to hold the tool steady while my right did most of the work hey thomas said when did you get those butters says its good for my hand to do physical therapy involving the use of manual dexterity thomas snorted so you started learning to pick locks i thought you were playing guitar this is simpler i said and it doesnt make dogs start howling i might have killed you if id heard house of the rising sun one more time thomas agreed whered you get the picks i glanced over my shoulder at murphy and said little bird one of these days dresden murphy said still stubbornly faced away i got the tumblers lined up and twisted with slow steady pressure the dead bolt slid to and i pulled the door slightly ajar i rose put the tools away and took up my staff again ready for instant trouble nothing happened for a moment i listened at the door for half a minute but heard not a sound all right i said here we go everyone ready to i glanced over my shoulder and found the parking lot entirely empty except for me wow i said good veil lily then i turned back around just as if my nerves werent jangling like guitar strings and said ding ding round one chapter thirtyfive i kicked the door open staff held ready to fight and shouted and im all outta bubble gum the pale grey light of the overcast sunrise coming in over the lake showed me a service corridor the kind with walls that have marks and writing all over them floors with the paint chipped off all down the middle of the walkway and lots of stuff stacked up here and there at the far end of the hallway was a door propped open with a rubber wedge a worn sign on the door read employees only a curtained doorway about halfway down the hall opened onto what must have been the concessions counter in the little theaters lobby silence reigned not a single light shone within guess you had to see that one i said to the empty building john carpenter rowdy roddy piper longest fight scene ever you know silence missed that one huh i asked the darkness i stood there hoping the bad guys would make this one easy if they charged me i could duck aside and then let my concealed allies take them apart instead as bad guys so often do they failed to oblige me i started to feel a little silly just standing there if i went ahead the narrow passage would negate the participation of those now lurking in veiled ambush behind me but had i really been alone the hallway would have been as reasonable a fighting position as i could hope to gainno way for the fetches to encircle me no way to use their advantage of numbers had i really been alone i would have needed to jump on an opportunity like that there are stupid faeries but fetches arent among them if i didnt behave like a lone wolf come to party it would tip off the presence of my entourage so like a crazed loner with more death wish than survival instinct i boldly strode into the building staff held ready teeth bared in a fighting grin the place was dim and cooler than it should have been even given the time of day my breath turned to frost in front of my nose the movietheater scent of popcorn had sunk into the very foundations and was now as much a part of the building as its walls and floor my stomach rumbled like certain other portions of my anatomy it had a tendency to become easily sidetracked and to hell with little details like survival the rest of me was nervous i had seen how fast one of those creatures could move i could have ducked out of the way if theyd come charging from the far end of the hall at me but not by much maybe two or three steps in i reached a point where i judged that i wouldnt have time to retreat and let my allies ambush the attacker for a few seconds at least id be on my own a few seconds are forever in a fight i shook out my shield bracelet willed power into it and walked with my left hand before me both providing me some protection against a possible charge and casting low blue light that would let me see as i moved forward do you know what part of a movie this is i said to myself as i moved this is the part where the old farmer with the torch and the shotgun just cant keep himself from walking forward into the dark cave even though he damn well knows theres a monster in there i moved up to the hanging curtain and slid it aside with my staff several quick glances out showed me a small and dingy concessions stand to go along with the small and dingy lobby nothing tried to eat my face oh come on i said louder im starting to feel a little insulted here if you guys keep this up im going to take drastic cliched measures maybe walk backward through a doorway or something my instincts suddenly screamed and i flung myself through the curtained doorway getting clear of the hall as something darted toward me from the halls far end i didnt want to catch any bullets or blasts of fire or hurled hammers from my backup there was a roar of sound from the hallwaysomething letting out a ululating howl a heavy handgun a roaring shotgun and the buzzing snap of an arc of electricity blinding bluewhite light blazed through the curtain as i dove through itand showed me the fetch that had lurked in ambush on the other side it was crouched on top of the glass cabinet atop the concessions stands popcorn machine and had taken the form of a creature that could only loosely be called a cat it was twice misters size and its moldy black fur stood out in tufts and spikes its shoulders were hunched almost deformed with muscle and its muzzle was broad and filled with teeth too heavy to belong to any feline short of a lion its eyes gleamed with a sickly greenish luminescence and it flashed through the air claws extended teeth bared emitting a mindsplitting howl of rage i had no time or space to strike first and it was a damned good thing id prepared my shield ahead of time i brought it up and into a quarter dome between me and the fetch blue power hissing i should have kept in mind how easily the scarecrow had shed my magic the night before the lesser fetch must have had some measure of the same talent because it changed the tone of its howl in the middle of its leap impacted my shield and oozed through it as though the solid barrier was a thick sludge there was no space to dodge in and no room to swing my staff so i dropped it as the fetchs face emerged from my shield and drove my fist into the end of its feline nose i dropped the shield as i did with the shield gone the only force acting on the fetch was the impact of my punch and the shapeshifter flew backward into the old cash register on the concessions counter it was made of metal blue sparks erupted from the fetch as its flesh hit the iron along with a yowl of protest tendrils of smoke and an acrid odor i heard footsteps in the corridor behind me and then a trio of gunshots harry murphy called here i shouted i didnt have time to say anything else the nightmare cat bounced up from the cash register recovered its balance and flung itself at me again every bit as swiftly as the fetch id faced earlier i ducked and tried to throw myself under the fetch to get behind it but my body wasnt operating as swiftly as my mind and the fetchs claws raked at my eyes i threw up an arm and the fetch slammed into it with a sudden harsh impact that made my arm go numb from the elbow down claws and fangs flashed the spellbound leather of my duster held and the creatures claws didnt penetrate except for a shallow cut a random claw accidentally inflicted on my wrist below the dusters sleeve i escaped it unharmed i hit the ground and rolled throwing my arm out to one side in an effort to slam the fetch onto the floor and knock it loose the creature was deceptively strong it braced one rear leg against the counter claws digging in robbing the blow of any real force it bounced off the floor with rubbery agility pounced onto my chest and went for my throat i got an arm between the fetch and my neck it couldnt rip its way through the duster but it was stronger than it had any right to be i was lying mostly on my back and had no leverage it wrenched at my arm and i knew i only had a second or two before it overpowered me threw my arm out of its way and tore my throat out i reached down with my other hand and ripped my duster all the way off the front of my body cold iron seared the nightmare cats paws in a hissing fury of sparks and smoke the fetch let out another shrieking yowl and bounded almost straight up gunshots rang out again as the fetch reached the apogee of its reflexive leap it twitched and screamed jerking sharply as it came back down it writhed wildly in midair altering its trajectory and landed on the floor beside me murphys combat boot lashed out in a stomping kick that sent the fetch sliding across the floor and the instant it was clear of me she started shooting again she put half a dozen shots into the creature driving it over the floor howling in pain but thrashing with frenzied strength the gun went empty murphy slammed another clip into the weapon just as the fetch began gathering itself up off the floor she kept pouring bullets into it as fast as she could accurately shoot and stepped with deliberate care to one side as she did so thomas came through the curtain with preternatural speed his face bone white he seized the stunned fetch by the throat and slammed it overhand into the cash register again and again until i heard its spine snap then he threw it over the concessions stand into the lobby light flashed something that looked like a butterfly sculpted from pure fire shot over my head like a tiny comet i scrambled to my feet to see the blazing butterfly hit the fetch square in the chest the thing screamed again front legs thrashing rear legs entirely limp as fire exploded over its flesh burned a hole in its chest and then abruptly consumed it whole i leaned on the counter and panted for a second then looked around to see the curtain slide aside of its own accord as lily stepped through it at that moment the summer lady did not look sweet or caring her lovely face held an implacable restrained anger and half a dozen of the fiery butterflies flittered around her she stared at the dying fetch until the fire winked out leaving nothing not even residual ectoplasm behind murphy reloaded and came over to me though her eyes were still scanning for danger youre bleeding you all right i checked blood from the injury on my wrist had trickled down over my palm and fingers i pushed back my sleeve to get a look at the wound the cut ran parallel to my forearm it wasnt long but was deeper than id thought and it had missed opening up the veins in my wrist by maybe half an inch my belly went cold and i swallowed simple cut i told murphy not too bad let me see thomas said he examined the injury and said could have been worse youll need a stitch or three harry no time i told him help me find something to wrap it up good and tight thomas looked around the concessions area and suggested silly straws i heard an expressive sigh charity appeared at the curtained doorway flipped open a leather case on her sword belt and tossed thomas a compact medical kit he caught it gave her a nod and went to work on my hand charity stepped back into the hallway her expression alert fix glanced in and then went by the curtained doorway presumably to the other end of the hall what happened i asked murphy one of those things charged down the hall to jump on your back she said looked like some kind of mutant baboon we took it down nature red thomas mused remember that movie the one where the retrovirus gets loose in the zoo and starts mutating the animals baboon was from there that cat thing too huh i said yeah i dont get it murphy said why do they all look like movie monsters fear i said those images have been a part of this culture for a while now over time theyve generated a lot of fear come on murphy said i saw nature red it wasnt that scary this is a case of quantity over quality i said even if it only makes you jump in your chair theres a little fear multiply that by millions the fetches take the form so that they can tap into a portion of that fear in order to create more of it murphy frowned and shook her head whatever a light appeared in the hallway leading back to the actual theater in an eyeblink murphy and thomas both had their guns pointed at it and my shield bracelet was dripping heatless blue sparks ready to spring into place its all right lily said her voice low fix appeared in the doorway at the far end of the lobby sword in hand fire gleamed along the length of the blade as if it had been coated in kerosene and ignited he looked around frowning and said it isnt back this way what isnt i asked the third lily said there will be a third fetch why i asked because theyre fetches fix answered we should check the bathrooms not alone i said murph charity murphy nodded and slipped around the counter to join fix charity slipped through the curtain and to the lobby in her wake the three of them moved in cautious silence and entered the restrooms they returned a moment later fix shook his head there thomas said finishing off the bandage too tight i flexed the fingers of my right hand and stooped to recover my staff its good i squinted around the place one room left we all looked at the double doors leading to the actual theater they were closed faint lights flickered barely noticeable from within the radius of our own illumination if it aint broke dont fix it i said walking around the counter and into the lobby i headed for the doors and tried to project confidence same plan i paused at the doors while everyone gathered behind me i looked back to check that they were ready which is why i was the only one who saw what happened the plastic trash can about six inches behind charity suddenly exploded the top flipping off and paper cups and popcorn bags flew everywhere something humanoid and no larger than a toddler shot from the trash can it had red hair and overalls and it held a big old kitchen knife in one tiny hand it hit charity just above her tailbone driving her into the ground and lifted the knife my companions had been taken by surprisejust a second or two but as far as charity was concerned it might as well have been forever there was no time for thought before i realized what i was doing i took a pair of long steps shifting my grip on my staff as i went and swung it like a golf club at the fetchs head it impacted with a meaty thunk its head flew off bounced off of a pillar and rolled to a stop not far from the rest of the thing i had only a second to regard the dolls features before it began dissolving into ectoplasm thomas blinked at it and said that was bucky the murder doll kind of a wimp i said thomas nodded must have been the runt of the litter i traded a glance with murphy personally i said i never understood how anyone could have found that thing frightening to begin with then i went to charitys side and offered her a hand up she grimaced and took it are you all right nothing broken she replied she winced and put her hand to her back i should have stretched out next time well know better i said lily is that it the summer ladys eyes went distant for a moment and then she murmured yes there are no longer agents of winter in this place come she stepped forward and the doors to the theater proper opened of their own accord we followed it was your typical movie theater not one of the new stadiumseating fancy theaters but one of the old models with only a slight incline in the floor light played over the screen though the projector was not running spectral colors shifted faded changed and melded like the aurora borealis and i was struck with the sudden intuition that the color and light were somehow being projected from the opposite side of the screen the air grew even colder as we followed lily down the aisle she stopped in front of the screen staring blankly at it for a moment then shuddered dresden she said quietly this crossing leads to arctis tor my stomach fluttered again oh crap i saw thomas arch an eyebrow at me out of the corner of my eye crap murphy asked why what is that place i took a deep breath its the heart of winter its like i shook my head think the tower of london the fortress of solitude fort knox and alcatraz all rolled up into one giant ball of fun its mabs capital her stronghold i glanced at lily if what ive read about it is correct that is ive never actually seen the place your sources were accurate enough harry lily said her manner remained remote strained this is going to severely limit what help i can give you why i asked lily stared intently at me for a second then said my power will react violently to that of mab i can open the way to the arctis tor but holding the way open for your return will occupy the whole of my strength furthermore so long as i hold the way open i run the risk of letting creatures from deep winter run free in chicago which means that fix must remain here to guard the passage against them i cannot in good conscience send him with you i scowled at the shifting colors on the screen so once we go in were on our own yes super without lily and fixs power to counter that of the winter fae within arctis tor our odds of success would undergo a steep reduction and i had hoped we would be attacking an independent trio of faeries lairing in a cave or under a bridge or something i hadnt figured on storming the bastille i looked up and met charitys eyes for a second i turned back to the dancing lights on the movie screen and told the others things just got a lot worse im still going none of you have to come with me i dont expect you to before i finished speaking charily murphy and thomas stepped up to stand beside me a bolt of warmth fierce with joy and pride and gratitude flashed through me like sudden lightning i dont care about whose dna has recombined with whose when everything goes to hell the people who stand by you without flinchingthey are your family and they were my heroes i nodded at lily she closed her eyes and the shimmering colors on the screen grew brighter more vibrant the air grew colder all right i said quietly each of you get a hand on my shoulder i resettled my grip on my wizards staff and murmured round two chapter thirtysix every time i opened a way to the nevernever it always looked pretty much the samean uneven vertical rip in the air that let in the sights and sounds and scents of the world on the other side the longer i wanted the rift to stay open the bigger id rip the hole more experienced wizards had made a comment or two over the years to suggest that i still had a lot to learn on the subject when lily opened the way to arctis tor i understood why light and color shifted over the screen their flow quickening deepening at first nothing else happened the movie screen was simply a surface then the hairs on the back of my neck rose and a cold wind wafted into my face bringing with it the dry sterile scent of winter in high barren mountains and the high lonely cry of some kind of wild beast like nothing in the real world deep blue came to dominate the colors on the screen and a moment later resolved itself into the shapes of mountains towering beneath the light of an impossibly enormous silver moon they were bleak and hateful stone peaks wreathed in mist and wrapped in ice and snow the wind moaned and blew frozen crystals into our faces then sank into a temporary lull the blowing snow cleared just enough to get me my first look at arctis tor mabs stronghold was a fortress of black ice an enormous shadowy cube sitting high up the slope of the highest mountain in sight a single elegant spire rose above the rest of the structure flickers of green and amethyst energy played within the ice of the walls i couldnt make a good guess at how big the thing was the walls and battlements were lined with inverted icicles they made me think of the fanged jaws of a hungry predator a single gate small in comparison to the rest of the fortress stood open hells bells how the hell was i supposed to get in there it was almost a relief when the wind rose again and blowing snow once more obscured the fortress from view it was only then that i realized that the way was open lily had brought it forth so smoothly that i hadnt been able to tell when image gave way to reality by comparison my own ability to open a way to the nevernever was about as advanced as the paintings of a particularly gifted gorilla i glanced back at lily she gave me a small smile and then gestured with one hand one of the fiery butterflies fluttering around her altered course and soared over to me this much i can do for you all she murmured it will lead you through the storm and ward away the cold until you can return here do not tarry wizard i do not know how long i will be able to hold the way open for your return i nodded thank you lily this time her smile was warmer more like that of the girl she had been before becoming the summer lady good luck harry fix took a deep breath and then hopped up onto the stage floor at the base of the movie screen he turned to offer me a hand up i took it stared at the frozen wasteland for a second and then stepped directly forward into what had been the screen i found myself standing in kneedeep snow and the howling winds forced my eyes almost shut i should have been freezing but whatever enchantment lilys blazing butterfly used seemed effective the air felt almost as warm as that of a ski slope seeing its last day of the season thomas murphy and charity stepped out of a shimmer in the air and fix followed them a second later hey fix i said i had to raise my voice to be heard over the wind i thought you werent coming the summer knight shook his head im not but it will be easier to stop anything going through from this side he said he regarded us and asked lightly you bring enough iron you think were about to find out christ youre going to piss off mab something fierce bringing iron here i was doing that anyway i assured him he nodded then glanced back at the rift and frowned harry he said theres something you should know before you go in i arched an eyebrow and listened we just got word from our observers that theres a battle underway the reds found one of the major headquarters of the venatori umbrorum who charity asked secret organization i told her like the masons but with machine guns the venatori sent out a call for help fix continued the council answered it i chewed my lower lip do you know where oregon couple hours from seattle he said how bad is it so far its too close to call but its not good the reds had their sorcerous types mucking around with a lot of the councils pathways through the nevernever a lot of the wardens got sidetracked from the battle completely dammit i muttered isnt there anything summer can do to help fix grimaced and shook his head not with the way mabs forces are disposed if we pull enough of our forces from summer to help the council it will weaken us winter will attack he stared at the looming fortress glimpsed in half instants through the gusting snow and shook his head the councils mindset is too defensive harry if they keep sitting tight and reacting to the enemy instead of making the reds react to them theyll lose this war i grunted clausewiz would agree but i dont think the merlin knows from clausewitz and this is a long way from over dont count us out yet maybe he said but his voice wasnt confident i wish i could do more but youd better get going ill hold the door for you i offered him my hand and he shook it be careful i said good hunting he replied i glanced at my three companions and called ready they were we followed the burning butterfly through the snow without its protection from the elements i doubt we would have made it and i made it a point to remember to wear sufficient coldweather gear in the event that i somehow survived this ongoing idiocy and was crazy enough to come back a second time even with the summer magic to protect us it was a pretty good hike over unfriendly terrain id done worse in the past with both justin dumorne and ebenezar and there are times when having long legs can be a real advantage on rough terrain charity seemed all right too but thomas had never been much of an outdoorsman and murphys height put her at a disadvantage that the unaccustomed weight of her armor and cutlery exacerbated i traded a glance with charity i started giving thomas a hand on rough portions of our climb charity helped murphy at first i thought murphy might take her arm off out of wounded pride but she grimaced and visibly forced herself to accept the help the last two hundred yards or so were completely open with no trees or undulation of terrain to shield our approach from the walls of the fortress i lifted a hand to call a halt at the edge of the last hummock of stone that would shelter us from view lilys butterfly drifted in erratic circles around my head snowflakes hissing to steam where they touched it i peered over the edge of a frozen boulder at arctis tor for a long time then settled back down again i dont see anyone i said trying to keep my voice down doesnt make any sense thomas said he was panting and shivering a little despite lilys warding magic i thought this was supposed to be mabs headquarters this place looks deserted it makes perfect sense i said winters forces are all poised to hit summer you dont do that from the heart of your own territory you gather at strong points near the enemys border if were lucky maybe theres just a skeleton garrison here murphy peered around the edge of the stones and said the gates open i dont see any guards she frowned there are theres something on the open ground between here and there see i leaned next to her and peered vague shadowy shapes stirred in the wind between us and the fortress insubstantial as any shadow oh i said its a glamour illusion laid out around the place probably a hedge maze of some kind and it fools people she asked uncertainly it fools people who dont have groovy wizard ointment for their eyes i said then i frowned and said wait a minute the gate isnt open its gone what charity asked she leaned out and stared there is a broken lattice of ice on the ground around the gate a portcullis could be i agreed and inside i squinted i think i can see some heavier pieces like maybe someone ripped apart the portcullis and blew the gate in i took a deep breath feeling a hysterical little giggle lurking in my throat something huffed and puffed and blew the house in mabs house the wind howled over the frozen mountains well thomas said that cant be good charity bit her lip molly i thought you said this mab was all mighty and stuff harry murphy said she is i said frowning then who plays big bad wolf to her little pig i i shook my head and rubbed at my mouth im starting to think that maybe im getting a little bit out of my depth here thomas broke out into a rippling chuckle a faint note of hysteria to it he turned his back to the fortress and sat down chortling i glowered at him and said its not funny it is from here thomas said i mean god you are dense sometimes are you just now noticing this harry i glowered at him some more to answer your question murph i dont know who did this but the list of the people who could is fairly short maybe the senior council could if they had the wardens along but theyre busy and theyd have had to fight a campaign to get this far maybe the vampires could have done it working together but that doesnt track i dont know maybe mab pissed off a god or something there is only one god charity said i waved a hand and said no capital g charity in deference to your beliefs but there are beings who arent the almighty who have power way beyond anything running around the planet like who murphy asked old greek and roman and norse deities lots and lots of amerind divinity and african tribal beings a few australian aboriginal gods others in polynesia southeast asia about a zillion hindu gods but theyve all been dormant for centuries i frowned at arctis tor and i cant think what mab might have done to earn their enmity shes avoided doing that for thousands of years unless of course i thought to myself maeve and lily are right and she really has gone bonkers dresden charity said this is academic we either go in or we leave now i chewed my lip and nodded then i dug in my pockets for the tiny vial of blood charity had provided and hunted through the rocks until i found a spot clear enough to chalk out a circle i empowered it and wrought one of my usual tracking spells keying it to a sensation of warmth against my senses cold as it was i would hardly mind anything that might make me feel a little less freezedried i broke the circle and released the spell and immediately felt a tingling warmth on my left cheekbone i turned to face it and found myself staring directly at arctis tor i paced fifty or sixty yards to the side and faced the warmth again working out a rough triangulation shes alive i told charity or the spell wouldnt have worked shes in there lets go wait charity said she gave me a look filled with discomfort and then said may i say a brief prayer for us first cant hurt i said ill take all the help i can get she bowed her head and said lord of hosts please stand with us against this darkness the quiet bedrockdeep energy of true faith brushed against me charity crossed herself amen murphy echoed the gesture and the amen thomas and i tried to look theologically invisible then without further speech i swung out around the frozen stone cairn and broke into a quick steady jog the others followed along i passed the first bones fifty yards from the walls they lay in a crushed twisted jumble in the snow frozen into something that looked like a macabre escher print the bones were vaguely human but i couldnt be sure because they had been pulverized to dust in some places warped like melted wax in others it was the first grisly memorial of many as i kept going forward brittle frozen bones crunched under my boots lying closer and thicker and twisted more horribly as we drew closer to arctis tor by the time we got to the gate i was shindeep in icy bones they spread out on either side in an enormous wheel of horrible remains centered on the gate whoever they had been thousands of their kind had perished here charitys guess about the portcullis had been bang on pieces of it lay scattered about mixed among the bones where the gate arched beneath the fortress walls there were still more bones waistdeep on me and slabs of planed dark ice the remains of the fortress gate stuck out at odd angles the walls of arctis tor had been pitted with what i could only assume had been an acid of some kind there were larger gouges blown out of the walls here and there but against their monolithic volume they were little more than pockmarks i pushed ahead to the gate plowing my way through bones once there i caught a faint whiff of something familiar i leaned closer to one of the craters blown out of the wall and sniffed what is it thomas asked me sulfur i said quietly brimstone what does that mean he asked no way to tell i half lied but my intuition was absolutely certain of what had happened here someone had thrown hellfire against the walls of arctis tor which meant that the forces of the literal hell or their agents were also playing a part in the ongoing events way way way out of my depth i told myself that it didnt matter there was a young woman inside that frozen boneyard who would die if i did not burgle her out of this nightmare if i did not control my fear there was an excellent chance that it would warn her captors of my approach so i fought the fear that threatened to make me start throwing up or something equally humiliating and potentially fatal i readied my shield gripped my staff ground my teeth together and then continued pushing my way forward through the bones and into the eerie dimness of the most ridiculously dangerous place i had ever been chapter thirtyseven the black ice walls of arctis tor were sixty feet thick and walking through the gateway felt more like walking through a railroad tunnel except for all the bones every breath every step every rasp of bones rubbing against one another multiplied into a thousand echoes that almost seemed to grow louder rather than fading away the bones piled higher as i went forcing me to walk atop them as best i could the footing was treacherous the deep green and violet and occasionally red or green pulses of luminance in the black ice walls did nothing to light the way they only made the shadows shift and flow subtly degrading my depth perception i started feeling a little carsick if one of the fetches appeared at the far end of the tunnel and charged me things would get nasty and fast especially given how ineffective my magic had been against them and how the bones had slowed my pace that was more than a little spooky and it was hard to keep myself from thrashing ahead more quickly out of pure fear i kept a steady pace held it in and refused to allow it to control me i had been shielding my thoughts from lasciel for a couple of years now damned if i was going to give a bunch of murderous faerie monsters the chance to paw through my emotions i checked behind me charity had trouble managing the awkward task of crawling over the bones while armored and holding that big old war hammer but she stuck to it with grim focus and determination behind her murphy seemed to have far less trouble thomas prowled along at the rear graceful as a panther in a tree i emerged from the gate into the courtyard the inside of the fortress was bleak cold and beautiful in its simple symmetry rooms and chambers had either never been built or had been built into the walls and their entries hidden stairs led up to the battlements atop the walls the courtyard was flat smooth dark ice and at its center the single spire reared up from the ground a round turret that rose to a crenellated parapet that overlooked the walls and the ground beneath the courtyard also held a sense of quiet stillness to it as though it was not a place meant for living moving changing beings the howl of the wind outside and overhead did not reach the ground it was as silent as a librarians tomb and each footstep sounded clearly on the ice echoes bounced back and forth in the courtyard somehow carrying a tone of disapproval and menace with them bones spilled out in a wave from the gate rapidly tapering off after a few yards beyond that were only scattered groupings of bones thomas drifted over to one such and poked at it with his drawn saber the blade scraped on a skull too big to stuff into an oil drum too heavy and thick to look entirely human what the hell was this thomas asked quietly troll probably i said big one maybe fourteen fifteen feet tall i looked around haifa dozen other enormous skulls lay in the scattered collections of remains another six had fallen very close to each other at the base of the spire give me a second i want to know what were looking at before we move ahead charity looked like she wanted to argue but instead she took up position a few yards off watching one way thomas and murphy spread out each keeping their eyes on a different direction mixed in with the fallen trolls bones were broken pieces of dark ice that might have been the jigsawpuzzle remains of armor and weapons each fragment bore the remnants of ornate engraving employing gold silver and tiny blue jewels faerie artistry and expensive artistry at that thirteen of them the trolls were mabs i murmured i saw some of them outfitted like this a couple of years back how long have they been dead murphy asked quietly i grunted and hunkered down i stretched my left hand out over the bones and closed my eyes focusing my attention on sharpening my senses mundane and magical alike very faintly i could scent the heavy bestial stink of a troll id only seen a couple of the big ones from up close but you could smell the ugly bastards from half a mile away there was a rotten odor more like heavy mulch than old meat and there was more sulfur and brimstone below that i could feel tremors in the air over the spot the psychic residue of the trolls violent death there was a sense of excitement rage and then a dull seldomfelt terror and a rush of sharp frozen images of violent death confusion terror and searing agony my hand flinched back from the phantom sensation of its own accord and for just a moment the memories of my burning took on tangible form i hissed through my teeth and held my hand against my stomach willing the tooreal ghost of pain away harry murphy asked what the hell the impression the death had left was so sharp so severe that i had actually gotten bits of the trolls memories that had never happened to me before of course i had never tried to pick up vibes in the nevernever either it made more sense that the substance of the spirit world would leave a clearer spiritual impression harry murphy said again more sharply im all right i said through clenched teeth the imprint had been more clear than anything i had ever felt in the real world in chicago i would have thought it was only a few seconds old here i cant tell how old they are i said my gut says not very but i cant be sure it must have been weeks thomas said it takes that long for bones to get this clean its all relative i said time can pass at different rates in faerie these bones could have fallen a thousand years ago by the local clock or twenty minutes ago thomas muttered something under his breath and shook his head what killed them harry murphy asked fire they were burned to death i said quietly down to the bone could you do that thomas asked i shook my head i couldnt make it that hot not at the heart of winter not even with hellfire the remains of perhaps a thousand creatures lay scattered about id cut loose once in the past and roasted a bunch of vampiresand maybe some of their victims with thembut even that inferno hadnt been big enough to catch more than a tithe of the fallen defenders of arctis tor then who did it charity asked quietly i didnt have an answer for her i rose and nudged a smaller skull with my staff the littler ones were goblins i said foot soldiers i rolled a trollsized thighbone aside with my staff an enormous sword also of that same black ice lay shattered beneath it these trolls were her personal guard i gestured back at the gate covering her retreat to the tower maybe some of them got taken down along the way the others made a stand at the towers base died there i paced around checking what the tracking spell had to say and triangulated again mollys in the tower i murmured how do we get in murphy asked i stared at the blank wall of the spire um i said charity glanced over my shoulder and nodded at the spire look behind those trolls if they were covering a retreat they should be near the entrance to the tower maybe i said i walked over to the tower and frowned at the black ice i ran my right hand over its surface feeling for cracks or evidence of a hidden doorway my senses tuned to discover any magic that might hide a door i had the sudden impression that the black ice and the slowly pulsing colors inside were somehow alive aware of me and they did not like me at all i got a sense of alien hatred cold and patient otherwise i got nothing for my trouble but halffrozen fingers nothing here i said and rapped my knuckles on the side of the tower eliciting the dull thump of a very solid object maybe the trolls just wanted to fight with their backs to something solid i might have to go all the way around checking for without any warning at all the ice of the tower parted an archway appeared the ice that had hidden it flowing seamlessly into the rest of the tower the interior of the tower was all shadows and slowly shifting lights that did little to provide any illumination inside was nothing but a spiral staircase winding counterclockwise up through the spire i glanced from the archway to my chilled fingers and back next time i guess ill just knock come on charity said she shifted her grip on the war hammer holding it at something like high port arms handle parallel to her spine heavy head ready to descend we have to hurry thomas and murphy turned to join us at the door an idle puzzled sense of familiarity gave way to my instincts furious warning fetches were the masters of the sucker punch like the buckyfetch who had jumped us just as we opened the doors to the theater they knew how to position themselves to attack just as their enemies focused their attention on some kind of distraction the suddenly opened doorway was it mounds of bones around the courtyard exploded into motion fetches hurtled at us over the ground there werent three of them eitherthere were dozens the fetches here in faerie did not look like movie monsters their true forms were only vaguely humanoid wavering uncertainly as black as midnight shadows but for ghostly white eyes i could see other shapes around them translucent and faint here another one of those alien monster things there some kind of wolflike biped there an enormous man with the head of a warthog but the salve i had spread over my eyes revealed those illusions for what they really were and showed me the thing beneath the mask my magic had a risky batting average against these creatures but there were things i could do besides hosing energy directly at the enemy hellfire came to my call and my staffs runes exploded into light as brilliant as a magnesium flare their flame lit the benighted courtyard while somehow not damaging my clothing or flesh my will and the hellfire roared through me in a torrent as i whirled the staff in a circle over my head and screamed veritas cyclis the howling winds thundered down into the silent courtyard as if i had torn off an unseen roof they gathered along my spinning staff fluttering with lightning the same color as the blazing runes on the staff i cried out and hurled the winds not at the oncoming fetches but at the thousands of bones lying between them and me the wind picked them up with a wailing shriek a sudden cyclone of broken bones and shattered armor spinning them into a whirling curtain the lead fetches were too late to avoid plunging into the cloud and the ossified tornado began to rip them apart battering to pulp whatever was not sheared away by the edges and points of bone and broken shards of ice fetches following in their wake skidded to a halt letting out a startlingly loud chorus of hisses the sounds filled with rage thomas cried out and i heard heavy footsteps another fetch this one much larger came around the curve of the spires wall the ghost image of the reaper was all around him a beat later another charged us from the other direction just as large this one with the faint image of hammerhand an almost obscenely muscled figure in black heavy mallets emerging from the ends of his sleeves into the tower i bellowed the reaper reached thomas and its arm rose up tipped with gleaming black talons in its true form the illusion superimposing the image of the reapers trademark scythe over them thomas caught the reapers sweeping claws on his saber but instead of the ringing of steel on steel there was a flash of greenwhite light and the reaperfetch howled in agony as the steel of the blade struck its claws cleanly from its appendage thomas crouched hips and shoulders twisting in a sharp onetwo movement the sabers blade cut and burned a flattened x shape into the fetchs abdomen the fetch roared in agony and liquid greenwhite fire burst from the wound the creature swung its other arm its speed taking even thomas by surprise he avoided most of the power of the blow but what was left slammed him into the side of the tower i heard a gunshot behind me then another and then murphy snarled damn it i turned in time to see her bob to one side and then to the other as hammerhand swung a mallet limb down at her the blow crashed into the courtyard with a cracking impact as loud as a rifle shot murphy danced in closer to the fetch inside the awkward reach of its clubhands it thrust one down at her at first i thought she was slapping it aside but then she grabbed onto the fetch and continued the motion adding her own weight and strength to the fetchs and redirecting the force of the blow so that the fetchs weaponhand crushed its own foot the fetch bellowed in pain and lost its balance murphy shoved in the same direction and the fetch fell she leapt away from it for the tower door while i grabbed thomas and hauled him inside from somewhere up the stairs i heard a terrified scream molly charity let out a cry and threw herself up the stairs no i shouted charity wait the doorway darkened as a fetch tried to come through murphy her back flat against the wall beside the door drew the long fighting dagger she had taken from charitys box of goodies just as its nose cleared the doorway she whirled in a half circle and with all the power of her legs hips back and shoulders drove the knife to its hilt in one of the things white eyes the fetch went mad with agony it slammed itself blindly against the inside of the doorway more liquid fire erupting from the wound and lurched back and forth until thomas stepped up to it lifted a boot and kicked the fetch with crushing strength hurling the mortally wounded faerie back out onto the courtyard go he cried another fetch began to press in and thomas went to work with his sword his blows struck more burning wounds into the fetch and its blood sizzled like grease on a stove when it touched the cold iron of his blade thomas dodged a return blow and pressed his attack with a sneer driving the thing back from the doorway go he yelled again ill hold the door a snakelike whipping limb shot in along the floor seized thomass ankle and hauled his foot out from under him i clutched at him and kept him from being drawn into the open murph murphy slid up pointed her pistol out the door and squeezed off several shots a fetch screamed in pain and thomass leg suddenly came free i pulled him in and he lunged to his feet again well hold the door murphy said her voice sharp get the girl molly screamed again charitys booted feet thudded unseen from the stairs above me i spat out an oath and sprinted after her chapter thirtyeight the spiral staircase spun me in a steady ascending circle the low ugly light within the walls swirled sickeningly adding to my sense of motion sickness and disorientation below me i could hear thomass sharp mocking laughter as he fought together with the occasional report of murphys gun my aching body hated me for forcing it to run up the stairsparticularly my knees anyone my size is prone to that kind of thing but there was nothing to be done about it so i ignored the pain and went on lilys fiery butterfly keeping pace with me and lighting my way i had longer legs and i caught charity as she neared the top of the staircase molly screamed again pure terror and anguish and pain and her voice was very near im coming baby charity gasped panting she was in great shape but no ones exercise program includes running up several hundred feet of spiral stairs in full mail and helmet carrying a bigass hammer and a sword her legs had slowed and she staggered a little when she reached the top stair and found herself in a short level lowceilinged hall leading a few feet to another open archway the cold light of winter night moonlight on snow shone in through the arch i managed to snag her arm and check her advance just as a heavy door slammed to cover the archway with toothrattling force if i hadnt delayed her it would have hit her like a speeding truck she recovered her balance and while she did we heard a heavy bolt slide shut on the door charity shoved a hand at the door which remained fixed she kicked a booted foot at it and failed to so much as rattle it in its frame molly screamed again still close though muffled by the closed door her cry was weaker shorter molly charity screamed i thrust the spread fingers of my left hand against the door and was instantly aware of the energy flowing through it binding it giving it strength beyond reason to resist being opened i looked for a weakness a soft spot in the adamant magic supporting the door but there was none the ward on the door was simply put flawless it spread through the doors substance as coldly and beautifully as crystals of ice forming on a window the magic of winter drawn up from the heart of the land there was no way for me to unravel the subtle complex faerie magic but then it was faerie magic i didnt have to be subtle to counter it charity i snapped its faerie make the hammer she shot me a glance of comprehension and nodded clear the door i hurried back leaving her room to swing please charity whispered as she planted her feet and drew back the weapon please father please charity closed her eyes and took a deep breath focusing her concentration on delivering the most powerful blow she possibly could in the confines of the hallway then she swung the weapon back golfclub style cried out and swung stepping forward maybe charity was way more buff than i thought maybe that particular ward had a particular weakness to cold iron maybe it had nothing to do with magic and charity had somehow tapped into the strength available to all mothers when their young are endangered hell maybe god was on her side whatever happened that siege door of adamant ice and malevolent obdurate magic screamed and shattered at the blow from her hammer shattered like delicate glass shattered into pieces no larger than grains of sand the whole tower rang with the power of the blow the very black ice it was made of seeming to shriek and groan the floor literally shook and i had to crouch to keep from taking a tumble back down the stairs i heard charity choke down a cry of pain she had broken the door before us but the spells running through it had backlashed against the hammer and it too had shattered a flying piece of fractured metal had cut across her hip and lodged in one of the rings of her mail it glowed redhot and she frantically slapped it away even as it burned her other pieces of shrapnel from the hammer had struck the walls of the tower burning their way into the black ice sending a network of cracks of greenwhite light all through the tower around us like some sort of bizarre infection black ice melted away from the redhot steel the tower rumbled again like some vast agonized beast charily dropped the handle of the hammer i could see that her right arm hung limp and useless but it didnt stop her from making an awkward lefthanded draw of the sword at her hip i slipped up beside her staff held ready in both hands and we stepped out onto the parapet of the tower of arctis tor together the parapet was enormous a hundred feet across twice as wide as the spire beneath us it was a garden of sorts a garden of ice ice covered the parapet somehow formed into ghostly trees and flowers there were seats here and there in the garden and they too were made of ice a frozen fountain stood silent at the center of the parapet a bare trickle of water sliding from the top of a statue so coated in layers and layers of ice that one could not readily identify its particulars replica rose vines and thorns spread all around the place all ice all cold and beautiful upon the branch of a tree perched a cardinal its bloodred feathers brilliant though the bird itself was utterly still i peered a bit closer and saw that it was covered in a layer of transparent ice frozen into a sculpture every bit as much as the rest of the place not far from it a spiders web spread between some tree branches the spider at its center also transformed into ice sculpture a swift look around showed me more beings entombed in ice and i realized that this place was not a garden it was a prison next to the fountain sat a lovely young girl in a byzantine gown hand entwined with that of a young man in similar historic costume not far from them three females of the sidhe mabs kindred the nobility of faerie kind stood backtoback their shoulders touching in a triangle the three looked so much alike that they might have been sisters and they each held hands with the others expressions of determination and fear frozen onto their faces the ice sculpture of a thick deadlooking tree held a dead naked man upon it crucified on its branches as a grotesque work of art bonds of ice held him there transparent enough to let me see the blackened flesh of his hands and feet the gangrenous darkness spreading upward through the veins of his arms and legs his hair was long unwashed and fell over his face as he hung limp within his bonds his body coated with layers of crystalline frost molly sat at the base of the same tree her artfully shredded clothes had been shredded in truth and they hung from her as loose rags her cottoncandy hair hung in a limp mass uncombed and tangled she shuddered with cold and her eyes stared at nothing her expression was twisted as if in effort her mouth open it took me a minute to realize that she had never stopped screaming shed damaged her throat and no sound would emerge but that didnt stop her from trying charity shifted her weight to hurry forward but i cautioned her wait well do her no good if were dead she clenched her jaw but heeded me and we paused for a moment while i swept my gaze over the rest of the parapet some movement in the shadows behind the crucifixion tree drew my eye and i reached back for the handle of my blasting rod sticking out of my nylon backpack i drew the magical tool and primed it with an effort of will redwhite fire suddenly glowed at its tip there behind the tree i said a deep voice let out a rasping chuckle then from the darkness i couldnt quite see into the scarecrow appeared this thing was no fetch no changer of form and image and illusion there was no shadowy mask over an amorphous form no glamour altering its appearance which my salve would have enabled me to see through this thing was a whole independent creature unless maybe it was a fetch so old and strong that it could transform itself into the scarecrow in truth and not simply in seeming red flame glittered in the carvedpumpkin head its limbs all long tough vines as thick as my wrists were clothed in ragged tatters of black that looked more like a funeral robe than a farmers castoffs its long arms trailed almost to the ground and one of them was stretched over to molly at the end of the arm the vines tapered into dozens of slender flexible tendrils and die scarecrow had them wrapped around mollys throat and sliding up into her hair we stood in silence facing one another for a while wind moaned somewhere overhead not far above the parapet the sounds of hissing and screaming fetches drifted up as if from a great distance thomas and murphy still held the door i took several steps to one side and gave the scarecrow a little smile hi i said who the hell are you one who has served the queen of air and darkness since before your kind can remember he replied one who has destroyed hundreds like you you know what captain kudzu i asked im not here to play guessing games with you give me the girl the bizarre creatures face twisted in what might been amusement or what follows i wasnt absolutely certain the thing was quoting shakespeare but that didnt mean i couldnt do it bloody constraint i told him for should you try to hide the girl from me even in your heart there shall i rake for her maybe the scarecrow wasnt a shakespeare fan its eyes flared with angry scarlet light little man move an inch closer and i will crush her soft little neck inadvisable i said and raised my blasting rod to level it at the scarecrow because shes the only thing keeping you alive right now i fear you not wizard the scarecrow said the creature narrowed its eyes focusing upon me intentlyperhaps preparing the same defense that had shed my spells in our first encounter bring your fire if you think it may survive the heart of winter it will avail you against me this time no more than last you think id show up for round two without being prepared to finish what i started i asked him i sidled a couple of more steps to one side the council is already on the way here i said im here to make you an offer before things fall apart give me the girl and your word not to go near her again and i let you live the scarecrow let out a laugh of pure scorn i shall enjoy killing you mortal i prowled a few steps more and planted my feet then brandished my staff and rod the scarecrow crouched in response eyes burning even brighter i had to be careful if i spooked him too much hed kill molly as a prelude to closing with me you know what your problem is i asked him he stared at me for a blank second of incomprehension what i showed my teeth in a wolfish smile you underestimate people while id drawn the scarecrows attention and eye charity had slipped around behind it silent as a puff of smoke as i spoke she lifted her sword and swept it down at the appendage holding her daughter the steel blade hissed and flashed and seared its way through the limb holding molly the scarecrow reared its head back in a sudden howl of rage mollys body bucked in panic as the severed limbs contracted on her throat i lifted my staff and snarled forzare unseen force lashed out caught up molly as gently as i could manage it and flipped her tail over teakettle away from the creature no sooner had i moved her than its stumpy arm swung down to smash into the ground where the girl had been sitting the scarecrow turned to grab at molly but charity stepped into its path cold steel gleaming her eyes harder and colder than the black ice of arctis tor she faced the thing squarely and snarled you will never touch my daughter again the creature roared in fury and rushed charity i whipped up my blasting rod and snarled fuego a lance of flame as thick as my wrist lashed out from the tip of the rodand died two feet away from it the burning energy of the magical strike swallowed by an unfathomable ocean of cold cold power i had hoped that i could get in a shot while the scarecrow was distracted but i had already decided on what to try next if i couldnt i stuck the blasting rod through my belt whipped my staff up to point the tip at the ground beneath the scarecrows feet and shouted forzare invisible force lashed out and struck the black ice under the scarecrow like a mortar round it threw the creature ten feet into the air spinning end over end deadly chips of black ice flew as the spells energy roared out of me i staggered and almost lost my balance my vision tunneled for a second or two out of pure exhaustion id been pushing too hard for too long with no rest the magic id been using had drained my reserves entirely the human body has limits that cannot be circumvented and i had reached mine charity rushed forward before the scarecrow could rise her sword hacked down at it in elemental brutality and the scarecrows blood and woodlike flesh sizzled on her blade but she didnt kill it the scarecrow regained its feet and lashed an arm at charity she swung her sword to meet it cold iron bit into faerie flesh drawing forth another explosion of brilliant liquid flame the creature screamed a sound louder than any living thing id ever heard and its backswing slammed into charitys limp right arm the impact tore a grunt of pain from her and flung her several feet through the air but the scarecrow paid for it coming into contact with charitys mail burned it again and its furious howls redoubled it lifted a foot to stomp down on the helplessly writhing molly to flatten her like an aluminum can it was the kind of thing that draws suicidal levels of chivalry from me i ran for the scarecrow ditching my blasting rod on the way i took my staff in both hands slammed it down like a polevaulter and launched myself into the air both feet aimed at the scarecrows back i hit the thing with considerable force but id been too tired to manage it as precisely as i wished the blow only staggered the creature and i bounced off it and flopped onto the icy surface of the parapet i had bought time enough though for charity to regain her feet and charge forward with her blade diverting the scarecrows attention from her daughter before i could regain my feet the scarecrow snapped a foot at me in a clumsy unbalanced kick it landed with only a fraction of the force it might have had even so that was enough to send me sprawling ten feet away and maybe crack one of my ribs pain washed through me and i suddenly couldnt get my lungs to take in enough air the scarecrow stretched out an arm toward charity and ropylooking vines shot from the ends of his arms flickered across the ten feet between them like lightning and wrapped her sword arms wrist the tendrils tightened the scarecrow shook charity violently she screamed and the sword tumbled from her fingers more vines wrapped around her throat and the creature simply hauled her up into the air its wounds were already closing rebuilding themselves it seized molly in its other hand and lifted her as well holding the pair of them facetoface there was a malicious eagerness in the creatures stance see it murmured to the fruitlessly struggling charity look at her watch your daughter die charitys eyes widened with terror her face turned dark red molly meanwhile simply lay limp her own face darkening as she was strangled not long now the scarecrow purred there is nothing you can do to help her mortal woman nothing you can do to stop me it was a fetch i was sure of it a creature who had been given talent or power enough to exceed its former status to become the embodiment of the icon of fear mortals called the scarecrow to draw power from that imagepower enough to block out my strongest magic that was why it tormented both molly and her motherto feed on their terror i stared at it dully while my mind ran through the logic tree and my lungs kept trying to get in a deep breath i searched through myself for energy enough to do something anything to help i didnt have it in me i lay there on my side too exhausted to feel fear too exhausted to feel hate too exhausted to feel anger it was all that i could do to keep from lowering my head and going to sleep and without will or emotion to fuel my spells i might as well have been one more frozen sculpture in mabs prison garden charitys heels began to kick frantically uselessly the scarecrow went on purring and i thought i could actually see the damned thing grow a couple of inches taller lilys incendiary butterfly fluttered around my head obscuring my view for a second and i suddenly got it a sluggish hope surged up in me the fetch drew its power from fear and i had none i was just too tired for it that was why i had thrashed the fetch at the hotel so badly not two minutes before i faced it i had gathered up my fear and hurled it out on that decoy spell when i faced the thing in the darkened hallway id been nothing but angry without my fear to play on the fetch could not disrupt my magic and i had batted him around like a softball similarly when i decapitated the buckyfetch i had been feeling no fear it all happened too fast id reacted on pure reflex before any pesky thoughts or emotions could weigh in on the matter thered been no time to be afraid and id struck the fetch down i would never have realized the weakness in the fetches defenses had i not pushed myself to my limits the only thing i had to fear was fear itself i suddenly knew i could take this chump out if only i had enough power left for one more spell id done it twice third times the charm the butterfly danced wildly in the air in front of me i stared at it for a second realization dawning and then i burst out into weak laughter lily you manipulative deceitful wonderful girl i held open my left palm and the butterfly alighted on it its light flashed brighter for a second and then my will touched it lightly it fell apart into glowing threads that settled down on my scarred palm and rushed into my spirit pure flame filled me the joyous heat of full summer and i exalted in the sudden overflowing life of it it met the tiny spark of hope still glowing within me and the two multiplied power unfolding and expanding inside me i found myself on my feet arms spread to my sides face turned up toward the enormous silver moon sunlight seemed to spill from me to wreathe me in dancing fires that blazed their defiance of winter arctis tor itself the fortress of black ice groaned in protest at the intensity of the light i looked down to find the creature staring at me in utter shock its tendrilfingers had gone loose and molly and charity lay moving weakly at its feet you cannot do that the fetch said in a shocked tone you it is not possible i flicked out a hand whispered a word and my blasting rod flew from the ground where id dropped it and into my hand its carvings bursting into light as the blazing heat of a thousand julys welled up ready to fly free you like movie villains do you i lifted the blasting rod while summer fire flickered around my outstretched arm i peeled my lips back from my teeth and purred have you seen this one the carvings along the rod flooded with a blaze of scarletandgolden light how about a little fire scarecrow chapter thirtynine the scarecrow let out an earsplitting trilling chirp like a summer locust on steroids and it bounded to one side in an effort to keep the mounded ice of the fountain between us id already seen how fast a fetch could move and didnt bother with a snap shot instead i let it distance itself from molly and charity until it reached cover behind the fountains ice and stopped moving then i blew twothirds of that dome away in a single blast of light thunder and fire the golden summer flame hammered straight through the ice and into the scarecrow the old fetch was taken off guard and the lance of fire incinerated what would have been a hip and thigh on a human being it bellowed a metallic roar of pain and anger bounced off one of the white marble statues of the three sisters and was forced to seize hold of one of the statues ankles to keep from bouncing over the edge of the parapet but the scarecrow wasnt the only faerie who cried out without warning a hurricane of sound slammed into me painfully intense once more arctis tor shuddered the black ice trembling and heaving while deep almost subsonic groans echoed through the fortress the other fetches screams arose from below a frenzied chorus of berserk rage the heaving ground and the sonic sledgehammer tossed me into a bank of icesculpted rose vines with thorns three times as long as their flowers the ice was not brittle and it didnt break as my weight hit it i felt a sharp pain from my ankle a thorn stabbing underneath the hem of my duster but the spellworked coat protected me from further harm i was on my feet again in a second readying another blast but in that second the scarecrow had reversed its course with eerie agility it headed for charity and molly running on all three of its limbs like a wounded spider awkward but still swift this time i couldnt afford to take my time about lining up the shot i flicked a lash of fire between the scarecrow and the carpenter women but it sidestepped and i only burned a few looseend tendrils from its vinebody the scarecrow hurtled toward molly charity lay perfectly still beside her sprawled on the black ice but only until the scarecrow came within reach of her sword then charity rolled and popped up into a low slashing lunge her sword seared its way through the scarecrows undamaged leg slicing it off at an angle that began at midthigh and finished just above the knee it frantically rolled again struggling to get out of sword range charity pressed ruthlessly too close to the damned fetch to let me blast it again the scarecrow hopped and skittered on its remaining limbs heading for the edge of the parapet charity i shouted down michaels wife dropped out of my line of fire in an instant the fetch shimmered body contorting weirdly and leapt on the way it changed membranous wings unfurled from its body and beat powerfully down and within a heartbeat the rest of the fetchs body had conformed to the shape of one of the monstrous hangglidersized bats id seen in faerie once before it hurtled away wings thrashing to gain altitude and the faerie moon shone down in lunatic glee i had a perfect shot once more i called upon the fire of summer id taken in i could feel its intensity beginning to ebb but if the fetch managed to slip away i might never have such an opportunity again besides that creature had tormented my friends wife and daughter nearly murdered them right in front of my eyes and now it was going to answer for it so i unleashed the fire again this time so brilliant that it lit dark mountainsides five or ten miles away so hot that the blowing snow hissed into instant steam in the wake of the flame when it struck the fetch it detonated into a blinding conflagration an explosion that roared so loudly that it shattered every icy replica of a rose vine upon the parapet what tumbled burning from the faerie skies toward the merciless mountains below could not have been identified as anything in particular it trailed sparks soot and ash and when it slammed into a granite cliff side it hit with such force that an icy rockslide was jarred loose from the mountains slope burying the fetch under incalculable tons of stone i shook my staff at the rockslide in a primal gesture of triumph and shouted whos next the courtyard below become completely silent for a second and then i could see fetches too dark to make out clearly darting away from the base of the spire retreating from the fight harry charity said her voice strained i hadnt realized it when charity had gotten her head down but shed dropped into a baseball players slide thanks to all the fire id been pitching around the black ice had become slick with a thin layer of meltwater and her momentum was carrying her with slow dreamy smoothness toward the parapets edge i turned to run toward her and then used an ounce of brainpower to deduce that id only be duplicating the behavior that got charity into the mess to begin with instead i dropped to all fours crawling forward with my staff extended her ankles were over the edge by the time i got close enough to reach her she was able to get her fingers around the end of the wizards staff and i locked onto the other end halting her slide i then began to move backward very slowly very carefully the black ice of the parapet hardened once more in a moment as though it had never thawed and i pulled charity carefully away from an involuntary education in skydiving once she was clear we both turned to look at molly the girl lay quietly still breathing i rolled onto my back until i could get my breath again charity rose and went to her daughter i didnt follow her it wasnt the kind of moment shed appreciate me sharing i watched and kept an eye out for trouble charity knelt down beside the young woman and gathered her into her arms as she might have a smaller child charity held molly against herself and rocked gently her lips murmuring steadily as she did so for a moment i thought that the terror and trauma had driven molly too far away to return but then she shuddered blinked her eyes open and began to weep quietly leaning against her mother i heard a groan behind me and spun up into a crouch blasting rod ready again the sculpture of the crucified man groaned again though he was still crucified and horribly rotted my fire spells as augmented by lilys extraordinary power had melted the bonds around his left wrist and now his left arm flopped bonelessly in the steady howling wind i had never seen human flesh so badly mangled his fingers wrists and forearms had long since succumbed to frostbite the blood gone poisonous as it flowed through them causing the flesh to swell grotesquely despite that i could see that the skin of his entire arm was covered in layers of scars burn scars knife scars scars from flesh torn by blunt force and left to heal incorrectly ive taken a few hits myself but that poor bastards arm had suffered more than my whole body almost against my will i walked over to the tree the mans hair hung like spanish moss over his bowed face some of it light brown some of it dark grey some of it gone brittle and white i reached out and brushed the hair back from the mans face lifting his head toward me a little his beard was as long and disgusting as his hair his face had been ravaged somehow and i got the unsettling impression that his expressions had so contorted and stretched his face that they had inflicted their own kind of damage though there were no scars as on his arm his eyes were open but completely white and unseeing i recognized him lloyd slate i murmured the winter knight the last time id seen slate had been after the battle on the hill of the stone table a place that served as the ok corral for the faerie courts when they decided to engage in diplomacy by means of murdering anyone on the other team slate had been a firstrank menace to society a drug addict a rapist a man with no compunctions about indulging himself at the expense of others by the end of the battle he had killed a young woman who might have become a friend he stirred and let out a small whimper who is there dresden i replied slates mouth dropped open and a maniacal little giggle bubbled under his reply youre here thank god youre here ive been here so long he tilted his head to one side exposing his carotid artery free me do it quickly free you i asked from this slate sobbed voice breaking from this nightmare kill me kill me kill me thank god dresden kill me the seedier neighborhoods of my soul would have been happy to oblige him but some dark hard part of me wanted to see what else i could think of to make him suffer more i just stared at him for a while considering options after perhaps ten minutes he dropped unconscious again from somewhere to my right a delicious voice at once rough and silky purred you do not understand his true torment i turned to face the frozen fountain well the remains of it anyway maybe a third of the ice mound remained but it had partially uncovered the statue withinno statue at all but a member of the sidhe a tall inhumanly lovely woman her appearance one of nigh perfection or it would have been so in other circumstances now partially free from the encasing ice her scarlet hair clung lumpily to her skull her eyes were deeply sunken and burned too bright as though she had a fever she stood calmly one leg her head one shoulder and one arm now emerging from the ice which was otherwise her only garment there was an eerie serenity to her as though she felt no discomfort physical or otherwise at her imprisonment she seemed to regard the entire matter with amused tolerance as though such trivial conditions were hardly worthy of her attention she was one of the oldest and most powerful sidhe in the winter court the leanansidhe and she was also my godmother lea i breathed quietly hells bells what happened to you mab she said last halloween i murmured she said that you had been imprisoned shes kept you here in that obviously something extremely unsettling glittered in her eyes you do not understand his true torment i glanced from her to the winter knight uh what slate she purred and flicked her eyes in his direction she was unable to move her head for the ice about it there is pain of course but anyone can inflict pain accidents inflict pain pain is the natural order of the universe and so it is hardly a tool mete for the queen of air and darkness she tortures him with kindness i frowned at slate for a moment and then grimaced imagining it she leaves him hung up like that and then she comes and saves him from it my godmother smiled a purring sound accompanying the expression she heals his wounds and takes his pain she restores his sight and the first thing his eyes see is the face of she who delivers him from agony she cares for him with her own hands warms him feeds him cleans away the filth and then she takes him to her bower poor man he knows that when he wakes he will hang blind upon the tree againand can do naught else but long for her return i shook my head you think hes going to fall for that i said fall in love with her lea smiled love she murmured perhaps and perhaps not but need oh yes you underestimate the simple things my godchild her eyes glittered being given food and warmth being touched being cleaned and cared forand desired over and over spinning him through agony and ecstasy the mortal mind breaks down not all at once but slowly the way water will wear down stone her madly glittering eyes focused on me and her tone took on a note of warning it is a slow seduction a conversion by the smallest steps the skin on my left palm itched intensely for a moment in the living skin of the lasciel sigil yes lea hissed mab you see is patient she has time and when the last walls of his mind have fallen and he looks forward with joy to his return to the tree she will have destroyed him and he will be discarded he only lives so long as he resists she closed her eyes for a moment and said this is wisdom you should retain my child lea i said what has happened to you how long have you been a sidhesicle some of the strength seemed to ebb from her and she suddenly seemed exhausted i grew too arrogant with the power i held i thought i could overcome what stalks us all foolish milady queen mab taught me the error of my ways shes had you locked up in your own private iceberg for more than a year i shook my head godmother you look like you fell out of a crazy tree and hit every branch on the way down her eyes opened again glittering and unsettling as hell and she laughed it was a quiet low soundand it sounded nothing like the laugh of the deadly sidhe sorceress id known since before i could drive crazy tree she murmured and her eyes closed again yes i heard heavy thumping steps on the staircase and thomas came sprinting onto the parapet faebloodied sword still in hand harry here i said and waved an arm at him he glanced at charity and molly and hurried over to me a little lump of fear knotted itself in my guts wheres murphy relax he said shes downstairs guarding the door is the girl all right i pitched my voice low shes breathing but im more worried about damage to her mind shes crying at least thats actually a good sign whats up we need to go thomas said now why somethings coming something usually is i said what do you mean he gritted his teeth and shook his head since last year since the erlking ive had intuitions maybe maybe just instincts i can feel things in the air better now than before i think the wild hunt is coming toward us i think a lot of things are coming toward us no sooner had he said it than i heard blended with the distant cry of the wind a long mournful somehow hungry horn call i stepped up onto the edge of the fountain and peered out into the moonlit night i couldnt make out anything very clearly but for an instant far in the distance i saw the gleam of moonlight on one of the odd metals that faeries used to make their weapons and armor another horn rang out this one more a droning enormous basso only the second horn came from the opposite side from the first over the next few seconds more horns joined in and drums and then a rising tide of monstrous shrieks and bellows all around us now in the mountains east of arctis tor one of the snowcapped peaks was abruptly devoured by a rising black cloud that hid everything beneath it a quick check around showed me several other peaks being blanketed in shadow horn calls and cries grew louder and continuously more numerous stars and stones i breathed i shot a glance at my godmother and said the power i used here that is what caused this isnt it of course lea said holy crap thomas blurted jumping like a startled cat when what he must have thought was another statue moved and spoke thomas this is my godmother lea i said lea th i know who he is my godmother murmured i know what he is i know whose he is her eyes moved back to me you summoned forth the power of summer here in arctis tor in the heart of all winter when you did so those of winter felt the agony of it and now they come to slay you or drive you forth i swallowed uh how many of them the mad gleam returned to her eyes why all of winter child all of us crap charity i called were leaving charity nodded and rose supporting molly though the girl was at least mobile if shed remained unaware and walled away from the world it would have been a real pain to get her all the way back down the tower molly and her mom hit the stairs thomas i said see if you can chop off some of this ice without hurting her thomas licked his lips is that a good idea isnt this the one who tried to turn you into a dog a hound lea murmured glittering eyes flicking back and forth at random quite different she was a friend of moms i told thomas quietly so was my dad thomas said and look how that turned out then give me the sword and ill do it myself im not leaving her lea made a sudden choking sound i frowned at her her eyes bugged out and her face contorted with apparent pain her mouth moved lush lips writhing twisting a bestial grunt jerked out of her throat every second or two the fingers of her freed hand arched into a claw then she suddenly sagged and when she turned her eyes back to me they were my godmothers again one part lust one part cool feline indifference one part merciless predator child she said her voice was weak you must not free me i stared at her feeling confused why she gritted her teeth and said i cannot yet be trusted it is not time i would not be able to fulfill my promise to your mother should you free me now you must leave trusted i asked no time she said voice strained again i cannot long keep it from taking hold of she shuddered and lowered her head she lifted her face to me a few seconds later and the madness had returned to her eyes wait she rasped i have reconsidered free me i traded a look with thomas and we both took a cautious step backward leas face twisted up with rage and she let out a howl that shook icicles from their positions release me what the hell is going on here thomas asked me uh i told him ill get back to you after we get out of dodge thomas nodded and we both hurried toward the stairs i glanced back over my shoulder once the fountain was already building itself up again freezing water to ice a thin sheet of it already covered my godmother i shuddered and looked away directly at the delirious lloyd slate my footsteps quickened even more and then just as i was leaving only for an instant i thought i saw one more thing the triangle of statues of sidhe noblewomen caught a stray beam of moonlight while thin clouds made it jump and shift in that uncertain light i saw one of the statues move it turned its head toward me as i left and the white marble of its eyes was suddenly suffused with emerald green the same color as mabs eyes not just the same color mabs eyes the statue winked at me the sounds of the approaching fae grew even louder reminding me that i had no time to investigate so i shivered and hurried down the stairs beside thomas leaving the parapet and its prisoners andperhapsits mistress behind me i had to focus on getting us back to lilys rift in one piece so i forced all such questions from my mind for the time being the four of us were slogging through snow up to my knees a few moments later while i spent the last reserves of power id taken from lilys butterfly to keep us from going into hypothermia i took the lead and ran for the rift as a nightmarish symphony of wails and horns and howls closed in all around us chapter forty shielded by the good graces of summer we fled arctis tor the winds outside howled louder kicking up increasingly intense clouds of mist snow and ice beyond the wind still vague but growing slowly more clear and immediate i could hear the cries of things that thrived in the dark and the cold i heard drums and horns wild and savage and inspiring the kind of terror that has nothing to do with thought and everything to do with instinct i heard the cry of the erlkings personal horn unmistakable for any other such instrument i traded a quick glance with thomas who grimaced at me keep moving he called duh i grunted immediately behind me murphy panted what was that about erlking i told her bigtime bad guy wants to eat me why she asked well i met him i said ag murph said even with her labored breathing the nonword managed to be dry last october yeah he thinks i insulted him youre never mouthy harry must have been someone who looks like you she grimaced and clutched at her belt her balance wavering there was a long open slice in the tough leather where a claw or blade had nearly struck home the belt gave way and the oversized mail she wore flopped down binding her legs almost tripping her dammit hold up i called before murphy could fall down and we all staggered to a halt molly all but dropped into the snow we cant stand around like this thomas called charity murph weve got to travel as light as we can ditch the armor i ripped off my duster and wriggled like an eel to get out of my own mail then i tossed it at thomas hey he said and scowled dont leave it on the ground i said thomas carry it what he demanded why youre strong enough that it wont slow you down i said and got my coat back on and we dont dare leave this much iron lying on the ground here why not i saw murphy get out of her gear and turn to support molly so charity could too would you want visitors leaving radioactive waste around behind them when they left your place oh he said good point because we wouldnt want to get them mad at us he started rolling the mail into a bundle which he tied into a rough lump with a belt and slung it over his shoulder howls and wails and horn cries grew louder though now all to our flanks and the rear somehow in the gale of snow and wind we had slipped out of the noose the encircling forces had formed around us if we kept moving we stood a real chance of getting away clean this entire field trip isnt what we were meant to think it was i told him weve been used what how later now carry the damn armor and dont leave anything lying behind move the little flutter of summer fire left in me began to waver and for a second the wind gained frozen teeth sharp enough to sink all the way into my vitals move i started slogging through the snow again doing my best to break a path for those coming behind me time went by wind howled the snow slashed at my face and the summer fire sank to low embers that would not last much longer they fluttered and faded at almost the precise moment i sensed a rippling of magical energy nearby and got a whiff of stale popcorn the rift shone in the air thirty yards up the slope things big shaggy things with white fur and long claws emerged from the snows behind us running as lightly over the snow and ice as if it had been a concrete sidewalk thomas i pointed at the oncoming threat murph charity you get the girl out of here move murphy looked back and her eyes widened she immediately ducked under mollys other arm and began to help charity charity staggered for a step then drew the sword from her belt and thrust it into the snow at my feet before redoubling her efforts to get molly over those last few yards i transferred my staff to my left hand and took the deadly iron in my right the last bit of the power lily loaned me played out and i didnt have enough magic left in me to light a candle much less throw around fire or even use my shield this was going to be about steel and speed and skill now purely physical which meant that i probably would have gotten myself quickly killed if charity hadnt thought fast and armed me with iron as things stood my brother and i only needed to hold the oncoming yetilooking things off until the ladies escaped we didnt have to actually beat them what are those things thomas asked me some kind of ogre i told him hit them hard and fast scare them with iron as much as we can as fast as we can if we can get them to come at us cautiously we might be able to pull off a fighting retreat back up the slope got it thomas said and then when the first of the snow ogres was maybe thirty feet away my brother took two steps and bounded into the air the top of his jump was about ten feet off the snow and when he came down he held the saber in both hands the iron weapon sliced cleanly through the ogres breastbone and filleted the monster splitting him open like a steaming baked potato its faerie blood took flame purple and deep blue and gouted in a blaze of streaming energy but thomas wasnt done there the next ogre threw a rock the size of a volleyball at him thomas whirled dodged it faked to one side and then cut across the second ogres thighs sending it howling to the ground the third ogre hit him with a small tree trunk baseball style and turned my brother into a line drive that missed slamming into me by six inches the ogres howled in fresh aggression and charged im not a terribly skilled swordsman i mean sure more so than ninetynine percent of the people on the planet but among those who know anything about it i dont rate well to make matters worse my experience was largely in fencingfighting with a style that uses long thin blades a lot of thrusting a lot of lunging charitys sword would have been at home on the set of conan the barbarian and i had only a basic understanding of using the heavier slashing weapon i have two advantages as fencer first im quick especially for a guy my size as long as something isnt superhumanly fast i dont get massively outclassed second i have really long arms and legs and my lunge could hit a target from a county away so i played to my strengths i let out a howl of my own to match the ogres and when the one with the club drew near and swept it up over his head in a windup i lunged low and quick and drove about a foot of cold steel into its danglies i twisted the blade and rolled out to one side as i withdrew it the club came down on the snow where id been fire fountained from the ogres pelvic region the ogre screamed and ran around in a panicked agony and the ogres coming behind it slowed their steps their charge faltering until the ogre keened and fell over into the snow the fire of cold iron consuming it they stared at their fallen comrade hey i dont care what kind of faerie or mortal or hideous creature you are if youve got danglies and can lose them thats the kind of sight that makes you reconsider the possible genitaliarelated ramifications of your actions real damned quick i bared my teeth at them and ogre blood sizzled on the steel of my borrowed sword never turning from them i started walking back step by slow cautious step tight agony in a fiery band around my ribs reminding me of my injuries i reached thomas a second later and he was just then sitting up hed crashed into a boulder and there was a knot already forming just above one eye he was still too disoriented to stand dammit thomas i growled my left hand wasnt strong enough to grab onto him and haul him up the hill if i used my right the sword would be in my weak hand and i wouldnt be able to defend either one of us get up the ogres began gathering momentum coming for us again thomas i shouted lifting my sword staring at the ogres as my shadow abruptly flickered out over the ground between us wait my shadow did what i had part of a second to realize that a new source of light had cast the flickering shadows and then a bead of intense fire maybe the size of a peanut m ampm flashed over my shoulder and splashed over the chest of the nearest ogre summer fire slammed the ogre to the ground before it could so much as scream and began to rip its flesh from its bones ive got him fix called and i saw him in my peripheral vision sword in hand he got a shoulder under thomass arm and lifted him with more strength than i would have credited the little guy with the ogres charge came to a complete halt i shoved my staff through the belt tying up the bundle of mail thomas had been carrying lifted it awkwardly to my shoulder and we fell back toward the rift never turning our backs on the ogres they hovered at the edge of visibility in the gusting snow but did not menace us again watch your step fix warned me then i felt a rippling sensation around me and then i stepped into an equatorial sauna i found myself on the thin stretch of stage before the screen in pells dingy old theater i stepped to one side just as fix came through with thomas lily stood on the floor facing the rift she looked weary and strained as soon as fix came through she waved a hand as if batting aside an annoying fly there was a rushing sound and then the rift folded in on itself and vanished silence fell on the dimly lit theater lily melted down onto her knees one hand holding her up white hair fallen around her head as she shivered breathing hard the ice and frozen snow that had been coating me gathering in my hair and in the creases of my clothing vanished replaced by the usual residual ectoplasm mmmm thomas observed in a slightly slurred voice slime fix lowered him to the ground and went to lily fix i said did you hear what was happening out there kicked a beehive it sounded like he knelt beside lily providing her his support the castles garrison came out to meet you no i said that was every other winterfae on the map apparently what he demanded i uh kind of threw a bunch of summer fire around mabs playhouse and blew up most of this frozen fountain thing fixs mouth dropped open you what the scarecrow was hiding behind the thing and so i put charitys sword down and waved a hand kablooey fix stared at me as if id gone insane you poured summer fire into winters wellspring i cant sleep well any night i havent inflicted a little property damage i said gravely anyway i did that and all hell broke loose my godmother told me that anybody who was anybody in winter had gotten their vengeance on and was coming to kill me my god fix breathed that would do it all right where did you get summer fire to his voice trailed off and he stared at lily the summer lady looked up her weary smile gorgeous i only provided a minor comfort and guide in order to repay my debt to the lady charity she murmured a small smile on her lips i had no way to know that the wizard would steal that power for his own use she drew in a deep breath and said help me up we must go fix did so go where i said all of those winter forces are now at the heart of their own realm which means that they arent on the borders of summer waiting to attack which means that summer has forces that can be spared to assist the council i said quietly but it only took them a few minutes to show up murphy pointed out couldnt they just run back and be there a few minutes from now no murph i said they planned for that this whole raid was a setup from the get go i jerked my head at lily wasnt it that is one way to describe it lily said quietly i would not myself interpret it that way i had no part in bringing the fetches herebut their presence and their capture of lady charitys daughter presented us with an opportunity to temporarily neutralize the presence of mabs forces upon our borders we i murmured maeve is working with you that was why she showed up at mcanallys so quickly even so lily said bowing her head at me in a nod of what looked like respect fix blinked at lily youre working with maeve she couldnt have altered the flow of time at the heart of winter i said quietly only one of the winter queens could do that fix blinked at lily as if i hadnt spoken maeves working with you lily nodded like us she fears mabs recent madness she turned back to me i provided you with power enough to threaten the wellspring in the hope that you would draw some portion of winter back into its own demesnes once that was done maeve altered the passage of time relative to the mortal realms i arched an eyebrow how long have we been gone it is nearly sunrise of the day after you departed she replied though the passage of time was only altered in the last few moments of your escape maeve will not be able to hold it for long but it will give us time enough to act what if i hadnt realized it in time i asked her what if i hadnt used your fire she smiled at me a little sad you would be dead i suppose i glared at her and my friends with me even so she said please understand the compulsion my queen has laid upon me permitted me few options i could not make explanation of what i had in mind nor could i simply stand by and do nothing while the council was in such desperate need but now you can tell me all about it now we are discussing history she said she inclined her head to me then to charity i am glad lady to see your daughter returned to you charity looked up at her long enough to give her a swift smile and a nod of thanks then she went back to holding her daughter lily i said she arched a brow waiting shed manipulated me turned me into a weapon to use against mab she hadnt exactly lied to me but she had taken an awful gamble with my life worse shed done it with the lives of four of my friends she had good intentions all the way down the line i suppose and she had faced limitations that my instincts told me i still did not fully appreciate or understand but she hadnt dealt with me headon open and honest but then she was a faerie queen in her own right what in the world had ever given me the impression that she would play her cards faceup i sighed thank you for your help i said finally she smiled though the sadness was still in it i have not been as much a friend to you and yours as you have been to me and mine wizard i am glad that i was able to lend you some help she bowed to me from the waist this time and now i must take my leave and set things in motion to help your people i returned the bow thank you she bowed again to the company and fix echoed her then they walked swiftly from the theater i dropped onto my ass at the edge of the stage my feet waving murphy joined me after a moment she said what now i rubbed at my eyes holy ground i think i dont think were going to have any immediate fallout from this but theres no sense in taking chances now well get back to forthill make sure everyone is all right food sleep murphy let out a groan that was almost lustful i like this plan im starving i sat there watching molly and charity and felt a twinge of nerves inside me id been sent to find black magic molly was it shed used her power to renovate someones brain and as benign as her intentions might have been i knew that it hadnt left her unstained i knew better than anybody how much danger molly was still in how dangerous she might now be id saved her from the bad faeries sure but now she faced another infinitely more dangerous threat the white council the wardens the sword it was only a matter of time before someone else managed to trace the black magic back to its source if i didnt bring her before the council someone else would sooner or later even worse if the mindcontrolling magic shed already used had begun to turn upon her to warp her as well she might be a genuine danger to herself and others she could wind up as dangerous and crazy as the kid whose execution had served as a prelude to the past few days if i took her to the council i would probably be responsible for her death if i didnt id be responsible for those she might harm i wished i wasnt so damned tired i might have been able to come up with some options i settled for banishing thoughts of tomorrow for the time being i was whole and alive and sane and so were the people who had stood beside me wed gotten the girl out in one piece her mom was holding her so ferociously that i wondered if i might not have been the catalyst for a reconciliation between the pair of them i might have healed the wounds of their family and that was a damned fine thing to have done i felt a genuine warmth and pride from it id helped to bring mother and daughter back together for tonight that was enough thomas sat down on my other side wincing as he touched the lump on his head harry thomas said remind me why we keep hurling ourselves into this kind of insanity i traded a smile with murphy and said nothing we all three of us watched as charity on the floor in front of the first row of seats clutched her daughter hard against her molly leaned against her with a childs gratefulness need and love she spoke very quietly never opening her eyes mama charity said nothing but she hugged her daughter even more tightly oh thomas said right exactly i said right chapter fortyone father forthill received us in his typical fashion with warmth welcome compassion and food at first thomas was going to remain outside saint marys but i clamped my hand onto the front of his mail and dragged him unceremoniously inside with me he could have gotten loose of course so i knew he didnt really much mind he growled and snapped at me halfheartedly but nodded cautiously to forthill when i introduced him then my brother stepped out into the hall and did his unobtrusivewallhanging act the carpenter kids were sound asleep when we came in but the noise made one of them stir and little harry opened his eyes blinked sleepily then let out a shriek of delight when he saw his mother the sound wakened the other kids and everyone assaulted charity and molly with happy shouts and hugs and kisses i watched the reunion from a chair across the room and dozed sitting up until forthill returned with food there werent chairs enough for everyone and charity wound up sitting on the floor with her back to the wall chomping down sandwiches while her children all tried to remain within touching distance i stuffed my face shamelessly the use of magic the excitement and that final uphill hike through the cold had left my stomach on the verge of implosion survival food i muttered nothing like it murphy leaning against the wall beside me nodded damn right she wiped at her mouth and looked at her watch she tucked the last of her sandwich between her lips and then started resetting the watch while she chewed gone almost exactly twentyfour hours so we did some kind of time travel she asked oh god no i said thats on the list of things one does not do its one of the seven laws of magic maybe she said but however it happened a whole day just went poof thats time travel people are doing that kind of time travel all the time i said we just pulled into the passing lane for a while she finished setting the watch and grimaced all the same i frowned at her you okay she looked up at the children and their mother im going to have one hell of a time explaining where ive been for the past twentyfour hours it isnt as though i can tell my boss that i went time traveling yeah hed never buy it tell him you invaded faerieland to rescue a young woman from a monsterinfested castle of course she said why didnt i think of that i grunted is it going to make trouble for you she frowned for a moment and then said intradepartmental discipline probably they couldnt get me for anything criminal so no jail i blinked jail i was in charge of things remember murphy reminded me i was pushing the line by laying that aside and coming to help you throw in that extra day and she shrugged hells bells i sighed i hadnt realized she shrugged a shoulder how bad is it going to be i asked she frowned depends on a lot of things mostly what greene and rick have to say and how they say it what other cops who were there have to say a couple of those guys are major assholes theyd be glad to make trouble for me like rudolph i said like rudolph i put on my bronx accent you want i should whack em for ya she gave me a quick ghostly smile better let me sleep on that one i nodded but seriously if theres anything i can do just keep your head down for a while you arent exactly well loved all over the department there are some people who resent that i keep hiring you and that they cant tell me to stop because the cases youre on have about a ninety percent likelihood of resolution my effectiveness is irrelevant i thought cops had to have a degree or something these days she snorted i love my job she said but sometimes it feels like it has an unnecessarily high moron factor i nodded agreement what are they going to do this will be my first official fuckup she said if i handle it correctly i dont think theyll fire me but i asked she pushed some hair back from her eyes theyll shove lots of fan counseling and psychological evaluation down my throat i tried to imagine murphy on a therapists couch my brain almost exploded out my ears theyll try every trick they can to convince me to leave she continued and when i dont theyll demote me ill lose si a lead weight landed on the bottom of my stomach murph i said she tried to smile but failed she just looked sickly and strained it isnt anyones fault harry just the nature of the beast it had to be done and id do it again i can live with that her tone was calm relaxed but she was too tired to make it sound genuine murphys command might have been a tricky frustrating ugly one but it was hers shed fought for her rank worked her ass off to get it and then she got shunted into si only instead of accepting banishment to departmental siberia shed worked even harder to throw it back into the faces of the people who had sent her there it isnt fair i growled what is she asked bah one of these days im going to go downtown and summon up a swarm of roaches or something just to watch the suits run out of the building screaming this time her smile was wired a little tight that wont help me are you kidding we could sit outside and take pictures as they came running out and laugh ourselves sick and that helps how laughter is good for you i said nine out of ten standup comedians recommend laughter in the face of intense stupidity she let out a tired quiet chuckle let me sleep on that one too she pushed away from the wall drawing her keys from her pocket ive got an appointment with the spin doctor she said you want a ride home i shook my head few things i want to do first thanks though she nodded and turned to go then she paused harry she said quiedy hmm what i said in the elevator i swallowed yeah i didnt mean it to come out so harsh youre a good man someone im damned proud to call my friend but i care too much about you to lie to you or lead you on its no ones fault i said quietly you had to be honest with me i can live with that one corner of her mouth quirked into a wry half grin what are friends for i sensed a change in tone as she asked the question a very faint interrogative i stood up and put my hand on her shoulder im your friend that wont change karrin ever she nodded blinking several times and for a moment rested her hand on mine then she turned to leave just then thomas poked his head in from the hallway harry karrin you leaving i am she said thomas glanced at me uhhuh think i can bum a ride her car keys rattled sure she said thanks he nodded to me thank you for another field trip harry kind of bland though maybe next time we should bring some coffee or something so we dont yawn ourselves to death beat it before i kick your whining ass i said thomas sneered at me in reply and he and murphy left i ate the rest of my sandwich idly noting that i had reached one of those odd little mental moments where i felt too tired to go to sleep across the room charity and her children had all fallen asleep where she sat on the floor the children all leaning upon their mother and each other like living pillows charity looked exhausted naturally and i could see care lines on her face that id never really noticed before she could be a pain in the ass but she was one gutsy chick her kids were lucky to have a mother like her a lot of moms would say that they would die for their children charity had placed herself squarely in harms way to do exactly that i regarded the kids for a moment mostly very young childrens faces relaxed in sleep children whose world had been founded in something as solid as charitys love for them would be able to do almost anything between her and her husband they could be raising an entire generation of men and women with the same kind of power selflessness and courage im a pessimist of the human condition as a rule but contemplating the future and how the carpenter kids could contribute to it was the kind of thought that gave me hope for us all despite myself of course i suppose someone must once have looked down upon young lucifer and considered what tremendous potential he contained as that unsettling thought went through my head molly shifted herself out from under her mothers arm removed her leg very gently from beneath a little brothers ear and extracted herself from the slumbering dogpile she moved quietly for the exit until she glanced up saw me watching her and froze for half a step youre awake she whispered too tired to sleep i said where are you going she rubbed her hands on her torn skirts and avoided my eyes i what i put them through i thought it would be better if i just left i asked she shrugged a shoulder and didnt lift her eyes it wont work me staying at home why not i asked she shook her head tiredly it just wont not anymore she walked out past me i moved my right hand smoothly gripping her hand at the wrist skintoskin contact that conducted the quivering tingling aura of power of a practitioner of the art up through my arm shed avoided direct contact before though i hadnt had a reason to think she would at the time she froze staring at my face as she felt the same presence of power in my own hand you cant stay because of your magic thats what you mean she swallowed how how did you know im a wizard kid give me some credit she folded her arms beneath her breasts her shoulders hunched i should ggo i stood up yeah you should we need to talk she bit her lip and looked up at me what do you mean i mean youve got some tough choices to make molly youve got the power youre going to have to figure out whether you want to use it or whether youre going to let it use you i gestured with a hand for her to accompany me and walked out slowly we werent going anywhere what was important was the walk she kept pace with me her body language as closed and defensive as you please when did it start for you i asked her quietly she chewed her lip she said nothing maybe i had to give a little to get a little its always like that for people like us something happens almost like its all by itself the first time the magic bubbles over its usually something small and silly my first time i smiled oh man i havent thought about that in a while i mused for a moment thinking it was maybe two weeks before justin adopted me i said i was in school and small all elbows and ears hadnt hit my growth spurt yet and it was spring and we were having this school olympics field day you know and i was entered in the running long jump i grinned man i wanted to win it id lost every other event to a couple of guys who liked to give me a hard time so i ran down the blacktop and jumped as hard as i could yelling the whole time i shook my head must have looked silly but when i shouted and jumped some of the power rolled out of me and threw me about ten feet farther than i should have been able to jump i landed badly of course sprained my wrist but i won this little blue ribbon i still have it back at home molly looked up at me with a little ghost of a smile i cant imagine you being smaller than average everyones little sometime i said were you shy too not as much as i should have been i had this problem where i gave a lot of lip to older kids and teachers and pretty much everyone else who tried to intimidate me whether or not it was for my own good she let out a little giggle that i can believe you i asked gently she shook her head mine is silly too i walked home from school one day about two years ago and it was raining so i ran straight inside it was errands day and i thought mom was gone ah i said let me guess you were still wearing the gothy mcgoth outfit instead of what your mom saw you leave the house in her cheeks flushed pink yes only she wasnt running errands gran had borrowed the van and taken the little ones to get haircuts because mom was sick i was in the living room and i hadnt changed back all i wanted was to sink into the floor so she wouldnt see me what happened molly shrugged i closed my eyes mom came in she sat down on the couch and turned on the tv and never said a word i opened my eyes and she was sitting there three feet away and hadnt even seen me i walked out really quietly and she never even glanced at me i mean at first i thought shed gone crazy or into denial or something but she really hadnt seen me so i snuck back to my room changed clothes and she was none the wiser i lifted my eyebrows impressed wow really yes she peered up at me why your first time out you called up a veil on nothing but instinct thats impressive kid youve got a gift she frowned really absolutely im a full wizard of the white council and i cant do a reliable veil you cant why not i shrugged why are some people wonderful singers even without training and other people cant carry a tune in a bucket its something i just dont have that you do i shook my head its impressive its a rare talent she frowned over that her gaze turning inward for a moment oh bet you got one hell of a headache afterward she nodded yes actually like an icecream headache only two hours long how did you know its a fairly typical form of sensory feedback for improperly channeled energy i said everyone who does magic winds up with one sooner or later i havent read about anything like that is that what you did next you figured out you could become the invisible girl and went and studied books she was quiet for a moment and i thought she was about to close up again but then she said quietly yes i mean i knew how hard my mom would be on me if i was showing interest in that kind of thing so i read books the library and a couple others that i got at barnes and noble barnes and noble i sighed shaking my head you didnt head into any of the local occult shops not then she said but i tried to meet people you know like wiccans and psychics and stuff that was how i met nelson at a martial arts school id heard the teacher knew things but i dont think he did some of nelsons friends were into magic too or thought they were i never saw any of them do anything i grunted what did all those people tell you about magic what didnt they tell me she said everyone thinks magic is something different heh i said yeah and it wasnt like i could just go running around all the time not with school and the little ones to watch and my mom looking over my shoulder so you know mostly books and i practiced you know tried little things little teeny glamours lighting candles but a lot of the things i tried didnt work magic isnt easy i said not even for someone with a strong natural talent takes a lot of practice like anything else i walked quietly for a few steps and then said tell me about the spell you used on rosie and nelson she paused staring at nothing the blood draining from her face i had to she said go on her pretty features were bleak rosie had shed already had a miscarriage because she kept getting high and when she lost the baby she went to the hard stuff heroin i begged her to go into rehab but she was just too far gone i guess but i thought maybe i could help her with magic like you help people hooboy i kept the dismay off my face and nodded for her to continue and one day last week sandra marling and i had a talk and during it she told me how they were discovering that the presence of a very strong source of fear could bypass all kinds of psychological barriers things like addiction that the fear could drive home a lesson reliably and quickly i didnt have much time i had to do it to save rosies child i grunted why do nelson too he was he was using too much he and rosie sort of reinforced each other and i wasnt sure what might happen so i tried the spell out before i used it on her too you tested it on nelson i asked then did the same one on rosie she nodded i had to scare them away from the drugs i sent them both a nightmare stars and stones i muttered a nightmare mollys voice became defensive i had to do something i couldnt just sit there do you have any idea how much you hurt them both i asked hurt them she said apparently bewildered they were fine they werent fine i said quietly but the same spell should have done more or less the same thing to both of them it acted differently on nelson than rosie and then i put two and two together again and said ah now i get it she didnt look up at me nelson was the father i said quietly she shrugged a tear streaked down her cheek they probably didnt even know what they were doing when it happened the pair of them were just she shook her head and fell silent that explains why your spell damaged nelson so much more severely i dont understand i never hurt him i dont think you did it on purpose i waved a hand palm up magic comes from a lot of places but especially from your emotions they influence almost anything you can do you were angry at nelson when you cast the spell contaminated the whole thing with your anger i did not hurt them she said stubbornly i saved their lives i dont think you realize the ramifications i said she spun to me and shrieked i did not hurt them the air suddenly crackled with tension vague unfocused energy centered on the screaming girl there was enough energy to manage something unfortunate and it was clear that the kid wasnt in anything like control of her power i shook my head and swung my left hand in a half circle palm faced out and simply drew in the magical energy her emotions had generated and grounded it into the earth before somebody got hurt a tingle of sensation washed up my arm surprisingly intense her talent was not a modest one i started to snap a reprimand for her carelessness but aborted it before the first word in the first place she was ignorant of what shed done not innocent but not wholly at fault all the same in the second place shed just been through a nightmarish ordeal at the hands of wicked faeries she probably couldnt have controlled her emotions even if she wanted to she stared at me in surprise as the energy she had raised vanished the rage and pain in her stance and expression faded to uncertainty i didnt hurt them she said in a rather small voice i saved them molly you need to know the facts i know youre tired and scared but that doesnt change a damned thing about what you did to them you fucked around with their minds you used magic to enslave them to your will and the fact that you meant well by it doesnt matter at all somewhere inside of them both they know what youve done to them subconsciously theyll try to fight it regain control of their own choices and that struggle is going to tear their psyches to shreds more tears fell from her eyes bbut i went on in a steady voice rosie was better off she might recover from it in a few years but nelson is probably insane already he might not ever make it back and doing it to them has screwed around with your own head not as bad as rosie and nelson but you damaged yourself too itll make it harder for you to control impulses and your magic which makes you a lot more likely to lose control and hurt someone else its a vicious cycle ive seen it in action she shook her head several times no no no no heres another truth i said the white council has seven laws of magic screwing around in other peoples heads breaks one of them when the council finds out what youve done theyll put you on trial and execute you trial sentence and execution wont take an hour she fell silent staring at me crying harder trial she whispered a couple of days ago i watched them execute a kid who had broken the same law her shocked expression could not seem to recover her eyes roamed randomly blurred with tears but i didnt know doesnt matter i said i never meant to hurt anyone ditto she broke out into a halfhysterical sob and clutched at her stomach but but thats not fair what is i said quietly one more hard truth for you im a warden of the council now molly its my job to take you to them she only stared she looked wracked with pain helpless alone god help me she looked like the little girl id first met at michaels house years before i had to remind myself that there was another darker portion of the girl behind those blue eyes the snarling rage the denial they both belonged to the parts of her mind that had been twisted as she twisted others i wished that i hadnt seen flashes of that other self in her because i did not want to follow the chain of consequence that sprang from it molly had broken the laws of magic shed inflicted incalculable harm on others her damaged psyche could collapse on her leaving her insane all of which meant that she was dangerous tickingbomb dangerous it did not matter to the laws that she had meant well she had become exactly the kind of person that the laws of magicand their sentence were created to deal with but when the law fails to protect those it governs its up to someone else to pick up the slackin this case me there was a chance that i could save her life it wasnt an enormous chance but it was probably the best shot she was going to get assuming of course that she was not already too far around the bend i only knew one sure way to find out i stopped in the darkened hall and turned to her molly do you know what a soulgaze is it i read in a book that its when you look into someones eyes you see something about who they are close enough i agreed you ever done it she shook her head the book said it could be dangerous can be i confirmed though probably not for the reasons youd think when you see someone like that molly theres no hiding the truth about who you are you see it all good and bad no specifics usually but you get a damned good idea about what kind of person they are and its for keeps once youve seen it it stays in your head fresh period and when you look at them they get the same look at you she nodded why do you ask id like to gaze on you if youre willing to permit it why i smiled a little though my reflection in a passing window looked mostly sad because i want to help you she turned away as if to start walking again but only swayed in place her torn skirts whispering i dont understand im not going to hurt you kid but i need you to trust me for a little while she nodded biting her lip okay what do i do i stopped and turned to face her she mirrored me this might feel a little weird but it wont last as long as it seems okay she said that lostchild tone still in her voice i met her eyes for a second i thought nothing had happened and then i realized that the soulgaze was already up and running and that it showed me molly standing and facing me as nothing more than she seemed to be but i could see down the hall behind her and the churchs windows held half a dozen different reflections one was an emaciated version of molly as though shed been starved or strung out on hard drugs her eyes aglow with an unpleasant fey light one was her smiling and laughing older and comfortably heavier children surrounding her a third faced me in a grey wardens cloak though a burn scar almost a brand marred the roundness of her left cheek still another reflection was molly as she appeared now though more secure laughter dancing in her eyes another reflection showed her at a desk working but the last the last reflection of molly wasnt the girl oh it looked like molly externally but the eyes gave it away they were flat as a reptiles empty she wore all black including a black collar and her hair had been dyed to match though she looked like molly like a human being she was neither she had become something else entirely something very very bad possibilities i was looking at possibilities there was definitely a strong presence of darkness in the girl but it had not yet gained dominion over her in all the potential images she was a person of powerdifferent kinds of power certainly but she was strong in all of them she was going to wind up with power of her own to use or misuse depending on what choices she made what she needed was a guide someone to show her the ropes to give her the tools she would need to deal with her newfound power and all the baggage that came with it yes that kernel of darkness still burned coldly within her but i could hardly throw stones there yes she had the potential to go astray on an epic scale dont we all i thought of charity and michael mollys parents her family her strength had been forged and founded in theirs they both regarded the use of magic as something suspect at best and if not inherently evil then inherently dangerous their opposition to the power that molly had manifested might turn the strength theyd given their daughter against her if she believed or came to believe that her power was an evil it could push her faster down the lefthand path i knew something of how much michael and charity cared for their daughter but they couldnt help her one thing was certain though and gave me a sense of reassurance molly had not yet indelibly stained herself her future had yet to be written it was worth fighting for the gaze ended and the various images in the windows behind molly vanished the girl herself trembled like a frightened doe staring up at me with her eyes wide and huge my god she whispered i never knew easy i told her sit down until things stop spinning i helped her settle to the floor with her back to the wall and i did the same beside her i rubbed at a spot between my eyebrows that began to twinge what did you see she whispered that youre basically a decent person i told her that you have a lot of potential and that youre in danger danger powers like money kid it isnt easy to handle well and once you start getting it you cant have enough i think youre in danger because youve made a couple of bad choices used your power in ways that you shouldnt keep it up and youll wind up working for the dark side she drew her knees up to her chin and wrapped her arms around her legs did did you get what you needed yeah i said you have a couple of choices to make molly starting with whether or not you want to turn yourself in to the council she rocked back and forth a nervous motion why would i because theyre going to find you sooner or later if that happens if they think youre trying to avoid them theyll probably kill you out of hand but if youre willing to cooperate and face up to what youve done and if someone intercedes on your behalf the council might withhold a death sentence arent you just going to turn me in anyway no i said its about choices molly this one is yours ill respect what you want to do she frowned would you get in trouble with them for that i shrugged not sure they might kill me for being in collusion with an evil wizard her eyebrows lifted really they arent exactly overflowing with tolerance and forgiveness and agape love i told her theyve almost pulled the trigger on me a couple of times theyre dangerous people she shivered youd youd risk that for me yep she frowned chewing that over and if i turn myself in then well explain what happened ill intercede for you if the council accepts that then ill be held responsible for your training and your use of magic she blinked you mean id be your apprentice pretty much i said but you have to understand something it would mean that you agree to accept my leadership if i tell you to do something you do it no questions no delays what i can teach you is no damn game its the power of life and death and theres no room for anyone who doesnt work hard to control it if you go to the council with me youre accepting those terms got it she shivered and nodded next you have to decide what you want to do with your power what are my choices she asked i shrugged youve got the juice to make the white council eventually if thats what you want or you can find something worth supporting with your talents ive heard of a couple of wizards who have made stupid amounts of money with their skills or hell maybe after you learn to control yourself you just set them aside let them fade like your mom did i could never do that last one she said i snorted think about it kid you join up with the wizards now and you wind up in the middle of the war the bad guys wont care that youre young and untrained she chewed on her lip i should talk with my parents shouldnt i i exhaled slowly if you want to you should but youve got to realize that this is going to be your choice you cant let anyone else make it for you she was quiet for a long time then she asked in a very small voice do you really think i could could like join the dark side yeah i said quietly there are plenty of things out there who would be happy to help you along which is why i want to give you a handso that i can steer you away from that type until you know enough to handle them on your own but her face scrunched up i dont want to be a bad guy no one wants it i said most of the bad guys in the real world dont know that they are bad guys you dont get a flashing warning sign that youre about to damn yourself it sneaks up on you when you arent looking but the council theyll see that right that i dont want to be like that i cant guarantee you that theyll believe that and even if they do they might decide to execute you anyway she sat very still i listened to her breathe if i go to the council can my parents come with me no she swallowed will you yes she met my eyes again this time without fear of a soulgaze beginning that ship had sailed tearstained cheeks gleamed and curved into a little smile that could not hide the fear behind it i reached out and put my hand over hers ill promise you this molly i dont intend to let them hurt you period the only way anyone will lay a finger on you is over my dead body which would not be difficult for the council to arrange but there was no sense in mentioning that to the girl her day had been scary enough i think going with me is your best chance to get out of this i continued if you decide that its what you want well sit down with your parents they wont be thrilled with the idea but they cant make the call on this one its yours it has to be or it wont mean anything she nodded and closed her eyes for a moment poor kid she looked so damned young i was fairly sure i had never been that young then she drew in a deep shaking breath and said i want to go to the council chapter fortytwo i talked molly into staying at the church with her family until everyone had gotten some rest and we could talk things out with her mother any sane man would have hopped a bus for las vegas or somewhere rather than wait around and tell charity carpenter he wanted to haul her first baby in front of a gang of powerful wizards for trial and possible execution i found an unused cot and flopped onto it my shins hung off the end of the undersized thing and i didnt care a bit nails clicked in unsteady rhythm on tile and i felt mouses warm silent presence limp carefully to the floor beside my cot i reached out ruffled his ears and laid my hand on the thick ruff of far across his shoulders i was asleep before he settled himself down to sleep beside me i woke up later in the same position id fallen asleep i had a crick in my neck and one hand dangled over the side of the bed it had lost enough circulation to feel numb and floppy and i had to squint over the side of the cot to see that it was still resting on mouses furry back the room was unlit but the door to the hallway was open and afternoonflavored sunlight lit the hall i wanted to go back to sleep but i hauled myself to my feet and stumbled down the hall to the bathroom mouse limping along beside me without complaint i availed myself of indoor plumbing and found myself wishing that they had a shower i made do with a birdbath in the sink and shambled back down to forthills guest room the cots were all but empty nelson slept in one of them faint twitches randomly stirring his limbs his closed eyes rolled back and forth and he had broken into a light sweat nightmares i supposed poor kid i wished i could have helped but realistically there wasnt anything i could do for him molly slept in another cot the motionless black sleep of the truly exhausted charity sat in a chair beside the cot her head tilted back against the wall she snored a little one of her hands rested on mollys hair i regarded them both in silence for a while i thought about writing the whole thing off conjuring up a wistful image of digging a hole getting in and then pulling the hole in after me hey it worked for bugs bunny i should have taken a left turn at albuquerque i sighed to mouse mouse settled down on the floor again and lay on his side holding his injured leg clear of the floor yeah youre right i said im too stupid to be uninvolved no sense in putting off the inevitable so i got up went over to molly and gently shook her shoulder charity woke up when i did blinking disorientation from her eyes molly took a little bit longer but then she took a sharp breath and sat up in bed mirroring her mother yes is everyone all right charity asked as far as i know i told her where are the other kids my mother took them home any word from michael she shook her head we need to talk about something fairly important please and what is that she asked worth waking up for maybe you could get up get some water on your face while i hunt down some coffee we do need to talk momma molly said in a gentle tone she frowned at me for a moment and i thought she was going to argue with me about it then she shook her head and said very well i made it so i raided the small staff kitchen and came away with not only coffee but several bagels and some fresh fruit i left a few bucks on the counter under a saltshaker then went back to molly and charity we sat down to eat our breakfast in the shadowy room i laid it out for charity just as i had for molly black magic charity whispered when i had finished she glanced at molly a faint frown troubling her features i never thought it had gone that far i know momma molly said quietly is what he says true molly nodded oh baby charity sighed she touched mollys hair with one hand how could i not have seen this happening dont beat yourself up over it i told her at least not right now it wont help anyone anger touched her features and she said neither will this nonsense with the white council of course she will not go i dont think you get it i told charity in a quiet voice shes going she can go voluntarily or she can go when the wardens find her but shes going you plan to inform them of what has happened then charity asked her tone gaining frost as it went no i said but that kind of magic leaves a mark there are plenty of things in the nevernever who can sense itand in fact they had already tipped off the council that there was black magic afoot here even if i never say anything else about it its only a matter of time until another warden investigates you dont know that for a fact i kind of do i said and this isnt just about accountability either the things shes done have already left their mark on her if she doesnt get support and training those changes are going to snowball you dont know that charity insisted i kind of do i said louder hells bells charity im trying to protect her by dragging her in front of a kangaroo court of egotistic powermongering tyrants so that they can execute her how is that protecting my child if she goes in voluntarily with me i think i can get her clemency until she has a chance to show them that she is sincere about working with them you think charity said no thats not good enough i clenched my fists in frustration charity the only thing i am sure about is that if molly doesnt come out and if one of the other egotistical powermongering tyrants finds her theyre going to automatically declare her a warlock and execute her to say nothing of what will happen to her if shes on her own its more than likely that shell deserve it by then thats not true charity snapped she is not going to become some sort of monster she is not going to change my god charity i want to help her that isnt why youre doing it she snarled rising youre trying to get her to go with you to save your own skin youre afraid that if they find her they will brand you traitor for not bringing her in and execute you along with her i found myself on my feet as well silence fell heavy and oppressive on the room momma molly said quietly breaking it please tell me what harry has done in the past two days to make you think that he is selfish or cowardly was it when he turned to face the ogres so that we could escape was it when he traded away the obligations the summer lady owed him in order to attempt the rescue charity was shocked silent for a second then her face heated and she said young lady that isnt molly went on smoothly her voice quiet calm displaying neither anger nor disrespectnor weakness or perhaps it was when you were unconscious and no one could have stopped him from simply taking me to turn over to the council and he instead stopped to give me a choice she chewed on her lip for a second you told me everything hes done since i was taken now hes offering to die for me momma what more could you ask of him charitys face reddened further and i thought i saw something like shame on her features she sat down again bowed her head and said nothing the silence stretched her shoulders shook molly slid down to kneel at her mothers feet and hugged her charity hugged back the pair of them rocked slowly back and forth for a moment and though the dim room made it hard to see i was sure they were both crying perhaps youre right charity said after a moment i should not have accused you so mister dresden she squared her shoulders and lifted her head but i will not allow her to go molly looked up very slowly she faced charity lifted her chin a little and said i love you very much momma but this isnt your choice im the one responsible for what i did ill face the consequences of it charity turned her face away from molly a kind of terrible grief and fear making her look for the first time in my memory old molly she whispered father forthill had arrived at some point during the conversation though none of us had noticed him in the doorway his gentle voice was steady your daughter is in the right charity he said shes an adult now in many ways shes taken actions that demand that she accept the responsibilities that accompany them she is my child charity objected she was forthill corrected her if only for a time children are a precious gift but they belong to no one but themselves they are only lent us a little while the priest folded his arms over his chest and leaned against the doorway i think you should consider what has happened charity dresden is perhaps the only one who could have helped you and molly i think it no accident that he became involved in this situation he gave me a whimsical little smile after all he does work in mysterious ways i walked across the floor and lowered myself to one knee before charity i dont know anything about that but for whatever it is worth i promise you i said very quietly i will bring your daughter back from the council safe and well theyll have to kill me to stop me charity looked up at me and i saw a dozen emotions flicker over her features hope fear anger sadness twice she opened her mouth to speak but bit down on the words before she uttered them finally she whispered i have your word on it you do i said she stared at me for a moment then she looked up and said to forthill i wish michael was here forthill asked her if he was what do you think he would say her eyes moved back to me and she said frowning faintly to have faith to trust the wizard that he is a good man the priest nodded i think he would say that too charity glanced at me without meeting my eyes how long will it take ill contact the council today depends on who is available but this kind of thing gets high priority tomorrow the next day at the latest she bowed her head again and nodded she said to forthill is there nothing we can do mollys made her decision forthill said quietly and everything ive learned about the effects of black magic upon those who use it agrees with what dresden has told you your daughter is in very real danger charity cant the church forthill gave her a faint smile and shook his head there arent many of us still standing sentinel against the shadows of those who do none of us have any real skill with magic we could assist her in turning aside from her gifts but given her age it would in effect be nothing more than imprisonment he nodded to molly and no offense child but with your temperament without your full cooperation it would only push you more quickly toward the darkness no charity said shes got to set this aside molly folded her arms tightly against her stomach and nodded lips pressed together no charity looked up and all but pleaded molly you dont understand what it could do to you the girl was quiet for a moment then she said do you remember the parable of the talents charitys eyes blazed dont you dare attempt to use the scripture to justify this i held up a hand for silence and said i havent read this one forthill said three men were given money by their lord in the amount of fifteen ten and five silver talents the man with fifteen invested the money worked hard and returned thirty talents to his lord the man with ten did the same and returned twenty talents the lord was most pleased but the third man was lazy he buried his five talents in the ground and when he returned them to the lord expecting to be rewarded for keeping them safe his lord was angry he had not given the lazy man the money to be hidden away hed given it to the man so that he could use it and make his lands better stronger and more productive the moral being that to whom much is given much is required oh i said stan lee said it better or at least faster im sorry forthill said spiderman with great power comes great responsibility i said forthill pursed his lips and nodded that is faster i suppose though im skeptical on how it could be worked into a sermon i frowned and glanced at charity she had her head bowed and her hands clenched into fists over and over again another insight about her hit me then charity had been the one given five talents shed had the power and she buried it in the ground my teacher told me something once i heard myself say in a quiet voice that the hardest lesson in life is learning when to do nothing to learn to let go molly laid her head in charitys lap and said you know bad things are out there i have a chance to make a difference i want to help something inside the steely will of michaels wife suddenly broke she gathered molly up into another hug and just held her there while she shivered then charity whispered of course you do youre your fathers child how could you want anything else molly let out a choking little laugh and leaned closer thank you i will pray for you charity said quietly she looked up at me and tried to smile and for you harry chapter fortythree forthill led me to a small cluttered office i was sure was his own he pointed me at the phone and then shut the door giving me privacy before i could ask him for it i sat down on the edge of his desk got the notebook i kept my contact information in from my duster pocket and called up the wardens i did a password and countersign routine with the youngsounding woman who answered the phone after which she asked in accented english what is the nature of your call a report i said ive got a young woman here whos broken one of the laws youve captured a warlock the woman asked she turned herself in full cooperation there are extenuating circumstances around it i want her to have a hearing a hearing the young woman said i heard paper rustling warden im sorry but i dont think we do hearings anymore sure we do i said we just havent had one for ten or twelve years pass word to command and tell them well use the same location sundown tomorrow im tasking warden ramirez with security i dont know the woman hedged she sounded young and uncertain our recent losses to the red court had created openings for a lot of young wizards and they had inherited a hellishly dangerous responsibility from the fallen im not sure if this is appropriate this is how were doing it i told her all you have to do is get word to morgan and luccio tell them what i said understand yes sir she said she sounded almost grateful ill pass word up the line thank you i said and hung up i took a deep breath word was on its way to the wardens and now i was committed there was a knock and then forthill opened the door finished yeah i said thanks of course is there anything else i might do i shook my head youve done more than enough already he smiled a little arguable he said though may i ask you something i nodded the young man he said nelson is he truly pursued i shook my head i dont think so no reason for him to be molly worked a spell on him that forced him to feel fear of drug use he frowned and you think it brought on a sense of paranoia she didnt know how badly her own feelings for him would disrupt the spell she didnt mean to do it but she laid a world of hurt on the boy i shook my head paranoia nightmares phobias and hes feeling the physical withdrawal from the drugs to boot he could be permanently damaged poor lad forthill said i dont know how to begin helping him father i said i paused for a moment then said hes an orphan forthill smiled and took off his spectacles he polished them with a handkerchief you may not know where to begin to help i do dont worry dresden the boy wont be left alone thank you i said i dont do it for you he said but for the boy and from obedience to our lord but youre welcome i put the notebook away and stood up but forthill remained in the doorway his expression direct tell me forthill said he squinted at his glasses making sure they were clean do you believe that youll be able to protect the girl i think so i said quietly i didnt have many friends on the council but the ones i did have were on the senior councilits an executive body especially in wartime theyd support me it wouldnt clear the kid completely but at least she could be placed on a kind of zerotolerance probation rather than executed forthill watched me with patient bright blue eyes you sound familiar with this situation i smiled a little intimately i begin to see he said tell me i said do you really believe what you told charity about me that god arranged for me to be there for molly he regarded me as he replaced his spectacles bright blue eyes steady i do i know that you dont much hold with religion dresden but ive come to know you over the years i think youre a decent man and that god knows his own meaning what i asked he smiled and shook his head meaning mostly that i have faith that all things work together for the good of those who love the lord i meant what i said about you i snorted gently and shook my head harry dresden im on a mission from god seems an awfully unlikely coincidence does it not that the one person michael knows on the council should be the one in the position to best help his daughter just when he was called away i shrugged coincidences happen i said and i dont think gods got me warming up in the bullpen to be one of his champions perhaps not forthill said but i think that you are being prepared nonetheless prepared i asked for what by whom forthill shook his head its an old mans hunch thats all that the things youre facing now are there to prepare you for something greater something more god i said i hope not ive got problems enough without working up to bigger ones he chuckled and nodded perhaps youre right i frowned over a thought padre tell me something why in the world would the almighty send michael off on a mission just when his family most needed him to protect them forthill arched an eyebrow my son he said god knows all things at all times by his very nature his omniscience enables him to know what has happened is happening and will happen though we might not be able to see his reasons or to agree with them from our perspectives they are yet there so what youre saying is that the almighty knows best and we just have to trust him forthill blinked well yes is there any reason that the almighty couldnt do something blatantly obvious poor forthill hed been preparing himself for years for a theological duel with the shadowy wizard dresden and when the moment came i wasnt even giving him a real fight well no what do you mean like maybe the almighty didnt send michael away right when he was needed to protect his daughter maybe he sent michael away because thats exactly what he wanted him to do i let out a short laugh if im wrong it would be one hell of a coincidence i frowned for a moment then said do me a favor go get molly for me council procedure says that i cant leave her alone ive got to keep her with me until its done he rose and nodded agreeable if still slightly baffled very well and i need to know something father do you know where michael is right now forthill shook his head could you get word to him i asked i mean if you really had to he tilted his head frowning and asked why because ive had an idea i said can you get in touch with him forthill smiled chapter fortyfour my mechanics skills bordered on the supernatural he left word with me that the beetle was ready to resume active duty and that while it didnt look like much the car would roll when i pushed the pedalswhich was all i really needed it to do so molly and i rolled up to the lakeside warehouse where id met with the council at the start of this mess when i shut down the engine the beetle rattled and shuddered hard enough to click my teeth together before it died it continued wheezing and clicking for several seconds afterward molly stared out ahead of her her face pale is this the place the rundown old warehouse looked different in the orange evening light than it had at high noon shadows were longer and darker and emphasized the flaws and dents in the building giving the place a much more rundown abandoned appearance than i had remembered there were fewer cars there as well and it gave the place an even more abandoned atmosphere thats the place i said quietly you ready she swallowed sure she said but she looked frightened and very very young what comes next i got out of the car as an answer and molly followed suit i squinted around but no one was in sight until the air shimmered about twenty feet away and ramirez stepped out of the veil that had hidden him carlos ramirez was the youngest wizard ever given the post of regional commander in the wardens he was average height his skin glowing with bronze health and he wore both the grey cloak of the wardens and one of theiror rather our except that i dont have onesilver swords at his left hip at his right he wore a heavy semiautomatic in a holster and his militarystyle web belt also bore several hand grenades good veil i said way better than the other day i wasnt here the other day he assured me with bland confidence your work i asked i make it look easy he said without a trace of modesty its a curse to be so damned talented when im already obscenely goodlooking but i try to soldier on as best i can i laughed and offered him my hand he shook it dresden he said ramirez i nodded to my right this is molly carpenter he glanced at the girl looking her up and down miss he said without a polite bow of his head he glanced at me indicated a direction with his hand and said theyre ready for you but walk with me for a minute i need to talk with you he glanced at molly privately i arched a brow at him molly ill be right back she bit her lip and nodded ookay miss ramirez said with a somewhat apologetic smile i need you to remain exactly where youre standing now all right hells bells i muttered you think shes that dangerous i think its security protocol ramirez said if you didnt want me doing it you shouldnt have asked me i started to snarl an answer but i choked it down and said fine molly just stand there for now i wont go out of sight of you she nodded and i turned with ramirez we walked several paces away over the gravel before he asked that the kid ramirez wasnt old enough to get good car insurance rates himself much less to refer to someone as kid though hed had to grow up awfully swiftly hed been an apprentice when the war with the red court erupted and hed done good service for the council upon attaining status as a full wizard fighting in several nasty engagements with the vampires it was the kind of thing that made a man age in a hurry thats her i confirmed did you get a chance to examine the victims yeah he frowned and watched me for a moment before he said shes someone you know i nodded he glanced back at her crud i frowned at him why i dont think today is going to go well for her ramirez said my stomach suddenly felt cold why not because of how the battle in oregon played out he said once the forces from summer attacked their rear we gave the vamps one hell of a beating morgan got within about twenty feet of the red king himself morgan killed him no but it wasnt for a lack of trying he cut down a duke and a pair of counts before the red king got away damn i said impressed but what does that have to do with molly we had the reds by the balls ramirez said sunrise was coming in the real world and when they tried to retreat into the nevernever the faeries were on them like a school of piranha the reds had to find a way to draw off some of our heavies and they found it luccios boot camp i drew in a breath they attacked luccio and the newbies yeah mccoy listenstowind and martha liberty led a force from the battle to relieve the camp they did huh howd it go he took a deep breath and said they havent reported in yet and that means it means that my support in the senior council isnt here to help me ramirez nodded who has their proxies we didnt hear from you until after they had left so they didnt entrust their proxies to anyone i sighed so the merlin holds them by default and he doesnt much like me hed cast the votes to condemn her just to spite me it gets better he said ancient mai is still in indonesia and lafortier is covering the venatori while they relocate the merlin has their votes tooand i dont think the gatekeeper is coming so the only one whose opinion counts is the merlin i said pretty much then ramirez frowned at me you dont look surprised im not i said if something can go wrong it does ive accepted that by now he tilted his head ive just told you the kid will probably be found guilty before shes been tried yeah i said i chewed on my lip this would make things more difficult i had been counting on at least a little help from ebenezar and his cronies they knew the council procedures better than i did and how to manipulate them they also knew the merlin who magical talents aside was a damned slippery fish when it came to maneuvering through a council meeting the merlin had every reason to oppose me and therefore molly now if he wielded the votes of the people id been counting on to support me he could literally be mollys judge jury and executioner well judge and jury anyway morgan would do the executing i ground my teeth my plan could still work theoretically but there was very little i could do to alter the outcome from here on in i glanced back at molly here we were id brought her to this turn id see it through fine i said i can deal with this ramirez arched an eyebrow at me i thought youd look more upset would it help anything if i started foaming at the mouth no ramirez said it might explain a few things but it wouldnt help per se water bridge i said spilt milk accept things you cannot change in other words you have a plan ramirez said i shrugged and smiled tightly at him and just then a low throbbing engine approached the old warehouse ramirezs hand went to the butt of his gun easy i told him i invited them a motorcycle wound its way through the maze of alleys and potholes between warehouses and then crunched to a stop in the gravel beside the blue beetle fix flipped the bikes kickstand down and then he and lily got off the motorcycle fix flipped me a little salute and i nodded back to him ramirez arched an eyebrow and said is that who i think it is summer knight and lady i confirmed well crap he said and scowled at me you going to turn this into some kind of fight los i chided him would i do that he gave me a steady look and then said you just had to ask me to handle security what can i say man no one else was pretty and talented enough no one is so talented that you couldnt make him look bad dresden he muttered then he gave lily and fix a calculating look and said well this should be interesting at any rate introduce me yep i did then ramirez led us through the veil protecting the warehouse from perception two wardens at the door searched everyone for weapons they even had one of the animate statues of a temple dog they used to detect hostile enchantments veils and concealed weaponry the stone construct made me a little nervousi had nearly been attacked by one over a false alarm oncebut this time it passed me by without showing any interest it lingered longest on molly once emitting a grindstone growl but it subsided after a moment and returned to its post beside the door i started to go inside but ramirez touched my arm i stopped and frowned at him he glanced at molly and drew a black cloth from his belt youve got to be kidding me i said its protocol harry its sadistic and unnecessary he shook his head im not offering an option here he lowered his voice so that only i could hear him i dont like it either but if you violate protocol now especially in a case that involves mindcontrol magic it will be all the excuse the merlin needs to declare the proceedings potentially compromised hell be able to pass summary judgment on the girl and put you and me both on precautionary probation i ground my teeth but ramirez was right i remembered when id been brought before the council for the first time one thing more than any other stuck in my memory of that nightthe scent of the black cloth hood theyd had over my head over my face it had smelled slightly of dust slightly of mothballs and no light whatsoever had come through to me some terrified corner of my brain had noted that so long as the hood was over my face i wasnt really a person i was only a creature a statistic and one that was a potential threat at that it would be far easier to pass and mete out a death sentence when one did not have to look at the face of the damned i took the hood from ramirez and turned to molly dont be afraid i told her quietly im not going anywhere she stared back into my eyes terrified and trying to look brave she swallowed and nodded once then closed her eyes i cast a resentful look at the warehouse then i slipped the hood over mollys pinkandblue hair and pulled it down over her pale face good enough i asked ramirez it wasnt fair of me to blame him for it but the note of accusation in my voice came through far more strongly than i had intended ramirez glanced away shame on his face and nodded then he held open the warehouse door i took mollys hand and led her inside chapter fortyfive blood might not stain a wardens cloak but its all but impossible to get it out of an old porous concrete floor the merlin morgan and a dozen wardens stood in the same places they had before a loose circle that surrounded the dark brown stain that yet remained in the spot where the young warlock had been beheaded morgan had a fresh cut on one of his ears and his left wrist was tightly wrapped in medical tape even so he stood calmly and steadily the sword of the white councils justice resting with its tip on the floor his hands folded over the weighted pommel his expression as he saw me was impossible to read i was used to flat contempt and hostility from the man hell i was used to feeling the same thing about morgan in reply but id seen him in action id learned a little bit about what his life was like i understood what moved him better than i had in the past and i couldnt simply dislike him anymore i respected the man it didnt mean that i wouldnt pants him on national television if i got the opportunity but i couldnt simply dismiss him outright anymore either i nodded to the man who might be ordered to murder molly in the next few minutes it wasnt a friendly nod it was more along the lines of the salute one gave to an opponent at a fencing match he returned it in exactly the same manner and i somehow sensed that morgan knew that i wasnt going to let the girl get hurt without a fight the fingers of his right hand drummed slowly on the hilt of the sword it wasnt meant as a threat it was simply a statement if i fought the white councils justice i would be fighting him we both knew how that kind of fight would end i would never survive it we also both knew that if given the right reasons id do it anyway beside morgan the merlin also watched me speculation in his features he knew that i didnt plan on slugging it out if the hearing didnt go mollys way in the past the merlin might simply have sneered at me spat in my eye and dared me to do my worst now he was sure i was up to something else and i could all but see the gears spinning in his head as i entered holding mollys hand and guiding her blind steps followed closely by fix and lily morgan nodded to ramirez and he went to pull the doors closed and to close the circle around the building a barrier that would prevent magical intrusion while the wardens guarded the purely physical approaches but just before ramirez reached up to chain the doors closed they opened to reveal the tall and ominous figure of the gatekeeper dressed in his formal black robes with a deep purple cowl that left his features shadowed but for the glitter of his dark eyes the gatekeeper stood in the doorway for a moment and something gave me the impression that he was staring at the merlin if so the merlin wasnt rattled the old wizard inclined his head in a regal nod of greeting and respect to the gatekeeper and he gestured for the man to join him instead the gatekeeper walked to a point in the circle midway between the merlin and myself and stood quietly leaning on an aged slender staff the merlin regarded this positioning for a moment eyes narrowed and then addressed the room in latin wardens close the circle warden dresden please step forward and introduce us to your guests i gave mollys hand a squeeze of reassurance then let go of her and stepped forward first thing i said looking around at the dozen or so wardens present plus a few other noncombatant council members who had been in the area or who were on the senior councils staff is there anyone here who doesnt understand english the merlin folded his arms a slight smile curling his lips council meetings are conducted in latin the old bastard knew that my latin wasnt so hot i could understand it pretty well but speaking it myself tended to result in words being transposed in increasingly odd ways until linguistic surreality ensued if i tried to defend molly in latin id sound like an idiot from the get go and the merlin knew it while he technically held all the power he needed to quash any defense he was still accountable to the rest of the council so he had to do everything he could to justify his actions hed planned on undermining me with latin from the moment he heard about the conclave but i can plan things too granted that latin is our traditional lingual medium i replied giving the merlin a big old smile but our guests lily the summer lady and fix the current summer knight do not speak it i would fain not show the slightest lack of consideration to such prestigious visitors and envoys of our allies in summer choke on that jerk i thought lets see you snub the ally who just bailed the council out of assdeep alligators the merlin narrowed his eyes and chewed on his options for a moment before he shook his head unable to find a way to counter the move very well he said in english though his tone was grudging the council welcomes the presence of the summer lady and knight in this conclave and extends its hospitality and protection while they remain within our demesnes lily bowed her head in acknowledgment thank you honored merlin he bowed his head to her in turn not at all your highness it is hardly our custom to involve outsiders in confidential internal affairs he pointedly shifted his gaze back to me but given the recent development between our peoples it would be ungrateful indeed to evict you it would wouldnt it i agreed the merlins eyes went flat for a moment but his expression shifted back to neutrality warden dresden as a regional commander of the wardens you have the authority to summon a conclave in matters pertaining to your duties and your area of command as soon as it is quite convenient would you enlighten us as to the purpose of this conclave two reasons i said the first is to allow the summer lady to address the senior council i turned my head and nodded at lily who stepped forward into the circle while i faded back to stand beside fix honored merlin she began her tone serious and formal my queen titania has bidden me to pass her compliments to you and yours and for two in particular whose courage has gained the admiration of the summer court i frowned whats this i whispered to fix shhh he said pay attention shell get there all i needed her to do was verify what we did be patient fix whispered she will lily glanced over her shoulder at me and winked i twitched it looked exactly like the gesture from the statue that might have been mab atop the spire at arctis tor lily turned to morgan and said warden morgan your courageous defense of the venatori and their retainers and your assault upon the red king were feats she has never seen bettered my queen extends her compliments and congratulations to you warden and to the council you serve furthermore she will not let such acts of daring and dedication go unremarked or unrewarded and so she has bidden me bestow upon you this token lily held up a small intricately detailed oak leaf of pure silver she walked over to him and pinned the oak leaf to his grey cloak just over his heart i name thee friend and esquire to the summer court warden morgan an you find yourself in peril near the realm of the sidhe once and once only you need but touch this device and call aloud upon titania for aid morgan got an odd look on his face as though he had tried to make several expressions at once and gotten stuck halfway there his mouth opened shut and then he settled for a deep bow at the waist and replied i thank thee your highness what the hell is that i whispered to fix the little guy grinned the order of the silver oak is nothing to sneeze at hush lily smiled laid a slender hand over the oak leaf in benediction then walked back over to me warden dresden she said your own contribution to the battle is every bit as admirable my queen has bid me his contribution the merlin said interrupting her i blinked at lily dresden was not present at the battle the merlin protested indeed not lily said turning while she spoke to address every wizard there with some of her words in the late hours two nights ago warden dresden planned and led a small force in a raid upon arctis tor itself a collective inhalation went through the room and was followed by a nebulous buzz of murmurs and whispering the merlins poker face was too good to tell me anything about his reaction but morgans eyebrows went up warden dresden and his team won through the defenders of the fortress and launched an assault of fire upon the icy wellspring at the heart of arctis tor his actions disrupted the dispositions of the forces of winter upon our borders compelling them to retreat to the fortress to deal with the offenders once there the flow of time through the region was slowed creating an opportunity for our own forces to come to your aid what is she talking about i whispered to fix i didnt know i was going there until i got there and the only fighting left to do was all the fetches mmmm fix murmured back and yet not one word shes said has been untrue i snorted in short honored merlin lily continued and honorable members of the council had dresden not attacked the lair of mab herself the mightiest fortress in winter had dresden not stormed the gates of arctis tor the battle would surely have been lost every soul who came safe home again from the battle owes his life to harry dresden and his courage silence fell she looked slowly around the circle and let the silence emphasize her previous words far more ably than any speech it is for this reason she said after a moment that my queen confers upon warden dresden status as friend and esquire of the summer court she turned to me and pinned another silver leaf over my heart then laid her hand over it she looked up at me and smiled you too may once call upon us at need well done harry she stood on tiptoe and gave me a kiss on the cheek and then turned to face the merlin my queen wishes you to know honored merlin that while glad to be able to go to the aid of the council against the threat posed by the red court winters forces have returned to their original positions and once again the forces of summer must remain vigilant of our borders until that situation changes she cautions you that summer will be able to offer its allies only limited assistance the merlin was staring at me so hard that for a second i thought he hadnt heard lilys warning then he blinked and shook himself a little of course your highness he said please convey to her majesty the gratitude of the white council and assure her that even in these desperate times her friendship will not be forgotten she bowed her head again i shall do so and so are my duties discharged she retreated back to her original position beside fix why i muttered under my breath do i get the feeling that titania handing me a medal cant possibly be as simple as it looks because you can tell a hawk from a handsaw when the wind is southerly lily murmured in reply but it offers you some benefit today she smiled at me surely you didnt actually expect a summer queen to do simply as you bid her and no more i grumbled something under my breath while the merlin turned to confer quietly with morgan a general round of whispers rose up as the wizards took the opportunity to bandy rumors and theories around i found mollys cold trembling hand and squeezed it again what happened the girl asked me lily talked me up like i was a hero i said everyone seems sort of shocked can i take this off yet molly asked not yet i told her harry ramirez said stepping over to me shes not supposed to speak yeah yeah i muttered to him and lowered my voice to speak to molly pipe down kid try not to worry so far so good which was true enough i had managed not to look like an illiterate idiot and lilys impromptu medal ceremony had tacitly established my fighting credentials as something comparable to those of the councils most capable soldier it didnt mean that molly was out of the woods but it would give me a solid foundation for presenting her case my credibility was everything and i had done all that i could to establish my presence before the council the merlin had been in the game a while and he knew exactly what i was up to he didnt seem too happy about it he beckoned the councils secretary a driedup old spider of a man named peabody and put his head together with the old man in whispered conference order the merlin called after a moment and the room settled down immediately warden dresden the merlin said may we continue with your explanation for the necessity of this conclave i stepped back into the circle tugging molly along with me until we were standing on the heavy bloodstain where the boy had been executed there was a psychic remnant of the death there a cold quivering tension in the air an echo of rage and fear and death molly shuddered as her feet came to rest atop the stained concrete she must have felt it too i had a sudden flash a horrible image of the future where mollys body lay in spreading scarlet a few feet from a black cloth bag so bright and detailed that it almost replaced the reality before me molly shuddered again and whispered so softly that no one but i could hear im afraid i squeezed her hand and answered the merlins question in the manner prescribed by protocol i have brought a prisoner before the council one who has broken the fourth law i have brought her here to seek justice merlin the merlin nodded at me his expression serious and distant this woman with you is the prisoner this girl is i replied and put no emphasis on the correction she comes to face the council openly of her own will and in open admission of her wrong and this wrong the merlin asked what has she done i looked at morgan she broke the fourth law of magic when she imposed a fear of drug use upon two addicts in order to protect both them and their unborn child from the damage of their addictions morgan stared back at me as i spoke i thought i saw a faint frown in his eyes the merlin remained silent for half a minute then slowly arched one brow she violated the free will of another human being she didbut in ignorance merlin she knew neither the laws nor the side effects of her actions her intentions were only to preserve and protect three lives ignorance of the law is never an excuse warden dresden as you well know and has no bearing upon this judgment the merlin glanced at peabody then back to me i assume you have examined the victims i have merlin and have you had their condition confirmed by another warden ramirez stepped forward i have done so merlin the psychic trauma was serious but it is my belief that both will recover the merlin eyed ramirez is that your opinion warden ramirez based no doubt upon your extensive experience ramirezs eyes glittered with anger at the merlins tone it is the opinion of the duly appointed regional commander of the western united states he replied i believe that the merlin should remember that he personally appointed me if it hasnt faded into a blur of senility warden morgan barked and his tone was one of absolute authority you will apologize to the merlin and moderate your tone at once ramirezs gaze smoldered but he glanced at fix and lily and then a little guiltily at morgan of course captain he drew himself up and gave the merlin a proper polite bow i ask your forgiveness merlin the last days have been difficult for everyone the merlin let it hang in the air for a minute then his rigid expression softened somewhat and i saw a flash of bonedeep weariness in the old mans eyes of course he said in a quieter voice and bowed his own head my choice of words was less polite than it could have been warden ramirez please do not take it as a slight upon your performance clever old snake establishing himself as ohsoreasonable and understanding with the younger members of the council or maybe he really was apologizing to ramirez who was the unofficial poster boy of the younger generation of wizards or more likely he was doing both that was more the merlins style the merlin returned his attention to me to continue warden dresden have you soulgazed the prisoner i have i said you are convinced of her guilt i swallowed i am i said but i am also convinced that her actions do not represent the malice that defines a true warlock thank you for your opinion warden dresden his voice turned drolly unapologetic doubtless offered to us out of your own extensive experience i beg your pardon merlin but when it comes to the council sitting in selfrighteous arrogant judgment over a young wizard who made an honest mistake i believe i have more experience than anyone in this room the merlins head rocked back as if i had slapped him i wasnt as subtle and proper as him when it came to insults but if he was going to do it i saw no reason not to return fire i pressed on before he could speak stepping forward and turning to address the room as i spoke wizards friends brothers and sisters in arms you know why this is happening you know how thinly stretched our resources have become in the past three years the council has tried and condemned more warlocks than in the past twenty children who are raised in societies that do not believe in magic suddenly inherit powers they could hardly have imagined and certainly cannot control they have no support no training no one to warn them of the consequences or the dangers of their actions i reached out and jerked that fucking black hood from mollys head and the girl suddenly stood blinking at the light tears had streaked her makeup into dark stains running down her face her eyes were red with crying her expression haunted and terrified she shuddered and lowered her eyes staring down at the bloodstained floor this is molly i said to the room shes seventeen years old her best friend had already lost one unborn child because of the drugs shed been addicted to she knew it was going to happen again so to protect that childs life to protect her friends from their addiction molly made a choice she used her power to intervene i faced morgan she made a wrong choice no one denies that she admits to it herself but look at her shes no monster she understands that what she did was wrong she understands that she needs help she submitted herself to this councils judgment freely she wants to learn to control her power to handle it responsibly she came here hoping to find help and guidance morgan didnt look at me he was staring at molly his fingers kept drumming on the hilt of his sword ive soulgazed her its not too late to help her i think we owe her the chance to redeem herself i continued i looked at the gatekeeper for gods sake wizards if we are to survive this war we need all the talent we can get mollys death would be a foolish waste i drew in a breath and turned to face the merlin theres been enough blood spilled on this floor i beg you to consider clemency levy the doom of damocles if you must but i beg you to spare her life i will take personal responsibility for her training and accept the consequences of any actions taken under my mentorship silence fell i waited for the merlin to speak molly began trembling harder and small whimpering sounds came from her throat the merlins eyes narrowed and with that single revealing expression i suddenly knew that id made a terrible mistake id outmaneuvered him id startled him with my insult and delivered my speech effectively to the wizards present i could see it on their faces the uncertainty the sympathy more than one wizard had glanced at the bloodstains at my feet and shuddered as i spoke to them more than one looked at mollys face and grimaced in sympathy for her fear id beaten the merlin he knew it and he hated it i had forgotten to take into account his pride his ego his selfimage he was the mightiest wizard on the planet the leader of the white council and he was not accustomed to being insulted and manipulatedand especially not in front of outsiders i a mere puppy of a young wizard had stung him and his wounded pride sprayed arterial anger he had it under control but it was no less terrible or dangerous for that warden dresden he said in a deadly quiet tone your compassion does you credit but as you yourself pointed out our resources are spread too thin already the council cannot afford to have a regional commander of the wardens burdened with a hazardous rehabilitation of a warlock the duties of the war and of containing the increasing occurrence of black magic must have your full attention oh god the laws of magic are clear the prisoner admits her guilt i am not unmoved by the prisoners plight but we are involved in a war for our very survival ohgodohgodohgod i therefore take no pleasure in pronouncing the prisoners fate it is the judgment of the senior council that the prisoner is a warlock guilty of breaking the fourth law he lifted his chin and said very calmly the sentence is death to be carried out immediately chapter fortysix morgan the merlin said quietly morgan stared at molly then at the merlin he drew in a sharp breath and took a grip on the sword lifting it vertically before him i looked frantically around the room ramirez like most of the rest of the wizards there had a stunned look on his face he looked back at me with a blank expression and gave me a little twitch of his shoulders lily looked remote and troubled fixs expression was blank but his jaws were clenched hard muscles standing out and creating shadows on his face harry molly whispered shaking so hard she could hardly speak harry i turned back to the merlin his eyes were hard his face as unyielding as stone morgan looked as if he might be about to throw upbut it didnt stop him from moving toward molly with a steady dreamlike slowness sword in hand harry molly sobbed i promised charity i took my staff in both hands and stepped forward putting myself between morgan and the girl morgan i said stars and stones man please dont do this shes a child we should be helping her my words slowed him and he froze in place for a terrible heartbeat then he closed his eyes and swallowed his face twisting with nausea he opened his eyes again and whispered stand aside dresden please i looked wildly around the room for someone anyone to help for some way to stop this madness i felt a sudden pressure against my spine and i looked over my shoulder my eyes fell on the gatekeeper i whirled back to morgan and lifted my hands point of order i cried point of order the senior council has not yet made its decision morgan paused head tilting and frowned at me he lowered the sword and glanced back at the merlin the senior council has decided the issue the merlin snarled no i said the senior council must decide any capital crime in an open vote i pointed my finger at the gatekeeper he has not cast his vote the merlin spoke through clenched teeth i hold six of seven votes however the honored gatekeeper decides it will not change the outcome true i said but that doesnt change the fact that he gets a damned vote why are you doing this the merlin demanded it is over you only torment the prisoner with this unnecessary charade he gets a vote i repeated and folded my arms on my chest the merlin stared at me hard and i could actually sense the pressure of his rage like the end of a baseball bat poking steadily at my chest morgan said very very quietly hes right honored merlin the merlin narrowed his eyes then he turned his head to the gatekeeper as you wish we shall play this farce to its conclusion gatekeeper how find you in this matter and the gatekeeper said nothing he just stood there face almost invisible beneath his cowl gatekeeper the merlin called how find you i find the need for deliberation the gatekeeper responded i beg the councils indulgence while i ponder this matter ridiculous the merlin said the gatekeeper tilted his head death is rather final honored merlin i must consider carefully before i consign a soul any soul no matter how guilty to that end this is nonsense it will make no difference how you vote true the gatekeeper replied very gently the faintest shade of rebuke in his voice but that does not change my moral obligation to make this decision with care the merlin took a deep breath and then said forced calm in his voice i suppose a few moments for thought are not unreasonable thank you the gatekeeper said gravely five minutes went by like five thousand years molly sagged against me so frightened she could barely stand enough the merlin said finally this travesty needs to end on that point the gatekeeper said we agree and then he stepped forward to the circle marked on the floor and smudged it with his boot breaking the circle he flicked a gloved hand and the lock on the chained door sprang open and fell away followed closely by the chains what is the meaning of this the merlin demanded the gatekeeper ignored him and pushed open the door one of the wardens on guard outside stood in front of it one hand raised as if to knock he blinked at the gatekeeper and then looked over his shoulder and said its open sir get clear of the door fool barked ebenezars voice get them inside hurry man theyre right behind us outside there was an eerie howl and a sudden detonation of thunder that shook the concrete floor young people in roomy brown robes began to hurry through the doorway most of them around mollys age or a bit younger they were led by a young woman with short curly hair and cheeks that had a dimple even when she wasnt smilingluccio the commander of the wardens in the young body a necromancer had trapped her in the kids must have been her trainees she was followed by more children and a tall brawny woman with dark skin and short iron grey hair helping a lanky young man with a wounded leg martha liberty helped the young man settle to the ground and barked out a command for a medical kit an old man with braided hair and native american features brought up the rear shepherding the last few young wizards ahead of him injun joe listenstowind made sure they were all inside and then turned and shouted im closing the way now there were several more howls and a belllike chime of steel something hit the wall of the warehouse hard enough to shake dust from the rafters then there was a rushing sound of wind that abruptly ended in heavy silence listenstowind sagged and leaned against the doorway panting then he rose and stood aside as ebenezar mccoy came in my old mentor was wearing his usual overalls and tshirt his bald pate shone with sweat and he looked tired but he was smiling over the pugnacious set of his lower jaw the air around him fairly crackled with intensity a mantle of power that hung around him in a subtle haze ebenezar reached behind him to hold the door open michael came in he wore his white cloak his mail and breastplate and he bore amoracchius in his hands stained with dark fluids he glanced around the room a smile firm on his face papa molly shrieked and threw herself at him michael blinked and managed to get the sword out of the way before molly hit him with a hug that nearly knocked him from his feet he got an arm around her smiling ooof careful girl the old man needs his ribs right where they are who the hell is this ramirez demanded frowning at michael he looked like he didnt know whether to be upset or disturbed that an armed and armored stranger had just waltzed in and was now standing inside all of his security measures hes a bloody hero is what he is ebenezar told him if he hadnt come along when he did not a one of us would have gotten out of there alive he offered michael his hand ive only heard of you by reputation sir knight but ive got to say that im damned glad to meet you thank you michael grinned and juggled his sword and his daughter so hed have a hand free to shake ebenezars im only a servant he said any thanks are rightly owed to him not to me aye ebenezar said and thank god you came sir knight secure the building said the merlin in a quiet voice he walked forward to see what was happening and stopped beside me michael nodded and moved out tapping ramirez and another warden and the three of them went to make sure the bad guys werent still coming vote isnt over i said in a very quiet voice which means that the three of them will need to cast their votes as well obviously the merlin said in a neutral murmur thats michael knight of the cross which sword the merlin asked idly amoracchius i said the merlin lifted a brow and nodded never looking at me looks like he just saved about forty of our young people so it would seem the merlin said seems like the least we can do is save one of his the merlins eyes narrowed and he did not speak look at it this way i said quietly theres no downside to this for you if youre wrong about molly the council gets another wizard fairly talented one too and if im right he asked quietly if youre right i said you still get to kill the girl the merlin glanced at me true he said and you with her chapter fortyseven after a second much less lengthy round of questions and answers the senior council voted and molly was officially declared my apprentice to be granted clemency under the doom of damocles doom of damocles was wizardspeak for probation if molly abused her magic or came anywhere near violating any of the laws of magic shed be executed at onceand id join her but id lived with that before i could do it again it was full dark by the time the conclave ended and everyone filed out as the wizard who had called the conclave it was my job to make sure everyone departed safely and to take care of any lastminute details between providing food and further medical supplies for the unexpected arrivals and coordinating with ramirez to make sure our comings and goings werent being observed i didnt get the chance to speak to anyone about personal matters with lilys help wed given the vampires a stiff kick in the balls but the fight was far from over the combathardened wizards and the talents of the senior council were needed elsewhere and they departed with hardly a pause for food and drink once it was done i left the warehouse and sank down against the wall just letting the cool summer evening wash over me id saved the girl from the bad guys and more importantly from the good guys which seemed the sort of thing that should pay my wardens salary overtime but for the moment i was simply glad it was over id gambled horribly in my attempt to play the collective will of the council against the merlin i shouldnt have done it that way the merlin was a politician if id been willing to eat a little crow he probably would have come to some sort of compromise with me a humiliating and disadvantageous compromise from my perspective but he might have worked something out instead id gained the moral support of the council present there tonight and id wielded it against him like a sword chopping off his options and maneuvering him into bending to my will i had exercised power over him in a way that no one had yet dared i had struck a blow against his authority declared myself an enemy of his administration there was no way he could ignore that kind of challenge from a morally suspect young punk like me he would have to bring me down if i wanted to avoid that id have to keep my eyes open my wits sharp and id have to continue to do whatever i could to secure myself against him in short id become a politician but instead of moaning about it i found myself laughing given all that had happened matters could have been much much worse molly was coming home safe the murderous fetches had been dispatched the vampires had been handed their first significant defeat since the cold war combusted after the events of the day tomorrow surely held nothing for me to fear and i trusted that it would take care of itself until i could rest eat and put an end to the last details of the business at hand molly and michael had waited with me when michael covered luccios retreat through the nearer regions of the nevernever he had gotten back to chicago without paying for the gas but his truck was still back in the middle of nowhere oregon hed need to have it shipped back or else make a long drive with a partner he needed a ride home and i was it the beetles floorboards settled almost all the way to the ground by the time everyone was on board and i drove carefully away from the warehouse molly chattered on about a confusing blur of things for maybe two minutes and then went abruptly silent michael checked over his shoulder asleep he reported quietly shes had a busy day i said he sighed tell me what happened i told him everything except the parts with lasciel in them and i didnt mention charitys neglected talent for magic i thought for a second that i could hear a ghostly amused laugh from somewhere nearby optimistically i wrote it off to my fatigued imagination michael shook his head how did you know that i would return as i did oh i didnt i said i just figured that you must have been sent off to do something to help your kid so i asked forthill to get word to you that you needed to be back here pronto and that if you were with any council members they should come with you you got the message he nodded it found me at luccios camp in colorado wed beaten off a vampire attack and were preparing to move if i hadnt gotten the message i wouldnt have followed them on their path through the nevernever what happened demons michael said quite a few of them actually what kind oh fangs tentacles you know the usual i snorted no i mean were they outsiders ebenezar said something about outsiders yes now that you mention it apparently his magic had difficulty dealing with them i shook my head im glad you were with them under the circumstances so am i he pursed his lips thoughtfully you assumed i had been sent to help the white council so that they would show mercy to my daughter i shrugged it was either that or else i was the one meant to look out for her which would mean that it was possible for me to do so so i decided to lean on the merlin michael blinked and stared at me if i do not mistake your meaning you just told me that you took a leap of faith no i took your leap of faith by proxy i shook my head look michael i try to stay out of gods way as much as i possibly can i dont expect him to send a rescue party for me if im in trouble harry i know you arent a churchgoing man but god does help people who arent perfect sure i said and i couldnt keep all the sneer out of my voice thats why the world is such a happy orderly place michael sighed harry god does protect us from harmits part of what i and my brothers in arms are tasked to do but hes a great deal less involved in protecting us from the consequences of our choices i know the theory i said that god mostly only steps in when theres supernatural evil afoot yeah thats an oversimplification really and spare me i said hell michael i had one of those bastard denarians here last year quintus cassius you remember him while i was lying there watching him slice his way into my guts i thought maybe it would be a good time for someone like you to show up you know one of those denarian knights i thought to myself hey it would be a great time for one of the knights of the cross to show up eh i shook my head it didnt work out that way what is your point he asked quietly heaven aint safeguarding me michael but youre different than me i figured god was going to look out for you and yours out of professional courtesy if nothing else and ive seen how hes arranged things for you in the past so what i did wasnt about faith it was just a matter of deducing probabilities he shook his head not agreeing with me but not pressing it either charity shes fine i assured him kids too should be back home by now she and molly reconciled well on polite speaking terms and hugging again at least his eyebrows shot up and then his mouth curved into a wide grin glory to god i wasnt sure it would ever happen i buffed my nails on my shirt sometimes i amaze even myself michael smiled at me then looked over his shoulder again and frowned my molly magic isnt that sort of thing passed through bloodlines usually i said but it doesnt have to be some people are just born with it we dont really understand the how and why he shook his head but how could i not have realized what was happening to her i dunno but if you find out make sure to tell charity she asked me the same question i suppose were all blind to what is closest to us he said human nature i agreed is molly in danger he asked me his tone frank i frowned and thought about it some shes got real power and shes abused it a little shes going to be real tempted to use it again when she starts running into problems that look unsolvable not only that but learning to harness the kind of strength shes got can be pretty tricky all by itself but shes smart and shes got all kinds of guts if her teacher keeps from making any stupid mistakes i think shell be all right but if she isnt michael said if she abuses her power again then clemency is revoked they execute her and you michael said softly i shrugged isnt like i havent lived with that over my head before as far as the council is concerned im responsible for her now until she either makes full wizard or sets her talents aside greater love hath no man he said quietly nothing i can say would be enough shes my daughter harry thank you i felt my cheeks heat up yeah yeah look dont make a big deal out of this no one will enjoy that he let out a rumbling chuckle and this apprenticeship what will it entail lessons every day at first until im sure shes got herself under control well have to practice some of it away from anything combustible trees houses pets that kind of thing how long will you need to work with her until were finished i said waving a vague hand i dont know yet ive never been on this side of an apprenticeship he nodded in acceptance very well we rode in silence for a moment then he said you remember the professional discussion i wanted to have yeah i said shoot fidelacchius michael said i was wondering if you found any candidates for a new wielder zippo i said frowning you think i should be looking hard to say but with only two of us in the field sanya and i are getting a little overworked i scratched my chin shiro told me that i would know the wielder there hasnt been anything like that at least not yet im concerned that it may take more than simply patience michael sighed ive consulted our records this is not the first time one of the white council has been asked to be the custodian of one of the swords i arched my eyebrows and looked at him seriously he nodded me and who merlin i snorted you sure because the merlin is kind of a jerk even you would think so trust me no harry michael said his tone patient not the merlin of the council merlin the original i sat there with my jaw suavely flapping in the breeze for a minute then said wow i shook my head you think maybe i should find a big rock or something stick the sword in and leave it on the white house lawn michael crossed himself heaven forbid no i just have an he scrunched up his nose an instinct you mean like when you get sent out on a mission from god no i mean a regular old human hunch i think that perhaps you should investigate the history around how amoracchius was passed on back then said sword now rested at a slant across michaels chest safely in its scabbard point between the knights boots wow you mean that sword right there your sword is i left it unsaid probably he said nodding though the churchs records are fragmented weve managed to establish that the other two swords have been reworked from time to time through the years this one hasnt thats interesting i mused quietly thats interesting as heuh as heck michael gave me a faint smile and nodded its an intriguing mystery isnt it you know what i said i can do mystery i chewed my lip for a minute and said but i hope youre not in a hurry you may have noticed that the council is having a busy year ill have time sooner or later but for now i shrugged i know he was quiet for a moment and then said but knowing the swords history could become important sooner is better than later something odd in his tone made me look at him why his hand moved unconsciously to amoraccbiuss hilt i dont think ill have the sword for much longer his voice was very soft when the knights of the sword retired they did it feetfirst from the inside of a box michael i asked did the uh office send you a memo i carefully didnt say like they did with shiro no instinct he said and smiled at me but i suppose i could be beginning my midlife crisis but im not planning to change the way i live my life and i certainly have no intention of an early retirement good i said though it came out more somber than id intended do you mind if i ask you something personal michael said im way too busy to answer rhetorical questions he grinned for a second and nodded then he pursed his lips and took his time about choosing his words harry youve avoided me for some time and you seem well somewhat more dour than ive seen you before i wasnt avoiding you exactly i said he regarded me with calm steady eyes all right i said yeah but ive been avoiding most everybody dont take it personally is it something ive done or perhaps someone in my family enough with the rhetoric you know it isnt he nodded then maybe its something youve done maybe something you should talk about with a friend the fallen angels sigil on my left palm throbbed i started to say no but stopped myself i drove for another block or two i should tell him i really should michael was my friend he deserved my trust and respect he deserved to know but i couldnt then my mouth started moving and i realized that what was bothering me the most had nothing to do with coins or fallen angels last halloween i said quietly i killed two people he drew in a slow breath and nodded listening one of them was cassius once he was beaten i had mouse break his neck another was a necromancer called corpsetaker i shot her in the back of the head i swallowed i murdered them ive never killed man not like that cold i drove a while more i have nightmares i heard him sigh for a moment his voice was bleak pained ive been in this business longer than you have i know some of what youre feeling i didnt answer him you feel like nothing is ever going to be right again he said you remember it perfectly and it wont leave you alone you feel like youre walking around with a sharp rock in your shoe you feel stained stupid damned streetlights getting all blurry like that i blinked a lot and stayed quiet my throat was too tight to speak anyway i know what its like he said there isnt any way to make it disappear but it gets better with time and distance he studied me for a moment if you had it to do again would you twice as hard i said at once then what you did was a necessity harry it might be painful it might haunt you but at the end of the day so long as you did what you believed right youll be able to live with yourself yeah i asked chewing on my lower lip i promise he said i darted a glance at him you dont think less of me knowing that im a murderer it isnt my place to judge what youve done i regret that those lives were lost that their owners never found redemption i worry for the pain youve inflicted on yourself in retrospect but i dont for an instant think that you would choose to take a human life unless you absolutely had to seriously i trust you michael said his voice calm i would never have left my family in your protection if i didnt youre a decent man harry i exhaled slowly and my shoulders loosened good and then before my brain could get in the way i added i picked up one of the blackened denarü michael lasciel my heart skipped several beats as i made the admission i expected shock horror outrage maybe with a side order of contempt but instead michael nodded i know i blinked at him you what i know he repeated you know you knew yes i was taking the trash around the house when nicodemuss car went by i saw the whole thing i saw you protecting my youngest i chewed on my lip and i mean you arent going to slug me and drag me off to a private suite in the asylum for wayward denarians dont be ridiculous michael said remember that the knights of the cross were not founded to destroy the denarians we were founded to save them from the fallen it is therefore my duty to help you in whatever way i can i can help you discard the coin if that is what you wish to do its best if you choose to do it yourself i dont need to discard it actually i said i havent really taken the coin up i buried it never used it michael looked surprised no that is good news then though it means that the fallens shadow is still attempting to persuade you i take it this time the mental chuckle was a little more clear i thought oh shut up very hard and sent it in lasciels direction trying i said keep in mind that lasciel is a deceiver he said quietly one with thousands of years of practice it knows people it knows how to tell you lies you want to believe are true but it exists for a single purposeto corrupt the will and beliefs of mankind dont ever forget that i shuddered yeah may i ask what its told you he paused and narrowed his eyes no wait let me guess its appeared to you as an attractive young woman she offers you knowledge yes the benefit of her experience yeah i paused and added and hellfire makes my spells hit harder when i need them to i try not to use it much michael shook his head lasciel isnt called the temptress for nothing she knows you knows what to offer you and how to offer it damn right she does i paused a moment then added it scares me sometimes youve got to get rid of the coin he said with gentle urgency love to i said how give up the coin of your own will and set aside your power if you do lasciels shadow will dwindle with it and waste away what do you mean set aside my power walk away from your magic he said forsake it forever fuck that he winced and looked away the rest of the trip to his home passed in silence when we got there i told michael mollys stuff is back at my place id like to take her back there to get it i need to have a talk with her tonight while everything is fresh ill have her back here in a couple of hours tops michael glanced at his sleeping daughter with a worried frown but nodded very well he got out and shut the door then leaned back in the window to speak to me may i ask you two things shoot he glanced back at his house and said have you ever considered the possibility that the lord did not send me out on my most recent mission so that i could protect my daughter that it was not his intention to use you to protect her whats your point only that it is entirely possible harry dresden that this entire affair beginning to end is meant to protect you that when i went to the aid of luccio and her trainees i did so not to free molly but to prevent you from coming to blows with the council that her position as your new apprentice had less to do with protecting her than it did protecting you eh i said he glanced at his daughter children have their own kind of power when youre teaching them protecting them you are more than you thought you could be more understanding more patient more capable more wise perhaps this foster child of your power will do the same for you perhaps its what she is meant to do if the lord was all that interested in helping out how come he didnt send someone to help me against cassius one of old nicks personal yesmen seems to be a solid rescue scenario michael shrugged and opened his mouth and dont give me any of that mysterious ways tripe he shut his mouth and smiled its a confusing sort of thing he said what is life ill see you in a couple of hours he offered me his hand i shook it i dont know of another way to end lasciels influence but that doesnt mean there isnt one out there if you should change your mind about the coin harry if you want to get rid of it i promise that ill be there for you thank you i said and meant it his expression grew more sober and if you should fall to temptation if you should embrace the fallen or become ensnared by its will he touched the hilt of the great sword and his face became bedrock granite old testament determination that made morgans fanaticism look like a wisp of steam if you change i will also be there fear hit me in a cold wave holy crap i swallowed and my hands shook on the beetles steering wheel there wasnt any attempt at menace in michaels voice or his face he was simply stating a fact the mark on my palm burned and for the first time i gave serious consideration to the notion that maybe i was overconfident of my ability to deal with lasciel what if michael was right what if i screwed something up and wound up like that poor bastard rasmussen a demonically supercharged serial killer if that happens i told him and my voice was a dry whisper i want you to i could see in his eyes that he didnt like the thought any more than i didbut he was fundamentally incapable of being anything less than perfectly honest with me he was my friend and he was worried if he had to do harm to me it would rip him apart maybe the words had been his own subconscious way of begging me to get rid of the coin he could never stand aside and do nothing while bad things happened even if meant that he had to kill his friend i could respect that i understood it because i couldnt do it either i couldnt stand aside abandon my magic and cut myself loose of the responsibility to use it for good not even if it killed me life can be confusing good god and how sometimes it seems like the older i get the more confused i become that seems assbackwards i thought i was supposed to be getting wiser instead i just keep getting hit over the head with my relative insignificance in the greater scheme of the universe confusing life but it beats the hell out of the alternative i went back to my place i let the kid sleep until we got there and then touched her shoulder with one hand she jerked awake at once blinking in weary confusion where are we she asked my place i said we need to talk she blinked her eyes several more times and then nodded why because you need to understand something come on we got out of the car i led her down the steps to my door and said come stand next to me she did i took her left hand and told her spread your fingers and close your eyes she did that too i held her left palm up about two inches from the door now focus see what you can feel her face scrunched up um she said shifting her weight back and forth restlessly theres pressure um or maybe a buzzing like highpower lines close enough i said and released her wrist what youre sensing are some of the energies that i used to ward my apartment if you try to come in without disabling them youll take a jolt of electricity that wouldnt leave much more of you than a smudge on the ground she blinked at me then twitched and pulled her hand sharply away ill give you an amulet that will let you get through until im sure you can disable them go in and start them up again but for tonight just dont try to open the door in or out okay okay she said quietly we went in my cleaning service had come through molly had left a bag with clothes and sundries spread over half of one of my apartments couches now the bag was neatly closed and suspiciously nonbulgy im sure the cleaning service had folded and organized the bag so that everything fit in without strain molly looked around blinking how does your maid get in i dont know what you mean i said because you cant talk about faerie housekeepers or they go away i pointed at the couch next to her bag and said sit she did though i could tell that my peremptory tone did not thrill her i sat down in a chair across from the couch as i did mister drifted in from the bedroom and promptly wound himself around one of mollys legs purring a greeting okay kid i said we survived i only had some very limited plans to cover this contingency she blinked at me what i didnt think id pull this off i mean raiding a faerie capital standing up to the senior council all those movie monsters your mom hell im shocked i survived at all much less got you out of it bbut she frowned you never seemed like i mean you just went through it all like you had everything under control you seemed so sure what was going to happen rule number one of the wizarding business i said never let them see you sweat people expect us to know things it can be a big advantage dont screw it up by looking like youre as confused as everyone else bad for the image she smiled at me a little i see she said she reached down to stroke mister and mused i must look horrible been a rough day i said look well need to talk about where youre going to live i take it that you had already decided to break things off with nelson i kind of picked up that vibe when we bailed him out she nodded well inappropriate to stay with him then to say nothing of the fact that hes going to need time to recover i cant stay at home she said quietly after all thats happened and my mom will never understand about the magic she thinks its all bad every bit of it and if im there its just going to confuse and frighten all the little jawas mom and me arguing all the time i grunted and said youll have to stay somewhere well work that out soonest all right she said next thing you need to know i said as of now you get no slack you arent allowed any mistakes you dont get to say oops the first time you screw up and slip deeper into bad habits it kills both of us im going to be tough on you sometimes molly i have to be its as much for my survival as yours got it yes she said i grunted got up and went to my tiny bedroom i rooted around in my closet and found an old brown apprentice robe one of the shiny new wardens had left at my place after a local meeting i brought it out and handed it to molly keep this where you can get to it youll be with me at any council meetings and it is your formal attire i frowned and rubbed at my head god i need aspirin and food you hungry molly shook her head but im a mess do you mind if i clean up i eyed her and sighed then i said no go ahead and get it out of the way i stood up and went to the kitchen muttering a minor spell and flicking several candles into light including one near the girl she took the robe and the candle grabbed her bag and vanished into my room i checked the icebox the faeries usually brought some kind of food to stock the icebox and the pantry when they cleaned but they could have mighty odd ideas about what constituted a healthy diet one time id opened the pantry and found nothing but boxes and boxes and boxes of froot loops i had a nearmiss with diabetes and thomas who never was quite sure where the food came from declared that i had clearly been driven froot loopy usually it wasnt that bad though there was always a high incidence of frozen pizza for which my housekeepers maintained the ice in my icebox with religious fervor i often left most of a pizza lying around uneaten when i figured theyd be coming to visit and thus continued my policy of shamelessly bribing my way into the little folks good graces i was too tired to cook anything and nothing was going to taste good anyway so i slapped several hot dogs between two pieces of bread along with a couple of lettuce leaves and wolfed them down i got out some of my ice and dumped it in a pitcher then filled the pitcher up i got down a glass and filled it with ice water then i and my glass and my pitcher moseyed over to my fireplace i set the pitcher on the mantel idly flipped the neatly laid fire to life with my ignition spell and then waited for the inevitable while sipping cold water and staring down at the fire mister kept me company from his spot on top of a bookcase it took her a little while to work up to it but not as long as i had expected my bedroom door opened and molly appeared she had showered her candycolored hair hung limp and clinging shed washed away the makeup entirely but there were spots of pink high on her cheeks that i figured had little to do with cosmetics the various piercings i could see caught the firelight in a deep burned orange glow she was also barefoot and wearing her brown robe i arched an eyebrow at her and waited she flushed more deeply and then walked over to me quite slowly until she stood not a foot away i gave her nothing to work with no expression no words just silence you looked into me she whispered quietly and i looked into you thats how it works i confirmed in a quiet neutral voice she shivered i saw what kind of man you are kind gentle she looked up and met my eyes lonely and she flushed a shade pinker and hungry no one has touched you in a very long time she lifted a hand and put it on my chest her fingers were very warm and a rippling flush of purely biological reaction bypassed my silly brain and raced through me in a wave of pleasureand need i looked down at mollys pale hand her palm glided over my chest barely touching a slow focused circle i felt faintly disgusted with myself for my reaction hell id known this kid before shed had to worry about feminine hygiene products i managed to thwart my hormones lobby to start growling or drooling but my voice had gotten a shade or two huskier also true she looked up at me again her eyes wide and deep and blue enough to drown in you saved my life she said and i heard her voice shaking youre going to teach me i she licked her lips and moved her shoulders the brown robe slipped down them to the floor the tattoo that began on her neck went all the way down to her pierced navel she had several other studs and fine rings in places i had suspected but never confirmed they would be she shivered and took swifter breaths the firelight played merrily with her shifting contours id seen better but mostly that had been from someone using her looks to get something out of me and the difference had largely been one of presentation molly didnt have much experience in displaying herself for a man or in playing the coquette she should have stood differently arched her back shifted her hips worn an expression of thickly sensual interest daring me to come after her she would have looked like the patron goddess of corrupted youth instead she stood there uncertain and frightened and too naive or maybe honest to be anything but totally sincereand vulnerable she was afraid uncertain the lost princess helpless in a dark wood it was worse than if shed vamped onto me like a trained courtesan what i saw in her was honest and hopeful trusting and terrified she was real and fragile and precious my emotions got together with my glands and they ganged up on me screaming that she needed acceptance and that the kindest thing i could possibly do would be to give her a hug and tell her everything was going to be all rightand that if something followed who would blame me i would so i just watched her with a straight face i want to learn from you she said i want to do everything i can to help you to thank you i want you to teach me things what things i asked in a quiet measured tone she licked her lips everything show me everything are you sure i asked her she nodded her eyes huge pupils dilated until only a bare ring of blue remained around them teach me she whispered i touched her face with the fingers of my right hand kneel down i told her close your eyes trembling she did her breathing becoming faster more excited but that stopped once i picked up the pitcher of ice water from the mantel and dumped it over her head she let out a squeal and fell over backward it took her maybe ten seconds to recover from the shock of the cold and by then she was gasping and shivering her eyes wide with surprise and confusionand with some kind of deep heavy pain i faced her and squatted down onto my haunches to meet her eyes lesson one this isnt going to happen molly i said in exactly the same calm gentle voice get that through your head right now it isnt ever going to happen her lower lip trembled and she bowed her head shoulders shaking i gave myself a mental kick in the head and snagged a blanket from the couch i went to her and wrapped it around her shoulders get over by the fire and warm up it took her a moment to collect herself but she did she hunched her shoulders beneath the blanket shivering and humiliated you knew she said in a shaking voice that i would do this i was pretty sure i agreed because of the soulgaze she said nothing to do with that really i replied i figured there had to be a reason that you didnt come to me for help when you came into your powers i figure youve been interested in me for a while that you wouldnt want to come up to your favorite rock star and start fumbling around on a guitar so that the first thing he thinks about you is that youre incompetent she shivered and blushed even more no it wasnt like that sure it was but id hammered her hard enough for the time being if you say so i answered molly you may fight with your mom like cats and dogs but the two of you are more alike than you know thats not true its trite but true that a lot of young women look for a man who reminds them of their dad your dad fights monsters i fight monsters your dad rescued your mom from a dragon i rescued you from arctis tor seeing the pattern here she opened her mouth and then frowned at the firenot an angry frown a pensive one plus youve just been scared real good you dont have any place to stay and im the guy who is trying to help you i shook my head but even if there wasnt magic involved it still wouldnt happen ive done some things im not proud of but im never going to take advantage of your trust what were going to have is not a relationship of equals i teach you learn i tell you to do something you damned well do it a touch of sullen teenagerness gleamed in her eyes dont even think it i said molly getting pierced and dyed and tattooed just because you want to break the rules is one thing but what were dealing with now isnt the same thing a botched dye job affects you you botch the use of magic and someonemaybe a lot of someonesgets hurt so you do what i say when i say it and you do it because you dont want to kill someone or you can die that was our deal and you agreed to it she said nothing her anger had faded from her face but that sullen trace of rebellion remained i narrowed my eyes clenched my fist and hissed a single word the fireplace flared up in a sudden fiery cyclone molly flinched back from it one arm lifted to protect her eyes when she lowered it i was hunkered down right in her face im not your parents kid i said and you dont have time to play teenage rebel anymore this is the deal you do what i say or you dont survive i leaned closer and gave her the look i usually save for rampaging demons and those survey people at malls molly is there any doubt in your mindany doubt at allthat i cant damn well make you do it she swallowed the hard knot of defiance in her eyes suddenly shattered like a diamond struck at precisely the correct angle and she shivered in the blanket no sir she said in a tiny voice i nodded at her she sat there shivering and frightened which had been the point of the exercise to knock her off balance while she was still unsteady from recent events and drive home the notion of what she faced it was absolutely necessary that she understand how things had to play out until she got her power under control anything less than willing cooperation would kill her but it was hard to remember that staring down at her as she shivered and stared at the fire its light turning tears to gold on her cheeks heartbreaking really she was still so damned young so i crouched down and gave her that hug its all right to be scared kid but dont worry everythings going to be all right she leaned against me shivering i let her for a moment and then got up and said get dressed and get your things why she asked i arched an eyebrow at her she flushed took the robe and hurried back into the bedroom i had my coat on and was ready to go when she was i led her out to the car and we took off can i ask you a question i hope so its going to take you a long time to learn if you cant she smiled a little where are we going your new digs i said she frowned at me but settled back in her seat oh we pulled up to the carpenter house ablaze with lights despite the hour oh no molly muttered tell me youre kidding me youre moving back in but i continued over her as if she hadnt spoken not only that but youre going to do everything in your power to be the most respectful loving respectful considerate and respectful daughter in the whole wide world especially where your mom is concerned she stared at me with her jaw hanging oh i added and youre going back to high school until youre finished she stared at me for a long time then blinked and said i died and this is hell i snorted if you cant control yourself well enough to finish a basic education and get along with a houseful of people who love you then you sure as hell cant control yourself enough to use what i need to teach you but but think of your homecoming as an extended lesson in respect and selfcontrol i said cheerfully ill be checking up with your parents at least weekly youll do lessons with me every day until school is back in and then ill give you reading and homework for the homework she half wailed dont interrupt the homework will only be on weekdays well do lessons on friday and saturday evenings friday and satur she trailed off into a sigh and slumped hell i am in hell it gets better i take it that youre sexually active she stood there with her mouth hanging open come on molly this is important do you boink her face turned pink and she hid her face in her hands i i well im a virgin i arched an eyebrow at her she glanced up at me blushed more and added technically technically i said urn ive explored most of the bases i see i said well magellan no baserunning or boldly going where no man has gone before for younot until you get yourself grounded sex makes things complicated and for you that could be bad but and no ah solo exploration either she blinked at me and asked in a blank tone why youll go blind i said and walked up to her front porch youre joking she said and then hurried to catch up thats a joke right harry i marched her up to her house without answering her molly wore a hopeless look on her face as though she envied a condemned criminal who could at least hope that the governor might call at the last minute but when the doors opened and her familys delight washed over her in a roar like a breaking wave she smiled from her eyes all the way down to her toes i made polite chat for a minute until mouse limped over to me smiling and wagging his tail there was something on his muzzle that i suspected to be honey mustard or maybe buffalo sauce doubtless slipped to him by a young accomplice i clipped his lead on him and took my leave heading back to my car before i got there charity caught up with me i arched an eyebrow at her and waited while she fidgeted and finally asked did you tell them about what i was of course not i said she slumped a little in relief oh youre welcome i said she frowned at me and said if you hurt my little girl ill come down to that little closet you call an office and throw you out the window do you understand death by defenestration gotcha a few tiny cracks developed in her frown and then she shook her head sharply once caught me in a hug that made my ribs ache and went back into the house without another word mouse sat there panting and grinning happily i went home and got some sleep i was working in my lab the next day trying to make notes of all that had happened so that i wouldnt forget anything bob sat on the table next to me helping me with the details oh he said i found something wrong with little chicagos design i swallowed oh wow bad extremely we missed a transition coupling in the power flow the stored energy was all going to the same spot i frowned thats like a surge of electricity going through a circuit breaker right or a fuse box exactly like that bob said except that you were the fuse that much energy in one spot will blow your head off your shoulders but it didnt i said but it didnt bob agreed how is that possible it isnt he said someone fixed it what are you sure it didnt fix itself bob said when i looked at it a few nights ago the flawed section was in plain sight even if i didnt recognize it at the time when i looked again tonight it was different someone changed it in my lab under my house which is behind my wards thats impossible no it isnt bob said just really really really really really really difficult and unlikely he would have had to know that you had a lab down here and he would have had to know how to get around your wards plus intimate knowledge of the design to tinker with it like that i said to say nothing of the fact that he would have to know it existed at all and no one does really really unlikely bob agreed dammit hey i thought you loved a good mystery harry i shook my head and started to tell him where to stick his mystery when someone knocked at the door murphy stood on the other side and smiled at me hey she held up my shotgun thomas wanted me to bring this by said to tell you he was getting his own toys from now on she offered it and i took it frowning he didnt even clean it off she smiled i swear dresden you can be such a pansy its because im a sensitive guy you want to come in she gave me another smile but shook her head no time got to see the first shrink in half an hour ah i said how are things playing out oh theres a long investigation and evaluation to be done she said officially of course of course i said but unofficially she shrugged im losing si theyre busting me down to detective sergeant i winced whos getting the job stallings most likely hes the next most experienced better record than most of the department and hes respected she looked away im losing my seniority too all of it so theyre partnering me with their most experienced detective which is that i asked rawlins she said her mouth moving in a tight smile he did so good on this one they promoted him to si no good deed goes unpunished i said aint that the truth murphy sighed that a bad thing he seems like a decent guy he is he is murphy said scrunching up her nose but he knew my father oh i said and its possible you have issues remotely she said what about you you okay i met her eyes for a second and then looked away i uh ill be okay she nodded and then simply stepped forward and hugged me my arms went around her without me telling them to do it it wasnt a tense meaningladen hug she was my friend she was exhausted and worried and suffering and shed had what she valued most sullied and stained but she was worried about me giving me a hug assuring me by implication that everything was going to be all right i gave as good as i got for a while when we broke the embrace it was at the same time and it wasnt awkward she smiled at me just a little bittersweet and glanced at her watch i have to get moving right i said thanks murph she left a while later my phone rang i answered it everything work out thomas asked with the girl pretty much i told him you all right yeah he said need anything like maybe to talk about how he was feeding on people again and making money at the same time not especially he told me i was pretty sure he had heard the unasked question because his tone of voice carried an unyielding coolness telling me not to push thomas was my brother i could wait whats up with murphy he asked me i told him about her job he was silent for an annoyed second and then said but whats up with murphy i glowered and slouched down onto my couch there isnt anything up with her she isnt interested how do you know he asked she told me she told you she told me he sighed and you believed her well i said yes i had a talk with her when she drove me home he said a talk a talk i wanted to figure something out did you i asked yeah what that youre both stiffnecked idiots he said his tone annoyed and hung up on me i glowered at the phone for a minute muttered a couple of choice words about my half brother then got out my guitar and labored to make something resembling music for a while sometimes it was easier for me to think when playing and the time drifted by i played and mulled things over until someone else knocked i set my guitar aside and went to the door ebenezar stood on the other side and he gave me a nod and a cautious smile when i opened the door hot enough for you the old wizard asked almost i said come in he did and i grabbed a couple of beers offering him one whats up you tell me he said so i told him all about the last few days especially my dealings with lily and fix maeve and mab ebenezar listened to it all in silence what a mess he said when i finished tell me about it i sipped at my beer you know what i think he finished his beer and shook his head i think we got played by the summer lady i shook my head i think lily got suckered just as much as we did he frowned and rubbed at his head with one palm how so thats the part i cant figure i said i think someone set molly up to be a beacon for the fetches and im damned sure that it was no accident that those fetches took molly to arctis tor when it was so lightly defended someone wanted me there at arctis tor ebenezar pursed his lips who i think we got used by one of the queens to oneup one of the others somehow but damned if i can figure out how you think mab really is insane i think it would be hard to tell the difference i said in a sour voice lily thinks so but lily wasnt exactly widely famed for her intellect before she became the summer lady i shook my head if mab really is loopy its going to be bad the old man nodded and since you cant swing a cat without hitting a catspaw lately i think maybe someone was trying to use mab for something like all the others whove gotten set up around here setup i nodded yeah starting with victor sells a few years ago then those fbi creeps with the wolf belts i think that someone out there wants to get things done without getting his or her ebenezar said or her own hands dirty i continued consider all these things running around with more power than they should have had or better connected than they should have been the shadowman the hexenwulfen the nightmare the last summer ladyand thats just for starters the red court sure are a hell of a lot more dangerous than anyone thought they would be ebenezar frowned nodding i think whoever is backstage moving things around tried to use mab and got more than they bargained for i think thats what the attack on arctis tor was about maybe they tried to put her down before she turned on them which she would ebenezar said of course she would shes mab shed keep any bargain she made but she isnt the kind who takes orders real well go on boy ebenezar said gently youve got facts where do they lead you i lowered my own voice to a whisper a new power is moving around out there something big smart strong and sneaky as hell something with a lot of strength and magical knowhow i licked my lips put that together with the evidence of varied powers wolf belts handed out to those poor fbi bastards black magic being taught to smalltimers like the shadowman and the nightmare vampires crosstraining one another in sorcery hellfire used on arctis tor and of course the white councils highly placed traitor all of that together doesnt point to just one person it indicates an organization i regarded the old man steadily and theyve got wizards on the staff probably several of them ebenezar grunted damn damn i was hoping maybe i was starting to go senile but i came to the same conclusion he nodded boy dont breathe a word of this not to anyone i got the feeling that this is information worth as much as your life he shook his head let me think about who else needs to know rashid i said in a firm voice tell the gatekeeper ebenezar frowned though it looked more weary than anything else likely he knows already knew already maybe even pointed you in a direction that would show you more assuming he wasnt simply using you to poke a hornets nest and see what flew up which was somewhat creepy to think about if ebenezar was right i could count myself among the pawns in play courtesy of the gatekeeper you dont want to tell him i asked rashid is a tough one to figure ebenezar said three four years ago i wouldnt have thought twice but with all thats happened since simon died he shrugged better to be cautious we cant put the genie back in the bottle once its out or maybe thats the worst thing we could do i said maybe its what these black council assholes are counting on he looked up at me sharply now why would you call them that black council i shrugged if the shoe fits its better than the legion of doom he regarded me for a moment more and then shrugged times are changing hoss thats for sure he polished off his beer but they always do i know youre going to do what you think you need to do but id like to ask that you be very cautious hoss we still dont know what our enemies look like that means well have to bring in our allies carefully meaning without troubling the white council and the wardens about it i asked my tone dry he grunted in the affirmative dont forget the other loose end i frowned and thought back over it huh i said youre right who was driving that car that ran into me exactly he said more mysteries thought you were a professional investigator hoss he teased for you this should be fun yeah fun fun fun fun im having fun already he smiled mmmmph it isnt good news that winter isnt going to stand with us against the reds but it could have been worse and we learned something valuable i grunted the traitor to the council someone had to tell the reds where luccios boot camp was hidden yes he said and leaned forward and outside of luccio only four people knew i arched my brows at him morgan thats one he agreed injun joe the merlin and ancient mai were the only others i whistled slowly heavy hitters but knock morgan off your list he didnt do it ebenezar arched his brows no i shook my head guy is a dick i said but hes on the level we shouldnt tell him but hes no traitor ebenezar frowned for a moment and then nodded slowly very well then ill vouch for injun joe so what comes next i asked him watching them he said waiting not letting on that we know we wont get more than one chance to take them off guard when we do move we got to make it hurt i frowned at my nowempty bottle and nodded we wait lie in the weeds keep a low profile got it hoss my old teacher said quietly what you did for that girl yeah i said waving a hand stupid the merlin is going to be royally pissed at me hell probably start insisting i go on shooting missions now in hopes someone will take me out and remove a thorn in his side true ebenezar said but what i meant to say was that what you did was damned brave from what i hear you were ready to take on everyone there if you had to wouldnt have lasted long no but then that wasnt the point he rose a little stiffly and said im proud of you boy something inside me melted you know i said you always told me you werent at my trial that the council saddled you with me because you skipped out i think that isnt true he grunted it was all in latin which i didnt understand then and i had that hood over my head so i couldnt see anyone but someone had to have defended me the way i did molly could be he rolled one shoulder in a shrug im getting old hoss i forget things ah i said you know ive missed a meal or three lately and i know this little joint thats got the best spaghetti in town ebenezar froze in place like a man walking on ice who suddenly hears cracking sounds oh he asked tone careful theyve got this great bread that goes with it too and its right by the campus so cute waitresses sounds promising ebenezar said makes me feel a mite hungry hearing about it absolutely i said let me get my shoes if we hurry we can get there before the evening rush we looked at each other for a long moment and my old teacher bowed his head to me it conveyed a lot of things apology gratitude happiness forgiveness affection pride you want me to drive us he asked i bowed my head in reply id like that sir authors note when i was seven years old i got a bad case of strep throat and was out of school for a whole week during that time my sisters bought me my first fantasy and scifi novels the boxed set of lord of the rings and the boxed set of

citizen of the united states and lankhmar narnia gor cimmeria krynn amberyou get the picture when i set out to become a writer i spent years writing swordsandhorses fantasy novelsand seemed to have little innate talent for it but i worked at my writing branching out into other areas as experiments including sf mystery and contemporary fantasy thats how the dresden files initially came aboutas a
