james rollins deep fathom prologue the day of the eclipse tuesday july i before am pacific standard time san francisco california on the morning of the eclipse doreen mccloud hurried from starbucks with the chronicle tucked under her arm she had a ten oclock meeting across town and less than an hour to ride the train to her offices near the embarcadero clutching her mocha and shivering at the morning chill she strode briskly toward the underground station at market and castro glancing toward the sky she frowned the nights blanket of fog had yet to burn off and the sun was only a pale glow through the mists the eclipse was due to occur just after the four oclock hour today the first solar eclipse of the new millennium it would be a shame if the fog marred the sight she knew from the inundation in the media that the entire city was poised to celebrate the event san francisco could not pass up such an auspicious occasion without the usual fanfare doreen shook her head at all the nonsense with san franciscos damned eternal fog why did a few extra moments of gloom warrant such fervency the event was not even a total eclipse sighing she pushed aside these stray thoughts as she snugged her scarf tighter about her neck she had more important concerns if she could land the delta bank account her track to partnership in the firm was assured she allowed this thought to buoy her across market street toward the bart station she reached the station just as the next train approached fumbling her transit card through the reader she hurried down the steps to the platform and waited for the train to come to a stop content she would make her meeting in plenty of time she raised the cup of mocha to her mouth a yank on her elbow pulled the cup from her lips hot mocha splashed in a chocolate arc as the cup flew from her hands gasping she swung around and faced her attacker an elderly woman dressed in mismatched rags and a tattered blanket stared up at doreen with eyes that looked somewhere other than here doreen had a flashback to her mother in bed the reek of urine and medicines slacken features and those same empty eyes alzheimers she stepped back reflexively guarding her handbag under an arm but the old woman clearly homeless seemed no immediate threat doreen expected the usual inquiry about spare change instead the woman continued to stare at her with those empty eyes doreen took another step away a twinge of sorrow pierced through her anger and fear the eyes of the other commuters slowly turned away it was the way of the city dont look too closely she tried to follow suit but could not maybe it was the flash upon her own longburied mother or some twinge of sympathy but either way she found herself speaking can i help you the old woman shifted doreen spotted a halfstarved terrier pup hidden among the drape of rags about her ankles it stuck close to its master doreen could count every rib on the thin creature the homeless woman noticed doreens gaze brownie knows she said hoarsely her voice graveled by age and the streets he knows all right doreen nodded as if this made sense it was best not to provoke the mentally ill she had learned that with her mother im sure he does he tells me things you know doreen nodded again suddenly feeling foolish the train doors opened with a whoosh behind her if she didnt want to miss the train shed best hurry she began to turn away when a withered arm shot out from under the tattered blanket bony fingers clutched her wrist instinctively doreen yanked her arm away but to her surprise the old woman hung on with a shuffle of rags the woman moved closer brownies a good dog the harsh voice was thick with spittle he knows hes a good dog doreen broke the womans grip ii must be going the woman did not resist her arm vanished under her blankets folds doreen backed her way into the open door of the train her eyes still on the old woman left alone the woman seemed to recede into her rags and tormented dreams doreen found the pups eyes staring back at her as the train doors closed doreen heard the homeless woman muttering brownie he knows he knows were all gointo die today pm pst am local time aleutian islands alaska on the morning of the eclipse jimmy pomautuk worked his way up the icy slope with practiced care his dog nanook trotted a few paces up the trail the large malamute knew the trail well but always the loyal companion he still kept wary watch for his master trudging after the old dog jimmy led a trio of english tourists two men and a woman toward the summit of glacial point atop fox island the view from there was spectacular his inuit forefathers had come to this same spot to worship the great orca building wooden totems and casting worship stones off the cliffs into the sea his greatgrandfather had been the first to take him as a boy to this sacred spot that had been almost thirty years ago now the spot was listed on countless tour maps and the zodiac boats from the various cruise lines offloaded their human cargo onto the docks of the picturesque village of port royson in addition to the quaint port the other prime attraction to the island was the cliffs of glacial point on a clear day like today the entire aleutian chain of islands could be seen spreading in an infinite arc it was a sight considered priceless to his ancestors but to the modern world it was forty dollars a head offseason sixty dollars during the warmer months how much bloody further is this place a voice behind him said im freezing my arse off here jimmy turned he had warned the trio that the temperature would grow colder as they neared the summit the group was outfitted in matching eddie bauer coats gloves and boots not a stitch of their expensive outwear showed any use a price tag still dangled from the back of the womans parka pointing an arm toward where his dog had just vanished jimmy nodded its just over the next rise five minutes theres a warming shack there the complainer checked his watch and grunted jimmy rolled his eyes and continued his march up the hill if it werent for the tip as their guide hed be tempted to heave the whole lot of them over the cliffs a sacrifice to the ocean gods of his ancestors but instead like always he just trudged onward reaching the summit at last behind him he heard gasps from the trio the view had that effect on most people jimmy turned to give them his usual speech about the significance of this site but he found his companions attention was not on the spectacular views but on their hurried attempts to wrap every square inch of exposed flesh from the mild winds its so cold the second man said i hope my camera lens doesnt shatter id hate to have trekked all the way up to this cursed place and have nothing to show for it jimmys fingers clenched into a fist he forced his tone to an even level the warming shack is nestled among that group of black pines why dont you all go on in weve got a bit of a wait before the eclipse thank god the woman said she leaned into the man who had first complained lets hurry reggie now it was jimmys turn to follow the english trio raced toward the scraggled copse of pines protected in a hollow as he marched nanook joined him nosing his hand for a scratch behind the ear good boy nanook he mumbled ahead jimmys gaze caught on the trail of smoke in the blue sky at least his son had completed his chores and set the coals this morning before leaving for the mainland off to celebrate the coming eclipse with friends for the oddest moment a melancholy wave washed over jimmy at the thought of his only son he couldnt identify why this sudden mood overwhelmed him he shook his head this place had that effect on him there always seemed a presence here maybe the gods of my forefathers he thought only half jokingly jimmy continued his way toward the warmth of the shack suddenly wanting to escape the cold as much as the tourists had his eyes followed the smoke trail up to the sun near the eastern horizon an eclipse what his ancestors described as a whale eating the sun it was due to occur in the next few hours at his side nanook suddenly growled a deepthroated rumble jimmy glanced to his dog the malamute stared out toward the south frowning he followed the line of his dogs gaze the cliffs were empty except for the wooden totem it was a mockup for the tourists tooled by machines somewhere in indonesia and shipped here not even the wood was native to these parts nanook continued his deepchested growl jimmy did not know what had spooked his dog quiet boy always obedient nanook settled onto his haunches but he still trembled squinting jimmy stared out at the empty sea as he stood an old prayer came to his lips taught to him by his grandfather he was surprised he even remembered the words and could not voice why he felt the need to speak them now in alaska to survive one learned to respect nature and ones own instincts and jimmy trusted his own now it was as if his grandfather stood at his shoulder two generations watching the sea his grandfather had a phrase for moments like now the wind smells of storms pm pst am local time hagatna territory of guam on the morning of the eclipse jeffrey hessmire cursed his bad luck as he hurried through the corridors of the governors mansion the first session of the summit had broken for an early brunch the dignitaries from the united states and the peoples republic of china would not reconvene until after the scheduled viewing of the eclipse during the break jeffrey as the junior aide had been assigned to type and photocopy the secretary of states notes from the mornings session then distribute them among the american delegation so while the other aides enjoyed the preeclipse buffet in the garden atrium and networked with the members of the presidential senior staff he would be playing stenographer he cursed his bad luck again what were they all doing out here in the middle of the pacific anyway hell would freeze over before any nuclear pact would ever be settled between the two pacific powers neither country was willing to bend especially on two critical points the president had refused to halt the extension of the countrys new stateoftheart missile defense system to include the protection of taiwan and the chinese premier had squashed any attempt to limit the proliferation of its own intercontinental nuclear warheads the entire weeks summit had succeeded only in managing to escalate tensions the single bright spot was on the first day when president bishop had accepted a gift from the chinese premier a lifesize jade sculpture of an ancient chinese warrior atop a war horse an exact replica of one of their famed terracotta statues from the city of xian the press had a field day taking pictures of the two heads of state beside the striking figure it had been a day full of promise that so far had not borne fruit as jeffrey passed into the suite of offices assigned to their delegation he flashed his security clearance at the guard who nodded coldly reaching his desk he collapsed into the leather seat though he resented such a menial task he would do his best carefully stacking the handwritten notes by his computer he set to work his fingers flew over the keyboard as he translated secretary elliots notes into clean crisp type as he worked his frustration fell away he became intrigued by this peek at the behinddoors politics of the summit it seemed the president was actually willing to bend on taiwan but he was haggling for the best price from the chinese government insisting on a moratorium on any future nuclear proliferation and chinese participation in the missile technology control regime which limited the export of missile knowledge elliot seemed to think this was attainable if they played their cards right the chinese did not want a war over taiwan all would suffer jeffrey was so caught up in the secretarys notes that he failed to hear someone approach until a small cough from behind startled him he swiveled his chair around and saw the tall silverhaired man he was dressed casually in shirt and tie with a suit jacket hung over one arm so what do you think mr hessmire jeffrey stood up so fast that his chair skittered backward across the floor bumping into a neighbors vacant desk mmister president at ease mr hessmire the president of the united states daniel r bishop leaned over jeffreys desk and read the partial transcription of the secretarys notes what do you think of toms thoughts the secretary mr elliot the president straightened giving jeffrey a tired smile yes youre studying international law at georgetown arent you jeffrey blinked he had not thought president bishop knew him from the hundreds of other aides and interns who labored in the belly of the white house yes mr president i graduate next year top of the class and specializing in asia i hear so what is your take on the summit do you think we can wrangle the chinese into an agreement licking his lips jeffrey could not meet the steelblue eyes of daniel bishop the war hero the statesman and the leader of the free world his words were mumbled speak up lad i wont bite your head off i just want your honest opinion why do you think i asked tom to assign you to this task shocked at this revelation jeffrey could not speak breathe mr hessmire jeffrey took the presidents recommendation taking a deep breath he cleared his throat and tried to organize his thoughts he spoke slowly ii think secretary elliot makes a good point about the mainlands desire to economically integrate taiwan he glanced up pausing to take another breath i studied the takeovers of hong kong and macau it seems that the chinese are using these regions as test cases for the integration of democratic economies within a communist structure some suggest these experiments are in preparation for chinas attempt to negotiate taiwans reintegration to demonstrate how such a union could benefit all and what of the growing nuclear arsenal in china jeffrey spoke more rapidly warming to the discussion their nuclear and missile technologies were stolen from us but chinas current manufacturing infrastructure is well behind their ability to utilize these newest technologies in many ways they are still an agrarian state illsuited for rapid nuclear proliferation and your assessment the chinese have witnessed how such proliferation bankrupted the soviet union they would not want to repeat the same mistake in the next decade china needs to bolster its own technological infrastructure if it hopes to maintain its global position it cant afford a pissing contest with the united states over a nuclear arsenal a pissing contest jeffreys eyes grew wide he turned crimson im sorry the president held up a hand no i appreciate the analogy jeffrey suddenly felt like a fool what nonsense had he been spouting how dare he think his views warranted president bishops time the president straightened from the desk and slipped into his jacket i think youre right mr hessmire neither country wants to finance a new cold war no sir jeffrey mumbled softly there may be hope to settle this matter before our relations sour further but itll take a deft hand the president strode toward the door finish your work here mr hessmire and join us for the festivities in the atrium you shouldnt miss the first solar eclipse of this new millennium jeffrey found his tongue too thick to reply as the president exited the room he fumbled for his chair and sank into it president bishop had listened to himhad agreed with him thanking the stars for such good fortune jeffrey sat up straighter and returned to his work with renewed vigor this day promised to be one to remember ii during pm pacific standard time san francisco california from the balcony of her office building doreen mccloud stared out over san francisco bay the view extended all the way to the piers she could even see the crowds gathered at ghirardelli square where a party was under way but the crowds below failed to hold her attention instead she gazed above the bay at a onceinalifetime sight a black sun hung over the blue waters the corona flaming bright around the eclipsing moon wearing a sleek set of eclipse goggles purchased from sharper image doreen watched as jets of fire burst in long streams from the suns edge solar flares the astronomy experts on cnn had predicted a spectacular eclipse due to the unusual sunspot activity coinciding with the lunar event their predictions had proven true on either side of her gasps of delight and awe rose from the other lawyers and secretarial staff along flare blew forth from the suns surface a radio playing in the background burst with a stream of static proving true another of the astronomers predictions cnn had warned that the sunspot activity would cause brief interference as the solar winds bombarded the upper atmosphere doreen marveled at the black sun and its reflection in the bay what a wonderful time to be alive did anyone feel that one of the secretaries asked with mild concern then doreen sensed it a trembling underfoot everyone grew deathly quiet the radio squelched sharply with static clay flower pots began to rattle earthquake someone yelled needlessly after living for so many years in san francisco temblors were not a reason for panic still at the back of all minds was the fear of the big one everyone inside the head of the firm ordered in a mass the crowd surged toward the open doorway doreen held back she searched the skies above the bay the black sun hung over the waters like some hole in the sky she remembered then the one other prediction for this day she pictured the old homeless woman dressed in rags and her dog were all going to die today doreen backed from the balcony rail toward the open door under her heels the balcony began to rock and buck violently this was no minor quake hurry their boss commanded taking charge everyone get to safety doreen fled toward the interior offices but in her heart she knew no safety would be found there they were all going to die pm pst pm local time aleutian islands alaska from the cliffs of glacial point jimmy pomautuk stared at the eclipsing sun nanook paced restlessly at his side off to the left the trio from england shouted to one another in awe the cold long forgotten in the excitement the flash and whir of cameras peppered their exuberant outcries did you see that flare bloody christ these pictures are going to be fantastic sighing jimmy sank to his seat on the cold stone he leaned back against the wooden totem as he stared out at the black sun above the pacific the quality of the light was strange casting the islands in a starkness that seemed unreal even the sea itself had turned glassy with a bluishsilver sheen at his side nanook again began a soft growl the dog had been spooky all morning he must not understand what had happened to the sunlight its just the hungry whale spirit eating the sun he consoled the dog in a low whisper he reached for nanook but found the dog gone frowning jimmy glanced over his shoulder the large malamute stood trembling a few paces away the dog did not stare at the sun above the pacific but off to the north my god jimmy stood up following nanooks gaze the entire northern skies darkened by the eclipse were lit with waves and eddies of glowing azures and vibrant reds they spread from the northern horizon to climb high in the sky jimmy knew what he was viewing the aurora borealis the northern lights in all his life he had never seen the magnitude of this display the lights swirled and churned in sweeping waves like a glowing sea in the sky one of the englishmen spoke drawn by jimmys shocked outburst i thought the borealis wasnt seen this time of year its not jimmy answered quietly the englishwoman eileen moved closer to jimmy a camera glued to her face its beautiful almost better than the eclipse the solar flares must be causing this her companion answered showering the upper atmosphere with energized particles jimmy remained silent to the inuit the appearance of the northern lights was fraught with omens and significance a borealis in the summer was considered a harbinger of disaster as if hearing his inner thought the totem trembled under jimmys palm nanook began to whine something his dog never did is the ground shaking eileen asked finally lowering her camera with a look of concern as answer a violent quake suddenly shook the island with a stifled scream eileen fell to her hands and knees the two englishmen went to her aid jimmy kept his feet fingers still clutching the wooden totem what are we going to do the woman screamed itll be fine her friend consoled well ride it out jimmy stared at the islands bathed in that otherworldly light oh god he whispered a prayer of thanks that his son had left for the mainland out in the pacific the most distant islands of the aleutian chain were sinking into the depths like gigantic sea beasts submerging under the waves at long last the gods of the sea had come to claim these islands pm pst am local time hagatna territory of guam in the garden atrium of the governors mansion jeffrey hessmire stared in awe at the total eclipse of the sun though he had seen partial eclipses during his twentysix years he had never witnessed a total one the island of guam had been chosen for the summit because of its position as the only american territory in the path of full totality jeffrey was thrilled at the chance to witness this rare sight he had finished typing and photocopying the secretary of states notes with enough time left over to catch the tail end of the solar spectacle wearing a pair of cheap eclipseviewing glasses jeffrey stood with the other us delegates by the west entrance to the gardens the chinese faction huddled on the far side of the atrium there was little mingling between the two groups as if the pacific still separated them ignoring the tension in the atrium jeffrey continued to watch the suns corona flare in violent bursts around the shadowed moon a few of the flares jetted far into the dark sky a voice spoke at his shoulder wondrous isnt it jeffrey turned to find the president directly behind him again president bishop jeffrey began to take off his glasses leave them on enjoy the view another is not expected for two decades yyes sir jeffrey slowly returned to his study of the sky the president also staring up spoke softly at his side to the chinese an eclipse is a warning that the tides of fate are about to change significantly either for the better or the worse it will be for the better jeffrey answered for both our peoples president bishop clapped him on the shoulder the optimism of youth i should have you speak to the vice president he finished the statement with a derisive snort jeffrey understood this response lawrence nafe the vice president held his own views on how to handle one of the last communist strongholds while outwardly supporting bishops diplomatic attempt to resolve the chinese situation behind the scenes nafe argued for a more aggressive stance youll succeed in ironing out an agreement jeffrey said im sure of it theres that damned optimism again the president began to turn away nodding at a signal from the secretary of state with a tired sigh he clapped jeffrey on the shoulder again it seems its time once again to try mending fences between our two countries as president bishop stepped away the ground started to shake underfoot jeffrey felt the presidents grip on his shoulder tighten both men fought to keep their feet earthquake jeffrey yelled all around them the sound of breaking glass rattled jeffrey looked up shielding his face with an arm all the windows of the governors mansion had shattered several members of the delegation those nearest the walls of the atrium were on the ground lacerated and bleeding amid the shower of shards jeffrey thought to go to their aid but he feared abandoning the president across the atrium the chinese members of the summit were fleeing inside the governors mansion seeking shelter mr president we need to get you to safety jeffrey said the rumbling grew worse underfoot an ice sculpture of a longnecked swan toppled flanked by two burly secret service agents the secretary of state fought his way through the terrified crowd to join them once there tom elliot grabbed the presidents elbow he had to yell to be heard above the rumbling and crashing cmon dan lets get you back to air force one if this islands coming apart i want you out of here bishop shook off the mans hand but i cant leave somewhere to the east there was a loud explosion drowning out all conversation a fireball blew into the sky jeffrey spoke up first sir you have to go the presidents face remained tight with concern and worry jeffrey knew the man had served in vietnam and was not one to run from adversity you must tom added you cant risk yourself dan you dont have that luxury anymorenot since you took the oath of office the president bowed under the weight of their argument the temblors grew worse cracks skittered up the brick walls of the mansion fine lets go he said tightly but i feel like a coward i ordered the limo to meet you out back the secretary said then turned to jeffrey as the president strode away with the pair of secret service agents in tow stay with bishop get him on board that plane whatwhat about you tom backed a step away im going to round up as many of our delegation as possible and herd them to the airport but before he turned away he fixed jeffrey with a stern stare make sure that plane takes off if there is even the slightest risk of trapping the president here dont wait for us jeffrey swallowed hard and nodded then hurried off once at the presidents side jeffrey heard the man mumble as he stared at the eclipsed sun it seems the chinese were right iii and the aftermath pm pacific standard time san francisco california as night neared doreen mccloud worked her way through the broken asphalt toward russian hill rumors told of a salvation army refugee camp up there she prayed it was true thirsty hungry she shivered in the cold as the eternal fog of the bay crept over the ravaged city the earthquakes had finally ended except for the occasional aftershock but the damage had been done exhausted legs trembling doreen glanced over her shoulder and stared out at what once had been a handsome city shining above the bay the stench of smoke and soot clung to everything fires underlit the mists creating a reddish halo over the devastation from here san francisco lay shattered all the way to the water huge chasms cracked the city as if a giant hammer had struck emergency sirens still echoed but there was nothing left to save only a handful of buildings were undamaged most others lay toppled or stood with their facades fallen away to reveal the ravaged rooms within doreen had grown numb to the number of bodies she had crossed on her way to higher ground bleeding from a scalp wound she had escaped almost unscathed but her heart ached for the families gathered around burned homes and broken bodies but she shared the one feature she saw in all she passed eyes deadened from pain and shock a flare of light appeared atop the next hill not fire but clear white light hope surged surely this was the salvation armys camp she continued onward her stomach growling her pace hurried oh please she climbed and crawled her way forward rounding an overturned bus she came upon the source of the bright light a crowd of men dirty and ashfouled were digging through the remains of a hardware store they had a crate of flashlights open and were passing them around as night rapidly approached a source of light would be essential doreen stumbled toward them perhaps they would give her one two of the men glanced her way she met their gazes mouth open to ask for aid then saw the hardness in their eyes she stopped realizing that the men wore identical clothes there were numbers stitched across their backs under the words california municipal penal system convicts wide grins spread across the mens faces she turned to flee but found one of the escaped prisoners standing behind her she tried to strike him but he knocked her arm aside and slapped her on the face hard driving her to her knees blinded by pain and shock doreen heard the approach of others behind her no she moaned curling into a ball leave her one of them barked we dont have time we wanna be out of this fuckin city before the national guard hauls in here grumbles met this response but doreen heard the scuff of heels as her attackers backed away she started crying relieved and terrified the leader stepped in front of her tearyeyed she lifted her face ready to thank him for his mercy instead she found herself staring into the muzzle of a handgun the leader yelled back toward the ravaged store grab any extra ammo and dont forget the camp stoves and butane without ever looking down at her he pulled the trigger doreen heard the crack of the weapon felt her body flung backward then the world was gone pm pst pm local time aleutian islands alaska as night approached jimmy pomautuk clung to the totem pole depicting his ancestors gods where once it had stood proudly atop the heights of glacial point it now floated in the sea bobbing in the waves jimmy clung to it he tried his best to keep his body above the waterline but the waves constantly tried to wash him from his perch atop the totem hours ago he had hacked the totem from its cement base as the water rose up the cliff face of glacial point the island had sunk surprisingly smoothly giving him plenty of time to use a hand ax from the warming shed to free the length of wood once the waters had neared the summit he flung it over the edge the trio of english tourists had long since fled down the path toward port royson jimmy had tried to stop them but they wouldnt listen panic had made them deaf alone he had leaped from the cliff and swam out to the floating totem only nanook the large malamute had remained at the cliffs edge unsure what to do stalking back and forth jimmy could not save his old dog he knew it would be hard enough for him to survive with a heavy heart he had straddled the totem and begun paddling toward the distant mainland nanooks bark echoed over the waters until the island vanished fully behind him as if his guilt plagued him now he heard the barking again but it was no ghost twisting around he saw something splashing toward him from several yards away jimmy spotted the flash of black and white fur joy and concern mixed in his heart the old dog had refused to give up and as much as jimmy tried to remain practical he knew he would do what he could to rescue it cmon nanook he yelled through chattering teeth get your wet butt over here a smile cracked his blue lips as a bark answered him then he saw something rise from the waves behind his paddling dog a long black fin too tall for a shark orca killer whale jimmys heart clenched he reached a hand toward his dog but it was useless the fin sank away jimmy held his breath praying to the old gods to spare his companion abruptly a burst of whitewater erupted around the dog nanook whined sensing his doom then the great dog vanished into a surge of bloody froth the black fin rose briefly then sank away motionless jimmy floated on his manmade log fingers clinging to images of his ancestors gods bear eagle and orca silence loomed over the sea the ocean had quickly settled leaving no evidence of the savage attack jimmy felt hot tears flowing down his frozen cheeks in grief he rested his forehead against the wood the character of the light changed then jimmy lifted his face the darkening skies now blazed an unnatural red craning his neck he saw the source off to the left a rescue flare high in the sky and in the glaring brightness he spotted a coast guard cutter gliding through the waters he sat up waving an arm and yelling help he fought to keep his balance on the bobbing wood a short beep of a horn answered him then faint words reached him from a megaphone we see you stay where you are lowering his arm jimmy settled closer to his pole he let out a long sigh of relief then he sensed it the presence of something nearby he turned his head to stare forward another long black dorsal fin surfaced directly in front of him its forward edge brushing the end of the wood nudging it testing it jimmy slowly pulled his feet from the water then on his left another fin aroseand another the pod of killer whales slowly circled him jimmy knew the cutter would never arrive in time he was right something struck the underside of the totem jolting it a full yard into the air and he went flying fingers scrambling for wood he struck the ocean and sank he was already so cold that he barely felt the icy chill he opened his eyes under the water salt burning in the flares fiery light jimmy saw the huge shadows still circling he tried not to move though his frozen lungs screamed for air he allowed his natural buoyancy to float him toward the surface before he reached the waves one of the shadows moved nearer for a moment he stared back into a fistsized black eye then his head broke the surface jimmy bent his neck and gasped for a breath of air the coast guard cutter bore toward his position at full speed the crew members must have seen the attack jimmy closed his eyes too far something clamped on his legs no pain only a fierce tightness his limbs were too frozen to feel the teeth as the coast guard spotlight swept over him his body was yanked away dragged into the depths by the gods of his ancestors pm pst pm local time boeing b cruising at feet en route from guam in the paneled conference room aboard air force one jeffrey hessmire watched the president respond to the worldwide emergency gathered around the table were his senior staff and advisors give me a quick summary tom how extensive were the quakes secretary of state elliot his left arm splinted and carried in a sling sat to the presidents right jeffrey noticed the morphine glaze to tom elliots eyes but the man remained remarkably alert and sharp onehanded he shuffled through the ream of printouts atop the table its too early to get any clear answers but it appears the entire pacific rim was affected reports are coming in from as far south as new zealand and as far north as alaska also from japan and china in the east and from the entire western coast of central and south america and the united states any further word toms face grew grim reports remain chaotic san francisco is still experiencing hourly aftershocks los angeles is burning tom glanced down at one sheet and seemed unwilling to report what lay there the entire aleutian island chain of alaska is gone shocked murmuring rose from around the table is that possible the president asked its been confirmed by satellite tom said softly were also finally getting reports from hawaii he glanced up from his pile of papers tidal waves struck the islands forty minutes after the initial quakes honolulu is still underwater the hotels of waikiki lay toppled like dominoes as the litany of tragedies continued the presidents face drained of color his lips drew in to tight lines jeffrey had never seen president bishop look so old so many dead jeffrey heard him mutter under his breath tom finally finished his report detailing the explosion of a volcanic peak near seattle the city lay under three feet of ash the ring of fire jeffrey whispered to himself he was overheard president bishop turned to him what was that mr hessmire jeffrey found all eyes turning to him ththe pacific rim has also been nicknamed the ring of fire because of its extensive geological activity earthquakes volcanic eruptions the president nodded swinging back to tom yes but why now why so suddenly what triggered this geologic explosion throughout the pacific tom shook his head were still a long way from investigating that question right now we must dig our country out of the rubble the joint chiefs and cabinet are convening by order of the vice president the office of emergency services is at full alert they just await our instructions then lets get to work gentlemen the president began weve the plane bucked under them several members of the staff were thrown from their seats the president kept his place what the hell was that tom swore as if hearing him the captain came on the intercom sorry for that little bump but weve run into some unexpected turbulence wewe may be in for a rough ride please secure your seat belts jeffrey heard the false cheer in the pilots voice worry rang behind his words the president whose eyes were narrowed glanced at tom ill check on it tom began to unbuckle his seat belt the president put a hand on toms injured arm restraining him he turned instead to jeffrey and motioned to a member of his security team you boys have better legs than us old men jeffrey unsnapped his seat buckle of course he stood and joined the bluesuited secret service agent at the door together they left the conference room and worked their way forward past the presidents suite of private rooms and toward the cockpit of the boeing as they neared the cockpit door jeffrey caught a flash of brilliance from out one of the side windows what was he started to ask when the plane tilted savagely jeffrey struck the port bulkhead and crashed to the floor he felt his eardrums pop through the door to the cockpit he heard frantic yells from among the flight crew screamed orders panic he pulled himself up his face pressed to the porthole window oh my god pm pst am local time air mobility command andrews air

only the perpetual darkness of the oceans abysmal deep the sole illumination came from a pair of xenon lamps set in the nose of his oneman submersible his new toy the nautilus was out on its first deepdive test the eightfoot titanium minisub was shaped like a fat torpedo topped by an acrylic plastic dome attached to its underside was a stainless steel frame that mounted the battery pods thruster assembly electrical can and lights ahead the brilliance of the twin lamps drilled a cone of visibility that extended a hundred feet in front of him he fingered the controls sweeping the arc back and forth searching out the corner of his eye he checked the analog depth gauge approaching fifteen hundred feet the bottom of the trench must be close his sonar reading on the computer screen confirmed his assessment no more than two fathoms the pings of the sonar grew closer and closer seated jacks head and shoulders protruded into the acrylic plastic dome of the hull giving him a panoramic view of his surroundings while the cabin was spacious for most men it was a tight fit for jacks sixfootplus frame its like driving an mg convertible he thought except you steer with your

of the left pedal the craft dove smoothly to the left lights swept forward ahead the seabed came into view appearing out of the endless gloom jack slowed his vehicle to a gentle glide as he entered a natural wonderland a deep ocean oasis under him fields of tubeworms lay spread across the valley floor of the midpacific mountain range riftia pachyptila the clusters of sixfootlong tubes with their bloodred worms were like an otherworldly topiary waving at him as he passed gently swaying in the current to either side on the lower slopes giant clams lay stacked shelltoshell open soft fronds filtering the sea among them stalked bright red galatheid crabs on long spindly legs movement drew jacks attention forward a thick eyeless eel slithered past teeth bright in the xenon lamp a school of curious fish followed next led by a large brown lantern fish the brazen fellow swam right up to the glass bubble a deepsea gargoyle ogling the strange intruder inside minuscule bioluminescent lights winked along the large fishs sides announcing its territorial aggression other denizens displayed their lights under him pink pulses ran through tangles of bamboo coral around the dome tiny bluegreen lights flashed the creatures too small and translucent to be seen clearly the sight reminded jack of flurries of fireflies from his tennessee childhood having lived all his young life in landlocked tennessee jack had instantly fallen in love with the ocean enthralled by its wide expanses its endless blue its changing moods a swirl of lights swarmed around the dome unbelievable he muttered to himself wearing a wide grin even after all this time the sea found ways to surprise him in response his radio earpiece buzzed what was that jack frowning jack silently cursed the throat microphone taped under his larynx even fifteen hundred feet under the sea he could not completely shut out the world above nothing lisa he answered just admiring the view hows the new sub handling perfectly are you receiving the biosensor readings jack asked touching the clip on his earlobe the laser spectrometer built into the clip constantly monitored his bloodgas levels dr lisa cummings had garnered a national science foundation grant to study the physiological effects of deepsea work respiration temperature cabin pressure oxygen supply ballast carbon dioxide scrubbers all green up here any evidence of seismic activity no all quiet two hours ago as jack had first begun his descent in the nautilus charlie mollier the geologist had reported strange seismic readings harmonic vibrations radiating through the deepsea mountain range for safetys sake he had suggested that jack return to the surface come watch the eclipse with us charlie had radioed earlier in his jamaican accent its spectacular mon we can always dive tomorrow jack had refused he had no interest in the eclipse if the quakes worsened he could always surface but during the long descent the strange seismic readings had faded away charlies voice over the radio had eventually lost its strained edge jack touched his throat mike so you all done worrying up there a pause was followed by a reluctant yes jack imagined the blond doctor rolling her eyes thanks lisa signing off time for a little privacy he yanked the biosensor clip from his earlobe it was a small victory the remainder of the biosensor system would continue to report on the subs environmental status but not his personal information at least it gave him a bit of isolation from the world above and this was what jack liked best about diving the isolation the peace the quiet here there was only the moment lost in the deep his past had no power to haunt him from the subs speakers the strange noises of the abysmal deep echoed through the small space a chorus of eerie pulses chirps and highfrequency squeals it was like listening in on another planet around him was a world deadly to surface dwellers endless darkness crushing pressures toxic waters but life somehow found a way to thrive here fed not by sunlight but by poisonous clouds of hydrogen sulfide that spewed from hot vents called black smokers jack glided near one of these vents now it was a thirtymetertall chimney stack belching dark clouds of mineralrich boiling waters from its top as he passed white clouds of bacteria were disturbed by his thrusters creating a miniblizzard behind him these microorganisms were the basis for life here microscopic engines that converted hydrogen sulfide into energy jack gave the chimney a wide berth still as his sub slid past he watched the external temperature readings climb quickly the vents themselves could reach temperatures over seven hundred degrees fahrenheit hot enough he knew to parboil him in his little sub jack the worried voice of the teams medical doctor again whispered in his ear she must have noticed the temperature changes just a smoker nothing to worry about he answered using the foot pedals he eased the minisub past the chimney stack and continued on a gentle dive following the trench floor though life down here fascinated him jack had a more important objective than just admiring the view for the past year he and his team aboard the deep fathom had been hunting for the wreck of the kochi maru a japanese freighter lost during wwii their research into its manifest suggested the ship bore a large shipment of gold bullion spoils of war from studying navigation and weather maps jack had narrowed the search to ten square nautical miles of the central pacific mountain range it had been a long shot a gamble that after a year had not looked like it was going to pay off until yesterday when their sonar had picked up a suspicious shadow on the oceans bottom jack was chasing that shadow now he glanced at the subs computer it fed him sonar data from his boat far overhead whatever had cast that shadow was about a hundred yards from his current position he flipped on his own sidescanning sonar to monitor the beds terrain as he moved closer a ridge of rock appeared out of the gloom he worked the pedals and swerved in a wide arc around the obstruction the abundant sea life began to dissipate the oasis vanishing behind him ahead the seabed floor became a stretch of empty silt his thrusters wafted up plumes as he passed like driving down a dusty back road jack circled the spur of rock ahead another ridge appeared a foothill in the central pacific range it blocked his progress he pulled the sub to a hovering halt and released a bit of ballast meaning to climb over the ridge as he began to drift upward a slight current caught his sub dragging him forward jack fought the current with his thrusters stabilizing his craft what the hell he nudged the craft forward skirting toward the top of the ridge jack lisa whispered in his ear again are you passing another smoker chimney im reading warmer temperatures no but im not sure what son of a bitch his sub had crested the ridge he saw what lay on the far side what is it jack fear quavered in lisas voice are you okay beyond the ridge a new valley opened up but this was no oasis of life ahead was a hellish landscape glowing cracks crisscrossed the sea floor molten rock flowed forth shadowy crimson in the gloom as it quickly cooled tiny bubbles obscured the view jack fought the thermal current the flow kept trying to roll him forward from the hydrophones speakers a steady roar arose my god jack what did you find the temp readings are climbing rapidly he needed no instruments to tell him that the interior of the sub grew warmer with each breath its a new vent opening a second voice came on the horn it was charlie the geologist careful jack im still picking up weak surges from down there its far from stable im not leaving yet you shouldnt risk jack interrupted ive found the kochi maru what the ship is herebut i dont know for how long as the sub hovered atop the ridge jack stared out the acrylic dome on the far side of the hellish valley lay the wreck of a long trawler its hull cracked into two sections in the dull glow the shattered windows of the pilothouse stared back at him on the bow were printed black japanese letters he was wellfamiliar with the name kochi maru spring wind but the name no longer fit the wreck around the ship molten rock welled and flowed forming ribbons and pools of magma steaming as it quickly cooled in the frigid depths the forward half of the ship lay directly over one of the vents jack watched as the steel ship began to sink melting into the magma its smack dab in the middle of hell jack reported im gonna get a closer look jack it was lisa again her voice hard with a pending command but she hesitated she knew him too well a long sigh followed just keep a watch on the external temp readings titanium isnt impervious to extreme temperatures especially the seals i understand no unnecessary risks jack pushed both foot pedals the sub shot off the ridge climbing higher at the same time as he glided toward the wreck he watched the temperature continue to rise seventyfiveone hundred sweat pebbled jacks forehead and his hands grew slick if one of the subs seals should weaken and break the crushing weight at this depth would kill him in less than a second he climbed higher until the temperature dropped below a hundred again satisfied he was safe he goosed the sub passing over the valley soon he hovered over the wreck itself tilting the sub on its side he circled the broken ship leaning a bit jack stared down at the wreck from this vantage point he could see the broken stern resting a full fifty yards from the bow the hollow cavity of the rear hold was turned away from the vents across the silt lit by the fiery glow of the nearby vents lay a scattering of crates half buried wood long turned to black from the decades it was submerged hows it looking jack lisa asked narrowing his eyes he studied the spilled contents of the wreck aint pretty thats for damn sure after a studied pause lisa came back on well i dont know i mortgaged the ship and the old family ranch to finance this trip to come up emptyhanded i know but all the gold in the worlds not worth your life he could not argue with that still he loved the old homestead the rolling green hills the whitewashed fences he had inherited the hundredacre ranch after his father died of pancreatic cancer jack had been only twentyone the debts had forced him out of the university of tennessee and into the armed services though he could have sold the place and finished school he had refused the land had been in the family for five generations but truthfully it was more personal than that by the time his father had passed away his mother was already long in her grave succumbing to complications from a simple appendectomy when he was a boy leaving no other children jack hardly remembered her just pictures on the wall and a handful of memories tied to the place no matter what he refused to lose even these slim memories to the bank lisa interrupted his reverie i could always try extending my nsf grant and scrounge up more funds it was her government money that had allowed them to lease the nautilus and test its patented biosensor system it wont be enough jack grumbled secretly he had hoped to garner sufficient funds from a successful haul here to clear his debts with a stash left over to finance a lifetime of treasure hunting that is if the kochi marus manifests were accurate jack ignored caution and obeyed his heart he shoved both foot pedals the submersible dove in a tight spiral down toward the broken stern of the kochi maru what would it hurt to take a fast peek the temperature gauge began to climb again he stopped looking jackthe readings i know im just going to take a closer look at the ship no risks at least replace your biosensor clip so i can monitor you jack wiped sweat from his eyes and sighed okay mother he slipped the sensor to his earlobe happy now ecstatic now dont kill yourself jack heard the worry behind her light words just keep one of those heinekens in the cooler for me will do as he neared the seabed jack lowered the sub behind the wrecks stern and edged toward the open rear hold the giant prop and screw dwarfed his vehicle even here life thrived the old hull draped in runnels of rust had become an artificial reef for mussels and coral clearing the keel he spun the sub and aimed his lights into the hold he glanced at the temperature reading one forty at least the rising heat had stabilized in the shadow of the ships bulk beyond the dark ship the seas radiated a fierce crimson as if an abysmal sun were rising nearby jack ignored the heat his back and seat now slick in his neoprene suit lifting the subs nose he pointed the xenon lamps into the heart of the dark hold two large eyes glared back at him from the holds cavern his heart jumped what the hell then the monster was upon him it sprang out of its manmade den long sinuous silver the sea serpent shot toward him mouth open in a silent scream of rage jack gasped scrambling for the controls to the subs hydraulic manipulator arms he waved the titanium arms trying to defend himself but mostly just flailing in his shock at the last moment the creature shied from his frantic waving and flashed past him jack watched its long silverscaled body rush past like a sinewy locomotive it had to be at least seventy feet long his tiny craft was buffeted by the creatures passage spinning in place jack craned his neck around and watched the creature flee disappearing into the midnight waters with a flick of its tapering tail now he recognized it for what it was a rare beast but no serpent it had clearly been as spooked by the chance encounter as he was jack forced his heart out of his throat swallowing hard goddamn he swore as he stabilized the sub spinning in the creatures wake whoever said there are no sea monsters static rasped in his ear sea monsters it was lisa again an orefish he explained god your heart rate almost doubled you must have a new voice interrupted the doctor it was robert bonaczek the groups marine biologist an orefish regalecus glesne he asked using the fishs latin name are you sure yep a big one seventy feet if its an inch did you get any pictures jack blushed remembering his panic as a former navy seal he knew his response to being attacked by a deepsea monster had been less than heroic he wiped his damp forehead nouh there was not enough time a shame so little is known no one suspected they lived so deep well this one was living large thats for damn sure made its home in the hold of the wreck jack moved his ship forward lights again delving into the interior crates lay stacked and broken everywhere the kochi maru had been heavily laden jack spotted where the orefish had nested a clearedout cubby near the back carefully he eased his sub into the open hold static buzzed in his ear jack imdont know mon jack recognized the geologists voice but the transmission was blocked by the walls of the hold as the sub glided inside it seemed even the vessels patented deepwater radio could not pierce three inches of iron jack touched his throat mike say again he received just static and garble frowning he eased off the thruster pedals meaning to retreat clear of the holds walls then his eyes caught a bright glint from deeper in the hold he glided the craft gently forward nose down his lamps now splayed the floor amid the crates against the far wall was a sight that drew a sharp whistle from him the swipe of the orefishs tail as it lunged from its nest had brushed free a few bricks black with algae from the top of an impressive pile the exposed section revealed the bricks deeper in the pile gold shining brighter than a caribbean sun in the reflection of the xenon lamps jack inched closer not believing his luck once in range he settled his hands on the controls to the external hydraulic manipulator arms having practiced at length he was familiar with their use manning the controls he extended the left arms pincers to their full length of fifteen feet he gripped one of the black bricks bringing it up to the light with the other arm he carefully scraped the surface gold there was no doubt he grinned widely and used the other arm to grab another brick then tapped his throat mike he had to tell topside static squelched sharply he had forgotten about the interference by the hull he backed the sub slowly careful not to get hung up on the debris meanwhile running through several different salvage scenarios float bags wouldnt work theyd have to hook a dredge to the sub and make a few hauls the sub finally cleared the hold and reentered open water he was instantly assaulted by someone yelling in his ear get out of there mon now jack get your ass away from there it was charlie panicked what is it jack yelled back he glanced at the external temperature reading it had climbed almost fifty degrees in the fever of discovering the gold he had failed to notice the rising temperature oh shit the seismic readings are spiking jack radiating out from your location haul ass youre sitting on the goddamn epicenter jacks navy training kicked in he knew when to obey orders he swung the submersible up and away chasing after cooler waters pushing the nautilus to its maximum speed of four knots jack craned his neck around damn the forward section of the kochi maru had melted halfway into the magma pool the crisscrossing of magma cracks had widened but the most ominous sight was how the seabed now bulged like a bubble about to burst jack had both pedals to the floor jerking the nose of the submersible toward the distant surface he blew all his ballast the thruster motors whined as he pushed them to the extreme damn damn damn he swore in a continuous litany jack somethings happening the readings are he heard it before he felt it a monstrous roaring from the hydrophones like thunder rolling through hills then the sub caught the shockwaves edge tumbling end over end jacks head struck the optical acrylic dome as he spun he caught fleeting glimpses of the seabed a flaming wound gaped below him magma blew forth spattering upward a volcano had opened directly under him as he flew upward spinning without control the seas around him began to boil bubbles as big as his sub bombarded his ship striking like fists he fought the thrusters to maintain some semblance of direction but was shaken and jarred about he tasted blood on his tongue he tried to raise the deep fathom yelling but static was his only response for what seemed an endless time he rode the chain of bubbles toward the surface fighting for control of the sub he had to get clear of the volcanic stream as his ship tumbled an idea came to him to survive a riptide a swimmer had to stop fighting it he lifted his foot off the right pedal and tapped only the left thrusters instead of trying to stop his spin he made the vehicle spin faster he was soon pinned to the port side of the sub by the centrifugal forces still he kept engaging just the left thrusters cmoncmon then one of the monster bubbles struck the undercarriage of the submersible the spinning sub tilted noseup the sudden shift pitched the craft end over like a skipping stone the nautilus shot free of the bubble stream as the subs tumble slowed jack pulled himself back into his seat his feet worked the pedals and halted the spin sighing in relief he aimed for the surface noting that the midnight waters had already lightened to a weak twilight craning his neck upward he saw the vague glow of the distant sun the static in his ear cleared jackanswer uscan you hear us jack replaced the throat mike the adhesive had torn away during his assault all clear here he said harshly jack the relief in lisas voice was like a cool spray of water where are you he checked the depth gauge two hundred twenty feet he couldnt believe his rate of ascent it was lucky his sub was a sealed oneatmosphere vehicle maintaining a constant internal pressure if not he would have died of the bends before now ill be surfacing in about three minutes glancing at his compass jack frowned the needle spun around as if still dizzy from the tumble he tapped at it but the needle continued to spin he gave up and touched his mike compass is fried not sure how far off i am but once up ill hit the gps beacon so you can track me and what about you are you okay just bruised and battered charlie came on the line for someone who just survived a volcanic eruption under the seat of his pants you are damn lucky mon i wish i couldve seen it jack grinned the birth of an undersea volcano was surely a geologists wet dream jack fingered the hard knot atop his head wincing believe me charlie i wish you had been here instead of me too around jack the waters grew from a deep purple to a lighter aquamarine coming up he said what about the kochi maru a new voice asked hopeful jack was surprised to hear from professor george klein the ships historian and cartographer the professor seldom left the deep fathoms extensive library jack suppressed a groan sorry doc shes goneso is the gold with disappointment george finally responded well we cant even be certain the kochi marus manifests were accurate during the war the japanese often falsified records to mask their gold shipments jack pictured the tall pile of bricks it was accurate he said gloomily charlie came back on the line hey jack it seems you were not the only one shaken up reports are coming in from all over earthquakes and eruptions have been rattling the entire pacific coasttocoast jack frowned what did he care since leaving the world behind twelve years ago he had little interest in the rest of the planet all that mattered was this single eruption it had cost him not only a huge fortune but possibly even his ship signing off he said with a long sigh be topside in one minute he watched the water grow lighter soon the bubble of his dome broke the surface the brightness of the afternoon sun stung he shaded his eyes off to the west the seas burbled with steaming bubbles marking the site of the undersea volcano but off to the southeast he spotted a dark blip the deep fathom he hit the distress beacon activating the gps locator then leaned back to wait as he stared out over the water a glint caught his eye curious he sat up straighter he reached and fingered the rms controls to lift the two external arms as they were raised seawater dripped from the titanium limbs jack sat straighter bumping his head again it cant be sunlight shone brightly off two large bricks one clamped in each pincer hed forgotten about grabbing them before fleeing the hold of the kochi maru the gold bars had been scrubbed clean by the rough flight to the surface but luckily they had remained clamped in the hydraulic grips he whistled appreciatively things are suddenly looking brighter georges voice came on the line again jack weve got your gps signal thats great jack said jubilant barely hearing the words and make sure you have the champagne chilled georges response was clearly puzzled ohokaybut i thought you should know we just received a call on the globalstar jack sobered sensing an undercurrent of tension whos calling a long pause admiral mark houston jack felt as if hed been slugged in the stomach his former naval commander whwhat why he had hoped never to hear that name again he had put that life behind him hes ordered us to a set of coordinates about four hundred nautical miles from here and jack clenched his fists interrupting ordered us tell him to take his order and shove it up now george interrupted theres been a plane crash a rescue operation is being gathered jack bit his lip it was the navys right to ask for his aid the deep fathom was a registered salvage ship still jack found his hands trembling old memories and emotions flared brighter he remembered his awe at seeing the shuttle atlantis shining brightly in the florida sunshine and the pride he felt upon learning he would be the first navy seal to fly in that bird but shadowing these pleasant memories were darker ones flames searing paina gloved hand reaching for him voices screamingslipping tumblingan endless fall seated in the nautilus jack felt as if he were still falling did you hear me jack shaking he could not breathe let alone answer jack the plane that crashedits air force one dragons of okinawa july am naha city island of okinawa japan crouching behind an alley trash bin karen grace tried her best to avoid the military patrol as she hid two armed servicemen sauntered into view flashlights in hand one of them stopped to light a cigarette holding her breath karen prayed for them to pass in the light of the match she noticed the insignia on a sleeve us navy after yesterdays earthquakes a state of martial law had been declared throughout the prefectures of japan including the southern island chain of okinawa looters had been plaguing the city and outlying areas the island leaders overwhelmed by the level of destruction and chaos had requested support from the local american military bases to aid in cleanup rescue and protection of the damaged city the citys leaders had set a curfew for naha from dusk to dawn and karen was breaking that new law the sun was still a half hour from rising movekeep walking she silently urged them as if hearing her one of the men raised his flashlight and shone it down the alley karen froze closing her eyes afraid any movement would draw his attention she wore an embroidered dark jacket and black slacks but she wished she had thought to cover her blond hair she felt exposed sure the two servicemen would spot her at last the light vanished karen opened her eyes a mumble followed by a bark of laughter echoed back to her a crude joke the pair continued on their patrol relieved she sagged against the metal dumpster from deeper in the shadows a voice whispered at her are they gone karen pushed up from her knees yeah but that was too close we shouldnt be doing this her accomplice hissed climbing out of the shadows karen helped miyuki nakano up her friend swore under her breath convincingly considering english was miyukis second language on leave from her japanese university professorship miyuki had worked for two years at a palo alto internet firm and had grown fluent in english but the petite teacher was clearly out of place here as she crawled from under a pile of old newspapers and rotted vegetables miyuki seldom left her pristine computer lab at ryukyu university and was rarely spotted without her starched and pressed lab coat but not this morning miyuki wore a dark red blouse and black jeans both now prominently stained her ebony hair was tied back into a conservative ponytail she plucked a spinach leaf from her blouse and flung it away in disgust if you werent my best friend i knowand i apologize for the hundredth time karen turned away but miyuki you didnt have to come along and leave you to venture through naha alone meeting with who knows what manner of scoundrel its just not safe karen nodded at least this last statement was true sirens echoed throughout the ravaged city searchlights from temporary camps cast beacons into the night skies though the curfew had been ordered shouts and gunfire could be heard all around karen had not expected to find the city in such chaos miyuki continued to complain about their predicament who knows what type of men will be waiting for us white slavers drug smugglers its only one of the local fishermen samo vouched for the man and you trust a senile janitors word karen rolled her eyes miyuki could worry a hole through tempered steel samo is anything but senile if he says this fisherman can take us to see the dragons then i trust him she lifted the edge of her jacket to reveal a black leather shoulder harness and besides i have this the automatic fit snugly under her arm miyukis eyes widened her skin lost a touch of its rich complexion carrying a gun is against japanese law where did you at times like this a girl needs a little extra protection karen crept to the alleys entrance she glanced down the street its all clear miyuki slid beside her hiding in her shadow cmon karen led the way excited and anxious at the same time she glanced to the skies true dawn was still about an hour away time was running short curfew or not she was determined not to miss the rendezvous this was a onceinalifetime opportunity three years ago she had traveled all the way from british columbia to study at ryukyu university and complete her doctoral thesis on micronesian cultures searching for clues to the origins and migration patterns of the early polynesians while studying here karen heard tales of the dragons of okinawa a pair of submerged pyramids discovered in off the islands coast by a geology professor at ryukyu kimura masaaki he had compared the pyramids to those found at ancient mayan sites in central america karen had been skeptical until she saw the photographs two stepped pyramids with terraced tops rising twenty meters from the sandy sea floor she was instantly captivated was there some ancient connection between the mayans and the polynesians throughout the last decade new submerged structures continued to be discovered in the waters off neighboring islands trailing as far south as taiwan soon it became hard to separate fact from fiction natural topography from manmade structure and now the newest rumor floating among the fisher folk of the ryukyu island chain the dragons had risen from the sea whether this was true or not karen could not pass up the opportunity to explore the pyramids firsthand a local fisherman scheduled to transport medical supplies and other aid to outlying islands had offered to take her to see the structures but he planned on sailing at dawn with or without her hence the early morning bike ride from the university to the outskirts of naha then the game of cat and mouse with police and patrols karen continued along the street it felt good to be moving again the morning sea breeze tousled her loose blond hair as she walked swiftly using her fingers she combed the stray locks from her face if the two women were caught both risked expulsion from the university well maybe not miyuki karen thought her friend was one of the most published and awarded professors on the campus she had accolades from around the world and was the first woman nominated for the nobel prize in computer science so karen had not argued against miyuki coming along if the pair were caught miyukis notoriety on the island might soften any legal repercussions for her as well or so she hoped karen checked her watch it would be close at least the roads through here were relatively clear this section of the city had survived the quakes mostly unscathed broken windows cracked foundations and a few scorched buildings meager damage when compared to other districts which had been leveled to brick foundations and twisted metal well never make it in time miyuki said cinching her photo bag higher up her shoulder though karen had pocketed a disposable kodak camera in her jacket miyuki had insisted on bringing full gear digital and polaroid cameras video equipment even a palm handheld computer all stuffed into a promotional bag stenciled with the logo from time magazine karen took the bag from her friend and slung it over her own shoulder yes we will she increased the pace miyuki a head smaller had to jog to keep up they hurried to the end of the street naha bay was only a hundred yards down the next avenue karen peeked around the corner the street lay empty she continued with miyuki trailing the smell of the sea grew stronger salt and algae soon she saw lights shining off the bay encouraged karen continued at a half run as she neared the end of the street a harsh command startled her yobitomeru halt she froze as the bright beam of a flashlight blinded her a dark figure stepped forth from the shadows between two buildings the light lowered enough for karen to recognize the uniform of a united states sailor he cast the beam briefly at miyuki then searched up and down the street a second and third sailor stepped from their shelter in a building entryway the group was clearly one of the american wandering patrols the first sailor stepped nearer do you speak english yes karen answered he relaxed slightly flashlight now pointing toward the street american karen frowned she was used to this response canadian the sailor nodded same thing he muttered and gestured his companions to continue down the street im heading back to base he said to them ive got this covered rifles were returned to shoulders and the other two strode past but not before glancing up and down the two womens figures one of the men mumbled something eliciting a laugh and a final salacious glance toward miyuki karen ground her teeth though not native to this soil the navys casual assumption of control here rankled ladies dont you know about the curfew the sailor asked them karen feigned confusion what curfew the sailor sighed its not safe for two women to be out here alone ill walk you back where are you staying karen crinkled her brow trying to think of an answer time to improvise she unslung miyukis camera bag and pointed to the large insignia for time on its side were working freelance for the magazine she said she pulled out her ryukyu university identification card and flashed it at the man it looked official and the japanese lettering was clearly unreadable our press credentials have been approved by the local government the sailor leaned closer comparing karens face to the cards picture he nodded as if satisfied too macho to admit he could not read the japanese script karen pocketed her card maintaining an officious attitude she introduced miyuki this is my local public relations liaison and photographer were gathering pictures throughout the japanese islands our ship leaves at dawn for the outer islands on its way to taiwan we really must hurry the sailor still wore a suspicious look he was close to buying the story but not completely convinced before karen could press on miyuki reached over and unzipped the bag she pulled out the digital camera actually its somewhat fortunate we ran into you she said in crisp english ms grace was just mentioning how she wanted to try and capture a few of the servicemen on film showing how the united states is helping to maintain order in this time of chaos miyuki turned to karen nodding back at the sailor what do you think karen was shocked by the sudden brazenness of the tiny computer teacher she cleared her throat thinking fast uhyes for the sidebar on the american peacekeepers karen tilted her head at the man her expression thoughtful he does have that allamerican look we were searching for miyuki lifted the camera and pointed it at the sailor how would you like to have your picture in magazines across the country by now the sailors eyes had grown large really karen hid a smile she did not know a single american who was not enthralled with the mystique of celebrity and for the opportunity to join such ranks common sense was often cast aside miyuki stepped around the sailor eyeing him from several angles i cant make any guarantees itll be up to the editors at time well take a few pictures karen said one of them will surely pass muster she framed the man between her fingers sizing up a shot american peacekeeperi think this really will work miyuki began to take a few pictures ordering the sailor into several poses once done she bagged up her camera and collected the servicemans name and number well fax you a photo release form but harry well need it returned to new york before the end of the week the man nodded vigorously of course karen glanced to the brightening skies miyuki we really must be going the press ship is scheduled to leave any minute i can take you to the marina im heading toward the bay anyway thank you harry miyuki said if you can take us as far as pier four that would be wonderful she smiled brightly at him then turned to karen rolling her eyes lets go we dont want to be late led by the sailor they hurried to the bay the gray dawn cast the waters in dull silver gulls dove and screeched among the piers pilings and boats throughout the bay wrecks dotted the water ships and boats that had scuttled against the docks and reefs during the quakes already cranes and heavy equipment had been moved into position the bay was the lifeline of the island and had to be cleared as quickly as possible as the sun crested the eastern sky they reached the entrance to the marina miyuki and karen again thanked harry and said their goodbyes once the sailor left the two hurried down the long planks karen glanced over her shoulder to make sure the sailor had truly gone there was no sign of him she relaxed and turned to miyuki who was cinching the camera bag higher on her shoulder i cant believe you miyuki smiled her face flushed that was fun its lucky i got that free tote bag with my subscription to time both women started laughing tears at the corners of their eyes karen led the way to berth twelve ahead she spotted a small fishing boat still docked at the berth the twentymeter wooden craft was piled high with boxes displaying prominent red crosses a pair of men were already loosening ropes in preparation for leaving karen hurried forward waving an arm ueito wait one of the workers glanced their way and yelled to another on the boat a grizzled japanese man left the wheel and met them near the ships stern he was dressed in levis and a green slicker offering his hand he helped them on board ssamo sent us karen said in broken japanese i know the old man answered in english the american actually im canadian she corrected him same thing i must get the ship going i wait too long already karen nodded and unslung her bag she and miyuki were guided to a stained wooden bench beside a folded mat of net the reek of fish entrails and blood from the wooden planks of the boat almost overpowered her around her the twoman crew had freed the ropes from the dock and jumped on board at the wheelhouse the ships captain barked orders the motor roared water began to churn and the boat slowly edged forward the crewmen took up posts near the bow one on the starboard one on the port side watching the waters ahead sunken debris made the bay treacherous it was clear why the captain insisted on leaving with the dawn as the morning tide receded these waters would become even more treacherous past the piers end they sailed toward the center channel of the bay and slowly edged by a pole sticking crookedly up from the water a flag flapping at its tip karen glanced over the rail and realized it was the mast tip from a submerged sailboat the fishing boat with its shallow draft cut around and over the debris across the bay the united states military base lay burning fires still glowed from the refinery blaze set off during the quakes as underground tanks had been ripped open a smudge of oily smoke climbed high into the morning sky helicopters circled the area hauling dredges of seawater and sand in an attempt to stanch the fires so far with little luck a thickbellied transport plane military gray passed low over them its engine roaring the fishing boats captain shook a fist at it the united states presence here especially this base still rankled the locals back in it had been agreed that the land would be returned to the islanders but that transition had yet to be realized finally the fishing boat sailed free of the bay and headed toward open water clear of the smoke the breeze freshened with the open sea all around them the captain nodded for his first mate to take the wheel then sauntered over to them my name is oshi he said i take you to dragons then we come back before sun go down karen nodded perfect he held out his hand awaiting payment karen stood and pulled a wad of bills from her jackets inside pocket she noticed the fisherman eye her holstered gun good just so things were clear she counted out the appropriate number of bills half the prearranged fee then returned the rest to her pocket the other half when we return to naha the mans face remained hard for a heartbeat then flashed a quick scowl he mumbled something in japanese and shoved the bills into his jeans karen sat back down as he left what did he say miyuki wore a grin he says you americans are all alike never stick to your own agreements so you dont trust anyone else im not american she said in an exasperated voice miyuki patted her knee if you speak english have blond hair and carelessly throw that much cash around youre american to him karen tried her best to sulk but she was too excited cmon if this american is paying for this excursion i want better seats she stood and led miyuki toward the bow they crossed to the forward rail as the boat rounded the southern tip of okinawa and passed the tiny island of tokashiki shima the ryukyu chain of islands spread south in an arc almost stretching to taiwan the dragons were located near the island of yonaguni an hours journey but still within okinawas prefecture one of the sailors bowed his way into their presence he placed two small porcelain glasses of green tea and a small plate of cakes on a nearby bench domo arigato karen said she took the tea and let the hot cup warm her hands miyuki joined her nibbling on the edge of a cake they stared in silence as green islands drifted slowly past the coral reefs colored the nearby shoals in shades of aquamarine rose and emerald after a time miyuki spoke what do you really hope to find out there answers karen leaned on the rail you read professor masaakis thesis miyuki nodded that once these islands were part of some lost continent now sunk under the waves pretty wild conjecture not necessarily during the holocene era some ten thousand years ago the ocean levels were three hundred feet shallower karen waved an arm if so many of these separate islands would have been joined still you know from your own research that the islands of the south pacific were populated only a couple thousand years ago not ten thousand i know im not saying youre wrong miyuki i just want to see these pyramids for myself karen gripped the ships rail tighter but what if i can find proof to support professor masaakis claim could you imagine what this revelation would mean it would change the entire historical paradigm for this region it would unite so many disparate theories she hesitated then continued even explain the mystery of the lost continent of mu miyuki crinkled her nose mu karen nodded back in the early s colonel james churchward claimed he had stumbled upon a set of mayan tablets that spoke of a lost continent similar to atlantis but in the central pacific he named this sunken continent mu he wrote a whole series of books and essays about the placeuntil he was discredited discredited karen shrugged no one believed my greatgrandfather miyukis brows rose her voice shocked your greatgrandfather karen felt a blush blooming she had never explained this to anyone she spoke softly embarrassed colonel churchward was my greatgrandfather on my mothers side when i was a child my mother used to tell me stories of our infamous ancestoreven read sections from his diaries to me at bedtime his stories first drew me to the south pacific and you think the dragons might prove your relatives wild claim karen shrugged who knows i still say this is all a wild goose chase karen shrugged wild goose chases they ran in her family she thought sourly twenty years ago her father had left his wife and baby girls to chase the dream of oil and wealth in alaska never to be heard from again except for a sheaf of divorce papers arriving in the mail a year later after his disappearance hardships drained the life from the remaining household her mother abandoned with her two young daughters had no more time for dreams and worked herself into a dull job at a secretarial pool and an even duller second marriage karens older sister emily had moved to the small town of moose jaw after graduating from high school her belly full of twin boys karen however had inherited too much of her fathers wanderlust to settle down between tips as a waitress at the flying trout grill and a few small scholarships she was able to put herself through an undergraduate program at the university of toronto followed by graduate work in british columbia so it was no particular surprise to those who knew her that karen grace had ended up on the far side of the pacific still she had learned from her fathers abandonment each month she mailed a chunk of her paycheck back home to her mother though she may have inherited her fathers blood she didnt have to accept his cold heart a call from the wheelhouse drew her attention yonaguni the captain yelled above the motors roar he pointed off the port side to a large island the fishing boat made a wide turn around the isles southern coast this is the place karen said shading her eyes with a hand the island of yonaguni i dont see anything are you then from around the high cliffs of the island they appeared no more than a hundred meters off the coastline shrouded in morning sea mists two pyramids towering above the waves their terraced sides damp with algae as the boat drew closer details emerged among the pyramids steps white cranes clambered picking stranded urchins and crabs from the debris theyre real karen said thats not all miyuki said her voice full of awe as the small boat continued to circle around the island the deeper mists parted and the view opened wider past the pyramids rows of coralencrusted columns and roofless buildings rode above the waves in the distance a basalt statue of a robed woman stood waistdeep in the sea draped in seaweed a stone arm raised as if calling for their aid farther yet piles of tumbled bricks and cracked stone obelisks marched deep into the pacific my god karen exclaimed in shock along with the dragons an entire ancient city had risen from the sea wreckage july pm nautical miles northwest of enewak atoll central pacific on the bridge of the deep fathom jack lounged in the pilots chair sprawled out his bare feet propped up on a neighboring seat he wore a white cotton robe over a pair of red nike swim trunks the morning had started warm and had only grown warmer though the pilothouse was equipped with airconditioning jack hadnt bothered he enjoyed the moist heat as he sat one hand rested on the wheel of the ship the fathom had been on autopilot since it left the site of the sunken kochi maru yesterday but jack felt a certain comfort with his hand on the wheel a twinge of mistrust for automated equipment he liked to keep things in his immediate control as he sat he chewed on the end of the cigar hanging from his lips a cuban el presidente the smoke trailed in a lazy circle toward the open window nearby behind him mozarts clarinet concerto in a major wafted gently from a sony cd player this was all he wanted the open sea and a handsome ship to travel her but that was not to be not today jack glanced at the reading from the northstar gps at their current cruising speed they should arrive at their destination in another three hours exhaling out a stream of smoke he stared out the windows across the upper deck of his salvage ship he understood why his ship had been summoned to aid the search for the wreckage of air force one the fathom was the closest salvager with a deepsea submersible on hand and they were contractually obligated to lend the subs services during an emergency still though he knew his duty he did not have to like it he spit out his cigar and ground its fiery end into the ash tray this was his ship twelve years ago using money from his settlement against general dynamics after the shuttle accident jack had purchased the deep fathom from a shipyard auction house the eightyfoot fathom had originally been built as a research ship for the woods hole institute back in in addition to the purchase price he had been forced to take out a large loan to convert the aged research vessel into a modern salvage ship adding a hydraulic cargo crane upgrading to a fiveton capacity aframe and overhauling the caterpillar marine diesel engine he had also updated the navigation equipment and outfitted it so the fathom could operate without outside assistance for weeks at a time he added naiad stabilizers a bauer diving compressor and village marine water makers it had cost him his entire savings but eventually the fathom had become his home his world over the years he had gathered a team of scientists and fellow treasure hunters to his side they became his new family now after twelve years he was being called back to the world he had left behind the door to the pilothouse squeaked open behind him and a fresh crossbreeze blew in jack what are you still doing here it was lisa the doctor from ucla scowled at him as she entered in shorts and a bikini top she did not look the part of an experienced medical researcher her limbs were deeply tanned and her long blond hair had been bleached white by the months under the sun she looked like she belonged on a beach hanging on the arm of a muscled surfer but jack knew better there was no sharper doctor on the high seas lisa held open the door to let in another member of the crew a lanky german shepherd loped inside the cabin and crossed to jacks side for a scratch behind the ear the dog had been born aboard the fathom from a litter whelped during a storm in the south china sea underweight and sickly the pup had been abandoned by the bitch and jack took him in nursing the pup back to health that had been almost nine years ago elvis here was worried about you lisa said she sidled to the chair next to him shoving jacks feet off jack patted the large dogs side and pointed to the cedar pillow in the corner bed he ordered the old dog crossed and collapsed into the thick pillow with a long sigh speaking of bed lisa said i thought you were supposed to be relieved at sunrise shouldnt you be trying to catch a nap couldnt sleep thought i might as well be useful lisa pushed away the ashtray to make room for the mug she brought in with her she glanced at the navigation array after five years on and off the fathom she had become a fairly skilled pilot herself looks like well be at the rendezvous site in less than three hours she faced jack maybe you should try to get some sleep weve a long day ahead of us ive still got to get some sleep she finished with a frown she shoved her mug toward him herbal tea try it itll help you relax he leaned over the steaming mug and sniffed the medicinal tang was sharp after smoking his cigar ill pass lisa pushed the mug closer drink it doctors orders jack rolled his eyes and picked up the cup he took a few sips to placate her it tasted as bad as it smelled needs sugar he said sugar and taint my healing herbs lisa feigned shock and nudged the ashtray as it is you have enough bad habits he took another sip and stood i should check on charlie see how the tests are going lisa turned her lips firm her eyes hard jack charlie and the gold arent going anywhere go to your cabin shut the drapes and try to sleep it will only she held up a hand her expression softened as did her words listen jack we all know whats got you so anxious everyones been walking on eggshells around you he opened his mouth to protest lisa stopped him with a touch she stood parted his robe and raised a hand to his chest jack did not flinch at such casual intimacy lisa had seen him naked many times on such a small ship privacy was limited but more than that years ago when lisa first arrived onboard the two of them had played at being lovers eventually it became clear their feelings were more physical than heartfelt without a word their trysts had eventually ended settling into a warm companionship more than friends less than lovers lisa she traced a finger down from his collarbone trailing through the coarse black hair on his chest her finger was warm on his skin but as it moved below his right nipple the feeling vanished jack knew why across the middle of his chest lay a swath of trailing scars old burns the scars were pale against his bronzed skin numb and dead jack shivered as he felt lisas touch return past the scarring just above his navel her finger traveled still lower and crooked into the waistband of his trunks she pulled him nearer she whispered let it go jack the past cant be changed only forgiven and forgotten gently pushing her hand away he stepped back those were easy words for lisa to say a girl who had led a charmed life in southern california she stared up at him her eyes slightly wounded you werent found at fault jack you were even offered the goddamn medal of honor i turned it down he said swinging away he headed toward the door the shuttle accident was a private matter a subject he did not want to share and discuss not with anyone he had enough of that from the navys psychiatrists free of the pilothouse he hurried down the steps to the boat deck her heart heavy lisa watched the large man retreat out the door in the corner elvis had lifted his head from the bed and watched his master storm out the big dog grumbled under his breath a throaty complaint lisa settled into the pilots seat still warm from its previous occupant my words exactly elvis she sagged into the chair though their fiery relationship had died to ash lisa could still touch the warmth of her old feelings jacks hard body holding her tight the heat of his mouth on her breasts and neck his lovemaking both rough and tender he was an attentive lover one of the best she had ever experienced however strong hands and legs couldnt build a relationship by themselves it took an even stronger heart jack loved her she never doubted this but there was a part of jacks heart that was as dead and numb as the scars on his chest she had never found a way to heal this old wound and doubted she ever could jack would not let it heal lisa reached for the mug of herbal tea and dumped its contents into the trashcan she had spiked the tea with halcyon before climbing up here jack needed to sleep and the sleeping pill hidden in her elixir should help him relax at least she hoped she had never seen jack this bad before he was normally outgoing quick to smile and joke full of an energy that shone from his skin but there had been times in the past when he would sink into a funk drift away from the others hole up in his cabin or pilothouse they had all learned to give jack the space he needed during these times but the past twentyfour hours had been his worst the door on the opposite side of the pilothouse suddenly crashed open lisa jumped at the noise caught off guard by her reverie from his corner elvis let out a warning bark lisa swung around as two people shoved their way inside still in midargument charlie molliers face was darker than its usual jamaican mocha the geologists eyes were lit with an inner fire you cant be serious kendall those gold bars weigh fifty stone each theyre worth a halfmillion us easy kendall mcmillan simply shrugged unimpressed by the larger mans tirade mcmillan was an accountant from chase manhattan bank assigned to be present here when the wealth of the kochi maru was brought to the surface to watch after the banks investment perhaps mr mollier but as your laboratory results proved the bullion is full of impurities not even sixteen carat the bank has offered a good deal youre a bloody thief charlie sputtered angrily the geologist finally seemed to see lisa can you believe this mon whats going on wheres jack charlie answered i thought he was up here gone down below where charlie crossed to the opposite door i need to tell him no you dont charlie the captain has enough on his plate right now let him be lisa glanced at mcmillan where charlie was dressed in his usual deckwear a baggy set of trunks hanging down to his knees with a floral jamaican shirt mcmillan wore sperry deck shoes khaki slacks and a smart shirt buttoned to the top the middleaged accountant had been on board the fathom for almost two months now but he had yet to relax into the casual routine of the ship even his red hair was carefully trimmed and combed whats this all about lisa asked mcmillan drew himself straighter under her gaze as i was explaining to mr mollier after reviewing his laboratory analysis there is no way the bank will pay current market price for the gold the old bullion is full of impurities ive used the satellite phone to confirm my own estimates with the banks experts charlie threw his hands in the air its high seas piracy mcmillans face tightened i take affront at your allegation that id i cant believe you two lisa finally interrupted the entire pacific rim is trying to recover from a day of horrible disasters and you two are arguing over pennies and percentages cant this wait both men hung their heads mcmillan pointed toward charlie he started it i just gave him my numbers if he hadnt enough both of you get out of here and if i hear that you dump any of this on jack youll be sorry you ever stepped on board the fathom im already sorry mcmillan grumbled under his breath what was that lisa asked fiercely the accountant backed up a step nothing get off my bridge she demanded pointing toward the door both men retreated quickly quiet returned to the pilothouse the german shepherd settled back to his bed eyes closing soft classical music returned to fill the space lisa combed her hair back with her fingers men she had enough of all of them swiveling in her seat she popped out the classical music cd why does jack like this stuff she shuffled through the stack and found one of her own after inserting the disk she hit the play button and the allgirl band hole blared from the speakers backed by a strident guitar and a mean drum riff the lead singers harsh voice echoed through the cabin singing of mens inadequacies and faults lisa sank back into her seat thats more like it in his cabin jack lay sprawled atop his bed on his back still in his robe he snored softly mouth hanging open he sank deeply into a halcyoncolored nightmare floating in his eva suit tethered to the shuttle atlantis he was surrounded by the unrelenting darkness of space below him the payload bay doors were open in the orbiters workspace he saw other crew members manhandling the large satellite into position using the shuttles manipulator arms the stenciled logo of the navys seal gleamed unnaturally bright on the satellite as did the weapons name spartacus in slow motion the satellite a halfbilliondollar test model outfitted with an experimental particlebeam cannon was lifted from the bay on a system of lever arms clear of the bay doors the satellites solar wings and communication array unfolded it was a wondrous sight as sunlight reflected off its solar cells a butterfly climbing from a cocoon beyond the shuttle the blue globe of earth loomed bright he thanked the stars around him for this opportunity he had never imagined anything so beautiful especially knowing he was sharing it with the one woman whose eyes outshone even these stars jennifer spangler was the mission specialist for this trip and as of last night she was also his fiancée he had first met her six years ago when one of his fellow seals introduced him to his younger sister he ran into her again as a fellow astronaut in training they had quickly and passionately fallen for each other furtively meeting in empty closets and wardrooms sneaking off to dance at the splashdown pub even sharing midnight picnics on the acres of tarmac around the center during those endless nights under these very stars they had planned their lives together still when he had corralled her alone aboard the flight deck last night and held out a small gold band between them he was as nervous as a schoolboy he did not know what her answer would be was he moving too fast did she share the depth of his feelings for an eternal moment the gold ring had hung between them weightless shining in the moonlight then she reached out and accepted his offer her smile and tears answer enough grinning at the memory he was interrupted by jennifers allbusiness voice over his comlink drawing his attention back to the satellite unlocking arms one two three all go i repeat go for spring launch jack he answered visual check confirmed colonel durham commander of this flight chimed in from the flight deck all clear here green lights all around releasing payload in ten secondsnineeightseven time slowed as the work crew retreated from under the satellite wrench in hand he maneuvered along his tether to the port side out of the way they had practiced the release a hundred times as he drifted he pictured jennifers body and wondered what it would be like to share a bed out here with the whole blue earth looking on what could be a better honeymoon sixfivefour as he daydreamed he was slow to see the mistake one of the three locking boom arms built by general dynamics had failed to release completely from his position he saw the satellite drift a few degrees to the starboard side oh god he took one second to confirm the error it was one second too many threetwo stop the launch jack screamed into his com one he saw the springs release catapulting the satellite out of the bay the springs had been engineered to thrust the satellite gently into proper orbital insertion but instead the releasing mechanism snagged in dreamtime slow motion he watched in horror the fiveton satellite slammed against the starboard bay doors one of the satellites solar wings smashed into the shuttles side soundlessly the bay door bent hundreds of ceramic tiles cracked from the shuttles surface and spun away like playing cards cast into the wind spartacus spun out into space its broken wing flailing it tumbled toward a higher orbit he witnessed a brief explosion on the underside of the satellite as it passed overhead a small panel blew out as its axial guidance system was overloaded spartacus floated away dead in space hours later he found himself strapped to a seat in the mid deck wearing his advanced crew escape suit overhead in the flight deck he heard the pilot and shuttle commander conferring with nasa the bay door had been repaired but the loss of protective heating tiles made reentry risky the plan get as far through the upper atmosphere as possible then eject if there was any mishap but the new emergency evacuation system installed after the challenger tragedy had yet to be tested whispers of prayers echoed over the open comlink jennifer sat beside him in the mission specialists chair his voice sounded far away as he tried to reassure her well make it jen we have a wedding to plan she nodded offering a weak smile but she couldnt speak this was her first shuttle mission too her face remained pale behind her faceplate he glanced to either side two other astronauts shared the middeck seats backs tense fingers clutching the seat arms only the commander and pilot were on the flight deck above the commander insisted all the crew be as near the middeck emergency hatch as possible at the controls colonel jeff durham checked one last time with houston as he began their descent here we go pray for us a staticfilled reply from shuttle mission control godspeed atlantis then they hit the atmosphere hard flames chased them their ship rocked and bucked no one spoke breaths were held sweat pebbled his forehead the heat grew too rapidly for his suits airconditioning unit to compensate he checked the cooling bib connection but it was secure he glanced at jennifer her faceplate had misted over he wished he could reach her hold her then he heard the best words of his life from the pilot approaching sixty thousand feet almost home folks a whoop of joy echoed through all their comlinks before their jubilation died down the shuttle bucked violently he saw the earth spin into view as the ship hoved over on its side the pilot fought to right the ship but failed only later would he learn that the damaged patch of the shuttles exterior surface had overheated and burned through a hydraulic line igniting the auxiliary oxygen tank but at that moment all he knew was terror and pain as the orbiter tumbled through the upper atmosphere fire in the bay he knew it was futile as the pilot continued to wrestle his controls another violent quake shook through the bones of the ship fifty thousand feet the pilot yelled the commanders voice came over the intercom prepare for bailout depressurize on my count fortyfive thousand the pilot yelled forty thousand they were falling fast close your visors and activate emergency oxygen jack open the pyro vent valve he found himself rising from his seat his personal parachute assembly strapped to his back he lumbered across the bucking middeck and reached the thandle box he tugged the vent handle and twisted it the valve would slowly depressurize the cabins to match external pressures get ready colonel durham ordered switching to autopilot the orbiter bucked more violently and he flew up striking his head savagely one of the other astronauts who had been unbuckling from his seat struck an overhead support bar his helmet split and the man fell limp he started to cross to the mans aid but the second astronaut waved him off man your station autopilots off line the commander screamed gonna have to stay on manual he glanced over his shoulder at jennifer she was struggling out of her seat meaning to assist with the injured crewman but she was clearly having some trouble she tugged at something by her left arm thirtyfive thousand the pilot announced the shuttle continued to rock viciously i can handle it i can handle it the pilot sounded as if he were arguing with himself thenjesus christ a litany of swearing erupted from colonel durham bailout he screamed over their comlinks get your asses out of here he knew they were still too high but he obeyed the direct order he twisted the second thandle the side hatch blew out winds exploded out of the cabin the depressurization had not been complete he found himself almost sucked out the hatch only saving himself by clutching the thandle in an iron grip screams filled the com system the shuttle rolled on its back the floor buckled he caught movement out of the corner of his eye and turned to see jennifer slide past him belly first her fingers scrabbling for a hold her parachute assembly was missing oh god he lunged out snagging her hand hang on he screamed a huge explosion sounded from behind him the middeck hatch blew out with a screech of metal a whirlwind of flames tore into the cabin burning all the way to the flight deck he lost sight of the other astronauts the fires rolled toward him and jennifer help he yelled into his communication unit but there was no answer the shuttle had become a plummeting rock he began to slip let go of me jennifer gasped at him struggling to free her hand im pulling you loose goddamn it hang on im not taking you down with me jennifer reached her other hand and unlocked the metal flange that mated her suits glove to its sleeve no he clenched his hand but he was too late he clutched only an empty glove jennifer slipped beyond his grip as in all nightmares he found himself unable to move in slow motion he watched jennifer slide away from himso slowly he struggled to reach out to her but his limbs refused to obey he could only watch his last view was not of jennifers panicked facebut of a small gold band blazing brightly on her hand shining with the promise of undying love as she fell away deaf to his own screams he dove after her chased by a wall of flame he tumbled through the hatch just as the shuttle flipped end over end the huge wing of the orbiter sliced through the air over his head darkness harried the edges of his vision as he twisted and spun uncontrolled he could not breathe still he searched as best he could for some sign of jennifer but the blue skies were empty only a flaming trail marked the path of the burning shuttle tears in his eyes he fumbled for the manual parachute release the eighteeninch pilot chute deployed instantly drawing out the fourfoot drogue chute stabilizing his spinning tumble but the small chutes did little to stop his rate of descent they were not meant to not in this thin air later a third chute would automatically engage as he descended but he never saw it darkness finally claimed him jack fell all the way back to earth back to his own bed aboard the deep fathom with a jolt his eyelids popped open too bright it took him a second to recall where he was he struggled to sit up his robe soaked with sweat he shivered and shrugged out of the garment half naked he stood on wobbly feet he shuddered again and crossed to the wall safe he thumbed the combination and pulled open the door amid the ships papers and a few thousand dollars in american currency lay a crumpled glove jack pulled it out the fingers and edges were scorched but he had not been able to part with it no matter how much he wanted to forget the past he couldnt im sorry jennifer he whispered pressing it to his lips when the rescue crew had found jacks unconscious body amid the billowing parachutes they had found this glove still clutched in his hand he had been the only survivor even now he could still feel jennifers frightened and panicked grip on his hand behind him a rapid knocking shook his cabin door jack returned the glove slowly to the safe his eyes closed against the tears what he growled irritably just thought you should know jack were about to reach the rendezvous point he recognized the marine biologists voice and glanced to his clock three hours had passed all right robert ill be up in a moment crossing to his rooms head jack splashed cold water on his face as he straightened he stared up at his reflection water dripped off his hard features and strong chin his black hair though still dark was now dusted with gray at the temples he wore it long to his shoulders no longer the military crew cut he shoved the damp hair behind his ears and toweled off his sunbronzed skin he turned away unable to face his own reflection tuned to his ship jack recognized the slight change in the engines constant rumble they were slowing down hurrying he slipped into a loose shirt left it unbuttoned and crossed barefoot to the door as he exited he found robert bonaczek still waiting for him the marine biologist seemed nervous shifting his feet unable to meet jacks eyes robert bonaczek was only twenty years old the youngest on the crew but also the most serious and dour he seldom smiled he had graduated with a masters degree in marine sciences at the tender age of eighteen and had been on board the last two years working toward his doctorate lisa called him an old soul trapped in a young body this assessment was compounded by the fact that the mans thin blond hair was already balding what is it robert the biologist shook his head you need to see it for yourself the young man turned and headed for the door to the open deck jack followed shoving through the door after the biologist the sun now lower in the sky blinded jack he blinked against the glare and raised a hand to shield his eyes the other members of the team were all on deck except for the geologist charlie mollier jack spotted his large frame behind the windows of the pilothouse charlie gave him a short wave jack joined the others at the rail robert on one side lisa on his other howd you sleep the doctor asked you slipped me something didnt you she shrugged you needed sleep he thought to reprimand her what right did she have to treat him like a child he was the goddamn captain of this boat but instead his eyes were drawn forward ahead the normally empty stretch of ocean was crowded with ships fishing trawlers cargo ships military cutters flags from various countries flapped above the ships overhead a pair of jayhawk helicopters buzzed by jack followed their path guessing they had been sent from the air force base on wake island near the horizon a widebodied c swept back and forth over the scene a search pattern the plane had probably been scanning the area all night with its sonar the us national transportation safety board had clearly mobilized its goteam on this crash george klein stepped up behind jack reading his mind the ntsb has been busy an impressive mobilization considering how far out we are the professor puffed on a pipe as he stared out at the turmoil except for the thick pipe george looked nothing like a sixtysomething harvard professor the older man was muscular wearing a pair of trunks and nothing else his wispy white hair fluttered in the thin breeze jack had always thought george bore a striking resemblance to jacques cousteau whats that smell kendall mcmillan asked wrinkling his nose brought to his attention jack caught the acrid taint in the ocean breeze fuel spill he finally noticed the slight stain on the oceans surface off the port bow the oil slick spread in a black bloom there was no question that some sort of crash had occurred here within the oil slick jack spotted a few bobbing red buoys data buoys he realized dropped to give the searchers some indication where wreckage and bodies may have drifted someone should have hauled my ass up here earlier he said george glanced at lisa who suddenly bore a more intense interest in the ocean and bear lisas wrath id rather face a great white with chum hanging around my neck besides charlie contacted the head of operations here an hour ago george glanced at jack with his brows raised the coast guard vice admiral himselfflown in from san diego last night not exactly a friendly fellow from charlies description how do they want us to help were on standby until they localize the pinging of air force ones data recorders and initiate an action plan it seems ntsb is really only interested in our nautilus were to sit out here until our sub is called into play and what about admiral houston jack asked his old navy commander had been the one to order them to service isnt he here due to arrive tomorrow whats taking him so long i guess it takes longer to grease the huge wheels of the us military machine hes due at daybreak in the uss gibraltar george waved his pipe forward all this malarkey is just preparation getting all the ducks in a row before the true deepwater search begins the gibraltar jack mumbled you did a tour on that boat didnt you jack nodded he had served aboard the ship for seven years the gibraltar was a waspclass landing helicopter dockship one of the largest ships in the navy only dwarfed by the supercarriers themselves the lhd was a part of the infamous gator navy an amphibious task force combining the combat power of the marines with the speed and mobility of the navy robert called out from nearby pointing look off to the port a bit of debris bobbed among the buoys it hadnt been there a moment ago it must have just surfaced jack squinted get me a pair of binoculars robert hurried away and returned with a set of minolta glasses jack donned them it took him a moment to find and focus on the piece of equipment it was the back of an airline seat the presidential seal bright blue against the red seat back a sudden swell rolled the seat over a flash of pale flesh an arm hanging limply then the sight vanished is it wreckage robert asked jack could not answer he flashed to his own tumble through the air twelve years ago the crash of the shuttle atlantis the sight struck too close to home jack are you all right lisa touched his shoulder he lowered his binoculars pale trembling we should never have come here no good can come of it blame july pm oval office white house washington dc david spangler waited outside the oval office all around him even at this late hour the west wing of the white house bustled with aides underlings and messengers this current turmoil was not localized just to pennsylvania avenue the entire beltway remained in high gear countless press conferences were convened repeated emergency meetings atop capitol hill took place and an endless amount of petty backdoor bickering occurred throughout the halls all the pandemonium over the loss of a single man president bishop david himself had been specially flown in this morning from turkey he and his ops team had been called back early from a mission along the iraq border but he had yet to be told why coffee sir an aide approached david with a tray of mugs he gave the tinybreasted girl the barest shake of his head seated stiffly in an upholstered chair david continued to study the room not moving just picking up everything around him the casual banter the half jokes the faint scent of perfume he breathed deeply opportunity was in the air his own boss cia director nicolas ruzickov was in conference with the new leader of the united states vice president lawrence nafe each of bishops former cabinet members was meeting in private with nafe who would be axed who would retain their job rumors spread like wildfire through government halls it was wellknown that a deep political gulf separated the former president from his running mate nafe had been named to the ticket only as a ploy to gain the south since then their two offices often found themselves in conflict today david suspected nafe had been getting his ass kissed like it had never been before but not from the cia director nafe and ruzickov had always been close friends fellow students at yale and fellow ideologues when it came to dealing with foreign aggression david had once shaken nafes hand at a white house function hed found the man as weak and dishonest as the next politician all fake smiles and perpetual condescending air but in his opinion nafe was at least better than the former occupant of the white house president bishop had been too much of a dove coddling the chinese while nafe was willing to take a more hardline stance nafes secretary typed at her computer a dictation device hooked to one ear as david waited for the conference to end he caught her glancing in his direction smiling shyly when she was caught looking he was accustomed to this reaction from women he was tall his shoulders broad and muscular his blond hair cropped to tight angles about his hard features his skin tanned by years under the sun of many foreign lands prior to the aborted mission in turkey his last assignment had been to lebanon where he and his ops team had dispatched a lebanese terrorist with the usual economy taking out the mans family and firebombing the hotel erasing all evidence of the assassination it had been a clean operation pride for his team fired his blood they were men he had trained from the start handpicked he knew each of them would die for him they were one of the most successful covert ops teams with a body count numbering over a thousand the phone at the secretarys desk buzzed davids gaze twitched in her direction she picked up the receiver yes sir immediately sir she put down the phone and turned to face david the president she blushed at her mistake nafe had not been formally sworn in yet not without more concrete evidence of bishops demise the vice president requests you join mr ruzickov in the oval office david stood smoothly a single line on his forehead marking his surprise at the invitation the secretary waved him toward the door then returned to her typing he crossed the room unsure why he was being called into this conference the door was opened by a secret service agent whom david did not even acknowledge he took three steps inside then snapped to attention at the edge of the circular rug bearing the presidential seal the eagle icon on the carpet seemed to stare at him as did the two occupants in the room his boss sat in an armchair the former marine though grayhaired and edging toward sixty was as lithe and wiry as when on duty as usual his hard blue eyes remained unreadable david respected ruzickov deeply commander spangler please come join us the vice president said waving him in as the door shut with a click behind david lawrence nafe stood leaning on the edge of the wide desk in appearance he was the opposite of the cia director his features were soft thick lips a hint of a double chin cow eyes his belly bulged slightly over his belt and the dungbrown color of his hair what remained of it clearly came from a bottle please take a seat nodding curtly david strode into the room maintaining a stiff posture the vice president came around the desk and settled easily into the chair as if he had done so a thousand times before the man nudged a folder on his desk mr ruzickov has been telling me much about your teams exploits his eyes rose to study david who was still standing please take a seat nafe repeated with a trace of irritation david glanced to the cia director who gestured to a neighboring chair he sank into the seat spine straight not leaning back suspicious alert nafe continued omega team has served our country well whether the public knows this fact or not thank you sir nafe leaned back in his chair lacing his fingers over his belly ive read the report on somalia fine job we could not have a communist newspaper starting in that volatile region david nodded fourteen deaths staged like a mass suicide it was artfully done discrediting the communist insurgents while ending their threat besides omega team only two other people knew the truth and they sat in this room now we have been discussing another mission for your team we believe you and your men are ideally suited the silent question hung in the air david answered it anything sir his response raised a small smile from nafe again with an icy hint of condescension excellent nafe sat up straighter again grabbed a folder and passed it to the cia director your orders and details are in here in turn nicolas ruzickov passed the folder to david maintaining the chain of command in these matters if anything went wrong david could honestly say the order came from the cia director not from the vice president david placed the folder on his lap his boss spoke for the first time outlining the mission while nafe sat silently leaning back hands over his belly again as you know the chinese have been a thorn in our side for decades while weve helped drag them into the twentyfirst century with aid and favorable trade status they in turn have grown more belligerent and inflexible biting the hand that feeds them nafe interjected exactly while our government has kowtowed to these communist leaders the chinese have grown stronger increasing their nuclear arsenal stealing the secrets for intercontinental ballistics growing and spreading their naval presence in just ten years theyve grown from a communist nuisance to a global threat this tide must be stopped david found his fingers tightening on the arms of his chair no truer words had been spoken he nodded hard yes sir ruzickovs eyes flicked to nafe then back to david but public sentiment does not favor such action the average american is more interested in the value of his stock portfolio and whats on tv at night confrontation with china is not a priority if anything the opposite is true we have grown complacent if we are to stem this rising tide of communism then this sentiment must be changed also david nodded his understanding ruzickov studied him then spoke again you know of the mobilization to recover air force one david didnt answer the cia directors words were not a question of course he knew of the mobilization it was in the news the entire world had turned its eyes to an empty stretch of ocean still his nostrils flared he almost smelled his bosss discomfort we believe this is an opportunity not to be missed a chance to gain some value for the loss of president bishop how so david asked intrigued you are to join the ntsbs goteam at the crash site davids left eye twitched in surprise to help in the recovery yesbut also to help ensure that the information that comes from the crash site serves our end i dont understand nafe clarified we want the crash to be blamed on the chinese whether the facts substantiate this claim or not the director finished both of davids brows rose nicolas ruzickov stood up with the chinese blamed for the assassination of the president there will be a public outcry for retribution and we will answer it nafe added david appreciated the plan with the world already in turmoil after the pacificwide disasters the moment was ripe for such a change does omega accept this mission ruzickov asked formally david stood yes sir without question nafe cleared his throat drawing both their attention one other thing commander spangler it seems that a colleague of yours is already on site a fellow sealsomeone you once worked alongside again david sensed a bomb was about to be dropped who jack kirkland a gasp escaped davids throat he barely heard the vice presidents next few words his vision grew black at the edges we know you still blame the man for the atlantis accident the entire country mourned the death of your younger sister jennifer david mumbled he pictured the girls face full of pride on the day of the launch her first mission with nasa at her side jack kirkland her teammate wearing a shiteating grin jack had won the shuttles military seat over david both men had been up for the mission but nasa had not wanted two siblings going up on the same mission in case something happened david closed his eyes jennifers body had never been found im sorry for your loss nafe said drawing back davids attention he straightened going cold thank you sir ruzickov spoke at his shoulder we just want to make sure kirklands presence isnt going to interfere with your mission no sir the past is the past i understand the importance of this mission and will let nothing stand in my way not even jack kirkland very good ruzickov turned toward the exit then gather your team you ship out in two hours with a nod to the countrys new leader david swung around on numb legs he would do as he had been ordered omega team had never failed in a mission but on this journey david intended to add a side objective of his own to avenge his sisters death serpents heart july am off the coast of yonaguni island okinawa prefecture with the sun yet to rise karen was already at the docks bartering for the rental of an outboard motorboat she stared out across the water the twin pyramids lay just a couple hundred meters out past the bay after yesterdays discovery she had refused to return to naha and the university instead over miyukis protests she chartered a fishing boat to drop them off at the small town of chatan on yonaguni islands coast we should have returned to naha yesterday miyuki said scowling at the condition of the boat the old fiberglass craft showed significant wear the metal railings dented and bent the vinyl seats cracked and fraying at the seams but the hull itself looked seaworthy enough to cross the hundred or so yards to the nearby pyramids we could have struck a better deal in naha and lost half a day getting back here karen answered i could not risk looters damaging the dragons or what if the pyramids sank again miyuki sighed her eyes tired all right but youre driving karen bubbling with excitement despite a restless night nodded and climbed into the stern last night she and miyuki had talked late into the night sharing a bottle of saki between them from their hotel rooms tiny balcony they had a clear view to the sea and the twin dragons under the moonlight the misted pyramids had shone damply as if glowing with an inner light then throughout the long night karen had risen many times from the cramped bed to stare out the window afraid the sight might disappear but the twin pyramids remained in the shallows off the coastline with the first blush in the eastern sky karen had hauled a grumbling miyuki from her bedsheets in the chilly predawn the two women had hiked the short distance to the docks and negotiated an expensive price for the day use of a fishermans old motorboat an entire months pay but karen had no choice but to agree there had been no other boat available she helmed the wheel while miyuki caught the ropes from the grinning fisherman pleased with his profit you know of course youre being robbed miyuki said perhaps karen responded but i would have been willing to pay ten times as much for this chance to be the first to explore the ruins miyuki shook her head and settled into the passenger seat as karen eased the throttle forward the engine chugged harshly the smell of burning oil wafted over them miyuki crinkled her nose its plain piracy dont worry if there are any other pirates karen patted her jacket where her automatic rested in its shoulder harness miyuki groaned dramatically and sank deeper in her seat karen smiled despite her companions protest she had noted the twinkle in miyukis eyes the stoic japanese professor was secretly enjoying this outing yesterday miyuki had ample opportunity to return to the university but instead had remained with her it was what forged their friendship miyuki tempered her wilder streaks while she added a bit of spice to miyukis professional routine once clear of the marina karen sped up the engines whining chatter filled the morning as they circled clear of the breakwater cliffs the rest of the ancient city appeared filling the seas in front of them both women stared at the sight and rode the waves in silence behind them the seaside village of chatan dwindled in size fading as a morning fog settled over the island and the nearby seas to the east the sun finally crested the horizon spreading a rosy glow over the ruins who built this drowned city karen wondered aloud right now all i care about is my own city my own lab miyuki replied waving a hand forward the past is the past but whose past karen continued to wonder in awe shrugging miyuki searched through her bag and pulled free her handheld palm computer she leaned back in her seat and began tapping at the small screen with her stylus what are you doing connecting to gabriel making sure everything is okay at the lab a quiet voice rose from the handheld computer synthetic and tinny good morning professor nakano karen grinned you two really should think about tying the knot miyuki just frowned at her and continued working youre already connected at the hip karen teased and youre just jealous karen snorted of a computer gabriel is more than just a computer miyuki countered her voice strained karen held up a hand to ward off a diatribe i know i know gabriel was a sophisticated artificial intelligence program designed and patented by miyuki the development of its theoretical base algorithms had won miyuki the nobel prize over the past four years she had turned theory into practice gabriel named after the fiery archangel was the result hows he doing hes categorized all my email and is still monitoring the emergency broadcasts across various international websites any news the quakes have ended throughout the pacific but there seems to be a massive mobilization effort by american forces in the central pacific though the details are sketchy hes been attempting to worm his way into the dod network dod the answer came from the small computer dod is the acronym for the united states department of defense karen glanced in shock at her friend not only did it unnerve her when gabriel answered one of her questions but sniffing around a military computer networkthat could bring down serious trouble should gabriel be doing that miyuki waved away her concern hell never be caught why not you cant catch what doesnt exist though my mainframe birthed him gabriel lives within the framework of the internet now he has no specific address to trace back to a ghost in the machine karen mumbled more precisely dr grace i am the ghost in the machine i am the only one of my design a shiver traced up karens back miyuki had tried once to explain gabriels looping algorithms and selflearning subroutines a form of synthetic intelligence but it quickly went over her head she had always felt uncomfortable around miyukis lab it was as if invisible eyes were staring at her all the time she felt that way now darn it miyuki swore under her breath what is it the university is shutting down for the month the chancellor just sent email to all the department heads students are being allowed to return home to help their families karens brows rose and how is this bad news with my aides gone its going to significantly set back my research im supposed to complete a progress report on my grant in three weeks considering the circumstances im sure you can file an extension maybe miyuki snapped her stylus back in place thank you gabriel ill be streaming you digital video throughout the day please record the data to the mainframes hard drive and back them up to the dvd drive file name miyuki glanced at karen dragon opening data file dragon now i await your next transmission thank you gabriel miyuki said goodbye professor nakano good day dr grace karen cleared her throat feeling awkward goodbye gabriel miyuki lowered the palm unit to her belt clipping it in place by now they had neared the edge of the halfsunken ruins karen slowed the boat miyuki can you get an overview shot of this for me her companion shuffled through her bag removed and hooked a compact video camera to the palm computer at her belt standing miyuki scanned the view of the ruins feeding the digital image through her portable computer back to her office computers got it karen edged the motorboat slowly forward the engine coughing as it idled she knew she had to be careful near the risen ruins the water was shallow less than six feet deep as she drifted forward columns rose around them green with algae pale crabs scuttled away as they neared drawn into this ancient world she quickly forgot about gabriel and advanced computer algorithms this is amazing in the distance a few other boats wove among the ruins excited voices echoed over the water too distant to make out any words as a nearby punt poled past a trio of darkcomplexioned men micronesian in heritage stared out at the ancient columns and seadrowned homes could ancestors of these men have built this site karen wondered and if so what happened the punt vanished as karen edged the boat slowly past a low roofless building window openings gaping at them as they drifted along all the structures seemed to be similarly constructed of stacked and interlocked blocks and slabs all the same dark stone volcanic basalt some of the slabs had to weigh several tons here was architectural skill seldom seen in the south pacific it rivaled the vaulted skill of the incas and mayas rounding the building a clear way led to the first of the dragons get a picture karen said hushed with awe i already am miyuki held the camera in front of her ahead the pyramids crown towered twenty meters above the waves eighteen terraced steps climbed from the sea each a meter tall leading to the flat plateau on top morning sunlight blazed on the partially tumbled summit temple a small structure composed of flat slabs as they neared a flock of white cranes took flight at their noisy approach turtles basking on the steps plopped into the surf karen circled the pyramid on the far side the second dragon appeared it was a twin of the first except its flattopped summit was empty of any sign of a temple lets take a closer look karen aimed their boat toward the first pyramid bringing the craft up to the lowest step a short basalt pillar at the northeast corner was a good place to tie a rope and secure their boat hold the wheel karen said as she throttled down the waves bobbled the craft grabbing the aft mooring line she crossed to the rail and used it to boost herself over the open water landing on the step of the pyramid she slipped on algae and damp weed careful miyuki yelled as karen cartwheeled her arms recovering her balance she swiped a few strands of hair away from her eyes and gave miyuki an embarrassed grin safe and sound with more care karen crossed to the metertall pillar rope in hand as she knelt she realized that the pillar was actually a sculpted figure of a robed man its details eroded away by sand and sea the nose gone the eyes no more than shadowed depressions karen hauled on the mooring rope until the boats hull bumped the lower step then she secured the line to the statues base cinching the hitch knot tight could you help me with my bag miyuki asked holding out her satchel filled with the photography gear karen relieved her of the bag so the petite professor could clamber over the rail miyuki scrunched up her face as her heel squashed something bulbous and slimy youre buying me new shoes when were through here new ferragamos i promise karen quipped direct from italy miyuki bit back a smile still refusing to admit she was enjoying the adventure well then thats okay i guess cmon i want to check out the ruined temple on the top miyuki craned her neck thats a long climb well take it slow karen pulled up onto the first step then reached back to help miyuki who waved away her hand and clambered up on her own but once up she fingered a long strand of seaweed from her knee and tossed it aside in disgust glowering at karen okay so well visit nordstrom too when we get back well buy you a new pantsuit this earned a true smile from miyuki new shoes new suit lets keep going before were done here youll be financing my whole new spring wardrobe karen patted her friends arm and led the way up the steps but she soon outpaced her companion halfway up she stopped to give miyuki time to close the distance and meanwhile stared out at the spread of the drowned city by now the sun had fully risen a bright globe in the east the columns and buildings cast long shadows across the blue water from that height she could see it had to be at least two kilometers until the ruins faded away the surprising size of the city suggested it may have housed a population in the tens of thousands so where did they all go karen moved aside as miyuki made her way up its not much further she assured her miyuki breathing hard just flapped a hand im fine lets keep moving wed better rest karen said though in truth she wanted to rush forward we should pace ourselves miyuki sank down ignoring the algae under her if you insist karen dug out a water bottle and passed it over miyuki flipped the cap and drank greedily but her eyes remained locked on the view its so extensive i would never have imagined it settling next to her karen took a swig from the water bottle too how could all this have been hidden for so long the water here isor was very deep the currents tricky only experienced divers could explore out here but now once word gets out about this place itll be swamped and trampled karen added nows the best time to study the city miyuki scooted up if youre ready to go on so am i we could rest a little longer these ruins have waited centuries to be explored a few more minutes wont make any difference miyuki settled back karen did too she stared out over the amazing view i appreciate your help miyuki i couldnt ask for a better friend me too miyuki said softly the two women had met at a ryukyu university social function both were single about the same age and working in a maledominated environment they had begun socializing trips to a local karaoke bar late dinners while grading midterms matinee movies on saturdays and had become close companions miyuki said did i tell you i heard from hiroshi yesterday no you didnt karen sat straighter hiroshi takata a fellow university professor had been engaged to miyuki but her success in her field had raised some professional jealousy and driven a wedge into their relationship two years ago he had abruptly broken off the engagement and transferred to kobe the bastard what did he want miyuki rolled her eyes he wanted me to know he was okay after the quakes he didnt even bother to ask how i was doing do you think he wants to reconcile in his dreams miyuki snorted karen laughed we do seem to attract the most obnoxious men spineless more like karen nodded knowingly in canada she had run through her own long series of bad relationships from cold to abusive and she was in no hurry to continue the pattern it was one of the reasons she accepted the fouryear position here on okinawa new city new future so what do you make of all this miyuki asked changing the subject could this be a part of your greatgrandfathers lost atlantis you mean the lost continent of mu she said slowly i doubt it hundreds of other megalithic ruins dot the pacific the statues of easter island the canal city of nan madol the latte stones of guam the burden of tonga all of them predate the oral histories of these islands no one has been able to connect them together she warmed with the mystery and you hope to do that who knows what answers may be found here miyuki gave her a crooked grin and pushed up there is only one way to find out karen shoved to her feet matching her friends grin i should say so the pair continued their climb staying together each helping the other up the high steps in twenty minutes with the sun climbing higher they reached the summit karen scrambled up first breathing heavily the plateau was a single monstrous slab a long crack traversed the surface but the split was clearly due to more recent damage most likely from the seismic activity karen guessed that when the pyramid was built the slab must have been lifted intact atop this structure she slowly turned ten meters on each side she estimated the meterthick slab had to weigh hundreds of tons how did these ancient builders get it up here miyuki clambered up behind her then turned in a slow circle appreciating the view her eyes shining simply amazing karen nodded too awestruck to speak yet she crossed to the tumbled temple in the center of the roof it had once been constructed of slabs and basalt logs she could imagine how it must have looked a squat low building surmounted by a slab roof she edged around it viewing it from all angles miyuki dogged her steps video camera in hand karen examined the temple it was unadorned or perhaps any decorative carving had been worn away long ago she straightened im going in what miyuki lowered her camera what are you talking about karen pointed to a pair of wall slabs that had fallen and were tilting against each other a narrow crawl space lay between them descending at a slant are you crazy you dont know how stable those stones are karen chipped some coral that had taken root between the two slabs like living cement for coral to grow here it means they havent moved in ages besides im just going to take a quick peek if theres any carving or petroglyphs theyll be inside sheltered from erosion she slipped out of her embroidered jacket and dropped to her knees its gonna be a tight squeeze she yanked off her belt so the buckle wouldnt snag then shrugged out of her shoulder harness lowering her holstered pistol to the stones is that penlight still in your bag she asked miyuki shuffled through her pack and pulled out a tiny fluorescent purple flashlight karen took it twisted it on then put the handle in her mouth as she lay flat on her belly are you sure you should do this as answer karen snuggled into the hole head first penlight pointed forward worming her way inside she used her fingers to find imperfections in the rock to help pull her forward but mostly it was her toes that edged her inch by inch into the crawlway she ignored the thick slabs hanging over her she had done some caving in her past but nothing this tight she kept her breathing calm told herself to just keep moving dont stop there go your feet miyuki called to her her friends voice was muffled karens body fit snugly within the tunnel she found it harder to breathe with the walls compressing her chest an edge of panic set in but she bit it back she took quicker shallower breaths she would not suffocate she moved on if she became stuck she could always use her hands to propel her backward plus miyuki could pull her by the ankles there was no real danger here still her mouth grew dry and sticky as her toes began to slip on the damp stone how you doing karen opened her mouth to answer and realized she did not have enough air to yell back to her friend im okay it came out in a gasped whisper around the flashlight held in her teeth what was that karen stretched her arms forward the fingers of her right hand just caught the edge of the slabs end the end was that close she locked her fingers and pulled shoving with her toes at the same time her body thrust forward by now her pulse pounded in her ears her jaw ached from biting on the metal penlight cmon goddamnit she swore in a short gasp fingers scrambling she found a purchase for her left hand too grinning she heaved her body forward pulling her head free of the tunnel she paused to crane her neck around the beam of light casting back and forth a cramped space lay open here no bigger than a half bath but what caught her eye was what looked like an altar on the far side barnaclecovered urns and broken pottery lay scattered about the floor all frosted with algae around the edge of the altar wove a carved snake karen followed it with her light until she reached the serpents nose a mane of stone feathers surrounded its fanged head its eyes red stones reflected back her light most likely rubies ignoring the jewels she moved the light more excited by the representation of feathers it reminded her of quetzalcoatl the feathered snake god of the mayas could this be a sign that the mayas had built this site she spat out the penlight twisting and using her arms as leverage she hauled herself out of the damp tunnel and into the chamber recovering her flashlight she turned to the entrance miyuki should see this karen bent by the tunnel as a shot rang out the sharp blast echoed in the small space followed by a terrified scream karen dropped to her knees trying to peer down the tunnel miyuki sounding the depths july am crash site northwest of enewak atoll central pacific for the first time in over twelve years jack placed his foot aboard a united states military vessel and it was no small tugboat he stepped from the sea knight helicopter onto almost an acre of open flight deck the uss gibraltar was two football fields long and half a field wide a monstrous beast powered by two boilers up and down the flight deck huge painted numbers signaled landing pads for up to nine aircraft ducking his head he strode from under the helicopters rotors overhead the roar of the blades was deafening the rotorwash tore at his unzippered jacket as he cleared the blades he almost tripped over one of the many aircraft tiedowns he caught himself feeling foolish a rookies mistake it truly had been a long time since he walked this deck past the deadly blades jack straightened and glanced out to sea near the horizon he could just make out the tiny dot that was the deep fathom he had been flown here for an organizational briefing due to start at noon closer to the huge ship flanking its two sides were three smaller destroyers support ships for the mighty behemoth jack scowled at the sight talk about overkill at least the vice president hadnt deployed an entire goddamn battle group turning jack eyed the bristling array of weapons systems near the gibraltars superstructure with that much firepower he thought who needed an entire battle group the gibraltar could probably take over a small country by itself its air contingent consisted of fortytwo sea knight helicopters five harrier attack planes and six asw helicopters additionally the vessel bore its own defenses sea sparrow surfacetoair missile systems phalanx closein weapons system bushmaster cannons even a nixie torpedodecoy system all in all one hell of a big stick to shake at the enemies of the united states motors whined on his left a portside elevator lifted another sea knight helicopter from the hangar below men and women in red and yellow jackets buzzed around the deck with the large ship approaching ground zero of the crash site the great beast was stirring near the stern jack noted new additions to the flight deck three large cranes and winch assemblies now he understood one reason for the vessels late arrival before steaming here they had clearly readied the ship for the salvage operation mr kirkland a stern voice barked from behind jack turned a trio of uniformed personnel strode toward him he did not know any of them but did recognize their credentials instinctively he found himself straightening throwing his shoulders back in the lead was the co of the gibraltar captain john brenning the man said introducing himself as he stopped in front of jack no hand was offered to shake he gestured to his right and left saying my executive officer commander julie knudson and master chief hayward lincoln both nodded the woman eyed jack up and down as if he were a bug the black master chief remained stoic barely acknowledging him rear admiral houston has requested a private meeting before the noon briefing commander knudson will take you below to the officers wardroom the captain and master chief turned away meaning to cross toward the main deck and the rallying air wing the female officer spun on her heel ready to lead jack away but jack remained standing why the private meeting three pairs of eyes swung his way clearly their orders were seldom questioned jack met their stares unmoving awaiting an answer the sun glared mercilessly off the metal flight deck jack knew he was no longer in their chain of command he was a civilian his own man captain brenning sighed the admiral did not elaborate on his reasons he asked us only to deliver you to him asap if you would please follow the executive officer said with the barest trace of irritation jack crossed his arms over his chest he would not be bullied into a subordinate position here when it came to dealing with the military mentality it was best to let them know where you stood to get the pecking order firmly established up front i agreed to lend the use of my submersible in this search he said nothing more i only accepted todays meeting so i could discharge this duty as swiftly as possible i am in no way obligated to kiss a rear admirals rear agruff voice called from an open hatch behind him and who the hell would want you to jack the three uniforms snapped to attention hands raised in sharp salute admiral on deck the master chief barked from the shadows of the open hatch a large man stepped into the sunlight he wore a green flight jacket casually loose his battle ribbons were in plain view he strode forward from the shelter of the doorway when jack had last spoken to mark houston the admiral had been a captain otherwise houston had not changed the old man had the same thick gray hair cropped short the same weathered features his frosted blue eyes were as keen as ever as they stared jack down houston acknowledged his people with a nod captain brenning stepped forward there was no need for you to come up here sir mr kirkland was just on his way down to meet you the admiral chuckled im sure he was but theres one thing you need to learn about jack kirkland captain he doesnt take orders well so i am learning sir the co said stiffly though jack stood sixfootthree the admiral still seemed to tower over him fists on hips jack the flash kirkland he muttered sternly who would have ever thought to see you on the gibraltar again not me sir thats for damn sure though jack hated to be aboard another navy vessel he could not shake a certain warmth at seeing the old man mark houston had been more than his commanding officer he had proved a friend and mentor in fact it was mark houston who had successfully campaigned for him to be awarded the seat on the military shuttle mission jack cleared his throat its good to see you again sir im glad to hear you say that now maybe youll cooperate and follow me down to the conference room yes sir the admiral dismissed his officers with a nod come i have coffee and sandwiches below he said to jack leading the way toward the hatch in the looming superstructure the ntsb people have had a long night so were catering this briefing thank you sir jack held his breath as he ducked through the hatch and entered the ships bowels out of the sun the cold of the ship struck him immediately he had forgotten how frigid the inside of the ships island could be but the smell of oiled metal triggered old memories voices echoed from deeper in the ship it was as if he had entered a living creature jonah in the whale he thought morosely the admiral led him down to level stopping periodically to bow his head with other officers to share a joke or pass on an order mark houston had always been a handson officer before becoming admiral when houston was the co here he had never holed himself up in his room he could be found as often as not down in the crew quarters as up in the officers galley it was what jack liked best about the old man he knew all his crew and the crew were all the more loyal for it here we are houston said he rested his hand on the latch to the door and glanced down the hall a tired smile on his face the gibraltar i cant believe im back here i know what you mean houston snorted theyve got me berthed up in flag country seems strange last night i almost returned to my old cos cabin by habit funny how the mind works the old man shook his head and pulled open the door he waved for jack to enter first the conference room was dominated by a long mahogany table it had already been set up for the briefing water glasses notebooks and pens were aligned precisely before each of the ten chairs there were also thermoses of coffee and platters of small sandwiches jack glanced around as he crossed to the table maps and charts hung on the walls with tiny flagged pins poking out he recognized a regional map of local currents on a nearby wall inked squares were checkered on it the search parameters it seemed that the admiral had not been lax on the ride here jack took it all in quickly then turned to find houston directly behind him again the admiral seemed to study him so howve you been jack he shrugged surviving hmmthats too bad jack scrunched up his brows surprised by this response he did not think the admiral bore him any ill will but houston clarified his statement as he sank into one of the seats and kicked another toward jack life isnt just about surviving its about living jack sat if you say so any women in your life jack frowned he did not understand this line of questioning i know youre not married but is there anyone special in your life no not really friends thats all why the admiral shrugged just wondering we havent spoken in over a decade not even a christmas card jack wrinkled his brow but youre jewish okay a hanukkah card you ass my point is that i thought youd at least keep in touch jack studied his own hands rubbing at his chairs armrests in discomfort i wanted to put everything behind me start new and hows that going for you houston asked sourly jacks discomfort welled toward anger he bit it back and remained silent goddamn it jack cant you tell when someone is trying to help you jack glanced to his former co and hows that whether you know it or not ive been keeping tabs on you i know the financial straits youre in youre about to lose that rust bucket of yours ill manage yeah and youll manage a hell of a lot better with several thousand dollars from the navy for assisting us in the search for air force one jack shook his head i dont need your charity well you need something you goddamn stubborn fool both men just stared at one another for several breaths houston finally clenched a fist on his knee but his voice softened with old pain do you remember when ethel died jack nodded ethel had been the admirals wife for over thirty years a year before the shuttle accident she had succumbed to complications from ovarian cancer in many ways ethel had been the only mother jack had ever known his own mother had died when he was three years old the day before she slipped into a coma she told me to watch over you jack looked up in surprise the admiral would not meet his eyes but jack noticed a glint of tears i dont know what ethel ever saw in you jack but i wont let the old broad down ive given you enough time to yourselfto work through what happened on the atlantis but enough is enough what do you want of me he met jacks eyes youve been hiding out here long enough i want you to come in from the sea jack just stared dumbfounded thats why i recruited you not just for your submersible its time you returned to the real world and the navy is the real world jack snorted close enough we at least come to port every now and then jack shook his head listen i appreciate your concern i really do but im almost forty years old not a child to be coddled whether you believe it or not im happy in my current life his former commander sighed and lifted his hands in surrender you are a goddamn piece of work jack he stood up the briefing should be under way shortly i suppose you understand the importance of our work here jack nodded standing also of course its air force one the president its more than just the president jack weve lost presidents before but never under such circumstances in the middle of a worldwide catastrophe as much as the rest of the world disparages the united states and its foreign policy it still doesnt stop them from looking to us for leadership during a time of crisis and now we are leaderless rudderless what about the vice president lawrence nafe i see you at least keep abreast of current events out here houston teased lightly but his voice quickly grew sober again his brows knit with worry washington is screaming for answers before nafe can be sworn in we need to put the fate of president bishop to rest already rumors are spreading some are claiming terrorists arabs russian chinese serbian or even the ira take your pick some are saying its all a hoax some say its a conspiracy tied to jfk the admiral shook his head its a friggin mess for order to be restored we need concrete answers we need a body we can bury with the usual pomp and ceremony thats why were here jack had never seen mark houston look so worried ill do my best to help he said sincerely just ask and ill do it i never expected less of you before jack could stop him the admiral reached out and gave him a quick hug and whether you believe it or not jack im glad to see you again welcome back to the gibraltar jack froze in the mans embrace unable to speak houston released him and headed toward the door i have a few last minute details to address but help yourself to the sandwiches jack the egg salad is especially good real eggs not that powdered shit the admiral gave him a tired smile then left closing the door behind him alone jack sank into one of the seats he wiped his damp palms on his trousers the gravity of the situation began to press on him for the first time in a decade he sensed the eyes of the world again looking in his direction three hours later jack found himself back on the deep fathom but not for long dressed in his blue norseman dry suit he climbed into the cockpit of the nautilus squeezing into the cramped seat once settled he hooked up the biosensor monitors and attached his microphone he ran down the predive safety checklist with lisa who was in the fathoms pilothouse charlie worked atop the submersible as it floated behind the fathom stomping around visually checking seals while robert in mask and snorkel swam under the ship jack had done his own check but his crew were taking no chances check everything twice he had drilled into them charlie clambered over to jack he stared with concern at his friend you sure about this mon thats a long way down deeper than youve ever flown this girl shes rated for this depth on the drawing boards maybe but this is real life the ocean has a way of surprising you she can be a real bitch jack looked up at the jamaican geologist im going charlie okay mon its your funeral jack reached out and clasped the large mans hand then charlie lowered the acrylic dome over jacks head and screwed it into place once done charlie gave jack a thumbsup and dove off the sub joining the marine biologist in the water as jack finalized his checklist around the fathom the other search ships were spread in a wide circle off to the south the gibraltar filled the horizon overhead a sea knight helicopter buzzed by all eyes remained on jack and his tiny sub lisa came on the radio youre ready to go jack the nervousness in her voice could not be hidden check and check diving now he said dryly he engaged the thrusters the sub humming under him he took on ballast and the nautilus began to lower into the surf the waterline climbed up the dome swamping over jacks head a brief flash of claustrophobia struck him he ignored it he knew it was just a base animal reaction a triggered survival instinct against drowning divers had been experiencing it for ages he breathed steadily past the momentary twinge of anxiety as the sub sank deeper he had a long way to go six hundred meters more than a quarter of a mile earlier on the gibraltar the briefing had been curt and to the point the overnight search had picked up the pinging of the flights data recorder and the ntsb team had localized the most likely dive spot in water over six hundred meters deep the coast guards vice admiral had argued for deploying the navys deep drone a remoteoperated deepsea robot to explore the seabed but the deep drone presently stationed in the atlantic could not be flown onsite for another two days as the situation was debated jack had let the group know that his own ships test submersible was rated for depths of eight hundred meters and that he would be willing to at least recon the site and attempt to retrieve the data recorders the ntsb seemed reluctant to accept his help too dangerous the team leader had asserted we cant risk the loss of more lives but jacks former commander had argued against such caution if mr kirkland says he can safely explore the region then i say let him even now jack could remember the flare of pride at mark houstons support without it he wouldnt be diving to this new depth with his other teammates clear jack worked the pedals of the nautilus he descended in a slow spiral his eyes on all his monitors the ping of his own sonar echoing in his ears the space between the ping and its return were still spaced far apart pingping as he sank deeper the waters grew darker around him he flicked the battery switch and engaged the subs headlights cones of brilliance shot forward disappearing into the infinite blue slipping past the two hundred meter mark the waters became inky as if he were descending through oil instead of water already jack heard the telltale groan and tick of stressed seals as pressure built outside the sub but this was just the beginning at a depth of six hundred meters the pressure would grow to half a ton per square inch enough to crush him to pulp in a heartbeat he reached to his computer monitor and tapped up the sonar model for this region of the seafloor the detail was poor scans had revealed only an odd fuzzy detail of the seabed even sidescanning sonar had failed to make much headway the topography of the seabed here was too folded and broken with hills scarps seamounts and other seabed aberrations any hope of discovering a telltale sonar ghost of the airplane had long been given up it would be up to him to search from here ping ping jack began to feed his own sonar information into the computer model slowly the fuzzy detail began to focus details emerged are you getting this he asked touching his microphone lisa answered its a mess down there be careful as the sonar image grew crisper he could make out a maze of gigantic seamounts and flattopped guyots on the floor below deep canyons and troughs wound around these towering mounts it reminded jack of the badlands of the american west a maze of crisscrossing canyons and river channels through a landscape of windswept mesas and red rock he had once taken a horseback trip through those wild lands even with a map it had been easy to get lost he suspected the same was true here the radio hissed for a moment then charlies voice came over the tiny speakers i dont like what im seeing jack what do you mean seamounts arise from volcanic activity this dense clustering looks highly suspect to me any seismic readings a long pause uh noits all quiet but i still dont like it keep an eye out for me charlie jack remembered what happened the last time he had ignored the geologists advice a volcano opened up under him he did not want to repeat the experience he continued to sink deeper in a widening spiral slowing his descent he watched his depth gauge climb from the four hundred mark toward the five hundred beyond the acrylic dome tiny flickering lights caught his eye drawing his attention away from his monitors at first he thought it was just his imagination then as if he were caught in a snowstorm a flurry of blue lights swelled and fluttered around his sub bioluminescent creatures too tiny and transparent to see clearly coming up on life down here jack said he hit the video button swiveling around to appreciate the storm as it rolled and churned away into the darkness hows the new video feed shaky jitterybut we can make out pretty good detail as quickly as they had appeared the flock of organisms were gone darkness closed in again jack settled into his seat the experimental video system had been loaned to them by the navy and installed quickly so others could monitor his progress he glanced to his depth gauge he was already nearing the six hundred mark pingping the sonar echo narrowed he had to be near the floor he slowed his descent from a spiral to a gradual slope gliding smoothly down lights spearing forward jack oh shit he saw it at the same time he slammed the left pedal tilting the sub and driving it in a sharp turn to the left he just missed crashing into a tall gnarled pillar it had appeared out of the darkness jack stabilized his sub circled past the pillar and found himself in a forest of other twisted columns and spires some were spindly only a hand span wide but tens of meters tall others were as thick as redwoods and towered just as high he had almost crash landed into a stone forest charlies voice was full of delight get as much on video as you can jack had never seen their like he rose a bit to avoid the densest patches but still had to weave and wiggle around the larger pillars what are they lava pillars fragile basalt columns formed where lava extrudes up tiny cracks in the mantle then are cooled rapidly by the frigid waters jack tilted to view the twisted tangle below and watched a huge octopus climb through the tangle fish darted from his light charlie continued we still dont know much about them they were only recently discovered jack edged past a monster column that had to be three meters thick and vanished up into the darkness over his head but be cautious jack as i was warning you before this clustering of lava pillars suggests the region is unstable a tectonic hot spot not a place you want to be hanging around but ive got your back any blip on the seismic scale and ill send you an sos please do jack cleared his throat lisa can you hear me yeah jack how am i positioned in reference to the ntsbs estimate of where air force ones black box is pinging a short pause im feeding your computer the newest data you should be almost on top of her about a hundred and twenty meters due north jack glanced to his compass the needle jittered in a half arc back and forth he futilely tapped the glass it had been working perfectly ten minutes ago lisa you may have to guide me in verbally the compass is malfunctioning cant get a clear reading fine turn the subs nose about thirty degrees then go straight jack slowly turned the ship estimating by using one of the pillars as a reference point how about now perfect straight ahead slow jack depressed the foot pedals and the sub slid smoothly forward lights drilling a path forward good your trajectory is right on target frowning jack watched his compass begin to swing wildly it reminded him of the problem he had with his compass when he was caught in the volcanic eruption topsidetheres something screwy with suddenly the submersibles lights reflected back at jack blinding him for a few blinks holy shit lisa finished for him ahead a massive sleek triangle of whitewashed metal blocked the way forward thrusting up from the jungle of lava pillars the twin xenon lamps lit it up brightly in the center a huge american flag was prominently depicted under it the designation boeing it was the tail fin of air force one the eagle has been found he whispered jack slowed his sub engaging the thrusters to lift him up and over the gigantic fin as he rose he dilated his lights to maximum diffusion thrusting a fog of brilliance over the landscape below past the tail fin the remainder of the wreckage appeared in a rain of destruction the boeing lay scattered across the valley in a rough circle hundreds of the fragile lava pillars lay toppled amid the debris seamounts towered on the far side jack slowly circled the site sections of torn wing and chunks of fuselage littered the seabed he crossed over the crumpled nose of the great plane its glass had been shattered out but jack could see the instrument panel he tore his eyes away afraid of what else he might find it was a graveyard down here memories of the shuttle crash flashed across his mind another fall from the sky had this been all that was left of atlantis bits and pieces scattered across a seabed floor jack shuddered the admirals firm desire to know the fate of president bishop had been accomplished all that remained now were the details who to blame jack closed his eyes for a moment taking a deep breath after the atlantis disaster he had experienced firsthand the feeding frenzy of blame and he pitied the person who would bear the brunt of the coming accusations opening his eyes he reached and gripped the controls to his exterior manipulator arms he had one final duty down here retrieve the two black boxes the flights data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder and bring them to the surface lisa im going to need more guidance from here to find those boxes jack glanced at his compass expecting to see it still spinning instead the needle remained fixed and steady pointing toward the debris field looks like ive got the compass back good then what you want to do jack watched the compass needle slowly inch as the nautilus circled the debris field just a second lisa bunching his brows he accelerated gliding around the edge of the crash site he completed almost a full turn yet the compass needle continued to point toward the center of the destruction that cant be right what is it lisa asked do you have a problem jack slowed the sub swinging its nose forward he coned his lights back down to narrow spears the concentrated light penetrated to the heart of the debris field a towering pillar lay near the center at least forty meters tall but something wasnt right the pillar seemed to glow jack blinked thinking the seawater must be playing tricks he edged the nautilus forward passing for the first time into the graveyard small hairs at the back of his neck began to tingle not from any fear of the ghosts but something more physical even the hairs on his arm began to vibrate lisas voice came over the radio but interference drowned out her words not static it was as if someone had recorded lisas voice and played it back at a higher speed say again topside he concentrated and he could just make out lisas words your heart rateits dropping significantly are you okay jack glanced to his own pulse reading it was normal i dont understand any response was lost in a highpitched whine jack lowered the volume as it began to ache his ear he thought there must be a glitch with the radio and glanced to the compass it still pointed toward the strange pillar the damned thing must be magnetic as he moved nearer the pillar the tingling sensation was swept from his body as if cool water were drenching him jack shivered and slowed the submersible he hovered before the pillar craning his neck he examined its length the column continued to glow but not with its own light it was simply an optical effect a reflection and refraction of his own light like sunlight on a diamond though the pillar was clearly stone it was not black volcanic rock instead it was made of some type of crystal like a shaft of quartz thrust up from the seabed floor under his lamplight the crystal had a slight aquamarine hue to it streaked with whorls of brilliant ruby though it stood as straight as an arrow jack sensed it was a natural structure not manmade some natural phenomenon undiscovered until now with only five percent of the ocean floor explored such discoveries like the lava pillars were being made all the time jack circled the crystalline obelisk with the communications still garbled he feared the video feed might also be affected so he switched the cameras to local recording saving it all on dvd disk once he was done he turned the sub around and returned to the edge of the debris field the mystery would have to wait for now he had a mission to complete he would use his own hydrophones and sonar to search for air force ones data recorders it would make the work harder but not impossible whatever communication glitch had occurred would have to be worked out topside as he swung free of the debris field lisas voice came over the radio as clear as glass jackwhat the hell is going on down there lisa jack the relief in her voice rang clear you goddamn asshole why didnt you answer me the readings we were getting were all frizzed and the video feed became garbled nonsense we didnt know what was going on how are my readings now uhfine green lights across the board what happened down there im not entirely sure theres something here that i cant explain its screwing with my compass and must be affecting other systems too what is it charlie asked piping in i was getting tiny seismic readings just as you went offline you scared me good mon im not sure charlie but i got it all on dvd ill show you when i get topside but right now i still have my mission to accomplish jack glided the sub near the jets tail fin again he had come complete circle lisa can you guide me to the boxes yyoure right on top of them lisas voice trembled she was clearly still shaken grab them and get your ass out of there jack lowered the sub will do he glanced to his compass it still pointed to the strange pillar thrusting up from the heart of the debris a gigantic gravestone marking the resting place of the dead he began his search through the rubble with a quiet prayer for the men and women of air force one especially one rest in peace mr president ancient footprints july pm off the coast of yonaguni island okinawa prefecture miyuki karen yelled a second shot blasted from beyond the short tunnel muffled this time but who karen knelt on both knees she saw the passage to the outside blocked someone was crawling toward her she swung her tiny flashlight up from the tunnel miyukis panicked face stared back at her pull me to you she hissed someones shooting at us miyuki extended her arms karen dropped the flashlight and reached out to grasp her friends wrists planting her feet she hauled miyuki inside the cramped heart of the pyramids temple miyuki panting and wildeyed rolled off karen and sat up she reached down and unhooked two packages from her ankles their tote bag of equipment and karens automatic still in its holster i didnt want to leave anything behind she said handing karen the pistol karen undid the snaps and shook the holster off her gun it reassured her to feel cold steel in her palm what happened menthree of them they must have spotted our boat and come to see what we had discovered looters miyuki nodded so you crawled in here i didnt know what else to do did they see you slip in here i dont know already harsh voices echoed to them their attackers were climbing the pyramid karen did not have time to crawl back out and set up an ambush she scanned around the cramped chamber for another exit they were trapped all they had to defend themselves were the eight remaining bullets in her pistol miyuki backed away from the tunnel opening what are we going to do she crossed to the snakeadorned altar and crouched next to it the rasp of boots on stone approached the voices louder the looters were not speaking japanese it sounded like a dialect of one of the south pacific islanders karen strained to understand but the language was unfamiliar to her a pair of legs appeared at the tunnels entrance tensing karen flicked off her flashlight plunging the chamber into darkness she raised the pistol in both hands sunlight blazed beyond the tunnel she had a clear shot three men eight bullets if she shot well they might have a chance but her hands shook she was an excellent shot but had never aimed at a human target before the man knelt at the exit leaning on one palm karen noticed a pale tattoo scrawling up his dark arm a winding snake the man twisted barking an order to a companion as his forearm turned karen saw the sprout of feathers about the head of the snake its red eyes stared back at her karen suppressed a gasp it was the same as the altars carving the mans face leaned into view flashlight in hand in his other hand he held her embroidered jacket he yelled something toward them though she didnt know the language she knew he was ordering them to show themselves karen ducked to the side as a beam of light pierced their hiding place she clutched the gun to her chest she would only shoot if forced maybe they would believe that she and miyuki had fled the beam of light vanished and darkness reclaimed the chamber karen leaned against the damp rock wall as long as they sat still she thought they were safe if any of the men tried to crawl inside she could easily dispatch them with a single shot the best defense right now was a waiting game the men outside had grown quiet karen could hear scuffling and scraping but could not discern what they were doing moving quietly she shifted to peer out of the tunnel again in the bright sunlight she saw a rusted metal canister being tipped and its contents splashed into the tunnels entrance the reek hit her nostrils at the same time understanding clenched her heart kerosene karen watched the trail of flammable liquid flow down the slanted tunnel toward them she covered her mouth against the rising fumes the looters meant to burn them out or kill them she backed away from the tunnel knowing she dare not shoot not when a spark might ignite the kerosene karen bumped into miyuki behind her her friend had her handheld palm computer in the gloom she saw miyuki furiously tapping at its tiny glowing screen im trying to reach gabriel miyuki said sternly all business a call for help but there is too much interference karen was surprised at miyukis resourcefulness what if you were nearer the entrance miyuki glanced toward the opening that might help she said briefly illuminated by the computer screens glow karens eye again caught on the rubyeyed altar serpent it was similar to the rendering on their attackers arm was there some connection but how the pyramid had been submerged for centuries in these waters miyuki had moved closer to the entrance with karen beside her the flow of kerosene now trailed into the chamber karen peered out and saw the canister on its side no men were in sight but she could still hear them tilting her head she listened they were singing or perhaps chanting shivering she gestured to miyuki hurry her friend knelt into the stream of flammable liquid her hands trembling she dropped to her belly extending her computer to arms length down the tunnel seeking a wireless signal i can barely see the screen just try we have to good afternoon professor nakano gabriels voice seemed explosively loud miyuki froze sprawled in the stream of kerosene gabriel i am continuing to collect and correlate your data may i be of additional assistance the singsong chanting continued uninterrupted from beyond the tunnel their conversation had not been heard can you pick up our location of course my gps is working perfectly professor nakano then please contact the chatan authorities tell them we are under assault by looters at this location before gabriel could acknowledge this command the chanting outside abruptly ended karen clutched miyukis arm warning her to silence miyuki yanked back her computer and the two women rolled to the side karen saw the first mans face appear again at the tunnels mouth this time it was not a flashlight he held in his free hand but a matchstick time had run out he struck the match on the stone a tiny flame sprouted holding the match aloft the man again called toward them his words almost sounded laced with regret then he tossed the flaming match down the tunnel northwest of enewak atoll central pacific youre running out of air jack lisa warned through the radio her voice had remained edgy since the glitch in communications she had been calling him every other minute i know he snapped back at her i can see my oxygen gauge jack worked the pedals of his submersible while simultaneously manipulating the controls to the remote exterior arms he dragged a large chunk of fuselage out of the way silt billowed up from his motion clouding his view he had been working now close to an hour shifting through the debris following the ping of the wrecks black boxes jack released the chunk of twisted metal and shifted the sub into reverse using the thrusters to blow the silt clear he didnt have time to wait for it to settle on its own the nautilus glided backward but he watched the water clear ahead of him once satisfied he slowed the submersible and edged back to the work site tilting the sub jack examined the sandy seabed a thick sea cucumber rolled across the empty space disturbed by his passage cmon you bastard where are you then he spotted it a squarish object half buried in the muddy silt he swung his lights to focus on it and sighed in relief thank god he wiped sweat from his eyes the small space had grown humid from his labors found it he called hoarsely into his microphone say again i found the second black box he inched the sub forward and settled it to the seabed the characteristic orange and red box lay near the subs nose the term black box was a misnomer the data recorders had never been black jack reached out with his titanium arms using the right pincer he gripped the rectangular box and carefully pulled it from the mud he lifted it into view and grinned in relief suddenly giddy he had done it it was air force ones cockpit recorder got it then get your ass up here jack youre damn near the point of no return your co levels are already rising i hear you mother he said checking his gauges he had just enough oxygen to reach the surface at least he hoped so swinging around in a tight arc he returned to where he had left the first box the flights data recorder and collected it up in his left pincer got both prizes coming up jack had reached for the key to blow his ballast when a glint from the seafloor caught his eye frowning he swung his lamps a gasp escaped his throat oh god jack what is it in the lamps glare a face stared back at him from the seabed floor it took jack a couple heartbeats to realize the visage was not that of a dead body instead the face shone bright green under his light it was hard crystalline jade as he adjusted the light he recognized the distinct asian features and ancient war crown hed been told about the gift given to president bishop by the chinese premier a fullsized replica of a terracotta warrior done in jade jack nudged the nautilus closer and bumped the bust with one of the subs arms the head rolled across the silty bottom it was all that was left of the tenfoot statue jack what is it lisa repeated jack swallowed hard nothing im okay coming up but before he could leave his eyes returned to the green gaze of the jade bust the features were so lifelike the sole survivor of the tragedy switching both black boxes to one pincer jack used the freedup arm to grab the piece of jade sculpture it had been the last gift to a dead president he would not leave it behind with his treasures in hand jack tapped a key and blew his ballast the sub burst upward from the seabed with a goose of his thrusters below he watched the debris field fade away near its center the strange spear of crystalline rock came into view again jabbing up from the seabed his gaze was drawn to it he knew charlie would sell his eyeteeth to catch a glimpse of the amazing structure jack hoped the video footage he had recorded to disk would come out as he climbed the sight vanished beyond the reach of the subs searchlights jack settled back to his seat every muscle ached he had not realized how the effort had worn on him the tension the cramped quarters the meticulous work while sifting through the debris he had kept himself tight as a fist periodically as hed worked the strange tingling sensation had washed over him quivering the tiny hairs all over his body it was as if the eyes of the dead were studying him occasionally he would swear he caught movement at the corners of his eyes but when hed looked all he found was wreckage and debris jack theres someone here who wants to speak to you who a new voice came over the radio how are you doing jack admiral what was mark houston doing aboard the fathom as if reading his mind the admiral answered i was flown to your boat about ten minutes ago i heard the good news en route so youve recovered both data recorders yes sir i should be up with them in about fifteen minutes i knew you could do it jack jack remained silent as much as he wanted to distance himself from his naval past praise from his old commander still affected him admiral houston continued how did your submersible handle except for that glitch in communications she handled like a dream good because the ntsb team has been monitoring your video feed of the wreckage the team has already targeted a few key pieces of the plane that theyd like to see brought to the surface sir would you be willing to haul cable from the winches jack bit his lower lip holding back a curse he had hoped the retrieval of the flights data recorders would end his obligation here id have to check with the rest of my team of course you have the night to sleep on it the ntsb will have enough on its hands just analyzing the black boxes jack grimaced he did not want to return to the deepsea graveyard though he had been searching wrecks for the past decade this one was different it reminded him too acutely of his own accident ill consider it admiral thats all ill say for now thats all im asking sighing jack leaned back and watched the depth gauge wind toward the two hundred meter mark the seas around him began to lighten it was as if dawn were approaching after a long moonless night he had never wanted to see the sky so desperately a more familiar voice returned to the radio we have your gps picked up lisa said charlie already has the dinghy in the water thanks lisa the sooner i get out of this titanium coffin and into a cold shower the better what about what the admiral wants us to do jack screwed up his face he did not want this conversation what do you think should we do it he could almost hear lisa shrug its up to you jack but i dont like that communication glitch the sub is still experimental it was not meant to be tested so vigorously id really like to see the sub drydocked and inspected to make sure the seals are undamaged you dont take chances at these depths youre probably right lisa this wreckage isnt going anywhere jack warmed to the idea it would buy him time to sort through his feelings could you have robert prepare the aframe well haul the nautilus out and give her a thorough going over before we consider the navys request good lisa sounded relieved the depth gauge crossed the hundred meter level jack craned his neck back he could see the distant sun as a watery glow in the dim water i should be up in less than a minute were ready for you charlie is on his way jack closed his eyes allowing himself a few private moments if the admiral was aboard the fathom he suspected this would be his last moment of peace for the remainder of the day he knew he faced a long debriefing as sunlight suddenly burst around him jack peeked open his eyes he fished into a side compartment and retrieved his sunglasses after being submerged for so long the light stung as he snapped the side compartment closed his hand settled on the video dvd recorder without a good reason but unable to resist he popped out the tiny disk slipped it into a pocket of his wet suit and zippered it closed the video of the crystal spire had nothing to do with the crash and charlie would want to see it if the investigators knew of it they would just confiscate it and lose it among the thousands of other details or so he rationalized to himself in truth the bit of subterfuge was his way of exerting some control over the situation he meant to keep something for himself from this adventure the sound of an outboard motor sounded buzzing through the gentle slosh of waves against his acrylic bubble jack turned and spotted the fathoms zodiac dinghy its green pontoons bouncing through the small swells grinning he slipped on his sunglasses he spotted charlie at the wheel the tall jamaican waved a long arm in his direction here comes the cavalry then jack saw someone standing beside the geologist someone in a black wet suit he frowned whos that charlie pulled alongside the bobbing sub and hopped over as he secured the mooring lines the dinghys other occupant dumped over the side before jack could get a better look at him charlie clambered over and unscrewed the acrylic dome jack pushed from the inside and shoved the dome back fresh air swept into the cabin and he breathed deeply not realizing until this moment how dead the air in the sub had become he had shaved this dive a little close pulling with his arms jack yanked himself from the compartment whos with you one of those ntsb investigator boys hes here to make sure the black boxes are secure jack stretched joints popping then clambered over toward the nose of the sub i could have brought them in myself theyre not taking any chances national security and all that someone had to be present jack knelt and saw the man in snorkel and mask working at the grips of the submerged arms he worked fast and efficiently at least they sent someone who knew something about submersibles the man loosened the first pincer and collected both data recorders into a bulky float bag it bobbed to the surface tied by a tether to the mans belt the man did not even come up for air as he turned his attention to the second pincer he freed the jade bust and collected it into another float bag jack felt a twinge of respect the man knew his stuff as the second float bag broke the surface charlie called to jack help me turn the dinghy jack left his observation point and assisted charlie with the final preparations to haul the submersible back to the fathom not that they would have far to go the fathom was already motoring toward their position jack squinted at his ship a welcome sight the dinghy suddenly rocked under jacks feet he grabbed the back of the pilots seat to keep his footing glancing over his shoulder he saw the ntsb man haul himself over the leeward pontoon jack stumbled over to assist the man into the dinghy but by the time he got there the man had rolled aboard and was hauling one of the float bags inside let me help you jack said leaning over the side and grabbing the edge of the other float bag jack found himself hipchecked and knocked onto his rear leave it the man ordered his words were harsh and carried a tone of command jack pushed to his feet his cheeks red his blood up no one shoved him around his own boat he stepped nearer who the hell do you think the big man turned ripped away his mask and pulled back the hood of his wet suit jack gasped as he recognized the diver it could not be he had not seen his former teammate in over a decade david the tall blond mans face was twisted with hatred before jack could move a fist flew toward his face hard knuckles struck his lower jaw and threw him backward sparks of light danced across his vision as he hit the floor charlie was instantly there stepping between the attacker and his captain what the hell do you think youre doing mon jack sat up stay out of it charlie he pushed himself to his feet tasted blood on his tongue the tall jamaican moved back a half step ready to defend his friend if necessary david spanglers thin lips sneered at jack that was for jen he spat jack rubbed his jaw he had no answer for that in fact he couldnt blame david for his reaction what are you doing here he simply asked leaning back against a chair ive been assigned to the investigation by the new president whats the cia have to do with this davids right eye twitched yeah i heard about your transfer jack said tired it seems youve moved up in the world and you should have stayed gone from it david said he turned and hauled the second float bag into the dinghy it wasnt my idea to come here let me guess david said harshly admiral houston called you in jack shrugged david dumped the second black box into the boat none too gently houston always had a hardon for you kirkland jacks voice grew gruff he was a friend of jennifers too yeah and look what it got her jack nudged charlie toward the wheel get us out of here jack stared david down in the other mans blue eyes jack saw all the blame he felt in his own heart im sorry about jennifer he started fuck your apology david spat back i have my job you have yours just stay out of my way jack knew no words would ever settle this old score david would never forgive him for his sisters death the chasm between them was unbridgeable giving up jack crossed to the stern to make sure the mooring lines remained clear of the motor as he moved past the former seal the man leaned close to him his breath hot on jacks face davids eyes shone with rancor and malice it was like looking into the eyes of a rabid animal he whispered so his words were heard only by jack this isnt over kirkland off the coast of yonaguni island okinawa prefecture get back karen pulled miyuki to her knees flames filled the narrow crawlway and spread rapidly along the trail of kerosene on hands and knees the two fled behind the altar at the crawlway flames swept into their hiding place accompanied by a blast of searing heat and stinging smoke miyuki cupped her arm across her mouth her eyes tearing karen joined her suppressing a choking cough afraid to alert the looters outside what were they to do in the brightness of the flames karens watery eyes were drawn to the sharp glint from the snake sculpture wrapped around the altar its twin eyes glowed at her reflecting the fire rubies karen miyuki reached out a hand to her karen took it and the women clung to one another the wall of flames blocked escape and the air grew smokier with each breath im sorry karen mumbled could there be another way out miyuki asked a secret passage karen bit her lower lip straining to think past her panic i dont know if there was it would probably be near the altar her eyes were again drawn to the altars snake carving something had been bothering her about it nagging for her attention her gaze caught again on the snakes ruby eyes with her free hand karen touched the stone carving then she saw it reflected in the firelight a defect one of the ruby eyes shone much brighter than the other it was almost as if a hollow space lay behind it using a finger she pressed against the faceted eye what are you doing miyuki asked the jewel pushed back into the snakes skull she heard a sharp click then felt the snakes head loosen in her grip its a lock release she could now swing the figures head back and forth but nothing happened what was its purpose the smoke meanwhile settled thicker in the chamber near the tunnel the flames receded the kerosene almost spent karen rubbed her sore eyes outside she heard the attackers stir since their initial volley had failed to smoke them out what might they do next the answer came quickly a flaming glass bottle flew into the room and exploded against the front of the altar a wave of fire burst up karen fell backward and miyuki ducked farther behind the altar with a startled squawk goddamn them karen swore ignoring the flames she moved back to the altar the secret release suggested the carving was more than decoration could there be a hidden passage the heat burned karens cheeks as she studied the stone snake the serpent curled fully around the edge of the altar its tail not far from its raised head a thought occurred to her the worm ourbourus the snake biting its own tail a symbol of the infinite many cultures had similar mythic images it was even in mayan astrology beyond the tunnel karen heard the mens voices grow heated argumentative impatient then a bullet blasted into the chamber ricocheting in a shower of stone shards ducking karen shoved the sculptures head all the way around until the tip of the serpents snout touched its own tail a loud grinding sounded under her toes and karen tensed whats happening miyuki whispered waving the smoke away karen backed up as the altar stone lowered dropping into the slab floor cmon karen took the penlight from a pocket and flashed a long beam into the inky darkness the altar had fallen down about two meters she sensed that a larger chamber lay below and leaned closer trying to get a better look a bullet whizzed past her left ear she felt the heat of its passage as she dropped to her belly theres no other way out of here she said glancing at her friend miyukis eyes were huge but she gave a quick nod karen popped the penlight in her mouth ill go first she mumbled swinging her legs into the pit she probed with her toes no footholds with a glance below she aimed for the top of the lowered altar and pushed off her feet hit hard dropping her to one hand she flashed her light around the chamber pools of dank water dotted the floor pale ropes of algae hung from the roof on the far side a dark tunnel led away she stood and shifted her light for a better look no not a tunnel a stairway it descended at a steep angle wherever it led it was better than here a second shot blasted overhead quickly followed by another miyuki squeaked laying flat straightening karen called up toss my gun and holster miyukis face disappeared for a moment here she dropped the leather holster strap the gun followed a second later karen caught it in one hand now you karen urged not yet miyuki disappeared again what was she doing miyukis legs reappeared karen reached up and guided her friends ankles okay youre clear miyuki let go landing almost on top of karen who held her friend steady good job yeah thanks miyuki muttered clutching her satchel of equipment tight to her chest she caught karens glance i wasnt leaving gabriel behind karen grinned despite the situation she bent and collected her pistol it seemed each of them had their own security blanket holstering the gun she tossed the strap over her shoulder cmon she hopped off the altar and miyuki followed as soon as the petite woman left the stone table they heard gears grinding overhead the altar stone and its platform thrust back up rose on a basalt pillar and jammed back into place pressure sensitive karen said with awe at the keen counterbalance system it astounded her that the mechanism functioned after being immersed for centuries in the salty sea gloom settled over them distantly the drip of water echoed up from the neighboring stairwell miyuki took a flashlight from her bag clicked it on and shone it forward she wore a determined expression you go first karen nodded and led the way the stair was narrow but the ceiling high enough to walk upright within the passage the echoing drip of water grew louder karen splayed out her light ran a finger along the damp wall the stone blocks are fitted perfectly i can barely feel the seams miyuki made a noncommittal noise she kept glancing back over her shoulder as they moved slowly down the stairs do you think theyll follow karen directed her light forward again ii dont know but if they do lets be as far away from here as possible miyuki was silent for several steps her breathing though was strained and tight she finally asked the question uppermost in karens mind where do you think this leads id guess some royal burial chamber but im not sure this passage is pretty steep we must be close to the base of the pyramid by now proving her theory true the stairs ended at a tunnel the next passage led in a straight line away from there a long way karens light failed to find an end she assumed the tunnel led beyond the pyramid itself frowning she moved down to the last step ahead the tunnel lay partially flooded at least a foot of water covered the floor within the beam of her light karen watched trickles of water drip and flow from cracks in the ceiling we must be underneath the pyramidunderneath the sea itself she muttered look at the walls here theyre not carved stone blocks but solid rock it must have taken decades to tunnel out this passage miyuki leaned beside her maybe not it might just be a lava tube japan is riddled with them hmmmaybe miyuki stared over at the dripping water i dont know about this cant we just wait a ringing sound cut her off echoing down the stairs to them metal on rock the two womens eyes met theyre trying to dig themselves inside karen said miyuki pushed karen toward the watery passage get going karen splashed into the water and gasped as the cold clamped around her ankles the tang of salt was sharp in the stagnant air miyuki followed holding her equipment bag tight they continued down the long tunnel their splashes echoing up and down the passage the noise made them both edgy karen ran her fingers along the wall here too it was still smooth almost glassy too smooth to have been carved by crude tools it seemed a natural passage as miyuki had suggested she tapped the wall with a knuckle dont do that miyuki yelled at her the shout startled karen she dropped her hand do you want to drown us miyuki said this passage has been down here for ages still dont knock on the walls after the quakes and uplift you dont know how fragile it might be all right karen said ill leave it alone she turned her attention to the passage ahead which seemed to widen she increased her pace could it be the end she prayed for another exit the ringing strike of metal on stone still echoed periodically behind them their pursuers were not giving up splashing in water up to her knees now karen hurried forward then stopped she looked around mouth gaping open the passage continued but here the tunnel ballooned out the ceiling became a dome overhead as glassy and smooth as the passage itself if this was a lava tube a bubble must have formed at this spot karen wagged her flashlight around overhead embedded bits of glittering quartz dotted the roof at first she thought it was a random pattern then she turned in a circle neck craned back its a starscape see theres the orion constellation miyuki looked less impressed she glanced over her shoulder as another echoing strike sounded behind them we should keep going karen lowered her light she knew miyuki was right but her legs would not move nothing like this had ever been discovered among the islands of the south pacific who had built this her light now pointing forward settled on a waisthigh section of the wall a sharp glint attracted her attention she narrowed her eyes a small niche had been dug out of the smooth wall a cubbyhole something inside reflected back her light karen approached it miyuki started to speak but karen stopped her with an upraised hand she bent to peer into the tiny alcove resting inside was a palmsize crystal star five points glittered brightly under her penlight it was as if a rainbow had exploded inside as she shifted her light she noticed deep scratches on the nearby wall and took a step back she had almost missed it at first she cast her light along the curved wall my god meticulously carved into the stone were lines of small symbols three rows of them clearly some form of archaic language bending closer she touched the first symbol with a finger the wall etchings were precise carved deep as if written with a diamondpointed tool but for all the precision the symbols themselves were crude rough hieroglyphics pictures of animals and men in distorted shapes and postures strange icons and repeated symbols karen tilted her head moving the light the rows continued waisthigh around the bubble in the tunnel she turned to miyuki her breath rushed i need a picture of this what her friend looked at her as if she were crazy karen straightened reaching for miyukis bag video record it save it i cant risk this being lost miyuki scowled what are you thinking we need to get out here the looters might destroy this or the whole area might sink again im more worried about it sinking with us in it karen pleaded with her eyes finally miyuki sighed and passed the satchel to karen who held it as miyuki shuffled through it for her tiny digital camera freeing it she passed karen her own larger flashlight ill need plenty of light follow as i record miyuki returned to the wall camera raised she slowly edged around the chamber tracing the wrap of ancient writing until she made a complete circuit karen realized something as they worked its not three rows she mumbled its one continuous line starting at the crystal star and wrapping around and around the room like the groove in a vinyl record or a curled snake miyuki said lowering the camera as she finished recording she started to put it away satisfied karen passed miyuki the large flashlight could you get a couple shots of the star map on the ceiling miyuki frowned but took the flashlight snugging the equipment satchel over her shoulder karen turned away im going to take the crystal artifact with me we cant let the looters get it she crossed to the cubbyhole and reached inside grabbed the star and tried to pick it up but failed she gave it a cautious tug but it didnt budge goddamn its cemented in place finished with the recording miyuki joined karen then leave it she peered down the tunnel the sound of digging had stopped a few minutes ago i dont like this quiet maybe they got through karen scrunched up her brow she didnt want to leave the crystal star behind shine your light in here so i can see what im doing miyuki moved closer and shone her light into the cubby again the rainbow brilliance sparked sharply its beautiful she conceded in a hushed voice again karen palmed the star and tugged hard this time it popped free easily caught off guard she stumbled back bumping into miyuki her friends flashlight went flying and splashed into the water miyuki bent to retrieve it i hope youre done she said fishing through the seawater lucky the flashlights waterproof karen held the star against her belly it was like cradling a bowling ball she had to hold it with both hands the star hadnt been cemented into the niche she simply hadnt expected it to be so heavy this thing weighs a ton she said she lifted the star and dropped it into a side pocket of the equipment bag the bag now pulled hard on her shoulder okay lets keep going we should hurry i dont like how quiet the explosion caught them by surprise the two women were thrown to their knees as the tunnel shook the ringing blast deafened them karen twisted around keeping her bag above the water she fumbled for her pistol miyuki pointed her light back down the tunnel smoke billowed toward them from the far end dynamite karen said they must have lost their patience with a pickax as the ringing faded a low groan filled the tunnel the drip of water became a deep gurgle a few meters away a spout of water erupted spraying a thick stream of seawater closer a crack opened overhead weeping water over them its breaking apart miyuki yelled in terror up and down the passage more and more spouts opened falling rocks splashed run karen shouted already the water rose from knees to thighs karen led the way down the next tunnel miyuki struggling behind her fighting through the deepening water where are we going karen had no answer first fire now water if not for her numbing fear she would have appreciated the irony but not now ahead the dark passage stretched beyond the reach of their lightsquickly filling with frigid seawater endgame july pm northwest of enewak atoll central pacific in his usual red trunks and white cotton robe jack relaxed in a lounge chair on the bow deck of his ship his hair was still wet from the long shower but the late afternoon remained warm it felt good to soak in the last rays of the setting sun his dog elvis lay sprawled beside the lounge across the deck the sleek contours of the nautilus reflected the light off its titanium surface robert worked under the drydocked submersible inspecting every square inch while lisa sat inside doing the same so far the sub seemed to have withstood the extreme pressures without a problem the only concern the radio glitch lisa had been troubleshooting the computer and com systems trying to trace the gremlin in the works but so far without success hows your jaw jack turned his attention back to his companion admiral mark houston relaxed on a neighboring lounge he puffed on a thick cigar one of jacks prized stock with his other hand the admiral scratched elvis behind an ear earning a slow thump of a tail ive had worse jack rubbed his jaw it still ached dully houston held out his cigar inspecting it with pleasure cuban tobaccoim breaking so many laws but its worth it isnt it he replaced the cigar inhaling deeply oh yeah his eyes narrowed with appreciation as he exhaled except for the admiral and his two personal aides jack had the deep fathom back to himself at least for now with the two black boxes wrapped and under armed guard david spangler and the other government investigators had left immediately for the uss gibraltar the admiral had remained behind he would be alerted as soon as any word came through on the flight data and cockpit recorders until then everyone was holding their breath so i take it houston said that your reunion with commander spangler didnt resolve anything what did you expect jack slumped in his lounge chair first the gibraltar then admiral houston now david spangler all together again he had run from his past for over a decade and ended up right where he started he sighed nothing changes even before the shuttle accident david hated me he resented that i took his place on the shuttle it wasnt your decision it was nasas jurisdiction yeah tell that to spangler we had a major blowout the night before the launch i was almost scrubbed i remember he found out you were dating his sister during the year you spent at nasa training houston pointed his cigar at jacks swollen lip and it seems that old grudge is still strong jack shook his head he lost his sister who can blame him you should weve lost other shuttles everyone knows the risks the admiral sucked on his cigar besides theres something i just dont like about our mr spangler i never did theres always been a lot of hatred buried beneath that cold surface im not surprised hes fallen into the employ of nicolas ruzickov at the cia those two sharks deserve each other jack was surprised at the admirals words his face showed it houstons voice grew stern just watch yourself around him jack he pointed his cigar at jacks swollen eye dont allow your guilt to weaken your guard not around him jack remembered the keen hatred in davids eyes this isnt over kirkland perhaps he had better take his former commanders advice and steer clear of the man he thought jack closed his eyes and leaned back if only i had spotted the glitch a few seconds earlieror held her hand tighter hindsight is always twentytwenty jack but you know what sometimes shit happens you cant see every bullet aimed at your head life just isnt that fair when did you become such a philosopher houston tapped his cigar age grants you a certain wisdom from across the deck lisa called to him perched at the subs hatch jack come see this groaning jack pushed himself up what lisa just waved to him all right hang on he got off his lounger and the admiral sat up straighter preparing to follow relax jack said ill be right back elvis rolled to his chest starting to push to his legs jack held out a hand stopping the dog you too stay the german shepherd sank back to the deck with a clearly irritated huff houston patted elviss side we old men will keep each other company jack rolled his eyes then crossed the deck he climbed down the stepladder to join lisa she lowered herself into the subs seat and jack leaned over her whats up look at the nautiluss internal clock she pointed to the clocks red digital numbers the seconds scrolled normally now look at my wristwatch jack studied the swatch on her wrist then looked back at the digital clock it was off by a little over five minutes so its slow by a few minutes before the dive i synchronized the clock myself when i calibrated the biosensor program it was exact to the hundredth of a second i still dont understand the significance i compared the time gap with the biosensor log the difference in clocks exactly matches the length of time you were offline jack crinkled his brow so the glitch must have affected the clock too must be a short in one of the batteries no the batteries checked out fine she mumbled and looked up at him when you were offline did you see the clock stop jack shook his head frown lines creasing the corners of his lips no in fact i remember checking the clock was running normally the whole time lisa wiggled up off the seat it doesnt make any sense the diagnostics of the systems are perfect jack is there anything youre not telling me he glanced over his shoulder the admiral was lost in his appreciation of his cigar jack lowered his voice during the postdive briefing jack had glossed over the details of the strange crystal pillar no one seemed interested anyway that pillar i discovered down there yeah the one on the disk you gave charlie jack bit his lip he didnt want to sound crazy he ran a hand through his hair i dont know the pillar was giving off some strange vibrations or harmonics it screwed with my compass i could even feel it on my skin an itchy tingle like ants crawling all over lisa furrowed her brow why didnt you tell me this before i didnt want to prejudice your examination of the nautilus if there was any other explanation i wanted you to find it lisas cheeks grew red jesus christ you know me better than that either way i would have been just as thorough youre right im sorry lisa scooted out of the sub jack helped her onto the ladder her eyes flicked toward the admiral then back to jack charlie is still holed up with george studying that secret disk of yours im going to find out if theyve learned anything she shoved past you really should have told me jack what do you think it means lisa shrugged beats me but its worth checking out im coming with you robert the marine biologist crawled from under the subs tail all the seals check out fine jack if you want to take her for another dive you should have no problems jack nodded distracted robert could you keep the admiral company for a few minutes i have some brandy in the cupboard under the microwave yeah i know where its at but whats up well fill you in with the details as soon as we have any lisa answered casting an angry look at jack she moved off jack called across the deck to admiral houston ill be right back he was answered with a nod and a dismissive wave jack followed lisa to the lower deck hatch she descended the steep stair ahead of him back stiff this first of the lower levels contained roberts wet lab the ships library and charlies tiny work station below were the crews cabins lisa led the way through the wet lab to charlies smaller compartment she knocked on the steel door who is it charlie called out to them lisa and jack open up after a short pause jack heard the locks unlatch and the door creak open slightly charlie peered out at them just making sure youre alone he sounded excited the geologist pulled the door the rest of the way open cmon insideyou have to see this you found something jack asked as he and lisa entered oh yeah mon you could say that the geology lab was no bigger than a single car garage but every square inch was utilized equipment and tools were stacked neatly on shelves and counters rock saws drills sieves scales magnetometers even a complete asc core analysis system jack was ignorant of most of the equipments use this was charlies domain with a dual doctorate in geology and geophysics the jamaican geologist could have taught at any university but instead he ended up on jacks boat doing his own research i didnt earn my degrees to hole up in no classroom he had explained seven years ago eyes bright with excitement not when there is so much to explore out here the deep ocean seabed jack thats where the earths history and future are written down there its waiting for someone to read it and that someone is me as jack entered the lab now he saw the same excitement in charlies eyes the geologist waved them over to his worktable a television and video recorder had been set atop it crouched before it was the ships historian the professor leaned only a few inches from the video screen squinting through his bifocals george scribbled on a pad amazingsimply amazing he mumbled as he worked jack and lisa moved to either side of him trying to get a better look at the monitor what did you find jack asked george finally seemed to realize their presence he turned his eyes wide you have to go down there again he said in a rush clutching jacks sleeve what why we should start at the beginning charlie interrupted he pointed the remote and the video image reversed on the screen jack watched the view of the crystal spire vanish into the ocean gloom once hed rewound it far enough charlie stopped the dvd and allowed it to play forward the obelisk slowly reappeared as charlie spoke you were right jack the crystalline substance appears natural ive analyzed the video closely and from the fracturing of the planes and uniformity of light refraction it must be a spike of pure crystal but what type quartz charlie tilted his head watching the video no thats just it i dont know at least not yet but id sell the fathom for a sliver of it so you think its something new the tall jamaican nodded nowhere on this planet is there an environment like the one down there charlie tapped at the screen the sub slowly circled the spire showing the brilliant shaft from every angle the video image was crisp and detailed flawless there was no sign of the interference that was described topside at these extreme pressures of seawater and salinity who knows how crystals might grow jack sat on one of the stools he leaned closer to the screen so what youre saying is that were the first people ever to see such a crystal creation charlie laughed drawing jacks eye away from the screen no im not saying that monim not saying that at all charlie manipulated the remotes shuttle slowing the recording jack watched the spire slow its spin as the submersible finished its circuit charlie stopped the video just as the subs xenon headlamps began to swing away jack remembered this was the moment when he had turned back to continue his search for the black boxes he had been looking elsewhere and missed what his camera picked up next with the light cast at an angle across the nearest plane of the obelisk slight imperfections could be seen marring its crystalline surface what is that proof that were not the first to discover this crystal charlie played with the remote and zoomed in on the imperfections the image swelled on the monitor the imperfections grew into rows of tiny markings too regular and precise to be natural jack leaned in closer though the enlarged video image was fuzzy there was no mistaking what he was seeing george spoke it aloud voice hushed with awe its writing some type of ancient inscription but at those depths jack stared in disbelief etched deep into the crystal were blocks and rows of tiny iconlike images animals trees distorted figures geometric shapes jack could not dismiss what he was seeing each symbol was carved into the smooth surface then filled with a shiny metallic compound it was no optical illusion it was ancient writingon a spire two thousand feet underwater off the coast of yonaguni island okinawa prefecture karen held her penlight above her head as she fought the growing depth of the water she slogged forward the water now past her waist she shrugged the equipment bag higher on her shoulder trying her best to keep it dry but the heavy weight kept pulling toward the rising seawater when would this passage end how long was it up and down the passage the echo of pouring water filled the tunnel behind her she could hear miyuki struggling the japanese professor was smaller than her the water up to miyukis breasts she half swam to keep up at last karen saw her penlight illuminate another wall ahead something different than this endless passage i think weve reached the end she moved faster the tunnel ended at a staircase its steps climbing up it reminded her of the staircase that had led them down here she reached the first step almost tripping over it since it was under the black water catching herself on the smooth wall karen stumbled up the steps and dragged herself out of the flooding passage she turned to help miyuki and both women climbed several steps until exhaustion dragged them down they sat on the dry stairs panting shivering karen pointed to the walls on either side stone blocks she said here the walls and ceiling were no longer bare rock but stacked and carefully fitted basalt slabs and blocks were above the lava tube so we wont drown miyuki looked pale her ebony hair wet and clinging to her face not if we climb high enough get above sea level miyuki stared up the staircase but where are we if i had to guess id say these steps lead into the heart of the second dragon the twin pyramid to the one we entered at least she hoped so but it made some sort of symmetrical sense and if she wasnt mistaken the passage had been heading in the direction of the other pyramid the lava tube must connect the two structures will there be a way out karen nodded im sure there is she left unspoken her own fear what if they couldnt find it then lets go miyuki said shoving herself to her feet she reached toward karen ill carry the bag from here karen pushed the strap off only too glad to shed the burden and passed the bag to miyuki who almost dropped it you werent kidding that its heavy she said straining to heft it to her own shoulder nope its that crystal artifact it must weigh close to ten kilos but it was so small karen shrugged and stood up just one more mystery about this place sighing she led the way up praying that the final mystery would not escape her the way out of this death trap the climb up the steep stairs was a cruel torture for their aching limbs it felt like they were climbing a ladder but they plodded onward silent too tired to talk at least the exertion served to warm their cold bodies but soon even the warmth became a burden with each step the temperature seemed to rise in the narrow stairway by the time they neared the top of the stairs it was stifling it seemed to karen that her damp clothes were steaming she wiped the sweat from her forehead and entered the next chamber finally she moaned as she shuffled into the room miyuki followed her wheezing karen raised her small flashlight the bare walls of the inner chamber offered no clue to an exit stacked stones and a slab roof surrounded them both women gazed around there were no adornments no writing karen moved along the margins of the walls turn off your light she ordered miyuki karen flicked her penlight off too darkness plunged around them the echo of splashing water from the passage below seemed to swell with eyes wide karen looked for a chink in the solid walls and ceiling some evidence of an exit by now she assumed the sun would be sliding toward the western horizon she mopped at her brow it was so warm in there not a bit of air moved with one hand on a wall she edged around the room searching for a telltale glow some sign of an exit but the darkness seemed complete are you finding anything miyuki asked hopeful karen had opened her mouth to answer when her hand touched a stone warmer than the others she paused placing one palm on one stone and the other on its neighbor there was a clear difference in temperature i think i may have a clue here she fingered the edges of the warmer stone it was difficult in the dark the blocks had been fitted snugly she discovered the edges but as she stared found no sign of sunlight creeping through she frowned there had to be a reason for the warmer stone karen thumbed on her penlight and miyuki moved to her side resting her bag on the stone floor she rubbed at her shoulder what did you find karen shoved hard on the stone it didnt move she backed up a step head tilted studying the stone block it was featureless about half a meter square this is warmer than the others suggesting it must be more directly exposed to the sun is it a way out miyuki turned on her own flashlight i hope so i just dont know how to open it karen closed her eyes think goddamn it she pictured the second dragon in her mind it was identical to the first except for the collapsed temple this second pyramids summit had been bare no clue what are you thinking miyuki asked karen opened her eyes im not sure in the other pyramid the temples altar was the access point the sculptured snake head was the key yeah think symmetry think larger in the ruins of chichen itza on the yucatan peninsula the main pyramid casts a snake shadow during the equinoxes a winding shadowy body that connects to a carved stone snake head at its base i dont understand karen kept talking intuiting that she was close to an answer the serpents head was the entry point this connected to a long lava tubeperhaps representing a snakes body miyuki nodded if youre right then were in the snakes tail we were swallowed by a snake traveled through its belly and now must complete the digestive process in other words we must find this snakes butt karen laughed at the dead seriousness with which miyuki had spoken these last words yep karen turned the opening to the stairwell lay directly opposite her she twisted around the warm stone was in direct line with the opening a straight line she placed a hand on the stone this is the tip of the tail the end of the snake right you said that its the way out no we arent paying attention to anatomy a snakes butt isnt in the tip of its tail its on its underside karen pointed to the floor its belly miyuki stared at her toes to go up we must go down karen dropped to her knees on the stone floor it wasnt a slab but fitted blocks like the walls she crawled forward starting at the warm brick and aiming for the stairwell wiping the water and debris from the floor as she went it had to be here her fingers brushed over something rough on the smooth stone she froze for a heartbeat then rubbed the spot praying miyuki knelt near her what is it karen moved aside the snakes butt imprinted into the smooth block was a carving a starshaped depression get me the crystal miyuki rushed over and retrieved her bag she dragged it back then zipped open the side pouch and pulled the starshaped crystal out she had to use both hands grunting she hauled it over to karen here karen rolled to her belly and lugged the star into place in the depression it was a perfect fit she held her breath ready for anything miyuki stood by her shoulder a fist at her throat nothing happened karen sat up on her knees whats wrong what arent we doing right maybe the mechanism is broken karen did not even want to think of that possibility she knew that by now the lower passage must be totally flooded there was no way back they were trapped here she felt tears coming to her eyes her throat tightened how was the crystal supposed to trigger the secret passage miyuki asked still pondering the riddle ii dont know didnt you say something about the other mechanism being pressuresensitive miyukis words sank through karens hopelessness she remembered how the altar stone had moved back up into the ceiling after miyuki had jumped off it the mechanism must have been pressuresensitive responding to the change in weight karen stared down at the crystal it was heavy unusually so but if the secret door here was triggered by weight then why hadnt it triggered when shed first walked across it then it dawned on her get off get off she yelled at miyuki waving her away from the stone block and crystal we weigh too much what miyuki said but backed away karen moved beyond the edge of the block it must be balanced to the weight of the crystal no more no less both women stepped away karen stared hard at the crystal still nothing she felt a scream of frustration building in her chest what were they missing she turned in a slow circle the walls were blank and featureless no answeror was there she turned again no wall sconces no place to hook a torch darkness she mumbled the belly of a snake is hidden from the sun what turn off your flashlight why trust me karen thumbed off her penlight miyuki followed suit plunging them into perfect darkness now what are a sharp grinding interrupted miyuki rock on rock karen froze praying she was right in the hushed silence she reached out and fumbled for miyukis hand then a spear of sunlight appeared sprouting from the floor to strike the ceiling blinking against the glare karen dropped to her knees the stone block with the crystal was sinking into the floor karen crawled to the edge and peered into the deepening hole the shaft of sunlight came from a narrow crack in the left wall of the pit as she watched the block sank away and the crack grew wider opening a side tunnel light poured in karens vision blurred with tears of relief it was the way out below the stone block finally stopped its descent with a grating sound leaving the side passage wide open karen rolled to her side and waved for miyuki to go first lets get out of here it was only a drop of a couple meters grabbing her satchel the japanese professor smiling with relief clambered into the pit she landed and crouched down peering through the side tunnel its only a few feet i see the sun miyuki crawled into the passage giving karen room to come down karen did not pause she jumped into the pit the sunlight blinded her for a moment then she saw the blue sea beyond the short tunnel shining bright thank god she bent and entered the side passage twisting around she grabbed the crystal star she was not leaving behind her prize the star seemed much lighter now she was able to pick it up with one hand as she held it the stone block ground up behind her and miyuki closing off the doorway back to the inner chamber turning to the exit she shoved the artifact into her hip pocket free of her fingers it sank like a lead weight straining her pants seams damn this thing is heavy but as she moved beyond the tunnel and into the sunlight cold metal pressed against the back of her neck and she forgot about her burden dont move someone ordered in japanese she froze a second man jumped off the pyramid step behind her with relief she saw that he wore a police uniform with the chatan emblem on his sleeve it wasnt the looters she was ordered to face the stone palms on the rock to the side miyuki spoke rapidly to another officer he had her identification in his hand he finally nodded turned to the man holding karen and waved him off karen stepped away from the wall they got gabriels warning over the teletype about the looters and were just under way when they heard the explosion miyuki told her by the time they got here the looters had already taken off there was no sign of them so they staked out this second pyramid meaning to protect it and they found us crawling out and thought we were the looters miyuki nodded luckily gabriel had transmitted our names saying we were in danger miyuki put away her identification well have questions to answer but therell be no charges karen took a deep breath answers i have more questions than answers she pictured the looters tattoo a pale winding snake against his dark skin another serpent in the light of the day it seemed too much of a coincidence karen wandered to the corner of the pyramid so she could see the other dragon miyuki followed across the hundred meters the dragons summit was a cratered ruin smoke curled into the sky a manmade volcano why had their attackers done that it made no sense and where had they gone whats wrong miyuki asked were safe i dont know karen could not escape the feeling that the true danger was just beginning but lets go back to the university i think its time we tried to put a few pieces of this mystery together no argument from me they turned away from the smoking pyramid and crossed back to the officers the white and blue police motorboat waited in the water below its lights blinking karen sighed with shaky relief remind me i owe gabriel a great big hug and you owe me a new pair of ferragamos with a tired grin miyuki swiped her hair from her damp forehead after all this im holding you to your promise northwest of enewak atoll central pacific ensconced in the ships geology lab jack and the others sat staring at the frozen video image of the inscribed obelisk metallic symbols etched crudely into the crystals surface who could have done this he asked george took off his bifocals ive never seen anything like it but im going to get online and post some questions to various archaeology websites see if i get any bites he picked up a legal pad with a handwritten copy of the writing but it would help if we had more data the historian glanced meaningfully at jack charlie clicked off the monitor i agree with the professor we need more information jack found all eyes on him george spoke first youve got to go back down there ii havent made a decision on that yet he was in no hurry to return to the deepsea graveyard lisa added her support we should just take the money and run weve met our obligation to the navy were not required to haul pieces of the plane to the surfaceand i dont like what happened when jack was near that pillar george crinkled his brow what do you mean what happened lisa turned to jack allowing him to explain but he remained silent he felt foolish discussing his vague misgivings while down there the nautilus checked out fine lisa explained filling in for him instruments computers radios power supplyall get clean bills of health but during jacks communication blackout when he was near that pillar he reports sensing vibrations coming off it charlie offered a more plausible explanation if the subs batteries were malfunctioning the thrusters might have become misaligned tremoring the vessel he looked at jack or maybe you were picking up vibrations from the slight seismic readings they occurred the same time as the blackout jack embarrassed felt heat rising to his cheeks no it was not vibrations from the ship it felti dont know more electric then a short in a system somewhere charlie persisted lisa shook her head i found no evidence of any electrical problems george pocketed his paper so what are you saying by now jacks face was red he could not meet the others gazes it was the pillar i cant explain how i know this but it was the crystal was giving off some type ofi dont knowharmonics vibrations emanations george and charlie stared at jack he recognized the doubt in their eyes charlie spoke first if youre right its even more of a reason to go down and do a little private snooping george nodded and if theres more writing id like a complete copy a firm knock on the door saved jack from having to answer its robert the marine biologist called from beyond the door what is it jack asked relieved at turning aside more questions from the others word has come over from the gibraltar they have news about the crash jack unlocked the door he hoped some concrete answer had been discovered something that would dismiss the need to go back down robert stood outside he waved them all out theyre faxing over a copy of the cockpit voice recorder then lets go jack said the marine biologist excited continued his explanation whatever they found it has everyone in a buzz i saw the admirals face when he was informed over a scrambled line he did not look happy he insisted that a full copy of the cockpits final conversation be faxed over to him jack hurried climbing the stairs to the main deck then up the steps to the pilothouse as he opened the door he found houstons two personal aides inside in uniform armed standing stiffly they were twin bulldogs old navy nearby the fathoms accountant leaned on the pilot seat wheres the admiral jack asked kendall mcmillan pointed toward the closed door to the radio and satellite system hes in there he told us to wait for him jack frowned at the closed door this was his ship he did not like someone closing him out of his own ships heart even an admiral he moved to the door but the two burly aides blocked him hands on holstered pistols before any confrontation could flare the door swung open the first one out was jacks dog elvis padded from the radio room tail sweeping back and forth the admiral followed him jack opened his mouth about to scold the old man but when he saw the pallor to mark houstons face he remained silent deep wrinkles etched the admirals forehead what is it jack asked houston glanced around the entire ships crew was now crammed into the small pilothouse is there a place to get a drink around here jack waved the others away and turned to his old friend follow me i have a bottle of twentyyearold scotch in my stateroom just what the doctor ordered the admiral smiled but it came out sickly jack led the way down to the main deck and to his stateroom he held the door open for the old man once both were inside houston nodded back at the door lock it jack did as ordered he pointed toward a pair of leather chairs in front of his shelves of nautical memorabilia houston crossed to the shelves touching an ancient sextant is this the one i gave you after i was accepted to the shuttle mission yep huston turned and sank into one of the chairs with a long sigh for the first time jack saw the mans age he looked sunken defeated the admiral pointed back at the sextant so you havent completely tossed away your past jack moved to a cabinet and pulled out a bottle of scotch and two glasses not the important things houston nodded he was silent for several moments jack have you made a decision yet on helping us retrieve sections of air force one jack sighed he poured a couple fingers worth of his private stash into each glass he knew houston liked his scotch neat no sirwere still doing some diagnostics on the sub hmm the admiral mumbled accepting the glass he sipped thoughtfully clearly thinking something through finally he settled the glass on a teak captains table reaching inside his flight jacket he pulled out a folded sheaf maybe this will help you decide he held out the papers jack gripped the proffered sheets but the admiral did not release them this is confidential information but if youre going to help us you should be kept informed houston let go of the report jack moved to his chair this is from the cockpit voice recorder yes the last minutes between the cockpit crew jack sat down and slowly unfolded the papers as much as he didnt want to be drawn further into this operation his curiosity couldnt be ignored he read the report boeing b designation vc a time captain honolulu this is victor charlie alpha can you update our weather were hitting some heavy pockets out here first officer why arent they answering captain honolulu this is victor charlie alpha please answer were having trouble with our radar and compasses can youhang on loud rumble and rattle navigator what the hell was that captain another pocket try climbing higher first officer climbing to thirtyfive thousand navigator im still getting conflicting readings here from the ins units the omega the radar the celestial sextantits making no sense im going on dead reckoning captain everyone keep your heads in the game here first officer shes heavy sir not able to climb captain what navigator this doesnt make sense im picking up land ahead captain must be wake island ill try to pick up something local on the radio pause wake island this is victor charlie alpha we need assistance silence for thirty seconds navigator its too big sir this cant be right im going to check the manual sextant first officer what are those lights captain just glare off the windshield keep climbing navigator where the hell are we deep rumble navigator what is that what is that first officer losing altitude controls arent responding captain my god navigator were over land first officer i cant see the light screech of metal rush of wind first officer engine number one is on fire captain shut it down now first officer yes sir navigator what the hell is going on captain honolulu this is victor first officer something ahead of us something ahead of us navigator im not reading anything nothing on radarnothing on anything captain honolulu this is victor charlie alpha mayday mayday first officer the sky the sky is opening up roaring noise then silence end of cockpit voice recording time jack lowered the sheets my god what happened up there houston shifted in his seat and reached for the fax sheets a chopper is on its way to collect me i want to listen to the recording myself but as to the true answer theres only one way to find out the answer lies down below jack reached a trembling hand to his glass of scotch he swallowed its contents in one gulp the expensive liquor burned all the way to his belly jack jack filled his glass one more time he leaned back into his seat sipping more gently at the smooth scotch appreciating it this time he met the admirals gaze ill go he said simply houston nodded and raised his scotch jack reached over and tapped his old friends glass with his own to absent friends jack said pieces of the puzzle july pm ryukyu university okinawa prefecture japan karen hurried across the staff parking lot late for her lunch meeting with miyuki her friends office and lab were on the fourth floor of the old yagasaki building once a government office complex ryukyu university had originally been founded by the united states civil administration in built upon the site of the ancient castle of shuri but in the japanese took over the administration since then the university had spread from its original site into the surrounding countryside and local buildings dashing up the steps and through the double doors karen crossed to the stationed guard and flashed her identification card he nodded from behind his desk and waved her past checking her name off his list the president of ryukyu university was taking no chances although the island of okinawa was climbing out of the devastation looting remained sporadic the added security measures were the universitys attempt to protect its assets karen strode to the stairwell passing a bank of elevators cordoned off with yellow tape declaring them out of service she imagined the companies that produced those rolls of ribbon were making a fortune the same yellow tape was strewn like party streamers throughout the island checking her watch she picked up her pace on the stairs since returning from their harrowing journey to the ruins of chatan this was the first chance the two women had to consult one another miyuki had called this morning and urged karen to join her at her lab she had news about the crystal star but would say no more over the phone karen wondered what her friend had learned over the past three days karen had been doing her own research investigating the cryptic language trying to trace its origin but progress had been slow the island was continually plagued by power failures that interfered with communication for a while shed been sure the glyphs were similar to a script found in the indus valley ruins of pakistan but on closer inspection she realized the similarity was only superficial this line of study however was not a total waste it did send her down another path to another similar language one even more exciting still she needed further study before she was willing to voice her theory aloud at the top of the stairs karen found miyuki waiting dressed in her usual crisp lab coat the guard buzzed me that you were on the way up her friend said cmon as they walked karen asked what have you found miyuki shook her head you have to see this for yourself she led the way down the hall past other teachers offices what about the hieroglyphics karen hesitated i may have a lead miyuki glanced at her with surprise really ive been having gabriel try to decode it but hes had little success he can do that decipher it one of his base algorithms is a decoding program ciphering is a useful model for building an artificial intelligence construct and if you correlate karen held up a hand surrendering okay i believe you has gabriel learned anything only one thingits part of the reason i called you but hed have more success with additional examples of the language more data from which to correlate crosscheck and build a language base karen bit her lip then confessed her own secret i may be able to supply that miyuki looked over again frowning how i wanted to confirm my idea before bringing it up but the library was of no use and i keep getting booted off the internet by these hourly brownouts i couldnt get an outside line all day yesterday what were you looking for examples of a written language found on the island of rapa nui rapa nui isnt that easter island the place with the big stone heads exactly but that islands on the other side of the pacific karen nodded thats why i need further information its not my area of expertise ive been concentrating my studies on polynesia and micronesia the pair reached miyukis laboratories miyuki unlocked the door with a key card and held it open for karen they entered a tiny anteroom starched white clean suits hung on the wall beyond the glass doors ahead was miyukis lab all stainless steel and linoleum under the fluorescent bulbs every surface gleamed dustfree and spotless karen took off her sweater and slipped out of her reebok sneakers she took a clean cloth suit from a peg it was stiff after being freshly drycleaned and pressed she wriggled into the white onepiece jumpsuit then sat down on a tiny bench to slip on paper booties miyuki did the same she insisted that her lab maintain a sterile environment she wanted no contaminants interfering with the large banks of computers lining the center of the room the birthplace of gabriel whats this connection to rapa nui karen fixed her short blond hair under a disposable paper bonnet back in a french missionary reported the discovery of hundreds of wooden tablets staffs even skulls carved with an unknown hieroglyphic script the natives called this language rongorongo but they couldnt read the script some claimed the language came from the time before the natives arrived on the island in ad unfortunately most of the artifacts were destroyed before they could be recovered only about twentyfive examples of the writing exist today in museums and universities and you think this language is the same one we discovered i cant be sure rongorongo is the only known indigenous written language among all the peoples of oceania but its origin remains a mystery and the text unreadable many epigraphers and cryptologists have attempted to decipher the language but all of them have failed karen could not keep the excitement from her voice if weve discovered a new vein of this language for the first time in centuries we might have a chance not only to unlock the mysteries of rongorongo but also to discover the lost history of polynesia miyuki stood so whats the next step i need to get online and hunt down the other examples of the language confirm my hypothesis miyuki began to catch karens excitement and if youre right we can add these other examples to gabriels database with more information he might be able to decipher it if so it would be the archaeological discovery of the century then lets get to work gabriel can get you a line to the outside by hooking into the us militarys phone lines theyre the most stable miyuki crossed to the glass door to her lab he can do that miyuki nodded of course who do you think is the main backer for my research the us military is very intrigued by artificial intelligence and its practical application i have a level clearance using her key card again she unlocked the inner door there was a whoosh as the door seal broke the next room was under a slight positive pressure extra insurance against contaminants entering the lab karen followed her into the clean room you go through a lot of trouble to avoid a bit of dusting she mumbled with a smirk miyuki ignored her and crossed to a halfarc bank of computer monitors two wheeled chairs rested nearby miyuki took a seat and waved karen to the other let me show you what gabriel has been able to decode so far she began tapping a keyboard while speaking aloud gabriel could you please bring up the images of the hieroglyphs certainly professor nakano and good morning karen grace the artificial voice came from stereo speakers behind the two women good morning gabriel karen answered still feeling awkward she glanced over her shoulder at the speakers it was as if someone stood behind her ththank you for your help it has been a pleasure dr grace you have presented an intriguing conundrum across the long curved bank of monitors the glyphs of the unknown language ran along the multiple screens in a continuous line birds fishes human shapes geometric figures and strange squiggles what has he learned karen asked he was able to decipher a small section at the beginning youre kidding karen sat up straighter the line of script ran across the screen until a section appeared highlighted in red then the scrolling images stopped centering on the highlighted section it contained six symbols gabriel believes its a lunar calendar designation a date so to speak hmmthose central symbols do look like the sickle shapes of a waning or waxing moon karen shifted back but if it is a date what does it mean the date when the inscription was written or some historical notation id guess the latter miyuki said some ancient historical event being described why do you think that miyuki remained silent karen glanced at her friend what miyuki sighed gabriel came to his calendar conclusion by crossreferencing with the starscape etched on the ceiling of the inner chamber karen recalled the quartz star map on the rooms domed ceiling so he compared the chambers starscape with an astronomical program then tied it to the lunar calendar miyuki looked at karen hes calculated the rough date noted in the inscription amazingwhen whats the date gabriel the program answered the icons denote the fourth month of a lunar year karen noted the four moon sickles early spring correctand from the relative position of the depicted constellations i can extrapolate the approximate year within a statistical error of fifty years miyuki elaborated of course i could not be more precise thats close enough karens mind spun if gabriels calculations were correct this might be a clue to when the ancient ruins had been constructed what year how long ago according to the astronomical map twelve thousand years ago northwest of enewak atoll central pacific aboard the nautilus submersible jack drifted over the debris field from his position several yards away he watched the tail fin of the boeing rise from the silt drawn up by two fourinchthick steel cables disturbed clouds of silt wafted up as the fin was pulled like a bad tooth from where it was embedded six hundred meters overhead the motorized winch aboard the uss gibraltar hauled on the cables slowly but efficiently drawing its catch to the surface going for the next fish jack called into his throat microphone he worked the foot pedals and swung his sub around he checked the nautiluss clock he had been working for almost three hours targeting the specific pieces of the plane the ntsb had picked out from the video feed of his first dive by now the salvage of air force one was becoming almost routine over the past three days they had hauled up almost forty sections of the plane the recovered wreckage was now spread and numbered in the lower hangar deck of the uss gibraltar like a macabre jigsaw puzzle though the recovery of the plane was well under way so far only four bodies had been recovered two floaters discovered in the tricky currents identified as two men from the press pool and the pilot and copilot found strapped to their seats jack drove away that memory the planes crumpled nose cone had been one of the first pieces to be hauled to the surface he had diverted his eyes from the shattered window as he attached the cables but had caught a brief look the pressures at this depth had crushed their bodies to a pulp they looked like fleshcolored clay molded into a vague approximation of the human form the only way to identify them were by their uniforms and their seats in the cockpit since then as jack sifted through the wreckage he had held his breath fearing what else he might chance upon but no other bodies were found the impact and currents had thoroughly scattered the planes human cargo were ready with the second winch the ntsb radioman announced aye ready on the second winch going for the next target jack swung the sub around and edged to the opposite side of the debris field ahead another cable appeared seeming to hang on its own its end disappearing into the gloom above it connected to a second surface winch aboard the gibraltar jack dove the nautilus down to the electromagnet hook attached to its end working the subs external manipulator arms he grabbed the hook and dragged it to one of the planes engine sections then he lowered the cables end and placed it against the metal nacelle okay he called up energize on his signal he watched the cables electromagnetic terminal flip and attach to the engines side fish is hooked haul away jack backed his sub with a whine of thrusters he watched the slack in the cable tighten then the engine cowling slid from the silt jack swung around the graveyard was now almost half cleared only smaller pieces and sections of fuselage and wing remained under his sub he passed over a large chunk of landing gear its tires collapsed under the pressure another day or two and nothing would be down here as he spun the sub in a slow circle he noted movement off to his left a school of hatchet fish flashed past the bubble of his submersible he had been noting more and more denizens of the deep attracted to the light and noise of the salvage operation long pinkish eels scuttling crabs and one sixfootlong dogfish off to the left he watched a vampire squid shoot out of a crumpled nest of debris and snatch a passing hatchet fish in a flick of tentacles it vanished away these were his only companions swiveling his subs twin lamps jack observed the tall flattopped seamounts towering just at the edge of his lights reach giants looming over the wreckage closer a forest of twisted lava pillars enclosed the space from his subs hydrophones the subsonic whistles and highpitched clicks of the living sea called to him a lonely sound as he waited a twinge of isolation struck him down at these sunless depths it was as if he had traveled to another world sighing jack swung back around he had a duty to perform and could not be distracted with stray thoughts in another twenty minutes the pair of winch cables would drape back down once again awaiting his help to snatch more wreckage until then he turned his attention back to his own investigation he edged his sub toward the center of the debris field out of the silty gloom the crystal pillar appeared glowing with the warmth of his reflected xenon lamps the clear crystal shone with veins of azure and rose hues over the past days he had recorded the spire from every possible angle again saving it all to a secret dvd disk for review by his team by now george had compiled a complete copy of the strange etchings on the crystalline surface jack brought his sub near the pillar since the first exploratory dive he had experienced no further radio interference or difficulties with his sub the strange emanations had never returned jack was almost ready to admit that the odd sensation may have been due to something mundane like a glitch in the nautiluss systems hovering before the pillar he reached out with his manipulator arm charlie had been hammering at him to try and clip a sample of the crystal jack reached with his titanium pincer and touched the pillar from his hydrophones he heard a slight tinkle as metal struck crystal as the sound struck his ear jack felt every hair stand on end as if his body had become a living tuning fork his skin tingled his sight wavered and the world began to spin he felt as if he were going to pass out he suddenly could not tell which way was up it was as if he were weightless in space again his ears rang and distantly he heard voices calling to him as if down a long tunnel garbled in some strange language gasping he slammed his foot hard on the right pedal driving his submersible away from the crystal as he broke contact jack snapped back into his own seat back into his own body the tingling sensation vanished hear me jack lisa yelled in his ear answer me jack touched his throat mike needing some physical contact with the world above im here lisa what are you doing whwhat do you mean youve been offline for forty minutes the navy was about to launch one of their rov robots to search for you jack drifted away from the pillars he widened the focus of his lights and saw the salvage cables hanging ahead how had the navy hauled up the two plane sections so fast he glanced at his clock only two minutes had passed since hed hooked the tail fin and engine section to the cables how was that possible frowning jack remembered the glitch lisa had noted after his first dive lisa what time do you have topside threefourteen jack stared at the subs computer screen the digital clock was thirtyeight minutes slow jack iim fine just another communication glitch he glided toward the cables had he blacked out lisas voice came back tentative full of suspicion are you sure yes lisa nothing to worry about im going for the next pieces i dont like this you should head up now i can handle it ive got green lights across the board how are you reading now lisas voice returned reluctantly receiving you fine now a new voice interrupted it was admiral houston your doctor is correct mr kirkland you had everyone in a panic topside its just a glitch sir i dont care this mission is over for today jacks grip grew hard on his controls he glanced back at the crystal spire his initial panic at the strange event had burned down to a deepseated anger he was determined to find out what had happened at least let me hook up these last cables theyre already down here along pause okay mr kirkland but be careful jack nodded though no one could see him aye sir he swept his submersible up to the first cable and checked the computer screen for his next two targets a cracked section of fuselage and a chunk of landing gear grabbing the cables end he dragged it over to the curved section of fuselage wall he noted a portion of the planes lavatory was still attached to the inside surface working rapidly he attached the magnetic hook and called topside ready on cable one the technician acknowledged hauling away jack swung toward the second winch line as he turned the radio buzzed in his ear it was robert on the deep fathom jack was surprised to hear from the marine biologist jack ive got movement down there what do you mean something large just cleared the trough between two seamounts northwest of your position and is coming your way jack frowned for something to show up on sonar at this depth it must be huge how big sixty feet jesuswhat is it a submarine no i dont think so its outline is too fluctuant its movement too sinuous not artificial so in other words a sea monster jack remembered the serpent that had startled him in the hold of the kochi maru is it another orefish no too thick great he mumbled how far off now a quarter klick but its picking up speed damn its fast it must be attracted to your lights can i outrun it no not without a larger head start any suggestions play dead say again settle to the seabed turn off lights and motors abysmal sea life is attracted to sound light even bioelectric signatures turn everything off and you should be blind to whatever is coming jack was not comfortable with this choice as a former seal he was trained for action for a more proactive means of defense but without an assault rifle and grenade launcher he would have to listen to the expert here jack settled the nautiluss skids to the silty seabed after a short pause he flicked off the battery switch the xenon lamps winked off the constant whine of the thrusters went silent darkness swamped over the tiny sub even the internal lights dimmed and died his own breathing seemed so loud in the tiny space his eyes strained for something to see distantly he thought he could pick up flickers of winking lights was it just his eyes playing tricks bioluminescence ghost lights robert whispered in his ear dont communicate it might be able to focus on you well try pinging from above to scare it off where quiet its just clearing the last ridgeline its huge here it comes jack held his breath afraid even that would be heard he craned his neck searching the darkness around him his eyelids were stretched wide hes circling the area damn what is it jack felt a trickle of sweat roll off his nose the subs cabin had grown humid without the carbon dioxide scrubbers working he knew he had maybe thirty minutes of air before it became stale he could not play possum forever suddenly he sensed something large move over him he saw nothing but something primal in his brain set off alarms jacks heart hammered fresh sweat broke out on his forehead and he fought to see anything around him what was out there hes on top of you robert whispered the sub shoved a few inches across the silt but jack knew nothing had touched the tiny craft the dragging movement was from the wake of something large sweeping past close the dead sub buffeted by its passage the nautilus rolled onto one skid twisting around slightly caught in the wash of another wake jack froze lifting both palms to brace against the acrylic dome how big was this thing the sub spun for two heartbeats more then crashed again to the seabed with a screech of metal on metal the left skid landing on a chunk of wreckage the sub now rested at a tilt teetering slightly on the uneven perch its sticking near you jack our sonar pinging is not scaring it off jack saw nothing beyond his own nose but sensed something circling out there stalking him he breathed silently through clenched teeth then he felt the sub move tip forward he heard something rasp across the acrylic dome wet leather drawn over glass the sub fell onto its side and jack sprawled hanging in his straps before he could shift into a better position something struck the sub hard this time jack was jarred into the seat harness choked by the straps the sub flipped and ground across the seabed he heard something tear free from the framework luckily the sub settled back upright on its skids jack straightened the damn thing out there was playing with him like a cat toying with a mouse he grabbed his controls before he was torn apart by whatever was out there he meant to fight with his thumb he flicked on the power spears of light lanced out the darkness was driven backward closer the whine of the batterypowered thrusters filled the space jack what are you doing where is it its right next to you he sensed the movement before seeing it he twisted to his left a huge black eye the size of a garbage can lid opened in a wall of flesh jack bit back a gasp the eye blinked against the glare of the subs lights the monster was lying beside the tiny sub dwarfing it jack caught more movement he craned his neck farther behind the subs stern a tangle of tentacles rose twisting and churning as the behemoth awoke from its initial shock at its preys brilliant display jack remembered the vampire squid snatching a hatchet fish and now sympathized with the tiny fish slamming both pedals he shot his sub forward and away dont run robert yelled in his ear whos running jack hissed tightly he spun the sub around nose pointed at the gigantic beast grabbing the manipulator controls he raised the subs titanium arms and flexed the pincers they could crush stone the creature rolled tentacles scrabbling and twisting around toward jack what is it video feed is fuzzy but i think its an architeuthis robert said a giant squid of the cephalopod family only a few have ever been found and those were dead dragged up in the nets of deep trawlers nothing this big has ever been seen the beast shied slightly from the direct lances of the subs xenon lamps one tentacle thick as a sewer pipe came probing low along the seabed jack backed away all thrusters on full but he wasnt fast enough the snaking limb shot toward him slapping a wide blow the sub bounced its nose driven up jacks forehead struck the acrylic dome with stars dancing across his vision he fought the control pedals but found the submersible unresponsive at first he feared he was out of power then he noticed a plattersized sucker clamped onto the acrylic dome he was caught trapped in its grip the tentacle wound around the sub drawing him toward the mass of the beast the seals around him groaned with the strain ahead the creature was fully revealed in his lights eight muscular arms and two longer tentacles coiled out from its pale body its skin was almost translucent its flattened head flanked by lateral fins its two longer tentacles probed the sub dragging toothed suckers across its titanium frame the vessel suddenly jolted his lights swung jack spotted the beaked mouth of the monster opening and closing only a yard away through the hydrophones he could hear the grind of its maw swearing under his breath jack shifted the manipulator arms he maneuvered the pincers and snatched at the nearest tentacle the titanium grips tore into the leathery tissue black blood bloomed out before jack could savor his attack the nautilus was flung away tumbling end over end he released the manipulator controls and braced himself tried to slow his tumble with his thrusters foot pedals but it was no use the nautilus struck the seabed gouging a trough in the silt jacks shoulder bore the brunt of the impact the sub lay on its side jack turn off your lights playing dead didnt work before he answered and pushed up on one arm he searched for the giant squid but a cloud of silt enclosed the vehicle listen to me were going to try and draw the creature away how jack shifted as the silt settled around him his lights began to pierce through the cloud it was not an encouraging sight a mass of tentacles twisted toward him rather than intimidating the beast his attack had only succeeded in angering it jack toggled down his power but didnt shut it off the subs lamps dimmed he refused to go totally dead he did not want to be blind down here again whats your plan ive just ordered the navy to activate the second cables electromagnet robert said the strong electric field might attract the beast awaybut only if you disappear jack bit his lip he lowered his power further flipping off the thrusters the light was now just a weak glow he could barely see the roiling mass of tentacles through the silt the beast continued to crawl slowly toward him okay try it jack ordered we already have we turned it on a minute ago is the architeuthis taking our bait the squid continued to roll toward him no he said with disgust it wasnt working he would have to fight try to chase it off jack reached to power up again then a thought occurred to him he remembered roberts initial warningdont run robert try moving the cable drag it along like a fishing line what ohi get it hang on jack turned off all systems except the subs lamps he searched for the cable but the light was too weak to reach that far cmon robertcmon the squid edged nearer a wall of pale tissue tentacles and dinnerplatesized suckers he watched one of its huge eyes roll in his direction suspicion shone forth he prayed the beast remained wary long enough for roberts ruse to play out where are you robert he mumbled a tentacle lashed out toward the halfburied sub jack reached for his manipulator controls his thumb shifted to the battery toggle then off to the left a new light suddenly bloomed in the inky gloom its brilliance sharp both jack and the squid froze slowly the beasts huge eye rolled its attention toward the new source of light jack looked over too across the seabed a spike of pure brilliance thrust up it was the crystal spire aglow with an inner fire in the gleam jack spotted the winch cable drifting only a few feet from the spire its electromagnet swinging even closer jack stared slackjawed what the hell under the sub the seabed began to tremble at first mildly then more vigorously bits of smaller wreckage began to dance atop the tremoring floor great jack thought first a sea monster now this he held on tight the vibration traveled up his bones to his teeth across the debris field the cable drifted away from the spike as it moved farther the brilliance of the crystal faded and the trembling died away as the light dimmed jack watched the electromagnetic lure float beyond his sight disappearing into the dark water he stared at his adversary the giant squid remained near the sub a hulk of tentacles it seemed to hesitate clearly spooked by the tremors and strangeness then slowly it crawled after the disappearing lure away from the nautilus its working robert hailed from topside jack remained silent afraid of distracting the great beast he watched the squid stalk its new prey soon the monster drifted beyond the reach of the subs dimmed lamps he dared not turn them brighter having to remain satisfied with updates from robert were drawing the cable both up and away its still following jack allowed himself a long low sigh its far enough away maybe youd better get the hell out of there jack did not have to be told twice he powered up the sub dumped his ballast and engaged the thrusters silt coughed up around him as the nautilus pulled from the seabed the tiny sub rose rapidly roberts voice returned damn what we lost it panic clutched jacks throat what do you mean dont worry its not heading your way roberts voice was distinctly disappointed it gave up on us and dove back into the deeper troughs its gone back home damn i wouldve loved to see it up close trust methe experience is not as fun as it looked on video uhoh yeah sorry jack coming up be topside in fifteen well be waiting for you jack leaned back into his seat he wiped his face with a hand towel though the terror was still fresh he grinned he had survived still a nagging kernel of concern marred his perfect relief he pictured the brilliant glow as the cable passed near the crystal spire he remembered his own experience with the pillar the odd sensations the lost time it seemed there were more mysteries down here than just the crash of air force one ryukyu university okinawa prefecture japan twelve thousand years thats impossible karen exclaimed miyuki pushed away from the bank of monitors it might be a mistake the database of this new language is limited right now if gabriel had more informationmore examples karen nodded it has to be a miscalculation there is no way the date could be denoting a real incident twelve millennia in the past unless the event were some fablesome creation myth being recounted still how would these people know how to map a snapshot of the night sky from twelve thousand years ago gabriel says the position of the constellations and stars is precise to a tenth of a millimeter its not impossible karen argued the mayans of south america had astronomical calendars of such precision that they rival our abilities today but to extrapolate that far back if the mayans could do it why not these folks in fact the builders might even be some lost tribe of the maya who knows youre right miyuki said shaking her head and standing up who knows there are too many variables thats why i didnt bring it to your attention when gabriel first told me of his discovery two days ago karen frowned you knew this two days ago miyuki shrugged i didnt think it was that important i was just testing gabriels decoding ability since you were studying the language i figured wed discuss it later then if it wasnt this bombshell why did you call me over today miyuki sighed the crystal star didnt you listen when i phoned karen stood remembering miyukis urgent call she had indeed mentioned something about the crystal star what have you learned did you find someone in the geology department to help you check it out no most of the geologists are still out in the field researching the quakes and studying their effects such a catastrophe is a boon to those in their field they wont be back until the university reopens then what did you learn i thought to do a bit of basic checking on my own i was curious about its abnormally dense mass miyuki led the way across the lab i borrowed an electronic scale and tools i figured id do some simple measurements nothing complicated calculate its mass densitythat sort of thing and i kept failing miyuki crossed to a workstation neatly arranged with graph paper metal rulers calipers compasses and a squat stainless steel box karen scrunched up her nose you kept failing miyuki picked up a few leaves of graph paper neatly drawn on them were precise depictions of the fivepointed star from multiple views each had tiny metric measurements denoted it was clearly the work of many hours i calculated its volume both by geometry and water displacement i wanted to be exact i found it to occupy precisely cubic centimeters what about its weight miyuki adjusted her bonnet thats the strange part she waved at the graph papers and tools i thought these calculations were going to be the hard part i figured that all id have to do afterward was weigh the artifact then divide the weight by the calculated volume to get the density simple karen nodded so how much did it weigh that would depend miyuki crossed to the steel box i borrowed this electronic scale from the geology department its able to weigh an object down to a fraction of a milligram and watch miyuki switched on the power switch i left the crystal star in the sample chamber karen watched the red digital numbers climb higher and higher settling at last on one number karen stared in disbelief kilos amazing thats over thirty pounds i cant believe it the star is that heavy miyuki turned to karen sometimes what do you mean miyuki opened the door to the electronic scale karen bent closer inside the sample chamber the crystal star shone brightly fracturing the rooms light into brilliant shards karen was once again stunned by its beauty she turned to miyuki i dont understand what miyuki pointed to the red analog numbers of the electronic scale the number had changed it was smaller kilos karen straightened frowning is there a problem with the scale i thought the same thing miyuki picked up the flashlight from the table watch she flipped on the flashlight and pointed its narrow beam at the crystal the star shone more brilliantly karen had to squint against its glare but her gaze did not remain long on the crystal artifact she stared at the digital reading it was smaller again kilos how miyuki shadowed the flashlights beam with her palm and the number climbed higher now you know why i had trouble with my calculations the weight keeps changing the stronger the light the less it weighs thats impossible theres no crystal on this planet that acts this way miyuki shrugged why do you think i called you thunder july am uss gibraltar northwest of enewak atoll central pacific david spangler crossed the rolling flight deck of the gibraltar a southern storm had whipped up overnight pelting the vessel with rain and gale force winds this morning the worst of the storm had blown itself out but the sky remained stacked with dark clouds drizzle swept across the deck in wicked spats safety nets that fringed the ship snapped and flapped in the gusts david hunched against the cold and headed toward the ramp tunnel that led down to the hangar deck below striding briskly he approached the two men sheltered just inside the tunnels entrance two guards they were his men members of his sevenman assault team like him they wore gray uniforms black boots black belts even their blond crew cuts matched his david had handpicked his team five years ago he nodded as he approached they snapped to attention no salutes though their uniforms were free of any rank or designation the entire ntsb team knew davids men a personal letter from cia director ruzickov had made it clear to the investigators and the ships command staff that spanglers team was in charge of security for the wreckage until the ship left international waters wheres weintraub he asked his secondincommand lieutenant ken rolfe at the electronics station working on the flight data recorder any news theyre still having no luck sir its tits up david allowed himself a grim smile edwin weintraub was the lead investigator for the ntsb and a prime thorn in his side the man was thorough keeneyed and sharpwitted david knew that his presence wouldnt make subterfuge any easier any suspicion he said in a lower voice stepping closer no sir david nodded satisfied gregor handel omega teams electronics expert had done his job well as head of security david had no trouble granting his man access to the recorder out of sight of anyone in the ntsb handel had promised he could sabotage the recorder without any telltale sign of tampering so far the lieutenant had proven as good as his word after the revelation on the cockpit voice recording david had not wanted the information on the flights data box to pinpoint a simple malfunction of one of air force ones primary systems it would be hard to blame the chinese for an ordinary mechanical glitch so he had ordered the second black box damaged do you know why weintraub called me this morning david asked no sir only that something stirred up the hornets nest in there an hour ago an hour ago david clenched his teeth if something new had been discovered the standing orders were for him to be informed immediately he stormed past his men since the first day weintraub had been testing the line between his team and davids it looked like a lesson might be necessary david walked down the long tunnel leading into the massive hangar bay below the flight deck his footsteps echoed on the nonskid surface the hangar space ahead was a cavernous chamber two decks high and stretching almost a third of the ships length before sailing here half of the air wing normally stowed in the hangar had been sent to guam leaving space for the recovered wreckage as david left the tunnel he stood and surveyed the wide expanse the chamber reeked of seawater and oil across the wide floor pieces and sections of the plane were laid out in distinct quadrants each area was overseen by its own field expert overhead in the rafters small offices had been taken over by his men acting as additional lookouts to spy upon the jets remains and the personnel below pausing david observed a large section of a cracked engine nacelle being hauled up another ramp from the lower well deck satisfied that all was in order he continued through the cavernous hangar a large circus could have performed in here and considering the scores of investigators scurrying around the pieces of wreckage it might as well be a circus clowns all of them david thought he jumped aside as an electric forklift swung a chunk of twisted wing past him almost taking his head off over the past three days the team of investigators had been shifting sections around twentyfour hours a day as if working a gigantic jigsaw puzzle once the forklift had safely passed david proceeded deeper into the ntsb base of operations larger pieces of wreckage towered to either side the smashed nose of the plane the tail fin chunks of fuselage steelribbed gravestones to the crew and passengers david spotted the electronics lab a section of the deck cordoned off by banks of computers twisted power cables and worktables covered with circuit boards and whorls of wiring from air force one as he approached he spotted the red and orange box of the flights data recorder it had been splayed open and its guts torn down little colored flags peppered its contents however none of the four investigators were giving the box a second look instead the three men stood around their portly leader ed weintraub who was seated at a computer and tapping furiously david stepped over whats going on weintraub waved a hand behind him i think ive figured out how the recorders data became corrupted davids heart jumped he glanced at the open box had gregors tampering been discovered what do you mean weintraub heaved himself to his feet come ill show you he tugged up his pants and absentmindedly tucked in his shirt david could not hide his disgust the mans skin was oily his black hair sticking out in odd directions his thick glasses making his eyes swim david couldnt imagine a more distasteful bearing weintraub was every repugnant image brought to mind by the expression slimy civilian the investigator led the way from the electronic station weve come upon an intriguing finding something that might explain the recorders damage he crossed over to a quadrant where sections of the fuselage lay the pieces were laid out in rough approximation of the actual plane david followed you still havent explained what youre talking about and i dont appreciate being the last to know i informed you weintraub looked at david and interrupted i report when i have something to report mr spangler i needed to rule out a more plausible explanation first explanation for what for this weintraub crossed to the fuselage and slapped a wrench against the surface he removed his hand but the tool remained in place hanging there davids eyes grew wide weintraub tapped the planes side its magnetized he waved a short arm to indicate the entire warehouse space all of it every bit of metal shows a magnetic signature to some degree or other it might be the reason for the data recorders corruption strong magnetic exposure could the effect be due to the electromagnet used to haul the pieces topside kirkland swore it wouldnt damage anything davids voice caught on jack kirklands name during the past three days both men had kept their distance in the evenings postdive debriefing david made sure he and jack were at opposite ends of the room no mr kirkland was quite correct the electromagnet did not cause this as a matter of fact i cant explain it what about some weapon david entertained the thought that maybe the chinese were actually to blame too soon to say but i doubt it id imagine the effect is due to something after the crash ive measured the lines of polarity on adjacent sections that were fractured apart they dont line up when i reassemble the pieces what are you saying weintraub sighed clearly exasperated davids hand twitched into a fist he had to forcibly restrain himself from smashing the condescending expression from the investigators face it means commander spangler that the magnetization of the airplanes parts occurred after it had broken apart i doubt it played a role in the crash but it must have interfered with the flight data recorder he pushed his glasses up again what i dont understand is why the cockpit voice recorder was unaffected if the flight data recorder was corrupted the other should have been damaged too david directed the conversation away from this query he frowned at the wrench if the magnetization occurred after the crash why are you investigating it at all our shared orders are to bring a speedy conclusion to this investigation to bring answers to washington to the world i know my duty commander spangler as i said before my initial findings are conjecture i cannot rule out the possibility that some em pulse or some other external force brought down air force one until i examine this phenomenon in detail weintraub removed a smudged handkerchief from a breast pocket besides ive seen the reports on cnn it seems washington has its own ideas rumblings about an attack or sabotage by the chinese david feigned disinterest he knew nicolas ruzickov had been using any and all bits of information to seed suspicion on the chinese already in the united states public sentiment was riddled with fingerpointing the rattling of swords would not be far behind david cleared his throat i dont care what the news media is reporting all that matters is the ultimate truth weintraub wiped his nose his eyes narrowed as he stared at david is that so were you ever able to find out who leaked the voice recorders transcript it seemed many of these socalled news reports are using the transcript as fodder to support claims of an attack upon air force one david felt his cheeks growing hotter but his voice hardened i dont give a shit about rumors or gossip our duty is to get the truth back to dc what the politicians do with it is their business weintraub pocketed his handkerchief and plucked the wrench from the wreckage then youll have no objections if i investigate this odd phenomenon he slapped the tool on his palm to discern the truth do your job and ill do mine weintraub eyed him silently for a breath then turned away then id best get back to work david watched the investigator leave then turned back to the large chunk of wreckage he placed his hand on its smooth surface for a moment he wondered what really had happened to the great aircraft with a shake he dismissed this line of inquiry it didnt matter what mattered was how the facts were spun by washington truth was of no importance turning away he left his concern behind he had been trained well in the old school obey never question he crossed back through the hangar and up the ramp outside the winds were kicking up rain pelted the flight deck sounding like weapons fire david nodded to his men and hurried across to the ships superstructure he knew he had better let ruzickov know of this new finding passing through the hatch he shivered against the cold and pulled the door closed behind him once out of the wind he shook the rain from his clothes and straightened to find a large form approaching commander spangler admiral houston said in greeting stopping before him dressed in a nylon flight jacket mark houston filled the passage david found himself rankling at the mans air of superiority aye sir have you heard the newest houston asked the magnetization of the airplanes parts davids thin lips sharpened to a frown had everyone been informed before him he forced down his anger ive heard sir he said stiffly i went to check it myself has edwin been able to formulate any explanation no sir hes still investigating it houston nodded hes anxious for more parts but another storm is blowing our way no diving today it looks like jack and his crew will get the day off davids eyes narrowed sir speaking of kirkland theres something i wanted to bring to your attention yes the navys submersible and divers from the deep submergence unit are due to arrive tomorrow with our own men here i see no need to keep kirkland a freelancer onsite for security purposes houston sighed giving david a hard look i know of the bad blood between you two but until the navys sub is tested at these depths jack and the deep fathom are remaining onsite jack is a skilled deepsea salvager and his expertise will not be wasted because of your past conflicts aye sir david said between clenched teeth seething at the admirals support of kirkland houston waved david out of his way as a matter of fact im heading over to the deep fathom right now david watched the admiral leave numb to the cold wind blowing through the open door it clanged shut but david remained standing staring at the closed door his limbs shook with rage before he could move booted footsteps sounded behind him david forced a calmer composure as he turned to his relief he saw it was another of his men omega teams electronics expert gregor handel the man stopped sir what is it lieutenant david snapped at the young man sir director ruzickov is on the scrambled telecom line he wishes to speak to you asap with a nod david strode past handel it must be the call he had been waiting for these past three days gregor followed in step behind him david strode quickly through to his own room leaving handel outside he closed the door on his desk rested a small briefcase opened inside was an encoded satellite phone a red light blinked on its console david grabbed up the receiver spangler here there was a short pause the voice was filled with static its ruzickov you have the green light to proceed to stage two david felt his heart beat faster i understand sir you know what you must do yes sir no witnesses there must be no mistakes the security of our shores depends on your action these next twentyfour hours david had no need for this pep talk he knew the importance of his mission here was a chance to finally grind the last major communist power under the heel of american forces i will not fail very good commander spangler the world will be waiting for your next call the line went dead david lowered the receiver back to its cradle at last he felt as if a heavy stone had been lifted from his shoulders the waiting the kowtowing was over he swung around to the door and opened it handel waited get the team together he ordered handel nodded and turned sharply on a heel david closed the door and crossed to his bunk bending over he hauled out two large cases from under his bed one was packed with c explosives detonators and electronic timers the other held his newest prize it had just arrived this morning by special courier he rested his hand atop the case distantly thunder echoed from outside the promised storm bore down upon them david smiled by nightfall his true mission would begin am aboard the deep fathom george klein sat buried in the ships library lost in his research oblivious to the rocking and rolling of the ocean for the past twentyfour hours the historian had holed up here going over old charts and stories searching for some clue to the origin of the strange script written on the crystal pillar though he had achieved no success his research had revealed something disturbing the discovery had kept him from his bed all night on the teak desk george had splayed out a large map of the pacific tiny redflagged pins speared the map dates scrawled on each flag they marked ships planes and submarines lost in the region going back a full century in an air force kb disappears near wake island in soviet golf ii class submarine vanishes southwest of japan in the british glomar java sea is lost off hainan island so many hundreds and hundreds of ships george had an old report from the japanese maritime safety agency listing boats lost with no trace ever found boats boats boats george stood moving back he studied the pins having sailed in these waters for years investigating shipwrecks he had heard of the term the dragons triangle it extended from japan in the north to yap island in the south and trailed to the eastern end of micronesia a triangle of catastrophe and missing ships not unlike the region known as the bermuda triangle in the atlantic ocean but he had never given these tales much thought until now hed attributed the vanishings to ordinary causes pirate activity wicked weather deepsea quakes but now he was not so sure he picked up an old report from a wwii japanese commander of a zero fighter wing shiro kawamoto the aged commander told a curious tale the story of the disappearance of a kawanishi flying boat during world war ii off the coast of iwo jima kawamoto quoted the final words of the doomed pilot over the radio something is happening in the skythe sky is opening up he returned the report to its pile jack had related the details of air force ones transcript to him last night after it was clear the news had already been leaked to the press the cockpit recording had struck a chord in him sending him to his library it had taken him an hour to dig up kawamotos recounting the similarity was too striking it took him the rest of the night to construct the model before him george returned to his map red pencil and ruler in hand he charted the dragons triangle upon the map he worked deftly striking the lines cleanly once done he stood back again all the tiny pins fell within the boundary of his lines all within the infamous triangle the old historian sat down he did not know the significance of his discovery but he couldnt stop a feeling of dread from settling in his chest over the long night he had read countless other stories of ships gone missing in these seas stories extending far into the past to records of ancient imperial japan countless centuries but these stories were not what disturbed him the most they were not what kept him working all night instead among the cluster of red flags in the exact center of the marked triangle was a single blue flag it marked the grave of air force one pm ryukyu university okinawa prefecture japan at the bank of computers karen worked alongside miyuki on a tiny monitor she watched a computer flash through various connections winding through an internet maze finally the university of toronto logo appeared on the active window you did it karen said gabriel did it miyuki answered i dont care who did it as long as were hooked up for the past day they had been trying to get a linkup to the outside world blackouts phone service interruptions and overloaded circuits had plagued their efforts to reach networks across the pacific even with gabriels skills but at last gabriel had succeeded with this internet connection their research into the discoveries at the chatan ruins could continue now maybe we can get somewhere karen said grabbing the computers mouse after learning of the crystal artifacts strange properties she had urged miyuki to keep quiet until she could research the language in more depth miyuki had not argued both women were too stunned and frightened by their discovery they had locked the artifact up in the safe in miyukis office karen connected to the anthropology department of the university of toronto she performed a quick search under the name rongorongo and found six websites she worked rapidly afraid of losing even her tenuous connection she clicked on a web address titled santiago staff from her research she knew this was one of the twentyfive known authentic artifacts from rapa nuis ancient past on the screen a photograph of a length of wood appeared carved into its surface were rows of tiny glyphs below the picture was a detailed rendering of the staffs writing karen highlighted it several of the symbols looked similar to those they had found in the star chamber we need to compare these to the lines we photographed done gabriels disembodied voice answered on a neighboring monitor the screen split into two halves on the left side a copy of the santiago staffs glyphs scrolled on the right the script from the star chamber rolled past at first nothing seemed to match they were similar but not exact then abruptly the scrolling stopped two glyphs now highlighted in red shared opposite sides of the screen miyuki gasped they look almost the same karen frowned she was not yet convinced it might be a coincidence how many different ways could there be to represent a starfish she spoke louder gabriel can you find any other matches i already have the pair of starred glyphs shrunk in size now each half of the computer monitor was filled with thirty glyphs each side the mirror of the other human figures odd creatures geometric shapes but they all matched i think this is more than coincidence miyuki said softly no kidding karen said adding this database to the previous gabriel said i estimate the language constitutes some main glyphs combining to form twelve hundred to two thousand compound glyphs with more data i may be able to begin building a translation karens eyes grew even wider i cant believe this if gabriels right the star chamber may be the rosetta stone for this ancient language the final key to a centurylong puzzle she returned to her monitor and computer gabriel im going to direct the other rongorongo examples to you she returned to the main screen and began feeding in other easter island artifacts the mamari tablet the large and small washington tablet the oar the aruka kurenga the santiago tablet and small st petersburg tablet when she was done karen straightened turning to miyuki toronto only has these nine artifacts can gabriel search other universities databases on his own if we could add the glyphs from the other sixteen artifacts then wed have a better chance at deciphering the language miyuki also spoke louder gabriel can you perform a worldwide search certainly professor nakano i will begin immediately karen clutched miyukis wrist do you have any idea what this could mean excited she answered her own question for centuries scholars have been attempting to translate the rongorongo writing how old is the writing where did it come from who brought it to the islanders the entire lost history of this section of the world could finally be revealed dont get your hopes too high karen im not she lied but either way to discover a new source of rongorongo script on the opposite side of the pacific that alone will garner countless journal articles itll force historians to change their assumptions of this area and what else is at chatan weve barely scratched the surface we should an alarm klaxon rang out from a wallmounted siren karen jumped at the noise miyuki stood up what is it karen asked my office alarm someone is breaking into my office karen bolted to her feet the crystal star miyuki grabbed her elbow the guards downstairs will check it out karen shook out of her friends grip and moved toward the door her mind spun she would not lose this clue to a mystery older than mankind she zippered down her white cotton clean suit and grabbed her pistol from its shoulder harness luckily the chatan police had not discovered her weapon after the incident at the ruins ever since that adventure she did not go anywhere without it miyuki followed her as far as the labs antechamber leave it to the guards she repeated emphatically the elevators arent working by the time they get here the thieves could be gone and i wont lose that artifact its too valuable trusting in her skill as a marksman karen cracked open the door and peeked down the hall toward miyukis office the door lay open its glass window shattered karen strained to hear anything but the alarm was deafening taking a deep breath she ducked out the door and crept along the wall toward the open office despite her warnings miyuki followed karen glanced at her friend but miyuki waved her on readying her pistol karen slid along the wall she could see a light skittering around inside the office a flashlight the intruder had not been scared off by the alarm her heart thundered in her ears she swallowed hard and continued on at the doorway she paused she could hear two men arguing inside but didnt recognize the language there was a loud crack of splintering wood she squeezed the grip of her pistol tensed for a breath then leaped into the entryway freeze she yelled inside two men glanced up at her with shocked expressions they had dark complexions clearly south pacific islanders one held a crowbar which hed just used to break into miyukis desk the other held a pistol he made a move in her direction karen fired a warning shot plaster puffed from the wall behind the armed mans head he froze drop the weapons or youre dead she screamed she did not know if the men knew english but the single warning shot crossed all language barriers the thief paused then tossed his pistol to the side a sour look on his dark face the other dropped his crowbar her adrenaline surging her senses were acute from the corner of her eyes she saw the ramshackle condition of miyukis office in the short time they had torn through the filing cabinets the drawers of the desk had been pulled and dumped with relief she noted that the wall safe hidden behind miyukis doctoral diploma had not been discovered raise your hands she said motioning with her pistol they obeyed karen kept her gun raised the building security should be arriving in the next few moments she just had to keep these thieves at bay as the men stood with their hands up karen noticed their bare arms the serpent tattoo was visible even in the dim light recognizing the symbol her breath caught in her chest they were the looters from the pyramids momentarily confused and shocked she was a few seconds too slow in realizing the hidden threat they had been attacked at the pyramids by three men only two were here where was the third to her right miyuki gasped she was posted in the shadow of the door karen glanced her way miyuki was staring down the hall past karens shoulder karen swung around the third thief stepped into the hall from the stairwell a rifle at his shoulder clearly their lookout the man fired the blast deafening but karen and miyuki were no longer there both women had leaped through the door into the office the wooden door frame burst into shards behind them inside one of the men lunged for the fallen pistol karen fired the mans hand blew back in a spray of blood moaning he rolled away from the discarded weapon his bloody fist clutched to his chest karen darted farther into the room giving her space to cover both men and the doorway the last man kept his hands raised unmoving it was not fear that kept him steady karen saw it in his eyes his calmness was almost unnerving he backed a step then sidled along the wall clearly offering no threat he kicked his wounded companion and barked something in his foreign tongue the bloodied man crawled across the floor in the direction of the door karens pistol followed them she did not shoot not in cold blood if they were leaving then let them hopefully university security would capture them on the way out but the reason for her restraint was not solely because the others were unarmed the first mans eyes did not leave hers in his gaze she continued to see a calmness that belied their situation then the rifleman appeared in the doorway before he could swing on them the first man knocked his companions gun barrel aside he eyed karen and miyuki and spoke rapidly in japanese his accent thick then the trio left the uninjured two helping their wounded companion karen did not lower her pistol even after their footsteps faded away what did he say karen asked miyuki hhe said that we do not know what we have discovered it was never supposed to be unearthed miyuki glanced at the hidden wall safe then back at karen it is a curse upon us all pm uss gibraltar central pacific david spangler led his team across the wet deck sticking to shadows the storms had grown worse by nightfall thunder boomed like distant mortar fire while spats of lightning turned night to day for flickering seconds nearby waves smashed against the flanks of the carrier washing as high as the deck itself after the evening meal the ntsb investigators had retreated to their own bunks many seasick abandoning the wreckage until the storm abated additionally david had declared the hangar deck to be unsafe for personnel with the ship heaving to and fro especially with all the loose pieces of wreckage he had ordered the hangar deserted until the storm died down greenfaced and holding their stomachs none of the ntsb personnel had argued afterward david assigned his men to guard the abandoned hangars entry points with the night complete and the storm in full rage david had chosen this moment to proceed with their plan sheltering for a moment in the lee of the giant superstructure he spotted the two men guarding the entrance to the hangar ramp tunnel one of the pair lifted a flashlight high signaling it was all clear then doused the light diving into the sweeps of rain david hurried forward shielding a thick case against his chest behind him the other three men laden with their own satchels kept pace moving with confident skill across the pitching deck david slid into the tunnel entrance and crouched beside the pair of guards all clear yes sir his secondincommand reported the last of them left half an hour ago david nodded satisfied he turned to the others you know your duties keep up your guard handel and rolfe with me the two men collected the equipment satchels david kept his own case he led them into the tunnel entrance it grew darker as they proceeded down at the bottom there were no lights pausing david slipped on his night vision goggles and switched on his uv lantern the stacks of wreckage appeared out of the gloom limned in dark purple and white he waved the others to follow striding briskly he moved down the central corridor of the makeshift warehouse no one spoke david flashed his ultraviolet light along the numbered side aisles at last he found number pausing he cast his light around there was no sign of anyone else here but the boom of thunder and the rattle of rain muffled even their own footsteps it set davids teeth on edge when he worked he depended on the full use of all his senses he searched for a full minute more then lowered the uv light he stood beside one of the jets hulking general electric engines except for impact damage it was intact he now knew where he was and led the way to the side his goal appeared out of the darkness a crate marked with the designation a on its side it contained the first bit of wreckage raised to the surface he nodded to his men the pair donned surgical gloves intending to leave no fingerprints they worked efficiently with minimal wasted movement rolfe pulled a small crowbar from his bag and loosened the crates nails gregor handel slid to his knees and primed the bombs electronics with four cubes of c enough to blow away several yards of wreckage around it david knelt and set down his own thick case snapping the bindings loose im ready sir gregor said beside him david nodded and opened his case it held the missions true prize resting on the felt interior was a jade sculpture the bust of a chinese warrior even through the night vision goggles he recognized the fine work he smiled with pride this aspect of the plan was pure brilliance on his part he had ordered the bust fabricated after the first days dive on the wreck it was an exact duplicate of the bust jack kirkland had rescued from the seabed the handsome object was a fragment of the chinese premiers original gift a jade replica of an ancient warrior seated on his horse when david had first seen the fragment he quickly modified his original strategy it occurred to him now that he should thank kirkland for this opportune turn of events he unscrewed the busts ear revealing a hidden compartment in the jade he passed the bit of sculpture to his electronics expert working deftly gregor slid the bomb in place and checked all the wires and transmitters nearby rolfe extracted the original bust from the crates bubble packing and settled it within their own case david glanced at his watch only a minute had passed i need some real light gregor hissed bent over the false bust he pulled back his night vision goggles this chink electronics is crap i need to doublecheck the connections david nodded to rolfe the man knelt and shone a small flashlight toward the chunk of jade david pushed aside his own night vision goggles gregor tilted his head fingers working over the explosive unit the timers and detonators had been stolen last week from a chinese black market dealer perfect to lay a false trail gregor sighed in relief and held the bust toward david all set david accepted it and screwed the jade ear in place lets get going he said standing up as he stepped toward the crate a call echoed across the dark tent whos out there david and the others froze rolfe flicked off his flashlight the men returned to night vision deeper in the tent a new light bloomed it lay over by the electronics bay show yourself or ill call security david thought quickly he now recognized the voice it was edwin weintraub the ntsb lead investigator he bit back a curse the hangar was supposed to be empty david leaned over to rolfe shut him down minimal harm rolfe nodded and backed swiftly away disappearing into the darkness quickly david adjusted his plans it was what made him such a successful field commander in the real world few plans proceeded as planned for a mission to succeed a plan had to be liquid capable of changing at a moments notice like now david stood shouting quiet down weintraub its just me commander spangler the edge of panic in the mans voice died down im just checking to make sure everything is secure before retiring what are you doing here i was taking a nap on my cot in the back my computer is compiling data im waiting for it to finish you shouldnt be out in this storm everythings insulated and surgeprotected theres no danger thats what you think david knew that rolfe should almost be in position he raised his voice keeping weintraubs attention on him fine if youve got everything in hand im heading out the guards will be outside all night if you have any problems thanks but ill be all hey who are david heard a loud crash he frowned rolfe was better than that sloppy work all clear rolfe called out im sending handel over to help you bring that slimy sack of shit over here gregor straightened a look of inquiry on his face but the man knew better than to question an order david waved him forward gregor quickly vanished as he waited david lowered the bust to the deck and collected their tools this unfortunate blunder could be turned to their advantage his original plan was to set off the explosive device during the workday tomorrow a few men would probably die but it was a small price to pay but now he recalibrated his plans beyond the rumble of the storm he heard the scrape of boot on deck he turned in time to see his two men edge into aisle weintraubs slack form slung between them his wrists and ankles were lashed with plastic straps his mouth sealed with duct tape the large man moaned and struggled feebly clearly dazed by the attack bring him here and dump him the pair lowered their captive to the deck im sorry sir rolfe apologized i slipped on some grease he saw me before i could silence him poor work all around david said harshly weintraub shouldnt even be here his cot was hidden behind a wall of wreckage his computers monitor was switched off in the dark i dont want to hear any excuses david turned his attention to the restrained investigator by now weintraub had regained full consciousness david spotted the large lump behind his left ear a dribble of blood marked where rolfe had clubbed him weintraub stared at david his eyes bright with hatred and anger what do we do with him gregor asked toss him overboard blame the storm david continued to study his prey he watched the mans anger change to fear no drowning him will do us no good a flicker of hope in the mans eyesand suspicion david reached over and pinched weintraubs nostrils closed hold him down rolfe pinned the mans legs gregor held his shoulders with his mouth sealed in duct tape there was no air weintraub struggled suffocating david held tight speaking to the others well put his body to use the weak spot in our plan was attempting to explain why tomorrows explosion would spontaneously happen why then what set it off it could raise suspicions he nodded toward the struggling man his color was now purplish his eyes bulging in recognition of approaching death david ignored his panic but heres our scapegoat the poor guy was tampering with the crate and accidentally set it off so well blow it tonight gregor asked just after midnight afterward well make sure the investigators discover the chinese electronics thats all the proof washington will need theyll come to believe the remainder of the jade sculpture had been similarly boobytrapped that the chinese stuffed the horses jade ass full of c i think hes dead sir rolfe interrupted still sitting on weintraubs knees david looked down and realized rolfe was right weintraub stared unblinking at the ceiling eyes empty david released the dead mans nose and wiped his gloved hand on his pant leg with disgust free his bindings his men obeyed while david ripped the duct tape from weintraubs purplish lips then he took the jade bust balanced it atop the mans chest and placed the mans hands near it as david began to pull away he had another idea fishing in a pocket he pulled free a bit of electronic circuitry of chinese design and placed it in the dead mans fingers he closed weintraubs hand over it a bit of extra insurance straightening he surveyed his handiwork for a few seconds then nodded curtly lets go im famished gregor collected the cases what are we going to do with the extra c and detonators he asked david smiled dont worry i have another mission for you after tonight tomorrows gonna be a hectic day lots of chaos to conceal one more operation sir i know someone wholl appreciate that extra c david pictured jack kirkland wearing his shiteating grin as he stood with an arm around his sisters shoulder a parting gift for an old friend midnight aboard the deep fathom in the ships galley jack sat with admiral houston at a small table outside the narrow window forked lightning streaked across the roiling skies due to the foul weather the admiral had chosen to remain aboard the fathom but jack suspected that his decision to stay was not all due to the storm as the ship heaved and rolled the admiral chewed on the stubby end of his thick stogie oblivious and sighed out a long stretch of smoke the old sailor was rapidly depleting jacks cuban cigar stock you really should have told us sooner about this discovery houston said jack bowed his head earlier he had played the secret recordings of the crystal spire and the strange hieroglyphics after the close call with the giant squid he knew he could no longer keep silent about his discoveries i know but at first i didnt think it was important to the investigation and you sought some way to snub your nose at the navy jack grimaced he never could put anything past the old man the admiral continued your discovery may explain the magnetization of the wreckages parts if the crystal was giving off some form of radiation it may have affected the wreck weintraub will want to know about this jack nodded he had been surprised to hear about the magnetization of the planes metal sections is there anything else youve been hiding houston asked no not really houstons look bore in on jack not really just a few thoughtsnothing concrete like what its not important houston drilled jack with his steely eyes even after twelve years it still made jack cringe inside let me decide whats important and what isnt jack felt backed into a corner i dont know dont you think its a strange coincidence that most of the wreckage just happened to land by the pillar strange no doubt but who knows how many of these spikes may lie down there on the ocean floor only a small fraction of the deep seabed has been investigated maybe jack was not convinced silence descended over the pair except for the distant rumble of thunder finally houston stretched stubbing out his cigar well if thats allits getting late i should get myself to bed before i totally clean out your cuban supply thanks for lending me your cabin jack took a deep breath all afternoon he had been mulling over an idea hed been afraid to verbalize mark the admiral glanced his way eyebrows raised it was the first time jack had addressed him so informally what is it i know this is crazy but what ifwhat if the crystal spire had something to do with bringing down air force one jack cmon now youre really pushing the envelope dont you think i know that but i was the only one down there jack recalled when his subs titanium arm had touched the crystals surface the sense of free falling the glitches what are you saying jack spoke earnestly struggling to put what he felt into words i once shipped out on a nuclear sub i bunked not far from the reactor though the power plant was shielded i could still somehow sense the immense power behind the bulkhead it was like my bones were picking up something that no machine could detect it was like that down below an immense power humming along idling houston stared silently then spoke slowly i trust your judgment jack i dont doubt you felt something if the thing could magnetize the wreckage then it is damn strong but to bring down a jet flying at forty or fifty thousand feet the admirals voice died away i knowi know what it sounds like but i just wanted you to know what i discovered what i felt down there all i ask is that you keep your mind open houston nodded i appreciate your candor jack but i always keep my options open the old man shook his head tiredly all i wish is that washington would do the same you know youre not the only one with thoughts about the crash the new administration seems to have already made up their minds what are they saying now jack asked sabotage done by the chinese jacks brow crinkled over the past few days he had been too busy to follow the news but thats ridiculous president bishop was one of the staunchest advocates for negotiating a longterm relationship with china why would they assassinate him the admiral scowled its all politics posturing but in response the chinese have already pulled their diplomats out of the us and kicked ours out of their country just this morning i learned that the chinese navy has been out on maneuvers just more posturing on their part but its still a dangerous game washington is playing jack suddenly felt foolish voicing his own wild conjecture the admiral had enough on his plate then i guess we need the real answer asap no doubt at least well have the navys own sub to aid us tomorrow with two submersibles diving we should be able to accelerate the pace jack nodded the sub was the newest prototype a part of the navys deep submergence unit rated to the depth of fifteen thousand feet and a speed of up to forty knots ive read about the perseus a real ferrari of the fleet a ferrari with teeth it was just outfitted with an array of minitorpedoes jacks eyes widened its the latest modification to the perseus still classified info should you be telling me about it houston waved off his concern you wouldve found out tomorrow anyway these little submarine busters should help discourage any hostile sea life from trying to eat you again jack grinned for once im not going to object to the navy guarding my back footsteps on the stairs interrupted their discussion both men turned george klein pushed up into the galley from the lower deck i thought i heard voices up here the historian said i was hoping you were still awake jack jack was surprised by the professors shabby appearance dark circles shadowed his eyes a scraggly gray beard covered his chin it looked as if he had not slept in a couple days now that he thought about it he hadnt seen george all day what is it professor the historian lifted a rolled map in his hand something i wanted to run past you ive been researching other disappearances in this region i think you should see this jack knew george did not voice idle thoughts the historian remained closelipped until he was satisfied with his research and from the condition of the man jack suspected he had been digging into something significant what have you discovered perhaps the underlying reason for the crash of air force one the admiral straightened and looked significantly at jack it seems everyone is coming up with their own theories today george ignored the admirals words and moved to the galley table as the historian unrolled his map jack caught a glimpse of the pacific ocean and a large redpenciled triangle before he could get a better look a loud boom shook through the ship everyone froze as the sound echoed away jack heard elvis barking deeper in the ships belly wincing the professor adjusted his glasses that was close that thunderclap must have been both the admiral and jack were on their feet that wasnt thunder jack said stepping to the door leading to the stern deck outside rain lashed the deck the winds tried to rip the door handle from his grip the ship rolled deeply under his feet both men followed him from the galley turning jack searched the seas about a quarter mile away he spotted the silhouette of the uss gibraltar the ship now blazed with lights from its deck a small fireball rolled into the dark sky what happened george asked wiping at his glasses no one answered but as jack followed the fireball he sensed that their true troubles were just beginning exiled august am ryukyu university okinawa prefecture japan climbing the stairs of miyukis building karen was thrilled to get back to work after yesterdays attempted theft she and miyuki had spent the entire day holed up with university security even though she had used her gun in selfdefense the authorities confiscated her weapon with japanese gun laws as strict as they were it had taken karen hours to talk her way out of the police station afterward ryukyus president concerned about the attack had called to reassure the two women and promise them increased security taking extra measures herself karen had stashed the crystal artifact in her safe deposit box at her bank in anticipation of another attempted theft even now as she climbed the buildings stairs she was accompanied by a uniformed security guard at least the universitys president had proven true to his word she thought at the top of the stairs she led the way to miyukis lab after she knocked and identified herself she heard the tumblers in the lock and then the door inched open are you all right doctor the guard asked in japanese miyuki nodded she pulled the door open allowing karen to enter well be fine from here karen said in stilted japanese well keep the doors locked and will call down when were ready to leave he nodded and turned curtly karen closed the door and miyuki locked it again sighing karen reached over and took her friends hand were safe she said they wont be back not with the extra security around here but she gave miyukis hand a squeeze remembering how calm the leader of the thieves had been and recalling how he had knocked down his companions rifle she said i dont think they truly meant us any personal harm they just wanted the artifact and are determined to get it no matter who stands in their way miyuki added dourly dont worry with it locked in my safe deposit box theyll have to defeat the bank of tokyos security system to get it im still not taking any chances miyuki waved karen to the clean suits hanging on their wall cmon gabriel has discovered something interesting really about the language yes he finished compiling the other examples of the easter island script karen hurried into her clean suit zipping it up and standing do you think he has enough information to translate it its too soon to say hes working on it though tucking her hair into a paper bonnet as she moved toward the door she asked but do you think he can do it miyuki shrugged and keyed open the door to the main lab a whoosh of air sounded as the seal broke thats not what you should be asking miyuki always japanese stoic was seldom playful when she talked business so the trace of mischief in her voice intrigued karen what is it you need to see this clearly miyuki had discovered something important what what is it miyuki led the way to the bank of computers gabriel could you please bring up figure b on monitor one certainly good morning dr grace good morning gabriel by now karen was growing accustomed to their disembodied colleague the two women sat down on the monitor before them karen saw data scrolling flowing so rapidly it was almost a blur but she noted that many of the fluttering images were of the unknown hieroglyphics within a few seconds five glyphs were centered on the screen she was unimpressed okay what am i looking at can you translate this section gabriel no dr grace with the current level of data a decryption of this language remains impossible karen frowned disappointed have you found any other examples of the rongorongo script i have found them all dr grace karens brows shot up all twentyfive so soon yes i contacted websites to obtain all known examples of this language unfortunately three of the artifacts contained identical scripts and one artifact contained only a single glyph the amount of data was insufficient to complete a decryption karen eyed the monitor so what is this which artifact are these glyphs from none of them what miyuki interceded please explain gabriel elaborate on your search parameters miyuki turned to karen and added hurriedly he thought of this all on his own her face shone with excitement and pride gabriel spoke after searching under the term rongorongoi performed a worldwide search under each individual symbol searches to be precise on an archaeology website at harvard university i discovered a matching post it matched three of my search parameters on the screen three of the five symbols suddenly glowed red what about the other two karen asked struggling to understand they do not match any known rongorongo glyph what are you saying miyuki answered theyre new symbols glyphs no ones seen before ththat would mean weve discovered an undocumented artifact she sat up straighter a new find the note on the harvard website was posted two days ago can i see the posting its right here miyuki slipped out a sheet i printed it out this is unbelievable i know gabriel was able to extend the search parameters on his own its true independent thinking unbelievable progress miyuki i meant the new symbols karen rattled the paper this is the unbelievable part in your field maybe karen realized she had slighted her friends accomplishment im sorry miyuki both you and gabriel deserve my heartfelt appreciation miyuki mollified pointed just read it theres more karen touched her friends wrist i do appreciate it really oh i know i just like making you admit it rolling her eyes karen turned her attention to the email post subject inquiry about unknown language to whom it may concern i would appreciate any help in ascertaining the origin of the following hieroglyphic writing system these few symbols were found etched on a piece of crystal for further details i would be happy to share data with anyone willing to assist my research thank you in advance for your help george klein phd deep fathom headers returnpath gkleinglobalnetnet received from globalnetnet by rlyyemx v with esmtp thurs july xmailer microsoft outlook express macintosh edition from george klein gkleinglobalnetnet to arclanguageharvarduniversityorg karen lowered the paper besides the glyphs she couldnt help but notice the reference to a second crystal it was too much of a coincidence do we know where this came from miyuki nodded gabriel ran a trace its from a salvage ship the deep fathom right now its located in the middle of the pacific gabriel was able to track its current position by tapping into the gps system where is it near wake island but thats not the weird part gabriel discovered a news article about the ship the deep fathom is currently aiding in the deepsea salvage of air force one how strange karen frowned trying to figure out how the two items could possibly be connected we need to contact this george klein gabriel is already working on it am uss gibraltar central pacific jack sat tensely in the leather chair in the long conference room though the room was crowded no one spoke they all awaited the appearance of admiral houston he was conferring with the joint chiefs after last nights explosion all night long investigators and military personnel had combed through the damage under sodium spotlights a hundred men dug shifted and collected pieces of evidence the remains of the chief investigator edwin weintraub had been found and brought to the ships infirmary his body was badly charred and blastburned the initial identification was made by his wedding ring it had been a long and somber night with security as tight as an angry fist jack had been refused admission to the gibraltar until this morning but even with the lead ship locked down rumors had spread to the support vessels including the deep fathom a bomb hidden in the chinese jade bust shards had speared everywhere piercing the tents tarpaulin even embedding into the bones of weintraubs skull and limbs additionally the explosion had ignited a nearby tank of cleaning oil creating the brilliant fireball that had blasted forth from the shaft of a cargo elevator jack shivered he had handled the jade bust himself if the stories were true what if it exploded while hed been on the ocean bottom he pushed away that stray thought around him in the room the silence remained tense everyone looked bonetired and thunderstruck not even whispers were shared at last the door to the conference room swung open admiral houston stalked into the room flanked by his aides and trailed by david spangler the admiral remained standing while the other three men took seats jack made eye contact with houston but the admiral did not acknowledge him his face was ashen his eyes as hard as agates gentlemen houston began first let me thank you all for your industrious efforts this past week the tragedy last night will not minimize your significant contribution the admiral bowed his head but i must now sadly announce that the remains found last night were positively identified as those of dr edwin weintraub a murmur spread through the crowd of ntsb personnel i know all who met dr weintraub held him in the highest esteem he will be missed the admirals tone grew harder but his death was not in vain amidst the debris his murderers left evidence of their cowardice experts both here and in san diego have confirmed the origin of the electronic timer and detonator both were of chinese manufacture a few of the ntsb men raised angry voices the navy and marine personnel remained stoic except for a lieutenant sitting near jack who moaned a quick oh god the admiral lifted a hand it is now believed that dr weintraub accidentally triggered the hidden bomb during the course of his investigation it is conjectured that similar devices were probably planted throughout the original tenfoothigh sculpture such an explosion in the cargo hold is believed to have downed air force one a hush settled over the crowd back home these findings will break with this evenings news it cannot be kept from the american people but once word spreads worldwide tensions will escalate quickly especially so soon after the pacific tragedy as such i have just received word that the uss gibraltar has been ordered to the philippine sea en route we will be offloading both the ntsb personnel and the wreckage of air force one on the island of guam new murmurs ran through the crowd the admiral waited for his audience to quiet down before continuing the navys salvage and research ship the maggie chouest along with the navys deep submergence unit will continue recovering the last pieces of air force one from the ocean floor once collected theyll also be shipped to guam this revised mission will be overseen by the current head of security commander spangler the admiral remained standing silent stonefaced then spoke slowly president nafe has promised that these terrorists will not go unpunished washington has already demanded that the chinese turn over all persons involved to international authorities houston clenched a fist and let me add my personal promise justice will be served whether the chinese government cooperates or not america will answer terrorism upon her people with swift and terrible fury jack had never seen admiral houston so incensed the cords of his neck stuck out his lips were bled of color that is all if there are any further questions of detail i refer you to my protocol officer thank you for your cooperation jack raised a hand unsure if his own crew would continue to play a role here sir if i might ask about the salvage op the admiral cut him off angrily mr kirkland any such questions should be directed to commander spangler without another word houston swung through the door and was gone jacks gaze twitched to david a small spiteful smirk flickered on spanglers face before he stood in answer to your question mr kirkland we thank you for your service as this matter is now one of national security your additional presence is no longer needed but this is now a military operation no civilians will be allowed a twomile cordon will be set up around the crash site you will be expected out of the zone by hours jack glowered at david knowing this banishment was of a personal nature if you are not out of the region or if you attempt to reenter you and your crew will be arrested and your ship impounded this response drew murmurs from the audience i have already arranged for two men to escort you from the gibraltar david lifted a hand two of his men stood up jacks face warmed he ground his teeth in frustration he did not know what to say he knew he couldnt go to the admiral since houston was clearly overburdened and did not need to be bothered by a petty squabble jack scowled at david spangler he had risked his life here and was now being unceremoniously dumped out on his ear i have no need for an escort he said coldly david signaled his men with a flip of a hand make sure mr kirkland leaves immediately jack did not resist as he was led away what was the use if the government didnt want his help so be it within minutes he found himself seated aboard a navy launch the pilot a navy seaman revved the engine and aimed for the deep fathom bouncing through the mild chop with the storm front blown past the day remained breezy but clear behind jack spanglers two men were seated he had not spoken a single word to the pair of grayuniformed men nor did he intend to jack leaned back into his seat from the security teams lack of racial diversity it seemed spangler had not changed davids sister had once confided to him that her father had been a cardcarrying member of the ku klux klan and often dragged david to meetings when he was a boy beating him if he refused jack eyed the twin blond escorts it seemed these childhood teachings had taken root in fertile ground with a bump the seamen slid the boat near the launch platform at the stern of the fathom all clear the pilot called out jack stood and crossed over the boats starboard edge before he could clamber onto his own ship one of davids men grabbed his elbow mr kirkland commander spangler asked us to give you this once you boarded the blond man held out a small square box the size of a jewelers ring box it was sealed with a small ribbon jack frowned at it a parting gift the man said with commander spanglers thanks jack accepted the gift and the man nodded and stepped back jack hopped to his own boats platform and grabbed the ships ladder with one hand as he turned the navy boat swung away with a throaty whine of its motor its wake splashed over the ribbed platform soaking jacks boots robert appeared on the main deck overhead leaning over the stern rail how did it go he called down learn anything more yeah gather everyone together robert gave him a thumbsup and vanished jack looked down at the small black gift box he was sure it was not a thankyou gift for his service more likely it was one of davids little jabs a final insult to send him on his way jack had a sudden urge to fling it into the sea but curiosity got the better of him he fingered the ribbon then shook his head his day had been bad enough already why add to it hed open the damned thing later pocketing the box in his jacket he turned to the ladder climbing up jack glanced over his shoulder at the gibraltar he forced down a twinge of regret it was as if hed been discharged all over again cut free from a past that had been his whole life surprisingly melancholy jack pulled himself onto the deck elvis came loping over to greet him jack knelt and gave the dog a vigorous pet and its tail thumped in contentment some things never changed youd never shove me overboard would you boy he said giving voice to his disappointment with the navy pm oval office white house washington dc alone for the moment lawrence nafe shifted in his chair assessing the latest developments his plan to implicate the chinese had been proceeding like clockwork nicolas ruzickov had proven a loyal friend and a skilled manipulator of the media earlier nafe had glanced over the letter his secretary of state drafted to the chinese premier it was fierce nafe recognized ruzickovs fingerprints all over the letter no compromiseimmediate reprisalsstiff sanctions it was just short of a declaration of war nafe had been only too happy to sign it as far as he was concerned it was about time the chinese government felt the full weight of american diplomacya diplomacy backed by the might of the worlds greatest fighting force the brief letter signaled an abrupt end to the pandering policies of bishops administration a shot across the bow so to speak nafe leaned back in his chair surveying the spread of the oval office this was now his administration he mused enjoying his new status but his short moment to himself was interrupted by a knock at his door come in he snapped the door was opened by his personal aide a thin twentysomething boy whose name nafe could not remember what is it the youth half bowed nervous sir the cia director and the head of the oes are here to see you nafe sat up straighter neither man had an appointment show them in the boy backed out allowing the two men inside nicolas ruzickov entered first and waved jeb fielding the head of the office of emergency services toward the upholstered leather chairs to one side of the room the older man of bookish appearance with rolled shoulders and an emaciated demeanor bore an armful of papers tucked under his arm mr president ruzickov said i thought you should see this the cia director gestured toward the sofas and chairs around an antique coffee table where fielding already sat if youll join us with a groan the heavyset nafe stood and walked around his desk its late nicolas cant this wait i have my nationwide address first thing in the morning and i dont want to look too tired the american people will need a strong face in the morning as the news of air force one sinks in ruzickov bowed his head slightly remaining officious i understand mr president and i implore your forgiveness but this matter may have a bearing on tomorrows address nafe settled onto the sofa in the informal seating arrangement ruzickov and fielding were in the chairs the oes chief with his pile of papersmaps nafe realized what is all this nafe asked leaning forward as fielding unfolded a map on the coffee table ruzickov answered late news hmm as you know the oes has been investigating the series of quakes from eight days ago given the devastation on the west coast detailed information was slow to dribble out nafe nodded impatiently he had publicly addressed the whole national disaster bit last week it was no longer his concern he knew that in another few days he was due to tour the region to shake hands at various homeless shelters and attend memorial services he was even scheduled to cast a wreath off the coast of alaska to mourn the thousands of deaths associated with the sinking of the aleutian islands he was ready for the trip he had his suits picked out and had posed before a mirror with his armani jacket over his shoulder his sleeves rolled up to the elbows it was a solid downtoearth look a president ready to help out his people ruzickov drew nafes attention to the map now open on the table with data flowing again from scientific stations on the west coast jebs office has been compiling the information and seismic readings trying to explain the natural catastrophe nafe looked up do we know what triggered it no not exactly but maybe jeb had better explain from here ruzickov nodded for fielding to speak the older man was clearly nervous he wiped a handkerchief over his forehead and cleared his throat thank you for your time mr president yes yeswhat have you learned fielding smoothed the map on the table it depicted the pacific ocean a topographic map of the sea floor continental shelf and coastlines drawn over it were a series of concentric circles the outer circle the largest brushed across the western coast of the united states and arced around to the islands of japan the inner circles grew progressively smaller little red crosses dotted the coastlines and islands caught within these narrowing rings marking disaster sites fielding ran his fingers along the concentric circles our office has been able to map out the vectors of tectonic force during the series of quakes nafe wrinkled his brow he hated to admit ignorance but ruzickov picked up on his confusion and said to fielding start at the beginning fielding bobbed his head of courseim sorry he licked his lips weve known from the start that the eclipseday quakes all occurred along the edge of the pacific tectonic plate he marked out the rough margins of the outermost ring on his map nafes brow remained wrinkled maybe id better elaborate further ruzickov said putting fielding on hold as im sure you know mr president the earths surface is actually a hard shell over a molten core a fractured shell actually like a hardboiled egg struck on a table each shell piece or tectonic plate floats atop this liquid core and is constantly in motion one grinding against another sometimes sinking under to form trenches or conversely riding up to form mountains it is at these friction points between plates that seismic activity is highest i know all this nafe said irritably feigning insult ruzickov pointed to the map theres one big plate under the pacific ocean the quakes and volcanic activity eight days ago all occurred along the margins or fault lines of that plate the cia director pointed at some of the islands in the center of the map additional catastrophes to coastlines and islands were the result of tidal wave activity generated by quakes under the sea nafe sat up too tired to feign interest any longer fine i understand so why this late night science lesson jeb why dont you finish from here fielding nodded for the past week weve been trying to find out what triggered so many points along the pacific plates edge to go active at the same time what triggered this catalytic reaction and nafe said fielding pointed to each concentric ring drawn on the map starting at the outermost and ticking down each smaller ring by triangulating data from hundreds of geologic stations weve been able to trace the direction of intensity zeroing in on the true epicenter of this entire series of quakes you mean all these quakes may have originated from a single bigger event somewhere else exactly its called plate harmonics a strong enough force striking a tectonic plate could send shockwaves radiating out causing the plates rim to blow out with activity like a pebble dropped into a still pond ruzickov added generating waves on the shorelines nafes brows rose do we know what this pebble might be no fielding said but we do know where the pebble struck the head of oes continued to draw his fingertip down the map until he reached the centermost circle a tiny red ring he tapped his finger it was right here leaning closer nafe studied the map it was only empty ocean whats the significance ruzickov answered that circle is where air force one crashed nafe gasped are you saying the crash of air force one caused this that bishops jet was this pebble weve been talking about no certainly not fielding said the quakes started hours before air force one crashed in fact it was the quakes in guam that required the presidents evacuation but either way a plane crash would not yield a fraction of the force necessary to trigger a harmonic wave across the pacific plate instead were talking about a force equal to a trillion megaton explosion nafe settled back onto the sofa are you saying then that such an event occurred down there he nodded toward the tiny red circle fielding slowly nodded back ruzickov spoke into the silence jeb thats all well need for now well talk in the morning fielding reached for the map leave it ruzickov said the man reluctantly pulled back his hand he gathered up his other papers and stood thank you mr president nafe lifted a hand dismissing him as fielding moved off ruzickov said and jeb your confidence in this matter would be appreciated this stays between us for now of course sir fielding replied then left the room when he was gone nafe spoke so what do you think nick ruzickov pointed to the map i think this discovery may be the most important find of this century something happened out there something that might be related to the crash of air force one the cia director stared nafe full in the face thats why i wanted you to hear about this tonight before the official announcement tomorrow before we commit ourselves fully to our current plan of blaming the chinese nafe shook his head im not changing our position not at this late stage of the game he scowled at the concentric rings all this is justjust science not politics i agree ruzickov said with a firm nod youre in charge it is ultimately your decision i wanted you to be fully informed nafe felt a surge of selfpride at the cia directors support good but nick what about all this other information can we keep it buried jebs my man he wont talk unless i tell him to good then tomorrows announcement will go along as planned nafe leaned into the sofa relieved that nothing would upset his schedule now what did you mean about this being the discovery of the century ruzickov remained silent for a few moments studying the map ive been keeping abreast on all reports from the crash site did you know that all the wreckages parts are magnetized no but what does that matter the chief investigator the deceased edwin weintraub theorized that the parts were exposed to a strong magnetic force shortly after settling to the oceans bottom i also read reports that the salvage operations submersible experienced some strange effects while down theresomething associated with the discovery of a new crystalline formation i still dont understand the significance ruzickov looked up whatever is down there was strong enough to shake the entire pacific plate as jeb said a force equal to a trillion megatons what if we could harness that power discover its secret a supreme new energy source could you imagine that firepower at our fingertips it could free us of the arabs stranglehold on our oil supplypower weapons and ships to dwarf any other military there would be no end to the possibilities sounds pretty farfetched to me how can you harness a onetime event at the bottom of the ocean im not sure yet but what would happen if some other foreign nation were to get hold of this power jeb is not the only scientist in the world in the months to come someone else might devise a similar map and go to investigate those are international waters out there we couldnt stop them nafe swallowed what are you proposing currently we are uniquely situated to explore this site without raising suspicion or outside interest were just recovering our lost presidents ship its the perfect cover weve got men and ships onsite already commander spangler has it cordoned off under this cover we could send down a research team nafe watched as ruzickovs eyes lit up so youve already thought about this and ive developed a tentative plan he said with a grim smile off the coast of hawaii a deepsea project jointly run by the national science foundation and a consortium of canadian private industries has been under way for the past decade they have developed and constructed a selfcontained deepsea research labequipped with its own submersible and rov robots it could be onsite and manned in four days the two missions recovering the last pieces of air force one and our clandestine research should merge together smoothly no one would suspect then whats the first step i just need your okay nafe nodded if there is something down there we cant risk it falling into foreign hands you have the goahead to proceed ruzickov collected the map and stood ill contact commander spangler immediately and begin the operation nafe pushed to his feet but nick after we set things in motion tomorrow no one must know about this no one dont worry mr president commander spangler will lock everything down tight he has never failed me nafe swung around his desk and settled into the executive chair once again he had better not pm deep fathom central pacific jack and the deep fathoms crew sat around the table in the ships wet lab the marine laboratory was one of the roomiest spaces on the small ship a convenient meeting hall if not the most homey there were only hard metal stools on which to sit and lining the cabins shelves were hundreds of clear jars of marinelife samples preserved in brine or formaldehyde the rows of dead animals seemed to stare down upon the assembled crew im still not buying this explanation george said heatedly ive wired into the news reports all day long heard the socalled experts spouting on cnn cnbc and the bbc im not believing a word of it jack sighed earlier he had related to his crew the findings announced at the briefing and their new orders vacate the area it took the entire afternoon to restow their gear secure the nautilus and get under steam by evening they had long cleared the crash zone and only empty sea surrounded them the crash is no longer our concern jack said exasperated the meeting was not going along as hed expected he had called this evenings session to congratulate everyone for their help and to concoct a plan with the treasure ship kochi maru sunk into a deepsea volcano the fathom would need a new target the two gold bars dredged up from the dive a week ago had been shipped to wake island and from there to kendall mcmillans bank in san diego the small treasure barely covered their expenses in the yearlong search for the kochi maru the salvage fee for their assistance with the navy would buy them a bit of latitude but not much they would still need to renegotiate a loan mcmillan the banks accountant sat at the far end of the table still looking green around the gills from yesterdays storms whatever was decided here the bank would make the final decision deciding whether or not to finance their next venture mcmillan sat with a pen in hand doodling in the margins of his legal pad the crew still angry at being so rudely booted out had yet to make any progress jack tried to refocus the discussion we need to put this matter behind us and consider what to do from here george scowled listen jack before the explosion last night i wanted to show you something i still want to get this off my chest jack recalled the historians interrupted midnight talk with admiral houston okay but this is the last time we discuss this matter then on to real business agreed george reached down and retrieved a rolled map from beside his chair with a flick of his wrists he unrolled its length across the table the map held a view of the entire pacific basin a large red triangle had been penciled on its surface with tiny xs marked within its boundaries lisa stood up to get a wider view what are you showing us george tapped the map the dragons triangle the what she asked george ran a finger along the boundaries of the penciled triangle it goes by other names the japanese call it mano umi the devils sea disappearances in this region go back centuries he sat down and tapped each of the tiny xs describing the tragedy of a lost ship submarine or plane lisa whistled its like the bermuda triangle exactly george said and continued his litany ending at last with the story of a wwii japanese pilot and the mans final fateful words before his plane disappeared the sky is opening up that was his last radioed message now i find that a remarkable coincidence air force one crashes into the center of the dragons triangle and the final words from its pilot are the same as the vanished japanese pilot from half a century ago amazing lisa agreed robert just stared his boyish eyes wide charlie leaned in closer running a finger along longitude and latitude numbers his brows were deeply furrowed george looked up at jack how do you explain that i saw the explosion site from the bomb jack said that was no weird phenomenon that was plain murder george made a scoffing noise but what of your own findings down below the crystal spire the strange hieroglyphics the odd emanations on top of all this most of the wreckage of the presidents plane just happens to settle at this site if a midair explosion had truly happened the debris field would be much wider jack sat silently in georges words he heard his own argument with the admiral last night he too had been convinced that something powerful lay down there something with the strength to knock a plane from the sky he studied the map the number of coincidences kept piling up too high to ignore but the bomb in the jade bust the electronic circuitry what if it was staged george asked a frameup washington had already been implicating the chinese before the explosion jack frowned charlie spoke up his jamaican accent thick i dont know mon i think ol george might be on to something what do you mean i too have heard of this dragons triangle i just never made the connection until now great another convert kendall mcmillan mumbled from the far side of the table jack ignored the accountant he turned to the ships geologist what do you know of the region as answer charlie nudged robert would you please grab the globe from the library sure robert took off charlie nodded to the map do any of you know the term agonic lines everyone shook their heads it is one of the many theories for explaining the disappearances here agonic lines are distinct regions where the earths magnetic field is a bit off kilter compass readings are slightly out of sync with the rest of the world the principal agonic line of the eastern hemisphere passes through the center of this dragons triangle charlie looked around the table do any of you know where the western hemispheres main agonic line passes through again a general shaking of heads the bermuda triangle charlie answered letting the fact sink in but what causes these magnetic disturbances in the first place lisa asked these agonal lines agonic charlie corrected no one knows for sure some blame it on increased seismic activity in the regions during earthquakes strong magnetic fluxes are generated but in general magnetism including the earths magnetic field is still poorly understood its properties energies and dynamics are still being researched most scientists accept that the earths magnetic field is generated by the flow of the planets molten core around its solid nickeliron center but many irregularities still remain like the fluidity of this field fluidity george interrupted what do you mean charlie realized that in his excitement hed spoken too fast from a geological standpoint he went on speaking more slowly man has only been here for a flicker during such a small scope in time the earths magnetic field seems fixed the north pole is up and the south pole is down but even over this short course the poles have wobbled the true position of magnetic north constantly bobbles around a bit but this is only a minor fluctuation over the course of earths entire geologic history not only have these poles shifted dramatically but they have reversed several times reversed lisa asked charlie nodded north became south and south became north such events are not fully understood yet jack scratched his head what does this have to do with anything hell if i know like i said i find it intriguing didnt you say that air force ones wreckage was magnetized doesnt this fact add to the list of coincidences and what about your own compass problems down there jack shook his head after the passing of a couple days he was not so sure what he had experienced down there and what about those strange time lapses lisa asked ive been struggling to find out why the nautiluss clock was always messed up when the submersible neared that crystal thing but i could never find anything wrong afterward george sat up straighter of course why didnt i make that connection too he began sifting through his pile of papers time lapses heres a report from a pilot arthur godfrey back in he flew an old prop plane to guam his craft traveled the miles in one hour two hundred miles farther than his plane could have traveled in an hour george lifted his nose from his papers on landing mr godfrey could not explain his early arrival nor why his clocks read differently from the airports lisa glanced at jack that sounds damn familiar i have other examples the historian said excitedly modern planes crossing the pacific but inexplicably arriving hours earlier than their etas i have the details down below george stood im going to go fetch them this is ludicrous jack said but he had a hard time mustering much strength behind his words he recalled his own fortyminute time gap it may not be that strange charlie said as the historian slipped past it has been theorized that strong enough electromagnetic fields could possibly affect time similar to a black holes gravity as the historian left the room he almost collided with robert the marine biologist stepped aside for the old professor then entered he bore a beachballsized globe in his hands ah charlie said now let me show you the really bizarre part something i remember reading in a university research paper robert passed the geologist the blue globe charlie held it up and pointed a finger at the pacific here is the center of the dragons triangle if you drove an arrow from this point through the center of the world and out the other side do you know where it would come out no one answered charlie flipped the globe around and jabbed a finger on it the center of the bermuda triangle lisa gasped charlie continued its almost as if these two diametrically opposed triangles mark another axis of the earth poles never studied or understood before jack stood up and took the globe from charlie he set it on the table cmon all of this is interesting but its not going to pay the rent folks i agree with mr kirkland mcmillan said sourly if i knew this was going to turn into an episode of unsolved mysteries i couldve been in bed jack rested his palm on the globe i think we need to turn this conversation over to more than theories and ancient myths set aside conjecture for now this is a business im trying to run george reentered the room then he wore a blanched expression and held a single sheet in his hand i just received this email he held up the paper from an anthropology professor in okinawa she claims to have discovered more of the strange hieroglyphic writingetched on the wall of a secret chamber in some newly discovered ruins jack groaned he could not seem to squelch this line of discussion but thats not the most amazing thing george looked around the room she discovered a crystal too she has it charlie sat straighter abandoning his interest in the map a crystal what does she say about it nothing much shes vague but hints that it bears some odd properties she refuses to give out further informationnot unless we meet with her jack found everyones eyes turning in his direction none of you are going to let this go are you strange crystals ancient writing magnetic fluxeslisten to you except for the banks accountant jack saw a wall of determination he threw his hands in the air and sank to his stool finewhether the navy wants our help or not whether we go broke or not you all want to continue investigating whats down there sounds good to me charlie said yep lisa added how could we walk away robert asked i agree george said only kendall mcmillan shook his head the bank is not going to like this jack stared at his crew then sighed he rested his head in his hands okay george how soon can you book me a flight to okinawa a line in the sand august am aboard the maggie chouest central pacific wrapped in a leather flight jacket david spangler stood at the bow of the navys salvage ship the maggie chouest it was an ugly ship painted bright red and festooned with antennas booms and satellite dishes a twohundredfoot homely bitch david thought manned by a crew of thirty the salvage ship was the temporary home of the navys deep submergence unit and the units newest rescue vessel the submersible perseus currently the large sub still rested in the ships dry dock at the stern awaiting its first deployment later this day alone at the bow david sucked a long draw from his cigarette morning was still hours away but he knew any attempt at sleep would fail him this night two hours ago he had gotten off the scrambled line with his boss nicolas ruzickov they had talked at length concerning davids revised assignment his primary goal of implicating the chinese in the crash of air force one had been accomplished with the country still struggling to recover from the disaster on the west coast and with paranoia sky high across the country the public was ready to accept any explanation it was an easy sell david had received the thanks of a grateful president in fact lawrence nafe would be making a formal announcement in only a couple more hours confronting the chinese aloud drawing a line in the sand between their two countries but now david had a new assignment to oversee a clandestine research project into an unknown power source something to do with the quakes from nine days ago he did not understand half the details ruzickov related but it was not important all he had to do was maintain a blanket over the site to the world abroad the activity here had to look like the continuing salvage ops staring out at the dark seas david exhaled slowly a circle of smoke curling up from his lips half a day ago the uss gibraltar had left with the setting sun steaming toward the philippine sea without the giant ship here the seas seemed empty besides the maggie chouest only three other ships still circled the region destroyers with enough firepower to maintain their privacy behind david a hatch clanged closed sir david glanced over a shoulder what is it mr rolfe sir i just wanted to let you know that the research site in hawaii has been locked down theyre dismantling the sea lab for shipment any problems no sir the head of the project has been informed and signed a confidentiality agreement the only concession was to let him oversee the research here our scientific liaison at los alamos vouched for the man and the cia director signed off on it david nodded wearing a grim smile it seemed ruzickov was getting as little sleep as he when are they due to be under way less than two days two days ruzickov was moving fast good david studied the sea later today he planned to dive in the navys submersible to give the perseus its first trial run here he had watched the video recordings from kirklands other dives but david wanted to see the crash site for himself once this mission was under way omega team would oversee topside while he would remain below at the sea lab sir theum other objectiveare we to continue david took a drag on his cigarette yes therell be no change if anything we now have a stronger mandate to proceed no outsider must know what lies below those are the standing orders yes sir are we still tracking the deep fathom of course sir but when do you expect to proceed with ill let you know we cant move too soon i want him well away from here before we proceed david flicked the dying butt of his cigarette into the sea angered that his moment of peace had been shattered by the intrusion after waiting for over a decade he told himself he could be patient a bit longer three days he decided no more trade secrets august am oval office washington dc just after midnight a knock interrupted lawrence nafes meeting with a trio of democratic senators three stubborn holdouts on his west coast disasterrelief bill the bill would be voted on in the morning and his entire staff was working through the night to ensure they had the votes needed to pass the door to the oval office opened and his personal aide stepped inside nafe had finally learned the boys name what is it marcus sir mr wellington is here to his chief of staff pushed past the young man excuse the interruption mr president but i have an urgent matter to bring to your attention nafe noticed the hard set to the mans eyes and lips william wellington from a rich georgian family usually exuded a gentile charm something was wrong nafe stood thank you gentlemen thatll be all the senator from arizona opened his mouth as if to complain but nafe stared him down if jacobson wanted his support in next years election for the arizona seat he had better tow the line on this bill he would brook no defectors in his own partys ranks the man closed his mouth the others mumbled their thanks and departed with his aide nafe turned his attention to his chief of staff what is it bill wellington spoke formally strained mr president youre needed in the situation room whats happened the chinese sir their air and naval forces have made a strike against taiwan nafe almost fell back into his chair what when its the goddamn middle of the night its midday in the far east they struck just before noon taiwan time nafe was stunned he had not thought the chinese would be so bold nicolas ruzickov had assured him that the chinese premier would bow to washingtons accusations paving the way to garner stiffer concessions from the peoples republic nafe wanted answers for this mistake wheres nick ruzickov in the situation room the national security council and cabinet are already gathering william wellington backed toward the door sir we must get going an immediate response will be necessary nafe nodded and headed toward the door the joint chiefs had better have a contingency plan in place with the chief of staff at his side he strode through the west wing trailed by his secret service men in short order nafe pushed angrily into the white houses inner sanctum the agitation and noise in the situation room quieted at his entrance around the long table a score of uniformed men and women stood at his arrival the chairman of the joint chiefs the secretary of the navy the us army chief of staff the commandant of the marine corps and other military heads nafes own cabinet members stood to either side of the table on the far side of the room a wallsized monitor displayed a complicated map of the philippine sea forces were highlighted in blues reds and yellows scowling nafe crossed to the head of the table he would make sure the us answered this display of chinese aggression there would be no diplomacy if necessary he would wipe the chinese navy from the seas he sat down those members who had seats returned to their own chairs the others remained standing so where are we nafe asked no one spoke no one would even meet his gaze i want answers and a plan for an aggressive response nafe said angrily nicolas ruzickov stood mr president its too late what do you mean the fighting is already over taiwan conceded nafe struggled to understand how could that be are you saying during the time it took me to cross from the oval office the chinese have taken taiwan ruzickov bowed his head with their island in shambles from the recent quakes the taiwanese could offer no resistance before we could respond their government had agreed to rescind their independence accepting chinese hegemony in exchange for both aid and an end to hostilities chinese forces have already landed taiwan is once again a chinese province nafe was too stunned to speak it had happened so fast the secretary of defense spoke up we cant just accept this we have forces on the islandin the area the chief of naval operations answered we cannot act without a request from the taiwanese government and we wont get it weve been in touch with their embassy they do not want to be caught between our two warring forces fearing in their current state that it would lead to the annihilation of their island in fact weve just received word that their government has demanded that our forces evacuate their waters nafe felt the heat rising in his face less than two weeks in office and he was losing taiwan to the chinese he clenched his fists i do not accept this i will not see the spread of communism while im in charge sir ruzickov cautioned nafe slammed his fist against the table its time to stop coddling china it will stop here now sir what do you propose with the cowardly assassination of president bishop and this newest aggression i see no other choice nafe stared down the heads of the united states fighting forces i will demand a declaration of war from congress pm naha city okinawa prefecture japan forgetting how much he hated airline travel the stale air the cramped seats the crying children jack was glad when the jets tires finally touched down and he was freed from the belly of this beast though in truth his annoyance did not entirely arise from the usual discomforts of flight but from his memory of air force ones crash the flight here had been in the same class of jet a boeing jack had spent much of the journey staring out the window studying every wing seam bolt and flap but after three days since making the decision to travel here he had finally reached okinawa the journey had taken so long because the closest airport was on kwajalein atoll a days sail in the deep fathom and once there he had been forced to fly standby killing another half day waiting for a seat to open up but at least the journey was finally over free of the plane now jack crossed through the concourse to the customs area his only luggage a single backpack was hooked over his shoulders he stepped up to the japanese customs agent and slapped down his passport the officer gestured him to open his bag as jack obeyed the man studied his passport and spoke to him in english welcome to okinawa mr kirkland if youll step over to the right jack turned and saw a second agent carrying a metaldetecting wand the first man spoke as he sifted through jacks backpack picking through his underwear and toiletries extra security the officer explained because of chinas attack jack nodded over the planes intercom the pilot had described the short skirmish and taiwans concession the strong were always eating the weak jack stepped over to the second agent who waved a metal detector over his legs and up his body the detector buzzed at his wrist he pulled back his sleeve to expose his watch the officer continued his sweep the detector sang out again as it passed over his heart the officer looked up at him frowning jack patted his jacket there was a small bulge in the inner pocket he opened his jacket and reached inside remembering david spanglers parting gift as he pulled out a tiny ribbonwrapped box with all the commotion hed forgotten about it youll have to open that the first agent said jack nodded and moved back to the customs table he tugged the ribbon free leave it to david to cause trouble from half a world away he popped open the tiny ring box inside resting on its velvetlined interior lay a small piece of circuitry a couple of blue wires stuck out of it what is that the agent asked tweezing it between his fingers jack had no idea but he knew some explanation was needed he thought fast itits for a repair job an expensive and critical component im a computer consultant so you giftwrapped it the man asked studying the tiny piece of electronics searching for some threat its a joke between he struggled to remember the name of the computer scientist helping the anthropologist professor nakano and myself the customs officer nodded ive heard of her the universitys computer expert smart woman nobel prize winner he replaced the circuit snapped the ring box closed and passed it back she taught my nephew jack shoved the box into his backpack behind him a loud portuguese family aimed for the customs station a large woman was arguing with her husband both dragged gigantic suitcases the agent glanced at them and sighed in exasperation youre free to go he waved jack off jack zipped his bag and proceeded through the gates into the main terminal the airport was in a tumult with masses of travelers leaving clearly the chinese attack had made everyone nervous taiwan was too close for comfort just south of the ryukyu chain of islands of which okinawa was a part jacks eyes drifted over the crowd the terminal was so busy he failed to notice the woman trying to get his attention until she called out his name mr kirkland jack stumbled to a stop glancing to his left the woman hurried over she had been waiting at the customs gate she stopped and held out her hand im karen grace jack blinked stupidly at her for a second thethe professor he had not expected her to be so young she smiled i know you told us you would call once you were settled in your hotel butwell a blush brightened her cheeks miyuki hacked into the airports computers and downloaded your itinerary i figured you could stay at my apartment rather than a hotel itll make things easier she began to stammer clearly realizing she might be stepping over a line that isif youd like jack rescued her from further embarrassment thanks i appreciate the offer i hate hotels goodgoodwell get a taxi she turned and led the way jack watched her for just a moment as the woman had rushed up to him jennifers memory had flashed before him not that the two women looked anything alike except for the blond hair the professor bore no resemblance to jennifer karen was taller her hair cropped shorter her eyes green she carried herself differently too striding sternly no sway in her step still jack recognized a similar energy coming from this professor she practically glowed with it a light that shone past the superficial differences so youre that astronaut karen said when he caught up to her i remember the news stories the hero god id love to go up there sometime i cant say i enjoyed it much karen stumbled to a stop oh god im sorry the accident you lost friends up there what was i thinking its ancient history he mumbled wanting to end the conversation she stared up at him with an apologetic grin im sorry jack turned the conversation in another direction as they moved off again so youre american canadian actually a visiting professor i have an apartment near the universityfaculty housing sounds good after i clean up id like to get to work as soon as possible of course exiting the terminal karen pushed forward through the throng at the curb she raised a hand to hail a cab one zipped to a stop at the curb stepping forward she pulled open the door cmon i want to get to the bank before it closes jack ducked inside the small car as karen spoke rapidly to the driver in japanese then she slid in next to him if you want to work this afternoon ill need to collect something from my safe deposit box first whats that the crystal you have it at the bank as the taxi wove into highway traffic aiming for the city she looked at him studying him in her eyes jack saw her weighing something in her mind finally she said you dont have any tattoos do you why she just stared waiting for him to answer okay i do i was with the seals could i see them not unless you want me to moon the driver she blushed again jack fought down a grin he was growing to like this reaction um that wont be necessary she mumbled how about snake tattoos any of those no why she chewed her lower lip then spoke weve had some trouble with a group trying to steal the crystal artifact they bear these snake tattoos on their forearms thats why i insisted on meeting you in person we need to be cautious jack pushed back his jackets sleeves baring his forearms no snakes anywhere i swear she grinned at him settling back into her seat i believe you after a short drive they exited the highway signs for the university were written in both japanese and english karen leaned forward and again spoke to the driver who bobbed his head she pointed at the next corner to a large bank of tokyo sign the taxi squealed to a halt ill be right back she hopped out jack sat in the steaming heat with the car stopped there was not even a breeze through the window to move the air his thoughts drifted back to the professor she smelled vaguely of jasmine her scent remained in the cab he could not help smiling perhaps this trip wasnt such a bad idea then karen was climbing into the cab again got it here she handed him a small leather satchel he took it and almost dropped it its weight caught him by surprise heavy isnt it this is the crystal see for yourself jack fingered loose the leather straps and tugged the satchel open at the bottom lay a crystal star smaller than his outstretched hand even in the shadowed light of the cab he appreciated its brilliance he also recognized the distinct appearance translucent crystal veined with azure and ruby whorls its the same what he reached in and pulled out the crystal id swear this is the same type of crystal that i found at the crash site the crystal obelisk with the inscription on it exactly jack held the artifact up to the direct sunlight its facets burst with brilliance notice anything odd about it what do you mean youre holding it up with one hand yeah so karen pulled out a black handkerchief and tossed it over the crystal jacks arm dropped it was as if the handkerchief weighed ten pounds what the hell the crystals weight is dependant upon light exposure the stronger the light the less it weighs jack whisked off the bit of cloth exposing the crystal again it was lighter my god karen took the crystal and lowered it back into her satchel my geologist would sell his soul to see this weve already arranged to have it studied next monday in fact when the universitys geology staff returns ill pass the data on to your friend jack knew this would hardly satisfy charlie he wished he had collected a sample of the crystal pillar himself now its your turn karen said you said you would bring a copy of the obelisks inscription he patted his own bag i have it may i see shrugging jack bent over and fished through his backpack for his notebook pulling it free he handed it to her karen opened the book the first page was covered with the tiny hieroglyphics a small gasp escaped her throat rongorongo excuse me karen flipped through the remainder of the notebook there were forty pages of glyphs the book trembled in her fingers as she mumbled there has never been a discovery of this length before discovery of what she closed the book and gave him a quick lesson on the history of the etchings found on easter island over the centuries she finished no one has been able to translate them this may hold the final clue i hope it helps jack said lamely as his mind spun if the language was from easter island what was it doing inscribed on a crystal spire six hundred meters underwater he struggled to incorporate this newest bit of information could this have anything to do with the crash of air force one before flying here he had not mentioned to karen his own agenda in meeting with her to tie the strange crystal to the downing of air force one it seemed too farfetched to admit to a stranger do you think youll be able to translate whats on the pillar karen clutched the notebook in her lap she stared out the window lost in her own thoughts i dont know within a few minutes they reached her apartment a secondfloor town house two bedrooms neat and wonderfully cool karen apologized for the drab furnishings all beige and browns it came prefurnished but jack noted small personal touches on a mantel rested a collection of stone statues and fetishes from micronesia in a corner were four carefully tended bonsai plants and stuck on the apartments refrigerator were scores of pictures family friends old vacation photos affixed by an equally colorful assortment of kitchen magnets jack followed karen toward the bedroom area as his host passed the decorated refrigerator all the magnets suddenly clattered to the floor the pictures fluttering after them startled karen jumped away jack glanced from the refrigerator to karen she stood with the satchel clutched to her chest it think its the crystal its demonstrated strange magnetic effects before as proof he waved her away when she moved off a few steps he collected one of the magnets and put it back on the refrigerator it stuck again that is so weird karen said no wonder the looters thought the crystal was cursed jack frowned cursed she matched his frown with a nod to the single magnet it seems both of us have been holding back a little lets get you settled and then head over to the lab we have much to discuss jack slowly nodded he showered shaved and changed into a pair of loose khakis and a light shortsleeve shirt he repacked his backpack camera notebooks pens cellular phone he felt worlds better as he left karens apartment it was only a short walk to the university i already called miyuki karen said shes waiting for us at her lab jack nudged his pack higher on his shoulder you mean professor nakano karen nodded she has a program to decrypt the language as they walked an awkward silence descended jack sought to break it so tell me where you found the crystal karen sighed thats a long story but she gave jack a quick sketch the risen pyramids the ambush the escape through an underwater passage as the story unfolded jacks respect for the two women grew and these looters were the same ones who broke into professor nakanos office karen nodded how could they possibly know about the crystal within the pyramid im not sure they did they just know we found something something they think is cursed jack thought about the crash of air force one wondering if these mens warning might hold a kernel of truth definitely strange he mumbled here we are karen pointed to a building just ahead she led the way inside she flashed her credentials and a guard escorted them to the elevators the lifts are working again she asked as the doors opened the guard nodded he joined them in the small space karen caught jacks inquisitive look at their escort precautions because of the breakin last week the elevator ascended swiftly when the doors opened jack found a small japanese woman waiting for them pacing anxiously stepping forward karen introduced them miyuki bowed slightly but offered no hand jack nodded in greeting asian customs involved little physical contact professor nakano thank you for your help please call me miyuki she said shyly lets go karen said as the guard returned to the elevator i want to enter jacks data as soon as possible karen hurried forward waving for jack and miyuki to follow jack leaned over to miyuki is she always like this miyuki rolled her eyes always she said with an exaggerated sigh once at the office miyuki stepped forward and keyed open the lock karen was first through the door miyuki maintains a clean room for her computers she explained as jack entered she pointed to a row of starched coveralls hanging on the wall youll need to wear one of those i dont know if i have a suit thatll fit him miyuki said she sifted through the coveralls this might do she passed him a large suit jack took it and placed his backpack on a bench by the wall karen was already zipping into her own coverall jack while you dress may i show miyuki your notebook he nodded and nudged his pack in her direction then applied himself to forcing his large frame into the tight suit miyuki come see this she tugged free his notebook as she did something tumbled from his backpack and rolled across the floor miyuki bent to pick it up as jack struggled to work both shoulders into the coveralls he saw that miyuki held david spanglers gift box and an idea dawned on him open it he said to miyuki i could use your expert opinion she pulled back the lid her eyes narrowed as she peered at its contents what do you think it is jack asked miyuki leaned closer its an inexpensive switching circuit she closed the box with a snap worthless really jack frowned what was davids scam here the circuitry must contain some veiled insult but what miyuki handed the box back to karen its just an obsolete chinese design her words struck jack in the stomach he suddenly felt ill chinese are you sure she nodded jacks mind fought for any other explanation his first suspicion couldnt possibly be true but he remembered georges question a few days back what if the explosion had been staged a frameup jack ran various scenarios through his mind but only one rang true spangler had faked the explosion that bastard he spat out even the little gift was davids way of rubbing his nose in this fact knowing he couldnt do a thing about it washington had wanted this explanation for the tragedy and david had handed it to them no one would listen to anything contradictory bile rose in jacks throat the stupendous gall of the murderous bastard and how far up did this treachery go he wondered was it just a frame job or had david played a role in the jets downing too jack swore under his breath and clenched his fists sharpening his resolve he would discover the truth behind the crash or die trying whats wrong karen asked jack finally noticed the two women gaping at him he sat down his legs suddenly weak as his anger faded it seems i also have a long story to share about what karen sat down next to him about the crash of air force one pm central pacific on his belly in the submersible david spangler ascended through the depths of the sea rising in a slow spiral toward the surface over the past three days the navys new prototype sub the perseus had been functioning far better than the estimates from the drawing board david lay sprawled on his stomach within the subs inner shell a torpedoshaped chamber molded of twoinchthick lexan glass except for the clear nose cone where his head and shoulders protruded the rest of the lexan cubicle was encased in the subs outer shell a topsecret ceramic composite that was lighter and stronger than titanium within this outer shell were housed all the ships mechanical electrical and propulsion systems this dual shell system was designed for safety in case of emergency the entire outer shell could be jettisoned with manual pyrotechnics freeing the inner lexan pod to rise to the surface under its own buoyancy perseus a voice said in his ear we have you locked in if youd like to switch to autopilot well guide you into the docking bay david answered the topside technician ill take her in myself this was his sixth dive in the perseus and he felt comfortable enough with her controls now to do this manually with his thumb he flicked a switch and a headsup display appeared superimposed over the nose cones glass his trajectory to the bay of the navys salvage ship the maggie chouest was delineated in red it was simply a matter of guiding his sub along the designated approach not unlike a flight simulator im hooked into the tracking computer he radioed ill be at the bay in three minutes aye sir see you topside slowing the thrusters david eased the sub upward around him as he neared the surface the dark waters began to lighten as he aligned his sub he could not escape the sensation of true flight on his belly it was as if he and the ship were one the subs hand controls were as responsive as his own thoughts the telescoping wings to either side were like the fins of a creature born to the sea twisting and tucking to guide the vessel but this was no creature of the sea under its belly a pair of titanium manipulator arms were folded and stored capable of crushing granite and atop the sub protruding like a sharks dorsal fin stood a stacked array of minitorpedoes on a pivoting dolly for ease of targeting though small each missile was tipped with a powerful warhead able to pierce an armored submarine they were nicknamed subbusters by the perseuss support team the navys deep submergence unit the weapons gave the tiny rescue sub an extra advantage in hostile waters david ran a finger over the torpedoes activation control earlier that day he had been informed of the loss of taiwan to the chinese the news had kept him agitated all day how had they lost the island to the goddamn communists it was an embarrassment and a black eye to all of america if only he could have taken part in the fighting the technician came on the line sir one of your men is here he says its urgent he speak with you put him on a short pause then rolfes voice came over the radio sorry to disturb you sir but you told us to let you know if there wereum any change in your secondary objective david frowned secondary objective he had been so focused on the timetable here and on the growing drums of war that he had momentarily forgotten about jack kirkland what is it the target has vacated the zone david bit back a long curse kirkland had gone missing he knew any further details and explanations could not be discussed over an open radio ill be topside in two minutes meet me in my cabin and brief me then yes sir grimacing david shoved aside his concerns about kirkland right now he had work to finish he swept the sub around on a wingtip aligning its trajectory into the proper approach he checked the subs clock he had been underwater for almost six hours after he surfaced the perseus would be checked over and reoutfitted for the days third dive an alternate navy pilot would take the submersible down to the work site on the seabed floor then in another seven hours it would be davids shift all over again but the two pilots were not the only ones with tough schedules since the arrival of the research team and barges from maui the entire crew had been working around the clock aided by the researchers submersible and robots the sea bases support framework had already been bolted to the bottom starting this afternoon the threetiered living units and labs would be sunk to the bottom and assembled barring any mishaps david expected the entire base to be established within the next fortyeight hours and manned soon afterward he had been ordered to get this base up in four days and he would not disappoint even if it meant cracking the whip in fact earlier in the day when the research teams leader a geophysicist named ferdinand cortez objected to the strenuous pace david encouraged him to call washington it had given david great pleasure to see the mexican browbeaten by nicolas ruzickov over the satellite phone even from a step away david had heard ruzickov screaming at the scientist afterward though tensions remained acute no one questioned his orders nor his schedule again he was in sole control of this operation and he would not let anyone or anything delay its completion not the embarrassing loss of taiwan nor the mysterious disappearance of jack kirkland he would not fail ahead out of the gloom the submerged docking bay appeared david angled the sub with deft skill gliding her skids onto the submerged platform he settled the sub between the selflocking clamps as he released the controls the subs wings retracted and two cclamps snugged against the vessels ceramic sides locked and loaded he called topside locked and loaded the technician acknowledged pulling you up through the perseuss hydrophones david heard the whine of the hydraulics as the captured submersible was drawn to the surface around him the seas grew brighter until at last he surfaced saltwater sluiced over the nose cone and small waves crashed against the subs side but the vessel did not move and after a few seconds even the waves were no threat the perseus and its pilot were hauled up out of the ocean and craned onto the stern deck of the maggie chouest as soon as the platform settled to the deck the subs fiveman maintenance crew swarmed over the vessel the nose cones oring was unscrewed and the glass bubble dropped open david slid like a beaching seal onto the deck one of the crewmen offered him a hand after six hours on his belly in the cramped space his limbs were untrustworthy once on his feet david unzipped his wet suit and stretched the kinks from his muscles behind him the maintenance crew was already at work checking seals blowing the carbon dioxide scavengers piping fresh oxygen into the two flank tanks they reminded david of an indy pit crew fast efficient and coordinated david turned his back on them and found cortez aiming his way across the deck groaning david straightened right now all he wanted was a hot shower and his bunk he did not want to deal with the geophysicist he set his face to a hard scowl as the man stopped before him what is it professor from the dark circles under his eyes the man had slept little even his clothes khakis and a flannel shirt were wrinkled and worn a request commander what on this next dive i was wondering if lieutenant brentley could take a few moments and scout closer to the crystalline formation from the video feed of the previous dives weve spotted some scratches on its surface they appear too regular to be natural we think its some form of writing david shook his head any such investigation will have to wait my first priority is to get that base built and manned after that you and your scientists can begin your own investigation but it would only take a few my orders stand professor david spat out the last word as if it were an insult stay clear of the crystal until the station is built that pillar radiates a strong magnetic signature creating glitches and communication problems i will not risk the perseus just to satisfy your curiosity yes commander though the researcher backed down david spotted the contempt in the mans eyes he did not care the mexican was under his command he would do what he was told across the deck near the aft hatch one of davids subordinates was on guard he stalked up to the man wheres lieutenant rolfe in your cabin sir david nodded and ducked through the hatch he climbed two flights up to the ships flag deck he had commandeered this levels cabins for his men ahead he saw his rooms door was ajar another of his men patrolled the passageway he nodded and pushed into his cabin inside rolfe stood up david closed the door and began stripping off his wet suit so what happened to kirkland did you lose his ship no sir rolfe cleared his throat weve been monitoring the location of the deep fathom continually it still circles the kwajalein atoll so then what went wrong earlier this morning lieutenant jeffreys got suspicious about why the ship was remaining in the area for so long so he did a little checking and found jack kirklands name on a quantas passenger list leaving the atoll david kicked out of his wet suit and stood naked dammit when did he leave two days ago from the itinerary it appears he traveled to okinawa david scowled what was the bastard doing in okinawa he stalked to his cabins bathroom and twisted on the shower nozzle do we know exactly where he went no sir he had reservations at the local sheraton but he never showed up however he did book a roundtrip ticket hes due back in two days davids face darkened two more days he had been looking forward to completing this little side objective much sooner still he was impressed by his own teams resourcefulness kirkland would not escape him as busy as he was here he could wait out another two days very good mr rolfe but i want to know as soon as we have confirmation that kirklands back on his boat yes sir david tested the shower the small bathroom was filling with steam sir we have another problem the lieutenants voice was pained what is it i dont know if we have two days to wait according to handel the transmitting signal has been deteriorating he estimates a day or two until we lose contact david swung around angry i told handel to make sure the bomb remained functioning for at least two weeks he knows sir he believes one of the bombs electrical circuits may be faulty he says that chink crap is not reliable david stood there almost shaking in frustration refusing to admit defeat he pondered other options and angles he knew no plan was as foolproof as on paper improvisation was the key to a missions final success as he thought about it a new strategy formed fine then if kirklands not back in time we blow his ship anyway sir destroying his boat and killing his crew will be only our first steps in bringing kirkland down as david stood in the steamy bathroom he warmed to his new plan slowly torturing jack kirkland did have its appeal pm ryukyu university okinawa prefecture japan anyone for dinner karen asked stretching her neck her eyes were blurry from studying the computer screens i cant take any more of this to her left the tall american sat crouched over his terminal he seemed not to have heard her gabriel lets move on to symbols forty a and b certainly mr kirkland on the far side of the american miyuki remained lost in her own work busily scanning in the final few pages from the notebook processing the data had turned out to be a slow and tedious chore it had become necessary for the computer to compare each glyph to the set already catalogued karen glanced at jacks workstation two figures appeared on his screen one from his notebook and one from their own collection of glyphs the americans notebook contained only a handwritten copy of the pillars inscription drawn by the historian aboard his boat this led to a certain level of ambiguity at times like now were the two figures the same glyph karen wondered or were the subtle differences just minor discrepancies on the part of the transcriber during this process gabriel had learned to compare over two hundred loci sites on each corresponding glyph as long as there was at least a ninety percent match it was decided that the two symbols were the same a match ranking less than fifty percent was considered unique enough to be classified as a new symbol this resulted in a gray zone between fifty and ninety and so far there were three hundred paired symbols falling into this category each of these required visual inspection by the trio of humans figures forty a and forty b gabriel explained are a match at fiftytwo percent will we classify a as the same or different from b jack leaned closer to the screen its like that old childrens puzzle whats different between these two pictures miyuki piped in as she finished the last scan and leaned back the first figure has an eye drawn on it the other doesnt jack nodded and the first figure is holding up two balls the other only one he glanced at karen again she was struck at what a brilliant blue the mans eyes were they had to be contact lenses no one had eyes that blue the rest looks the same she said clearing her throat jack asked so whats the verdict folks are they different enough from one another to be two separate symbols karen shifted closer to the monitor brushing her shoulder against jacks he did not move away instead he bowed his head beside hers both concentrating on the screen im gonna dismiss the eyes as being insignificant karen said but not the differences in the number of items in the figures raised hand i think this discrepancy is significant enough to be unique over the past few days weve discovered other symbols with counting icons built into them the number of legs on a starfish the number of fish in a pelicans mouth i think this is one of those counting icons though similar to one another they are ultimately unique jack nodded satisfied with her answer gabriel please classify figure forty a and figure forty b as separate icons done shall we proceed to figures a and b karen groaned i dont know about the both of you but im starved and my eyes are aching how about a couple hours rest break i guess i could use a little dinner myself jack said all ive eaten for the past twentyfour hours has been airplane food as jack stretched karen tried not to notice the breadth of his shoulders or the way his neck muscles corded up i know a restaurant only a few blocks away they serve the best thai food around sounds good the spicier the better its tongueblistering guaranteed just the way i like it standing miyuki shooed them you two go on by yourselves theres something id like to try with gabriel are you sure karen asked miyuki nodded but her eyes traveled up the tall man as he stood once jacks back was fully turned she winked at karen im sure she said to karen with a small smile karen blushed was her attraction to jack so obvious she scolded miyuki with a consternated expression but this only widened her friends smile besides i just had thai food miyuki said louder but i know how many months its been for you the double meaning was not lost on karen her blush darkened she glared at her friend as jack called from the doorway is there anything youd like us to bring back for you miyuki oh im fine im not the hungry one here but youd better get something into karen right away will do then he was out the door karen playfully swatted at miyuki you are so wicked and you are so smitten go on make a move i already checked him out no ring not even a girlfriend and i think he sort of likes you too he does not he never even looked twice at me miyuki rolled her eyes not when you would notice it was like watching two teenagers both of you sizing each up when the others back was turned he was not checking me out miyuki shrugged and turned back to her computer karen touched her shoulder was he really like a lovesick puppy now go on give that puppys belly a rub and leave me alone for a few hours were only going to dinner uhhuh were both professionals colleagues in this matter uhhuh hes only going to be here for a couple more days uhhuh karen grew frustrated and stormed away its only dinner she called back to miyuki as she exited miyukis answer followed her uhhuh pm ryukyu university okinawa prefecture japan as they walked back from the lucky thai restaurant jack bellowed out a laugh that had the smaller japanese pedestrians glancing in his direction embarrassed he leaned closer to karen youve got to be kidding you told the president of the british anthropology society to pull his head out of his ass karen shrugged he ticked me off him and his stickinthemud ideas what does he know about the south pacific my greatgrandfather had traveled south pacific islands for decades before that man was in diapers what right did that pompous ass have in claiming my ancestor was a crackpot oh and ill bet your response set him straight he must think your entire family is nuts no wonder you had to come all the way to japan to teach karen glared up at him but jack could tell her anger was feigned i wasnt exactly expelled from canadas shores i chose to come here for my own research colonel churchward my mothers grandfather may have jumped to some ridiculous conclusions about a lost continent in the middle of the pacific but i came out here to prove that much of the accepted historical dogma of this region is wrong and with what we both have been uncovering here im beginning to think my ancestors claims may not have been so off base a lost continent he scoffed cmon jack think about it off the coast of chatan an ancient city rises from the sea and if gabriels translation of the star chambers calendar is correct it dates the construction around twelve thousand years ago during that era the seas were about three hundred feet lower than they are now who knows how many other landmasses and cities might be hidden in these waters and what of your own pillar are you saying this lost race could dive to the ocean bottom and carve letters on a crystal pyramid i dont know what im saying but after all youve shown me today im learning to see things with a more open mind karen nodded as if satisfied you really should see the ancient city and pyramids that would help convince you to be honest i wouldnt mind a trip out there if we have time ill take you its only a couple hours by boat iid like that its a date a long awkward moment arose between them they continued in silence through the universitys grounds the scent of lavender and hibiscus colored the garden paths but all jack could smell was karens jasmine perfume what was so captivating about this woman back on the deep fathom lisa had twice the physical attributes still there was something exciting about karens passion and boldness during dinner jack discovered karen was also her own woman her wit was as sharp as a knife blade while her eyes shone with constant mischief her crooked smile both mocked and enchanted over dessert he had stopped seeing jennifer and saw only karenand he wasnt disappointed were almost to the computer building karen said quietly breaking the silence was there a trace of regret in her voice jack knew he felt it in his own heart he longed to spend more than a few snatched hours with her in private he found his steps inadvertently slowing she matched his pace at the bottom of the stairs to the building she stopped and turned to him thanks for dinner i had a nice time its the least i could do for your putting me up for the night they stood too close together but neither moved we should see if miyuki has discovered anything new karen said half raising an arm to point toward the building she climbed the first step her face was now even with his their eyes met and held each other for a heartbeat longer than necessary jack leaned closer to her it was foolish inappropriate juvenilebut he could not stop he was not sure if she shared any of his feelings so he moved slowly if she pulled away he would have his answer but she maintained his gaze only her lids lowered imperceptibly he began to reach his arms around her when a voice barked from the doorway the pair were speared by a flashlights beam karen coughed in surprise and backed up a step retreating the man called out to them in japanese half turning into the flashlights glare karen answered in the same language as the light was turned aside jack saw it was one of the security men from the building what did he want he asked as the guard swung away karen turned to him miyuki warned him to watch out for us she has news karen led the way up the steps her voice grew excited drowning away the passion from a moment ago lets go jack followed both disappointed and relieved it was ridiculous to start anything with this woman especially since he was leaving in two days not that he had any rule against onenight stands though his heart was guarded he had physical needs like any other man and seldom had problems finding a willing partner during port calls but in this case he knew any brief dalliance with karen would hardly satisfy him in fact it would make matters worse he climbed the steps and passed through the doorway maybe for all concerned he thought it was best to leave their passions at the bottom of the stairs across the lobby karen waved to him from beside the elevator bay he stretched his stride to reach her just as the doors opened with the guard escorting them neither one spoke each stood in a cocoon of privacy when the doors whooshed open they hurried down the hall as they neared the door to the lab it cracked open and miyuki gestured them to hurry saying it worked come see i have all the glyphs catalogued all of them karen said jack understood her surprise it had taken them hours to reach number forty in a list of discrepancies that numbered over three hundred how had the computer scientist accomplished so much in so little time miyuki didnt respond instead when they had accompanied her into the lab and to her computer station she pointed to the screen symbols were flashing past gabriel is rechecking his data miyuki said it will take another hour to doublecheck everything for accuracy then hell try decoding the various inscriptions karen just stood there shaking her head how how did you do it as i mentioned before gabriel is an artificial intelligence program he can learn from experience while you were at dinner i had him study the first forty pairs of glyphs and incorporate why the three of us rejected or accepted various symbols as unique or not then apply those parameters to the remaining couple hundred grinning miyuki said he was able to do it he learned from our examples but hes a computer karen said jack noticed how she whispered these words as if somehow afraid of hurting gabriels feelings how can we trust that his decisions were correct instead of her words dampening miyukis glee she grew more excited because after completing this exercise hes been able to expand his rudimentary understanding of these peoples lunar calendar and dating system what do you mean karen asked still skeptical what has he learned buried in the text are hidden references to a specific site in the pacific what site i dont understand ill let gabriel explain because frankly even i have trouble understanding it miyuki glanced to the side speaking to their invisible partner gabriel please explain your calculations yes professor nakano from the celestial map and my understanding of their lunar calendar i discovered a reference to a specific location triangulated by the position of the moon the sun and the north star in the text jack was stunned by this revelation and youre able to do this even though you cant translate the language yet its all astronomy and mathematics miyuki explained numbers and the movement of the stars are really a cosmic language such information is the easiest to translate since it is a relative constant across cultures in fact when archaeologists first attempted to decipher the hieroglyphics of ancient egypt the first thing they understood were the egyptians mathematics and celestial designations miyuki pointed to the scrolling glyphs the same is true here so what did you find karen asked impatient in the pyramids inscription miyuki said there are two references each mentions the same site in the pacific gabriel bring up the map on the second monitor and highlight the location for us a map of the pacific appeared on the small screen jack had a flash of déjà vu it reminded him of a similar discussion aboard his own ship when george had related the mysteries of the dragons triangle jack assumed the mysterious site from the inscription was going to be the location of the crystal pillar but instead a small red blinking dot bloomed farther south on the map just north of the equator gabriel zoom in on the location three hundred times normal the map swelled sweeping deep into the south pacific islands once so tiny they could not be seen grew in size until names could be read satawal chuuk pulusuk mortlock they were all islands of micronesia the red dot was positioned at the southeastern tip of one of them it was pohnpei the capital of the federated states of micronesia karen sat up straighter gabriel can you pinpoint the location in any finer detail though jack had known karen less than a day he sensed that she was on to something the other islands of micronesia faded off the screen as the outline of pohnpei filled the monitor individual villages and towns grew clearer the blinking red marker hovered near the islands southeast coastline jack leaned toward the screen he could just make out a name written beside the red marker what does that say karen remained stiff in her seat she was hardly looking at the screen its nan madol jack glanced over at her a village ruins she answered one of the most spectacular set of megalithic ruins in all the south pacific the site covers eleven square miles of coastline an engineering marvel of canals and basalt buildings she turned toward him to this day no one knows for sure who built them jack sat back and nodded to the neighboring screen where the glyphs continued to scroll maybe now we do i have to know more karen said grabbing miyukis sleeve the computer scientist frowned im sorry thats all i have after gabriel doublechecks his own work itll still take at least a day to begin any significant decoding with these new additions the total number of individual glyphs is now over five hundred and the list of compound glyphs has grown into the range of ten thousand this is no easy language how long do you think itll take karen asked breathless try me late tomorrow afternoon miyuki said i might and i repeat mighthave something then a whole day karen groaned what am i going to do for a whole day jack knew the anthropologist needed something on which to focus her energy how about your promise to me karens brows bunched up not understanding the ancient city off the coast of chatan you promised to tour me through there she brightened but not for the reason jack had hoped youre right if the ruins of nan madol are referenced some other clues may still be hidden out at chatan its worth investigating again and this time out youll have better company than me miyuki added a strong man to guard your back karen looked at jack as if finally seeing him again oh in her green eyes jack recognized her burning passion for this newest mystery he searched for something morebut came up empty he smiled weakly so much for romance on the run august am salvage site of air force one central pacific david spangler glided his submersible in a slow dive around the steel support base of the deepsea research station each of the frames four alloy legs were solidly bolted to the seabed floor with tenfootlong metal spikes none of the stout legs even budged when the first section of the fourton research station settled atop the landing base looking good from up here a topside technician radioed to him hows it looking down there david continued his survey the laboratory had the appearance of a twentymeterwide white doughnut sitting on a raised platter he dove underneath the section craning his neck to make sure the piece was properly seated then keyed his transmitter all clear perfect landing ill unhook the winches and lines david goosed his thrusters and swung around aiming for the four thick cables that had been used to lower and guide the laboratory section into place no need were getting good video from the rovs commander our team has practiced this a thousand times all we need you to do is monitor from there on the seabed floor david watched as a pair of boxy robots slowly lurched forward churning up silt behind them the pair named huey and duey were remotely operated by the topside technicians they set about the task of latching the first section to its support base over the next day the team would lower the other two sections secure them together one atop the other and then evacuate the water from the drowned labs the plan was to pressurize the facility to one atmosphere exactly matching the surface pressure thus allowing the scientists to journey up and down in their own submersible without the need to decompress so far everything was proceeding smoothly david had to give some credit to the mexican leader of the research team with a fire lit under his ass cortez ran a tight ship himself as such perhaps the scientist deserved a bone tossed in his direction since yesterday cortez had not stopped nagging him for a closer peek at the crystal pillar perhaps it was time to oblige him a little after giving the developing station one final pass david circled out in a widening spiral about fifty yards away rested the graveyard of air force one many of its parts still strewn across the seabed floor in the distance giant flattopped seamounts shadowed the site while surrounding it all lay the twisted forest of lava pillars david could not imagine a more inhospitable place on earth he pushed the throttles on his sub and swept toward the wreckage site in the center the strange crystal obelisk thrust up from the seabed floor he gave it a wide berth in the perseus still nervous about getting too close to the giant structure that had demonstrated such odd properties during kirklands dives even from ten yards away he could appreciate its size the top of the spire disappeared into the inky gloom far overhead hovering in place david guided his lights along its length its faceted surface seemed to absorb his lamplight and cast it back tenfold undoubtedly a marvel and if his boss was correct also potentially one of the worlds most powerful energy sources with care david maintained his distance using the touchpad on his video monitor he zoomed in on the crystalline surface tiny scratches focused into row after row of small figures and geometric shapes etched and shining silver his eyes grew wide it was writing goddamn you kirkland he mumbled what was that sir nothing continue securing the station david thumbed off the transmitter he needed to think jack kirkland had not mentioned writing on the crystal in any of his reports and david knew hed been close enough to see this he couldnt have missed it the silver symbols practically glowed on the crystalline surface so why hadnt he reported it what was he up to david gripped the throttles tightly what else was jack kirkland keeping secret every instinct in him screamed with suspicion on his touchpad he activated his private encrypted line to the surface he had it implemented after running into problems communicating directly with his team through an open channel it was answered immediately by his secondincommand what is it sir rolfe we may have a problem i need access to all communication into and out of the deep fathom since it first arrived here sir we didnt tap the ships communication system i know that but its a goddamn boat any telephone communication wouldve passed through a traceable satellite system we may not know what he said but i want to know who he said it to yes sir ill put jeffreys on it right away im coming topside immediately i want some answers by the time im on deck aye commander david switched channels and hailed the subs technician he repeated his plan to surface earlier than scheduled get brentley suited up he finished brusquely the lieutenant can finish babysitting the robots down here without waiting for an assent david flicked off the radio and blew the ballast on his sub he shoved both throttles forward the perseus shot upward its thrusters whining as they were fully engaged what was kirkland up to am off the coast of yonaguni island with the sun hovering above the eastern horizon jack stood behind the wheel of the sleek nineteenfoot boston whaler ill be damned he muttered as he cut the motor and glided around the headlands of yonaguni island ahead the small coastal city of chatan lay nestled along the shore a ramshackle village of cheap hotels and seaside restaurants but it was not the town that captured jacks attention it was the pair of terraced pyramids towering above the waves offshore amazing isnt it karen said beyond the pyramids more of the ancient city appeared basalt columns roofless homes sharpedged obelisks worn statues the city spread toward the horizon fading into the morning mists amazing hardly describes this sight jack said you told me what to expect but to see it his voice dwindled away in awe finally he settled back into the pilots seat and throttled up it was worth the hassle getting here i told you it was karen remained standing as the boat sped toward the city her hair blowing back her cheeks rosy in the wind as the boat bounced through the chop her figure was framed in sea spray jack studied his companion from the corner of his eye at the port of naha he had spent an aggravating hour scrounging up this boat with the islands us military bases at full alert because of the chinese sea traffic had been congested and chaotic jack was forced to pay an outrageous rental fee for the day use of his boat luckily they took his american express still as he watched karen he knew the trip was definitely worth the hassles as they neared the first pyramid jack cut the engine and slowed the boat into a gentle glide karen settled into her own seat once you see this city how can you not believe that a prehistoric people once lived among these islands she waved her arm to encompass the spread of ruins this is not the work of early polynesians another people an older people built this along with the many other megalithic ruins dotting the pacific the canal city of nan madol the lattes stones of the mariannas the colossal burden of tonga if these ancient people were so skilled what happened to them karen grew thoughtful eyes glazed i dont know some great cataclysm my greatgrandfather believed from studying mayan tablets that a larger continent once existed in the middle of the pacific he called it muafter the hawaiian name for this lost continent your greatgrandfather colonel churchward she smiled back at him he was consideredwell eccentric in most respectable scientific circles ah jack rolled his eyes karen scowled goodnaturedly at him regardless of my ancestors eccentricities myths of the lost continent persist throughout the pacific islands the indians of central and south america named these lost people the viracocha in the maldive islands they are the redin their word for ancient people even the polynesians speak of wakea an ancient teacher who arrived in a mighty ship with massive sails and oarsmen across the pacific there are just too many stories to dismiss it out of hand and now here we have another clue a sunken city rising again but this is just one city not a whole continent karen shook her head twelve thousand years ago these seas were about three hundred feet shallower many regions now underwater would have been dry land back then still that doesnt explain the disappearance of a whole continent wed know about its presence even if it was under three hundred feet of water thats just it i dont think the continents disappearance was due only to a change in the water table look at this city an earthquake shoved this section of coastline up while in alaska the entire aleutian chain of islands sinks there are hundreds of other such stories islands sinking or rising so you think some great cataclysm broke up this continent and sank it exactly around the same time twelve thousand years ago we know a great disaster occurred a time of major worldwide climatic changes it happened suddenly mastodons were found frozen on their feet with grass in their bellies flowers were found frozen in midbloom one of the theories was that a massive volcano or series of volcanoes erupted casting enough smoke and ash into the upper atmosphere that it caused dramatic climatic shifts if such an extreme seismic event truly happened perhaps the quakes were bad enough to break up and sink this lost continent as jack listened he remembered the crystal column six hundred meters under the sea could this have once been dry land he wondered a part of karens lost continent he pondered her theories they seemed farfetched but still karen glanced at him blushing sorry i didnt mean to bend your ear like that but ive been buried in books and historical texts all week it helps to voice some of my theories aloud well theres no doubt youve been doing your homework im just following up on my greatgrandfathers research she turned her attention forward he may have been crazy but if we can decode the language here i believe well have our answer one way or the other jack heard the frustration in her voice he wanted to reach out to her to reassure her but he kept his hands on the boats wheel the best way to assist her was to help solve this mystery as he glided up to and between the two pyramids he put karens theories together in his mind a lost continent sunk during an ancient cataclysm an ancient seafaring race who demonstrated mysterious powers and at the center of it a crystal unlike anything seen before as much as he tried to dismiss it all he sensed that karen was on the right track still a critical question remained unanswered how did any of this explain the downing of air force one he had no answer himself but he knew this intriguing woman was closer than any of them to solving it for now he would follow her lead a whining roar cut above the rumble of their boats engine it drew their attention around low in the sky a military jet sped toward them jack recognized its silhouette as it shot past and screamed south an f tomcat from one of okinawas military bases frowning karen followed the path of the plane this war is gonna get ugly she said am aboard the maggie chouest central pacific david stormed into his cabin two men jumped to their feet at his arrival ken rolfe his secondincommand and hank jeffreys the teams communications officer in the center of the cabin the table was covered with various communication tools two satellite phones a gps monitor and a pair of ibm laptops trailing both modem cables and tlines what have you learned david demanded rolfe visibly swallowed sir weve traced all telephone communication from the deep fathom from the clustered worktable he found a sheet of paper and looked at it saying calls were sent to first credit bank of san diegoa private residence in the suburbs of philadelphiaan apartment building in kingston jamaicaa qantas airline office on kwajalein atoll and rolfe looked up at david several calls to ryukyu university on okinawa david held out his hand for the list rolfe passed it to him we have it correlated by date and time very good david scanned the list to the bottom ryukyu university a womans name was listed with the connection karen j grace phd do we know who this woman is rolfe nodded we connected to the universitys internet site and downloaded a fact sheet on dr grace shes an associate professor of anthropology visiting from vancouver whats her connection to kirkland rolfe flicked a nervous glance at jeffreys weve been working on that sir we noticed the first communication between the deep fathom and the university was the day after the ship sailed from here any idea why kirkland was calling this woman actually thats what we were just working on when you arrived it seems it was not the deep fathom that made the initial contact call but the other way around she called him david frowned lowering the sheet of paper she called him yes sir we found it suspicious too so lieutenant jeffreys spent the last half hour gaining access to all email coming and going from the ship it took a bit of time to convince their isp to allow us access rolfe swung one of the laptop computers around so its screen faced david we downloaded the email there were five exchanges between the two parties david leaned his palms on the table and bent nearer the computer rolfe continued all the mail dealt with some cryptic language david slammed his fist against the table i knew it the bastard did discover the inscription reaching over rolfe clicked on one of the emails the page opened up on the screen heres a bit of the language it seems the naval historian aboard the deep fathom had blanketed the internet news boards inquiring about the origins of this language on the screen david stared at the five tiny icons included in the email he recognized their similarity to what he had seen below and this professor from okinawa responded to the inquiry yes sir she answered saying she had more examples of the language and wanted to meet so kirkland went out there the bastard is investigating this lead thats not all sir david turned from the computer screen what else youd better read her response yourself rolfe clicked open a second piece of mail david leaned over and read the message as he scanned the email it was clear the woman knew more than she was willing to divulge but one item caught his eye she hinted at the discovery of a crystal that exhibited unusual properties he straightened up goddamn it she must have some of our crystal thats what we thought too if she has some of it our mission here is compromised no one was supposed to know of the crystal deposit if kirkland goes blabbing about it and they have a sample of the crystal davids voice trailed off this was bad he waved his men away clear out i need to talk to ruzickov aye sir both men quickly left the cabin alone david crossed to his bunk and pulled out his personal scrambled phone it was late evening in washington but he knew this information was too vital to sit on overnight he opened a channel and keyed in the number for the head of the cia with the escalating tensions between the us and china he suspected that the director would still be in his office he was not wrong ruzickov here sir its commander spangler i know who it is the director snapped at him even over the encrypted line david could hear the exhaustion in the mans voice what do you want i have a war about to erupt out here yes sir ive been following the reports nicolas ruzickov sighed its worse than in any reports the chinese know of the presidents intention to seek a declaration of war its chaos out there the chinese navy has already secured a blockade around taiwan from batan island to the south and swinging full around the taiwanese coastline david gripped the phones receiver tighter and our forces the uss john c stennis is already in the region just awaiting word from us but with tensions so high out there the whole mess could explode before washington officially responds as you can imagine im up to my neck with problems so your call had better be important enough to interrupt me i think it is sir the security of this site may be compromised david related the discovery of the communication between kirklands ship and university on okinawa if other parties gain wind of the crystals properties we could lose our edge here ruzickovs voice lost its exasperated tone you were right to bring this to my attention david was impressed by the mans ability to switch gears so smoothly from one crisis to the next the cia director quickly put together a game plan it seems this professor knows more than we do i want you to fetch her convince her to join our team but more importantly her crystal sample must be confiscated this is a black priority yes sir i understand black priority were the code words to unleash omega team with lethal force there was no higher designation for a mission do you truly understand commander if the tensions out east turn to war we may need a secret weapon the equivalent of the atomic bomb during world war two we cannot let this discovery fall into foreign hands and with okinawa only a stones throw from the battlelines being drawn out there i dont want that crystal sample anywhere near there dont worry sir i will see to it personally do so it sounded like ruzickov was about to sign off david spoke quickly what about jack kirkland ruzickov sighed i told you this is a black priority mission no word must leak out about what were doing silence him however you must david smiled grimly im already on it sir dont fail me commander the phone line went dead david slowly lowered the receiver and clicked its case closed he sat for a moment with his palm resting atop the case black priority his blood thrilled with those two words he savored them for a moment then stood up he crossed to the cabin door opened it and barked an order to his man in the hall fetch lieutenant handel tell him to bring the detonation transmitter with a nod the man hurried away david closed the door and leaned his back against it he would bring a whole shitload of hurt down upon kirklands head he thought and he knew where to strike first at the mans heart and soul at the deep fathom pm aboard the deep fathom east of the kwajalein atoll it was charlie molliers turn to prepare dinner behind him the galley door to the stern deck was open but no breeze blew in to relieve the moist heat the day had started out humid and grew worse as the sun climbed into the sky in the galley with both of the stoves burners going the heat was stifling charlie though whistled in tune to the reggae music of bob marley on the tape deck beside the sink wearing onlya pair of baggy swim shorts that reached his knees he swayed slightly as he stirred his homemade gungo pea and coconut soup a family recipe the spicy steam stung his nostrils he smiled widely nothin like hot food on a hot day reaching behind him he tapped the blender its grinding roar drowned out the reggae music and margaritas of course lots of margaritas ladle in hand he spun around in sync with the chaotic melody of kitchen noises with jack gone the entire ship had relaxed enjoying the temporary reprieve and charlie was in an especially good mood the moist heat the tropical islands dotting the horizonsit was as if he were back home in the caribbean bending over he checked the oven the fruity scent of his jerked chicken rolled out as he cracked the door open perfect he said contentedly bent over he felt something goose him from behind he snapped upward with a squawk of surprise swinging around he found elvis staring up at him the german shepherd nosed charlie again a small whine rising from his throat come begging my olmon you smell ol charlies cookin and think to sneak a little mouthful he grinned at the large dog and grabbed a chicken wing from the countertop dont go telling jack now you know how he hates you begging im not supposed to encourage you he held out the treat elvis sniffed at it then backed up a step and gazed toward the open galley door charlie frowned whats wrong my olmon dont like my cookin elvis backed toward the doorway and barked at charlie whats the matter with you lisa appeared in the doorway now hes bothering you she said with a concerned look lisa was dressed in a bikini shed been sunbathing on the aft deck he woke me up when i dozed off and wouldnt leave me alone until i shoved him away charlie turned off the noisy blender must be missin jack the captains never left the ship for longer than a day before i guess from the ladder to the lower deck robert climbed into the galley is dinner ready i can smell your cooking all the way down in the bilge charlie waved him off with an exaggerated scowl your nose could smell bacon cooking from over the horizon it was an ongoing joke the young marine biologist had the most remarkable metabolic rate he ate four times his body weight every day but remained as skinny as a bamboo pole so is lunch ready robert asked hungrily eyeing the stove almost robert glanced at lisa kneeling by jacks dog is something wrong with elvis charlie shrugged missing the boss we think he was pestering me all day it wasnt until i hid in the cargo hold that he left me alone lisa stood hes been bothering all of usand i dont think its all because of jack being gone i think its something more as if understanding her elvis barked and wagged his tail he edged through the galley door then stopped and looked back at them what is it lisa asked she stepped toward elvis and the dog moved another few steps away stopping again egging her to follow him lisa turned to charlie and robert he wants something charlie rolled his eyes maybe timmys stuck down in a well the trio moved after the dog as if realizing his message had been understood elvis moved quickly leading the group up the stairs to the bridge wheres he going robert asked elvis scratched on the door lisa opened it for him and the dog dashed toward the small hatch to the communications room lisa glanced at the others with a frown then opened the hatch door must be after a rat charlie said when he was a pup he was always hunting them down better than any cat inside the small space elvis had his nose pressed against a door to a lower drawer lisa pulled it open charlie crowded next to her the drawer was full of fax paper and old receipts i dont see anything lisa said maybe he wants you to fax a note to jack robert joked elvis nudged between charlie and lisa he began pawing at the drawer whining in the back of his throat his digging became more vigorous okay olmon let me help you charlie shouldered the dog aside and pulled free the drawer he set it on the floor but elvis ignored the drawer and had his nose pointed into the empty space in the cabinet charlie knelt on hands and knees and peered inside but it was too dark pass me a flashlight robert grabbed one from the bridge and tossed it to lisa who passed it to charlie with his cheek close to the deck charlie probed the light into the dark space if theres a rat in here he warned then the light reflected off something hidden in the dead space beneath the drawers steel runners oh shit what is it lisa asked charlie swore under his breath leaning closer he ran his light over the array of electronics perched atop a nest of tiny gray cubes red led lights blinked at him i think ive found elviss rat pm ruins off the coast of yonaguni karen sipped from her water bottle as they rested inside a roofless building among the chatan ruins stories of a lost continent in the pacific arent limited just to the islands she continued snugging her water bottle into her pack during the period of the chinese warring states ancient stories describe a huge land mass in the pacific named peng jia a place supposedly inhabited by a people who could fly and who lived forever uhhuh her companion responded karen looked at jack who leaned out one of the windows he soaked his handkerchief with cold seawater then sat on the windowsill draping the wet cloth over his sweaty face they had been clambering among these ruins all day going from one site to another stopping only for a cold lunch of bread and cheese so far their search had proved fruitless they had found a handful of barnacleencrusted pieces of pottery and broken bits of statuary but no further evidence of writing or crystals just rock and more rock the ravages of sea sand and currents had erased everything but the basalt bones of this ancient city tired she asked realizing her litany of stories were probably falling on deaf ears by now she sat down on the wide sill beside him sorry to take up your whole day maybe it would be best if we headed back she checked her watch hopefully miyuki has made some headway on the translations jack pulled the wet handkerchief from his face and smiled theres nothing to apologize for youve opened my eyes on a past i never knew existed out here ive traveled these seas in search of treasures for over a decade but never heard a tenth of these stories thanks for listening jack stood but youre right we should be heading back karen glanced out the window dusk was falling long shadows crept across the waters she nodded jack helped her stand his grip firm on her hand they crossed over to the buildings entrance where their motorboat was docked jack worked the rope loose while karen tossed her backpack into the stern rope in hand jack suddenly froze did you hear then he was flying across the small room tackling her to the hard floor stay down she heard it too a highpitched whistle that was growing louder she lifted her head what is it rockets he hissed straddling her what then the world exploded with a crashing roar jack rolled off her and peeked out the window karen joined him off to the south she saw a billow of smoke and bits of rock climb high into the sky as they watched another explosion blew apart one of the basalt statues far to the west a stone hand flew across the setting sun whats happening karen asked cringing overhead a military jet streaked south united states markings twin streams of fire bloomed as a pair of missiles were launched from the jets underbelly screaming across the darkening sky other jets shot past one winging low across the islands trailing smoke jack pulled karen back down something tells me the blockade around taiwan just exploded together they crawled to a window the southern horizon glowed as if a new sun were rising wed better get clear of here another explosion erupted nearby quickly followed by another karens ears rang with the echoing roars as she scrambled to her feet out the window the twilight sky was streaked with ribbons of smoke they moved back to the door damn it jack muttered their motorboat untethered a moment ago had drifted several yards away he shrugged out of his own pack and kicked off a boot ill fetch it karen grabbed his elbow as he teetered on one foot another telltale whistle pierced their ears much louder this time jacks eyes were huge as he glanced at her together they leaped away from the doorway and rolled behind sheltering walls karen screamed as the blast shook the walls and dust showered her the roar of the detonation seemed endless jack scuttled to her side his lips moved but she could not make out his words a huge boulder landed in the next room crashing down as the echoes faded she could finally hear jacks words okay it was a near hit but were safe she nodded her eyes blurry with tears he helped her up this time she remained in the shelter of his arms they returned to the door jack kicked off his other boot ill just grab the boat and well get our asses out of the line of fire karen groaned as they reached the threshold oh no his grip tightened on her the squat building across the canal was a blasted ruin smoke was so thick it was hard to see clearly the force of the explosion had blown the boat right back to their doorway they could easily clamber back in but the boat was quickly filling with water huge rocks had pelted it punching holes through its hull gas leaked in a slow spray from its ruptured outboard tank now what karen asked jack shook his head more explosions erupted but farther south jack pulled karen to his side sit down they sank to the stone floor leaning against the wall each explosion trembled the stones karen found herself leaning less on the wall and more on jacks arm for a half hour they listened beyond the window full night descended the whistle of rocket fire and dull rumblings continued but now far to the south jack finally spoke i think maybe theyre done with us just retaliatory strikes harassing fire meant to intimidate i think well be okay well hole up here tonight in the morning ill swim to chatan and get help karen shivered with his words the chinese i think theyll leave us alone now jack got up and crossed to the doorway ill keep watch karen stood and joined him she kept near his shoulder with the night already cold she could feel the heat radiating from jacks body and leaned closer the dark sky was foggy with smoke a jet sped past to the west karen followed its course with worry movement closer at hand caught her eye glancing to the sea beyond the ruins she spotted a brief glint of starlight on metal whats that she asked squinting what she pointed jack squinted then fished her binoculars out of her pack he stared through them for a few seconds and scowled great what is it conning tower chinese sub now i know why they were bombarding the ruins covering fire as it crept beyond the blockade i spotted some type of special forces team loading into a pontoon why what are they doing probably being sent in for surveillance and sabotage he lowered the binoculars how good a swimmer are you cold terror trickled through her veins i was on the universitys intramural swim team but that was ten years ago good enough were getting out of here off in the distance silent explosions bloomed in fiery flowers well be okay he promised through the rumbling explosions karen heard a sound much closer a scuff of rock she swung around and was startled to see a dark stranger standing in the doorway jack he spun moving like a lion the man leveled a pistol at him even in the gloom karen recognized the tattoo on the mans forearm a coiled snake with ruby eyes am washington dc a knock on the door woke lawrence nafe he pushed to one elbow what is it he asked blearily he glanced to the clock on the nightstand it was not even six the door swung partly open sir he recognized the voice and felt a twinge of misgiving nicolas the cia director had never called upon him in his bedroom whats gone wrong nicolas ruzickov entered the room pausing at the threshold im sorry to disturb you and the first lady but nafe rubbed his eyes melanie is still down in virginia for the dedication of some damned statue what do you want ruzickov closed the door firmly behind him the chinese have attacked okinawa what nafe sat up and switched on a lamp in the light he saw that the director was wearing the same suit as the night before ruzickov moved farther into the room weve just received word of skirmishes between their forces and ours along the ryukyu island chain who shot first all our reports claim the chinese and what are the chinese saying that we attempted to break their blockade of taiwan and they were defending great just greatand which is true sir between us and these four walls who pulled the first trigger ruzickov glanced at a chair nafe waved him into it the cia director sat down with a long sigh does it matter the chinese know of our intention to push for a formal declaration of war if they mean to hold the region okinawa is the closer and more significant threat theyve been bombarding the island with missile fire and the damage a few strikes uninhabited areas so far our new patriot missiles are doing a satisfactory job of protecting the island nafe eyed his cia director what are we going to do the joint chiefs have already convened in the situation room awaiting your order nafe got out of bed and paced the room with this newest aggression directed against our forces in the pacific he stared pointedly at ruzickov unprovoked of course that is the way all newscasts will report it he nodded then we should have little political opposition to a formal declaration of war no sir nafe stopped before the mantel of the cold fireplace ill address the joint chiefs but i want congress fully behind this declaration i dont want another vietnam ruzickov stood ill make sure all is in order nafe clenched a fist if need be well bring this war to beijing its about time we instilled the fear of god into the chinese people thats all they respond to sir strength we cannot show weakness nafe scowled and neither will we show them mercy pm ruins off the coast of yonaguni crouched jack eyed the snub end of the pistol pointed at his chest in a fraction of a second he quickly calculated the odds of disarming their assailant he would have to take a bullet there was no way around it but he could still tackle the smaller man and probably knock the gun away but what then depending on where he was hit could he keep the man down long enough for karen to grab the weapon and what if there were others hes the leader of the group that attacked us before karen whispered beside him hands half raised recalling karens stories jack leaned closer to her i can take him outbut be ready how can i help he was surprised by karens resolve this woman was no wilting flower a distraction before any plan could be set in motion the man acted first come wit me he whispered in stilted english we must leave here danger he lowered his gun and holstered it at his waist jack straightened from his half crouch suspicious he looked with confusion toward karen who wore a matching expression do we trust this guy he asked she shrugged he didnt shoot us the man disappeared through the low doorway into the roofless buildings rear chamber jack glanced behind him distant explosions continued to echo across the water through the window the glow of fires dotted the southern horizon karen nodded toward the grim view its not like we have a lot of choices here maybe we should go jack joined her yeah but did you ever hear the expression out of the frying pan into the fire she waved him through the doorway then by all means you go first jack ducked through the low door and found the stranger standing by another window his back to them beyond the window a small dark boat floated in the lapping waters as jack moved nearer he recognized it as a sampan one of the ubiquitous fishing vessels of the eastern seas made of wood it was short and narrowbeamed with its stern half covered in a frame of bamboo and tattered tarpaulin two other men were aboard the sampan one held the mooring line and kept glancing nervously to the south chinese come the leader said indicating that jack should board the vessel we take you to okinawa karen joined jack and gave him a gentle nudge we could always jump overboard if theres trouble gathering his pack in one hand jack climbed over the stone sill the man with the mooring line offered him a hand of support but jack ignored it instead he dropped to the boat and eyed the men darkskinned and short they were clearly south pacific islanders but he could not place where exactly he noticed that both men wore holstered weapons with a moan of complaint karen landed beside him she grabbed his elbow as the boat shifted under her weight he steadied her but she kept her grip on him okay now what behind them a few terse words were passed between the leader and his men before he climbed in to join them once aboard he waved for karen and jack to follow him under the overhang the other two men used long paddles to push away and propel them between the buildings jack now understood how he had been ambushed the sampan moved silently through the waters its dark wood matching the sea as they glided jack searched for the chinese submarine it was gone as was the pontoon full of armed men they could be anywhere for close to twenty minutes the sampan slowly drifted among the ruins moving skillfully through the dark no one spoke distant thunder warned of the war to the south at last two large structures towered to either side the chatan pyramids from his spot under the overhang jack allowed himself a sigh of relief they were almost free of the ruins rifle fire suddenly tore through the tarpaulin fabric bullets chewed into the old wooden sides of the boat jack pulled karen to the floor shielding her the leader yelled orders a motor at the stern suddenly roared jack felt the bow end lift as the prop dug into the water the sampan lurched forward a small explosion blew not far from the stern a column of water flumed up grenade hurry he urged silently rifle fire continued to pepper the boat the leader busy with the rudder leaned toward jack he held out his pistol offering it jack hesitated then took it the man pointed to the bow jack crawled forward jack karen warned stay down ill be right back jack inched his way toward the other two men who crouched with pistols in hand when he reached them he silently pantomimed that they should wait for his signal free of the shelter there was a light breeze jack listened as rifle fire pelted the starboard rail over his head digging away chunks of teak he waited for a pause in the attack when it happened he jerked up firing blindly in the direction of the rifle blasts the other two followed suit jack fired for a count of five then ducked down again the other two men followed his lead covering his head the next barrage was less riotous most shots whizzed by harmlessly by now the sampan had gained sufficient speed to race and bounce away jack stayed down when they were past the range of the rifles the men tentatively stood jack rolled to his feet and slipped under the overhang he found karen sitting up eyes worried you okay he asked she nodded the leader met jacks gaze they stared at each other quietly for a moment then jack handed the pistol back the man took the weapon slipped it back into its holster and waved them to a worn teak bench karen sat down but jack remained standing he wanted answers who are you he asked i am mwahu son of waupau why did you help us this earned a scowl from the man elders say we must to punish us we failed our great ancestor failed to do what jack jerked a thumb in karens direction failed to kill her and her friend last week jack karen cautioned him under her breath mwahu leaned on the rudder glancing away we want to hurt no one only to protect it is our duty i dont understand karen said softly protect who the man remained silent who jack repeated he raised his eyes to the roof protect the world oldest teachings say that none must disturb the stone villages or a curse will come to destroy us all he glanced back toward the fires near the horizon already the curse comes jack leaned toward karen do you recognize any of his mumbo jumbo she shook her head but kept her eyes on the leader mwahu tell me more about these teachings whose are they the words of our great ancestor horonko were written long ago only elders read it elders of which island where is your home no island home he cast an arm to encompass the open seas here is our home the ocean he frowned and turned his back on karen no mwahu i no speak no more of it the elders tell me to help you i help you jack interrupted why did they tell you to the islander fingered the coiled serpent tattoo elder rauren says you cannot put poison back into snakes fang once it bites he lowered his arm signaling the end to this discussion killing the snake no good only help can save you in other words karen whispered to jack the cats out of the bag the wrong cant be undone what wrong jack asked something about us taking the crystal out of the pyramid he frowned everything keeps coming back to the crystal if his elders have some ancient text that warns about these ruins it must have come from the same era in which they were built karen stood up excited mwahu can you read any of the ancient writings he glanced at her some my father was an elder he teach me before he die karen shuffled in her pack for pen and paper moving closer to mwahu she held the paper to the deck and scrawled a crude rendition of a few of the symbols he leaned over one hand still on the long wooden rudder can you read any of this she asked as he stared at it his breathing became harder and his eyes widened then abruptly he ripped it from the deck crumpled it and tossed it into the sea it is forbidden he said between clenched teeth karen backed away from his vehemence and sat down it must be the same language she said to jack but clearly theres some taboo about putting it to paper maybe its their attempt to maintain the languages secrecy she was thoughtful for a moment youre probably right but ive never heard of any island sect like this why the mystery what were his ancestors warning against jack shook his head who knows perhaps there might be an answer in the inscriptions if we could get mwahu to help us it might accelerate our work that is if you can trust anything this man says karen sighed he seems sincere enough and he clearly believes what he said just because he believes it doesnt make it true i suppose still its a place to begin she leaned back her eyes glazing as she stared out at the sea sighing he leaned back too but ignored the view and kept a wary watch on the three men aboard the boat they might claim to want to help but considering karen and miyukis encounters with them he knew they could be dangerous the rest of the journey was made in silence soon the lights of nahas harbor could be seen ahead even from a mile out it was apparent that the island was in turmoil the us base on the south side of the harbor was lit up like times square planes of all sizes circled the island while the waters ahead were thick with military vessels jack and karen moved to the bow she pointed one of the government buildings was now a cratered and smoking ruin rocket strike jack commented karens eyes widened miyuki he took her hand in his im sure shes fine the university is inland away from the most likely targets besides she has thirtynine us military bases protecting her karen did not look convinced en route to the island their own boat was stopped twice and searched before it was allowed to proceed jack was glad to see the trios weapons taken from them during the first search he had tried to urge karen to abandon these islanders and board the military cutter but she refused mwahu might hold the only key to this language shed mumbled i cant lose him so they remained on the sampan as it glided through the harbor to the marina they moored and climbed onto the docks a japanese officer checked their papers jack was surprised to see the pacific islanders produce tattered and weathered passports when the officer handed back all their papers he spoke to them in english you picked a poor time to go sightseeing weve had a flood of refugees from the south were trying to divert as many to the north as possible otherwise all other civilians are being evacuated via the international airport youre evacuating the entire island jack asked or relocating them into bunkers as many as we can we dont expect fighting to reach our shores but were taking no chances another rocket barrage could occur at any time i suggest you collect your personal belongings and report to the airport karen nodded ryukyu university its already cleared out the man waved them down the dock as more makeshift crafts drifted in good luck jack led karen and mwahu toward the shore and the city mwahus two men remained with the sampan karen moved up next to jack what if miyuki is already gone she asked shell be there i cant imagine her leaving her lab unless they dragged her out kicking and screaming she smiled at that without thinking jack put his arm around her karen leaned in to him tucking herself against his side no words were spoken with mwahu following they moved on through the earthquakeravaged city to where a bus still serviced the university area it was a short ride to ryukyu and a quiet walk to the computer facility once at the steps karen pointed toward the fifth floor there were no lights on then they discovered that the door to the building was locked and the lobby dark hello she called out knocking a guard appeared around a corner his flashlights beam washing across the three of them and settling on karen professor grace he said with clear relief he climbed the stairs passing mwahu with a suspicious glance with a jangle of keys he moved to the door professor nakano refused to leave until you returned is she in her lab no shes in my office weve locked down all the upper floors he opened the door and led them into the lobby guiding them with his flashlight through the dark interior from under a door ahead light glowed the guard knocked then pushed the door open miyuki was sitting at a desk the thick briefcase open before her containing a portable computer at the sight of them she burst to her feet thank god youre okay were fine karen said hugging her reassuringly what about you shaken up lots of fireworks karen noticed the portable computer what are you doing she asked i couldnt risk losing all our work so i diverted gabriel into moving all our research off site and backed up everything onto this computer just in case i also revamped the portable unit to accommodate gabriel miyuki reached out and touched a key a familiar disembodied voice arose from the tiny speakers good evening professor nakano i will continue troubleshooting our connections and interfaces to make certain all is in order thank you gabriel behind jack the south pacific islander pushed into the room glancing with suspicion toward the computer miyuki noticed him and jerked back karen put a hand on her shoulder steadying her its okay she said ill explain it all later keeping a watch on the tattooed stranger miyuki snapped the computer case closed she unhooked the cables and wound them up we need to leave i heard about the evacuation do you have the crystal miyuki frowned at her then tilted her head toward mwahu it really is okay she said hes here to help us now miyuki hardly looked convinced jack moved beside her and if it helps hes alone and unarmed she studied jack for a breath then seemed to sag the stars in my luggage she nodded toward a wheeled suitcase behind the desk i also went to your flat and collected everything i could see that you might wantincluding jacks stuff she pointed to a second suitcase we couldve done it ourselves karen said not if you want to catch a flight off this island my cousin pilots a small private jet a charter service hes agreed to get us out but we have to leave she glanced at her watch in thirty minutes jack frowned everything was moving too fast where to tokyo miyuki bit her lip no i thought it best if we leave the area entirely then where karen asked i asked him to take us to pohnpei island miyuki looked from one of them to the other i thought if we had to go somewhere why not follow the one clue in the transcription to the ruins at nan madol karen laughed fantastic i knew you were an adventurer at heart its not a bad plan jack said we can search for additional clues without being in the middle of a war zone but ill need to contact my ship first let them know the change in plans oh god in all the craziness i forgot just before i left karens apartment i received a call from your boat a charles molder charlie mollier right he seemed anxious to speak to you when did he call about half an hour ago is there a working phone around here miyuki nodded the line i was using for the computer should still be okay she hooked up a small desk phone and passed him the receiver he crouched over the desk and tapped in the deep fathoms satellite number a short burst of static briefly turned into charlies voice jack is that you yeah whats up all hells breaking loose out here and im heading to pohnpei in micronesia yeah its too long a story you still near kwajalein yeah but its not that far from pohnpei can you meet us there yeah but good ill keep you post goddamn it jack charlie burst in listen to me what jack realized he hadnt asked charlie why hed called weve got a bomb on board here it took jack a few moments to understand a bomb a goddamn bomb as in big fucking explosion how who it was planted in the radio room get rid of it oh jeez mon why didnt i think of that i may not know much about explosive devices but this baby looks boobytrapped and has an electronic receiver i aint touching it as his shock bled away jack suspected that david spangler was the culprit behind the bomb he remembered the little gift of chinese electronics spangler he hissed what one of spanglers men must have planted it in the back of his mind he wondered if this act of sabotage was simply revenge on davids part or if david had suspected that he was on to something listen charlie i dont know what youre still doing on the fathom but get everyone off and alert the authorities already working on that weve got the launch outfitted everyone is loaded up except robert and i you almost missed us get your asses out of there why did you even bother to call we were hoping you could talk us through defusing it are you insane hell its the fathom were talking about jack jack gripped the receiver tightly listen to me just a sec jack heard charlie call out then heard another voice faintly in the background it was robert the lightits blinking more rapidly oh god jack yelled into the phone charlie get out of there the receiver suddenly squelched with static standing his small hairs on end then the phone went ominously dead charlie he clicked the receiver again and again a dial tone returned savagely he tapped in the code for the deep fathom again goddamn it karen stood behind him jack whats wrong he didnt answer he listened as the satellite connection fed through but all he got as an answer was a screech of white noise then nothing again he lowered the phone he was numb all over fearing the worst he prayed it was just the connection frizzing out but in his heart he knew he was wrong he had heard the panic in roberts voice jack karen placed a hand on his shoulder he slowly lowered the receiver into its cradle ii think someone just blew up my ship pm aboard the maggie chouest central pacific its done gregor handel said im reading nothing from the deep fathom not even a mayday shes tits up sir perfect david lowered the headset from his ears earlier rolfe had succeeded in breaking the fathoms globalstar code allowing them to tap into the transmitted call using the headphones david had eavesdropped on the final phone conversation between jack and his ship he placed the headset on the table what could be better he said jack knew it was me he heard his fucking ship explode and he knows his crew was still on board rolfe spoke from his station ive got the port authority of kwajalein do you want me to send a helicopter to confirm wait about an hour ideally we dont want any survivors handel made a scoffing noise with that much c almost a pound theres a kill zone of a good hundred yards nothing couldve survived davids grin grew wider well done men he reached under the table and pulled out a bottle of dom pérignon he raised the bottle to the perfect execution of this mission execution is right rolfe said with a smirk of satisfaction david stood and twisted the cork free of the bottle it popped and shot across the cabin as the champagne frothed over the neck he lifted the bottle high and this is only the first step in bringing kirkland down pohnpei august am pohnpei island the federated states of micronesia karen sat in the spacious cabin of the private learjet as it taxied across the tarmac of pohnpeis airport outside a fine misty rain drizzled down muting the views of the jungledraped peaks of the south pacific island as the plane turned the islands most prominent feature came into view sokehs rock a towering volcanic plug overlooking kolonia harbor nicknamed the diamond head of micronesia its beautiful miyuki said beside her leaning closer her friend clearly exhausted had slept most of the way only awakening as the plane began to land karen however had not been able to sleep neither had jack she stared across the cabin he still sat stiff in his seat barely noticing the passing scenery mwahu sat slumped beside him snoring earlier after boarding the plane jack had spent a few frantic hours trying to discover the fate of his ship by the time he reached someone in authority who would listen he was informed that a search helicopter had already been sent out to investigate so they were forced to wait jack had paced up and down the cabin clenching and unclenching his fists when the report finally came in it was not good lit by a burning pool of oil the debris from the ship had been easy to spot after the news jack had not spoken a word hed crossed to the cabins bar poured himself a couple fingers of whiskey downed it and repeated it two more times until karen coaxed him back to his seat and there he had sat just staring unblinking at first she had tried to engage him in conversation but his only response was cold and savage im going to kill that bastard so she returned to her seat watching the world pass beneath her it had been a monotonous journey until they reached their destination before landing the jet circled the island pohnpei was roughly thirteen miles across encircled by a protective ring of coral reefs creating an island of lagoons and mangrove swamps inland its mountainous interior was all rain forests streams waterfalls and steep cliffs studying the circular island from above karen had hoped to spot pohnpeis other wellknown feature the seaside ruins of nan madol but the mists had been too thick on the southeast side of the island miyuki settled back in her seat as the jet taxied toward the terminal she nodded toward jack is he going to be okay itll take time i think karen knew jack bore a lot of guilt it was etched in the lines on his face and the hollowness in his eyes as the plane rolled to a stop miyuki unbuckled her seat belt lets get him moving try to get his mind off what happened karen nodded though she doubted it would help jacks brooding went beyond simple distraction across the cabin mwahu stretched we here yes karen said freeing herself from her seat jack had still not moved fresh sunlight entered as the aft door cracked open karen crossed the cabin as mwahu and miyuki moved toward the exit she sat down and touched jacks arm are you all right he remained silent for a few moments then spoke his voice numb it was all my faultagain first the atlantis now the fathom it wasnt your fault he didnt seem to hear her i should never have left if id been there i couldve defused the bomb and maybe you wouldve been killed with them then this spangler fellow would have truly won if what you say is right that he planted the bomb amidst the wreckage aboard the gibraltarthen youre the only one who knows the truth all hope of exposing him would be lost if you were killed what does the truth matter its not worth this cost jack finally looked directly at her karen was shocked at the pain in those blue eyes she had an urge to pull him to her chest to envelope him to hold him until the pain went away but knew any true solace could not come from her he would have to find his own way past this tragedy if you want justice for your friends she said softly but firmly youre gonna have to win it youre not gonna get it by killing spangler rage flickered through his pain then how she faced his anger and matched it by exposing the goddamn bastard jack thats how youll win she touched his knee and ill help you youre not alone in this jack you have to understand that he closed his eyes sighed and after a few moments opened them again the pain was still there but it was not allconsuming anymore she saw a glimmer of the jack she had met in the okinawa airport maybe youre right he said theres too much at stake david needs to be brought down but the only way to do it is to discover the truth about air force one i wont let him win well do it together jack nodded almost reluctantly karen sensed a critical moment had passed between them that the exseal seldom allowed anyone to share his grief or his guilt turning in his seat jack took her hand from his knee and raised it to his lips the brief touch on her skin sent an electric thrill through her thank you he whispered shocked at the sudden intimacy karen could not move jack lowered her hand in his eyes she saw a twinge of bewilderment as if the impulsive act had surprised him as much as it had her miyuki called from the doorway with a wave we need to go the two stared at each other for a silent moment lets go karen finally said we have a lot to plan am maggie chouest central pacific david stood near the stern of the research vessel behind him the last of his teams gear was being loaded into the helicopter the journey to pohnpei island would take seven hours with ruzickovs help the us embassy on the island had been alerted and expected his arrival commander spangler david swung around he had been so lost in his own plans that he hadnt heard the approach of the paunchy mexican leader of the research group what is it cortez you asked that i inform you when we were ready to evacuate the water from neptune base david cleared his throat of course are you prepared yes sir if youll join us in the command center you can oversee the process david gestured the man to lead cortez crossed to the ships superstructure and wound toward the main monitoring station on the second level the exwardroom was now a jumble of computers monitors and other equipment four other scientists were crowded into the small room but they made space for david moving out of his way with nervous glances cortez motioned david to join him before a console of monitors he tapped two of the screens here we have feeds from the two rov robots as you can see neptune is ready for the second stage david studied the assembled base it was a stack of three doughnuts one atop the other sitting on a fourlegged frame power cables and other lines wound from its top shell toward the surface he watched as one of the robots positioned another of the sites lamp poles each illumination pole was six meters surmounted by a sealed halogen spotlight twelve in all the poles were positioned around the base the dark seabed had become a welllit parking lot in the bright lights david watched the perseus piloted by lieutenant brentley slowly circle the large sea base now assembled the structure contained almost four thousand square feet of living space cortez sat down at the console watch the three center monitors im going to bring up the inner cameras one for each level of the complex murky images appeared on the screens watery views of dim rooms little detail could be discerned the only light filtered through tiny portholes along the curved walls what am i looking at david asked cortez tapped the first monitor the lowest level is solely for docking the submersibles the middle level houses the labs the top level living quarters he glanced over his shoulder at david we chose this arrangement so in case of emergency the top level could be freed manually and rise to the surface on its own there are multiple redundant safety features built throughout the complex david sighed not bothering to hide his exasperation fine are you ready to drain the complex or not certainly weve triplechecked everything then lets get this done im due to leave within the hour off to the side david caught the relieved smile pass between the two technicians it seemed his teams absence would not be missed we were just awaiting your arrival cortez busied himself at one of the computers he spoke into a microphone perseus this is topside clear for blowout i repeat clear for blowout on one of the monitors the torpedoshaped submersible banked sharply and glided away from the sea base lieutenant brentleys voice scratched from a set of speakers roger that clearing out here we go cortez said he tapped a series of buttons on his keyboard level blowing level blowing level blowing on the screens the view of the deepsea station vanished in an explosion of bubbles the visibility obscured by the roiling waters look cortez pointed to the center monitors the interior views were clearing as the water lines dropped below the level of the camera lenses within a few minutes the water drained away leaving the rooms wet but habitable interior lights flickered then blazed bringing the pressure down to one atmosphere cortez said checking hull integrity he smiled up at david green lights all around commander neptune is ready for company david clapped the mexican on the shoulder as much as he hated to admit it the man knew his job good work cortez we can take it from here commander the research leader stood up from his console i know youve been ordered away for a few days but theres no need to worry my team wont let you down it had better not david said as he turned to leave but he could not give his statement much heat cortez ran a tight ship leaving the command center david climbed down to the deck as soon as he pushed out of the airconditioned superstructure and into the heat he was met by his secondincommand rolfe was dressed in a black flight jacket were loaded and ready sir he said jeffreys just heard from our contacts on pohnpei jack kirkland and the woman landed an hour ago theyre under surveillance as we speak good everything was going well first the base now this it was as if kirkland were trying to make his job easier david thought to extract the scientist and her crystal from the growing war zone around okinawa would have been complicated but out in the backwaters of micronesia on an island sympathetic to american concerns it shouldnt be a problem everything was falling into perfect place sir jeffreys also reports that the woman has been making inquiries about hiring a boat to take them all to some ruins on the southeast side of the island david nodded overnight he had studied topographic maps of pohnpei he knew the islands entire terrain by heart when are they planning to go out there late afternoon david thought a moment and nodded there should just be enough time get me jeffreys i want a boat arranged he zipped up his jacket were going to prepare a little welcome for mr kirkland and his friends pm pohnpei island madolenihmw municipality jacks headache still pounded behind his eyes and the bumpy ride along the jungle road in an old rusted jeep cherokee wasnt helping karen sat behind the wheel squinting through the grimy window for landmarks are you sure you know where youre going miyuki asked from the rear seat a particularly large bump sent the small woman flying for the roof she swore at karen in her native language this is the right way mwahu said also in the backseat bridge to temwen island is not far so youve been to nan madol before karen asked trying to glean more information from the man sacred place i visit with father three times karen glanced at jack as if to stress the coincidence jack rubbed his temples trying to grind away the headache after landing he had finally slept a bit but the pain of the last twentyfour hours could not be alleviated with a nap while hed slept karen had hired a car and arranged for a boat to explore the ruins of nan madol because the best time to explore was at high tide they were leaving late in the day when boats could traverse the meterdeep canals otherwise at low tide it meant slogging through the ruins in kneedeep water and mud clearing his throat jack sought some way to distract himself from the pounding in his skull karen you never did tell me the full story of nan madol whats so special about this place there are many stories and myths surrounding this island she replied but the story of nan madols origin is the most intriguing according to the myth two demigods olhosihpa and olhosohpa came to the island in a great ship from some lost land with magical powers they transported the gigantic basalt logs across the island and helped the natives build the canal city some say the stone logs flew through the air jack shook his head yeah right karen shrugged of course who knows the truth for sure but mysteries remain some of the stones weigh up to fifty tons the entire complex of nan madol is composed of million tons of crystalline basalt how did it all get there jack shrugged on large rafts bamboo is great building material and theres plenty of it on the island he nodded to the rain forest out the windows karen shook her head back in researchers tried to float a oneton basalt log using every sort of raft imaginable they failed the best they could manage was a stone that weighed a couple hundred pounds so how did these unsophisticated natives move rocks weighing fifty tons and once at the site how did they lift and stack them forty feet in the air jacks brow crinkled as much as he hated to admit it the mystery was intriguing how had it been done karen continued i have no idea what the real answer is but i find the myth of the demigods interesting another story of a magical people from a lost continent jack settled back in his seat so how old are these ruins hmmthats another bit of controversy nine hundred years is the current estimate based on carbon dating on fire pits done by the smithsonian institute in the sixties but others have argued for an older date why carbondating of the fire pits only proves that it was occupied during this time not that the place was built then in the early seventies an archaeologist from honolulu using newer techniques came up with a date over two thousand years old karen shrugged so who can say for sure from the backseat miyuki shifted forward and pointed between them look karen slowed the cherokee as raw sunlight appeared ahead it was the end of the forest road finally jack murmured the view opened before them as they swung out of the forest a wide bay lay ahead sparkling in the late afternoon sunlight in the middle of the bay towered a steep mountainous island fringed by swamps from the height of the jungle road a coral reef could be seen in the shallows circling the small island mottling the blue waters in hues of rose and jade karen pointed nan madol is on the far side of temwen island facing the open ocean turning she guided the jeep down the steep grade toward a long twolane steel bridge that spanned the strait between coast and island they descended into shadows as the sun setting toward the western horizon disappeared behind the mountainous peaks of pohnpei then they were trundling across the bridge passing over coral atolls and deep blue waters karen played tour guide the harbors around here are fraught with submerged sections of other ruins columns walls stone roads even a small sunken castle back during world war two japanese divers reported discovering caskets made of pure platinum down there platinum here yep the divers brought up quite a bit of it platinum became one of the islands major exports during the japanese occupation jack eyed the water strange in fact just recently a large megalithic discovery was made in the deep waters off the east coast of nahkapw island she pointed to a speck of an island just visible near the southern horizon a submerged stone village named kahnihnw namkhet for decades natives told stories about it but it was only in the last five years that divers rediscovered it with a kidneyjarring bump the jeep left the bridge and turned onto the coastal road that circled the small island karen accelerated soon they wound out of the shadows and into the sunlight of the southern coastline ahead and below the ruins of nan madol appeared jack lowered his map stunned by the sight spreading far out into the shallow sea from the coastline were a hundred manmade islets the buildings and fortifications were all composed of basalt columns and slabs constructed similar to americanstyle log cabins framing the entire site was a gigantic sea wall also of basalt amazing he said i can see now why the place is called the venice of the pacific the ancient city spread over ten square miles with canals intersecting and connecting the entire community mangrove trees and ferns grew thickly throughout it looking down the stones of the city sparked in the sunlight reflecting off the quartz crystals in the basalt its been compared to the building of the great wall of china karen said they built the entire city atop the coral reef carving deeper channels and canals out of the reef itself theres also an extensive tunnel system connecting the various islets it was lucky the eclipseday quakes werent too bad out here it wouldve been a great tragedy to lose this historic site jack stared struck by its breadth and size its so large karen nodded and guided their vehicle down the last few switchbacks toward the citys edge thats another mystery why is it so big to support such a city would require a populace ten times larger than currently living on the island and a land area thirty times as big further evidence of your lost continent perhaps she turned into a parking lot before the entrance to the ruins parked under the shade of a large mangrove tree and switched off the engine then she turned her attention to mwahu in the backseat you said before this place was sacred to your people before we go further i want to know why mwahu stared out the open window silent for a long time then spoke slowly as if it pained him it is the last home of our ancient teacher horonko he came here to die when was this how long ago mwahu turned to face karen and jack long long ago but why did he come here karen asked because his own home was gone his own home mwahu again seemed reluctant to answer his voice became a whisper he came from katua peidi karen gasped at his answer what jack said to her puzzled according to myth she explained katua peidi was the name of the original homeland of the magical brothers who had helped build nan madol jack frowned he thinks his teacher was one of these katuans so it would seem she turned her attention back to the rear seat what did horonko teach your ancestors he teach many things mostly he teach us to guard the old places he tell us where they are word pass from father to son forbidden to speak he say none must open the heart of old places he stared hard at karen she ignored his accusing eyes and sat pondering a secret sect assigned to guard the pacifics countless megalithic ruinsby the last survivor of some lost continent she swung one more time on mwahu you say horonko died here he nodded is he buried here he nodded again and turned toward the watery ruins of nan madol i will take you but we must leave before night why jack asked karen answered instead a superstition about the ruins if someone stays among the ruins overnight it is said he will die great miyuki mumbled from the backseat eyeing the low sun its only myth karen said all their eyes swung to mwahu the man slowly shook his head pm neptune base central pacific ferdinand cortez rode as passenger aboard the researchers twoman submersible the argus the pilot seated ahead in his own acrylic dome signaled a thumbsup as he guided the vessel under the sea base and up into the entry dock on the stations underside the docking hatch sealed under them and the seawater was pumped out ferdinand watched the waterline recede down his dome the whole docking procedure took less than five minutes he smiled at his success after his wife died hed devoted all his energies to the neptune project it had been a goal he and his wife had shared a functioning deepsea research station we did it maria he whispered to the station we finally did it as the central computer calibrated the air pressure in the docking bay a green light flashed on the wall indicating it was safe to depart the argus ferdinand unscrewed the domes seal using a motorized winch the seal broke with the barest hiss of pressure differentials ferdinand smiled perfect he pushed back the dome and climbed out of the sub hauling his bag with him the pilot remained in his forward dome he had another four research members to ferry down to the deepsea station free of the sub ferdinand breathed deeply the air tasted stale but that couldnt be helped no amount of conditioning would freshen it waving a thanks to the pilot he crossed to the door and unscrewed its three latches beyond the door he found john conrad wearing a wide shiteating grin were here his friend and colleague said were on the goddamn bottom of the ocean ferdinand smiled and clapped him on the shoulder then how about a tour he asked not that he needed one the neptune had been based on his own design specs he knew every inch of the base every circuit every switch john took his bag and slung it over his shoulder cmon everyones waiting he led the way to the ladder up to the second tier of the station as john climbed electronic sensors marked his presence and opened the hatch overhead it was all automated once both men clambered up to level the hatch selfsealed another safety feature each of the tiers were sealed from one another unless a crew member was on the ladder the hatches could also be cranked shut and locked in case of power failure or a system malfunction stepping from the ladder ferdinand surveyed his domain level contained a circular series of labs marine biology geology climatology physiology even archaeology the bases tiny hospital ward also shared a wedge of this floors space the tier above this level housed the living quarters galley tiny recreation room and unisex bathroom ferdinand could not wipe the smile from his face the neptune was finally up and functioning as he passed through the labs other scientists called to him congratulating him he acknowledged the wellwishes and continued to his own wedge the geophysics laboratory john accompanied him cant stop working can you how can i especially with that pissant spangler gone hes been hobbling my work ever since we first arrived here this may be my only chance to be free of the asshole and im going to take advantage of it ferdinand settled onto a fixed stool before a smooth metal console he hit a button and like a rolltop desk the airtight seals on his station wheeled open to reveal a bank of computers monitors and tools is the perseus over by the crystal pillar he asked yep lieutenant brentley has been waiting for an hour and hes growing a bit impatient we had to argue against him collecting your sample on his own good goodi should oversee the sampling we cant risk damage to the pillar brentleys audio is on channel video feed on channel ferdinand called up the proper channels on his central monitor perseus this is neptune do you read lieutenant brentley answered aye neptune read you loud and clear just cooling my thrusters ferdinand adjusted the monitor to pick up the video feed from the deep submergence units sub he was surprised at the clarity of the image the sub faced the crystal pillar from a distance of ten yards away its faceted surface filled the screen across its smooth planes the silver etchings were plainly evident have you recorded the entire pillar aye completed and recorded just waiting to collect the sample ferdinand heard the exasperation in the mans voice i appreciate your patience lieutenant were ready to proceed try to collect a sample without marring any of the writing aye sir ive studied the pillar theres no writing near the top should i attempt a sampling there yes very good on the screen ferdinand watched the perseus circle the fortymeter length of crystal climbing toward its apex once there the image focused on the faceted top of the obelisk ill try to nip a bit off the very tip the pilots voice crackled with static as the vessel edged toward the pillar be careful as they watched the video feed began to flicker with static too the sub floated toward the pillar slower and slower it was almost as if the video feed were playing in slow motion as the sub neared its goal a titanium arm reached cautiously outward careful ferdinand warned we dont know how fragile that thing is a few jumbled words answered frosted with static oddtremblingcant hear john touched ferdinands shoulder the crystals emissions must be messing with the subs communications remember the reports from the salvage ships sub ferdinand nodded worrying that perhaps he shouldve waited until spangler had returned if the navys sub were damaged the titanium claw reached for the pillar intending to pinch the tip off the crystal it was agonizingly slow the first deepsea circumcision john mumbled ferdinand ignored his friends attempt at humor and held his breath the pincer closed on the faceted point brentleys voice suddenly came through the speakers crystal clear again i think ive the video image froze both john and ferdinand glanced in puzzlement at each other frowning ferdinand tapped the screen for a brief moment he thought he saw the submersible vanish then flicker back abruptly the video image resumed got it brentley finished on the screen the sub retreated from the pillar its titanium arm held up high a chunk of crystal in its grip he did it ferdinand said to hell with the glitches john blurted out happily a cheer arose from the crew but broke off as a fierce rattling began to shake through the base a wary hush descended ferdinand held his breath the rattling grew into a savage shaking doors rattled shelved containers tumbled sea quake john yelled cries rose from the various science stations the video connection to the perseus disappeared as the monitors screen shattered into a spiderweb of cracks john stumbled to one of the porthole windows if any of the seals break ferdinand knew the threat at a depth of six hundred meters the pressures outside were close to half a ton per square inch any rupture would lead to immediate implosion emergency klaxons bellowed red warning lights flared ferdinand yelled in a firm tone of command retreat to level prepare to evacuate one of the marine biologists ran toward them almost colliding with john the interlevel hatches have sealed themselves i cant override on manual ferdinand swore in case of flooding the safety systems automatically locked down and isolated each tier but the manual override should have worked he stood up on the bucking floor as the main lights flickered out everything became redtinged in the glow of the emergency lights oh god john said his face was still pressed to the porthole ferdinand stumbled to a neighboring port what is it it took him a moment to comprehend what he was seeing the neighboring forest of lava pillars shook and vibrated as if a mighty wind were blowing through it distantly bright fiery glows marked opening magma fissures but neither sight was what had triggered johns outburst in the direction of the pillar a jagged crack split the seabed floor as ferdinand watched the rift widened and in vicious zigzags it raced toward the neptune no there was no time to evacuate other scientists took up positions at other portholes a heavy silence settled from somewhere across the way a whispered prayer began to echo ferdinand could do nothing as his lifelong dream was about to end his fate was in the hands of god he closed his eyes and pressed his forehead against the cold glass how many had he killed down here as fear and guilt clutched him it took him a moment to realize the rumbling roar had begun to recede the temblors underfoot calmed ferdinand lifted his face john was staring back at him wearing a frightened smile isis it over ferdinand glanced out the porthole the jagged fissure had reached within a yard of neptunes steel legs the quake shook with one last fierce rumble then died away that was too close john said ferdinand nodded over the radio a squelch of static erupted neptune this is perseus is everyone okay in there ferdinand stumbled to the transmitter relieved that brentley had safely weathered the quake all clear perseus just shaken up glad to hear it ill pass the news topside thank you perseus ferdinand slumped in his seat he turned to john lets hope that doesnt happen again john nodded oh yeah i dont have enough clean pairs of underwear ferdinand smiled weakly he willed his heart to stop pounding that had been too damn close pm nan madol southeast of pohnpei island kaselehlie the small darkskinned boatman greeted karen in native pohnpeian smiling broadly he was barechested and wore loose shorts that hung to his knobby knees behind him the ruins of nan madol spread in a series of manmade islets toward the open sea ia iromw were fine karen answered bowing her head slightly menlau thank you i called earlier today about a day rental of one of your rowboats the man nodded vigorously the scientists yes i have better than a rowboat he turned and led them down a short stone quay of black basalt to a pair of long canoes much better smaller travel the canals better faster he motioned with a hand sweeping it back and forth karen eyed the worn fiberglass canoes dubiously they hardly looked seaworthy enough even for the shallow canals i guess these will be fine the boatmans smile widened i have map two american dollars karen shook her head i have my own thank you i act as guide seven american dollars an hour i show you all the sights tell you stories i think we can manage on our own besides we have our own guide she nodded toward mwahu the boatman looked crestfallen and waved them toward the canoes menlau she said passing down the quay leading the others jack kept pace with her and mumbled a real capitalist that guy at the two canoes miyuki joined them she studied the sun low on the horizon lets get going we dont have that much daylight left karen sighed she knew her friend still fretted over mwahus earlier warning miyuki youre supposed to be a computer scientist since when do you believe in ghosts looking at this place im beginning to waver overhead a pair of fruit bats swept past distantly the calls of birds sounded lonely and lost its so creepy here karen nudged one of the boats well youre right about one thing we should get going why dont you and mwahu take this one jack and i will take the other miyuki nodded and climbed into the canoe as mwahu held it steady then the islander clambered skillfully in afterward are you sure you can lead us to the grave of your ancient teacher karen asked mwahu he bobbed his head satisfied karen turned to the other canoe jack already sat in the stern she carefully stepped into the canoes bow end and picked up a paddle everyone ready there was a general sound of assent lets go karen dug in her paddle and the canoe slid smoothly from the dock ahead miyuki and mwahu led the way paddling under the basalt entry gate of the ruins past the gate the breadth and scope of the site opened before them high palaces low tombs great halls miniature castles simple homes all framed by watery canals mangrove trees and thick vines were draped throughout creating a maze of water stone and overgrown vegetation karen paddled silently while jack guided the canoe with considerable skill he cut the boat around a narrow corner they were traveling through what was known as the central city of nan madol the canals here were less than a meter wide the basalt islets tightly packed around them jack continued to follow mwahus zigzagging course youre good at this karen said as jack swung the canoe smoothly under a bridge of vines and lilting white flowers seal training jack laughed no its a skill learned from years of float trips down the rivers and creeks of tennessee its like riding a bike you never forget facing forward karen hid her smile it was good to hear jack laugh she settled back as they paddled slowly toward the heart of the ruins crisscrossing from canals dark with deep shadows to sunlit channels some paths were so choked with overhanging ferns and mangrove boughs that she wished they had a machete yet at all times the stacks of basalt logs surrounded them prismatic crystals glowing in the late afternoon sunlight walls towered up to thirty feet only broken by the occasional window or doorway finally the canals widened to the right an especially huge basalt island appeared a great structure built upon it its walled fortifications towered forty feet a monstrous construction of logs and gigantic boulders nan dowas karen said pointing at it the citys central castle they glided along the fernchoked coastline of the wide island doorways opened into the structure some intact some collapsed its huge jack said they passed another entrance guarded by a large basalt boulder nodding toward the structure karen explained its one of the entrances to the subterranean tunnel network the passages here have never been fully explored and are considered feats of engineering in fact further west theres an islet named darong with a manmade lake atop it at the bottom of the lake is a sea tunnel that leads to the reefs edge it allows fish to travel into the artificial lake maintaining its stock impressive jack dug in his paddle and turned the canoe away from the castle as mwahu led them to a more open section of the city they floated over coral reefs rich with anemones and colorful fish from here the imposing sea wall of basalt pillars and slabs came into view taller monoliths dotted its lengths silent stone sentinels staring out to sea periodically narrow spaces opened gates to the ocean beyond after a few minutes of gliding along the walls they cut back into the maze of islets soon karen found herself drifting down a narrow canal the walls festooned with tiny pink and blue blossoms scented not unlike honeysuckles she inhaled deeply a slap drew her attention around bees jack warned karen smiled leave them alone and theyll leave you alone she felt something crawling on her arm and jumped then realized it was jack tickling her with a long blade of dry grass funny she scolded him he tossed the blade away with a look of total innocence karen faced forward paddle across her knees at least jack seemed to be coming out of his funk behind her he spoke up more serious do you have any idea where this guy is taking us she fished out her map and spread it on her lap she eyed the islets around her then bent over the map hmm what i can guess where hes leading us theres a sacred place near here she looked up as they rounded a tall promontory ahead appeared a huge island even larger than nan dowas but instead of a single castle the artificial island held a sprawling complex of buildings and crumbled walls mwahu aimed his canoe toward its shore pahn kadira karen said naming the place the forbidden city of nan madol mwahu glided into the islands shadow and beached at a low spot he waved them over why forbidden jack asked no one can say its a term passed from generation to generation jack guided them toward the bank pulling alongside the other canoe it seems were about to find out jack held the boat steady while karen climbed ashore as she joined miyuki and mwahu jack roped the canoes to the bole of a lone mangrove this way mwahu said softly his gaze flickered across the deep shadows as he led them along a thin trail through a dense accumulation of ferns to an arched entry beyond the gate a wide stone plaza opened grasses and flowers sprouted between the cracks to the left the remains of an ancient fortification lay toppled to the right stood lowroofed buildings with narrow doorways and small windows ahead splitting the plaza in half was a thin carved channel an artificial creek forded by a wide bridge it is so hot miyuki said she wiped her face with a handkerchief then pulled out a small umbrella pohnpei was known for its frequent showers but today the sky had remained cloudless miyuki opened her umbrella and sheltered in its shadow as a group they crossed the long plaza karen would have liked to explore the surrounding sites but mwahu continued on singlemindedly looking neither right nor left he led them across the bridge and toward a tall building on the far side it rose ninety feet above the plaza with two low wings sprouting off from the central keep karen stepped up next to mwahu is this the tomb of horonko mwahu did not answer he made a vague motion to remain silent reaching the wide entrance to the central keep he paused and bowed his head his lips moving silently karen and the others waited finished with his prayer mwahu took a deep breath and led them inside with karen right behind him the entrance hall was dark and refreshingly cool as karen entered she was struck by how clean the air smelled no mustiness just a hint of salt and dampness the short passage led into a cavernous chamber their footsteps on the stone floor echoed off the heights she fumbled through her pack and removed a penlight the thin beam pierced the darkness splashing across the featureless walls and roof basalt and more basalt no crystals no indication of any writing mwahu frowned hard at her then continued to lead them on jack whistled this place is massive you described it but to see this construction firsthandit mustve taken thousands and thousands of people to build this single building even aided by a pair of the magical brothers too awed to speak herself karen nodded they left the huge hall and entered another low passage the press of stone overhead seemed to weigh down upon karens head she wasnt prone to claustrophobia but there was a certain heaviness about the place that couldnt be ignored the passage turned sharply and sunlight flared ahead mwahu led them into a rear courtyard karen stepped back into the brilliance of the sunlight and the heat miyuki shook open her umbrella again around the space the oncetall walls lay toppled lengths of cracked basalt logs were tumbled amid boulders and smaller rocks still the solemnity of the yard was not diminished though no longer inside the keep karen still felt the weight of centuries there adding to this effect was the courtyards central altar a massive hewn block of prismatic basalt at four meters in length and a meter high she guessed that it weighed several tons they were all drawn to it as it glowed and sparked in the last rays of the afternoon sun none of them could keep their hands from touching its surface mwahu dropped to his knees karen noted that the spot where he knelt was worn into the rock how many generations of his people had made the pilgrimage here she wondered moving beside him is this the gravestone of your ancient teacher she asked he nodded head bowed jack circled the great block i dont seen any writing no clues mwahu stood and indicated that karen should give respect and kneel she nodded not wanting to offend dropped her pack and knelt mwahu pointed toward the stone she stared not sure if she was supposed to bow recite a prayer or perform some other act of respect as she looked at where mwahu pointed however she had her answer holy shit what is it jack said miyuki stepped to her other side come see karen stood and returned to the stone she brushed the blocks surface with the palm of her hand it was no optical illusion im not surprised you missed it you can only see it if youre kneeling see what she tugged jack down by an arm so he could look across the stones surface she traced a finger there jacks jaw dropped a star carved so thinly or simply worn faint by time that the only way to see it is from an extreme angle he straightened but what does it mean miyuki took a peek too then answered from under her umbrella its like back at the pyramid we need the crystal karen nodded and tugged open her pack jack still looked confused what are you talking about karen hadnt told him about how shed used the crystal star and now she tugged out a black cloth bag and shook it out behind her mwahu gasped with awe she crossed to the stone as the others gathered around her carefully placing the artifact atop the thin carving it was an exact match she held her breath not knowing what to expect nothing happened disappointed karen stepped back the crystal star must act as a key but how miyuki leaning over the stone said remember back at the pyramid darkness was the final key karen slowly nodded it had taken perfect darkness for the crystal star to function as the key to release them from the heart of the chatan pyramid so what do we do jack asked wait until nightfall miyuki looked sick at this suggestion i dont know karen studied the stone something didnt sit right with her then it struck her she recalled the symmetry and balance of the chatan pyramids the yin and the yang of course what jack moved to her side its not darkness we need she waved miyuki away from the stone her friends umbrella had been casting a shadow over the crystal as miyuki stepped back raw sunlight bathed the crystal the star burst with radiant brilliance its light a loud crack sounded from the stone the others moved back a few steps but karen stood her ground a hidden seam appeared around the solid block it outlined a fourinchthick lid resting squarely atop the stone block karen stepped forward be careful jack warned she touched the blocks lid and pushed the slab of basalt shifted moving as easily as if it were styrofoam it hardly weighs a thing jack moved beside her his gaze fixed on the crystal star he shadowed his hand over it try pushing now she did the lid wouldnt budge jack removed his hand exposing the crystal to sunlight again and using a single finger he moved the slab of stone to the side the star has somehow extended its weightaltering properties to the basalt karen was stunned amazing this must be how the magical ancients floated the stones in the past it looks downright magical enough to me thats for damn sure miyuki beside them pointed into the blocks interior karen leaned over as jack pushed the stone lid back farther inside the altar there was a carved alcove lined by a shiny metal karen touched it platinum jack nodded like your story the platinum coffins the japanese divers discovered underwater during world war two karen nodded but this coffin isnt empty resting inside were the bones of a human skeleton mwahu spoke at karens shoulder a whisper horonko karen studied the remains clinging to the bones were a few scraps of dusty cloth but what had captured her eye was a book bound in platinum clutched in the bony grip of the coffins occupant carefully she reached inside no mwahu cried karen could not resist she gripped the book and lifted it disturbed the bones of the fingers fell away to dust then like toppling dominoes the degradation of the bones spread the rib cage collapsed the femurs and pelvis disintegrated the skull caved in soon the form was no longer recognizable ashes to ashes jack mumbled karen held the platinum book in her fingers stunned by her thoughtless act of desecration mwahu began to weep behind her doomed he moaned as if hearing him the first bullet struck the basalt altar stinging karens face with a spray of rocky shards pm uss gibraltar philippine sea admiral mark houston climbed the five levels to the bridge of the uss gibraltar they were under full steam from guam where two days ago they had offloaded the civilian ntsb team along with the crated wreckage of air force one in guam the gibraltar had also reacquired its normal complement of aircraft fortytwo helicopters both sea knights and cobras and five harrier ii fighterbombers along with its usual complement of lcac amphibious landing craft all to land the ships marine detachment safely on okinawa and bolster the islands defense reports coming from the region were growing worse by the hour apparently the chinese naval and air forces were merciless in their determination not to surrender taiwan passing through a cipherlocked hatch houston shook his head its folly let the chinese have the damn island he had read the intelligence reports on the agreement signed between the leaders in taipei and beijing it was not all that different from chinas assumption of control in hong kong and macau it would be business as usual as they did in hong kong the chinese had no intention of weakening taiwans economic base still he could understand the administrations position president bishop had been murdered whether the upper levels in beijing knew of the plot or not the crime could not go unanswered upon hearing of the escalating conflict houston had offered his services to remain on board and proceed to the beleaguered front calmer heads were needed out there he was to oversee the situation and report his recommendations to the joint chiefs he climbed the last ladder his knees protesting and entered the bridge of the gibraltar the navigational equipment map table and communication station were all manned and busy admiral on the bridge an ensign called out all eyes turned in his direction he waved them back to their duties a groggyeyed captain brenning pushed from his day cabin into the main bridge he looked like hed had less than an hours sleep in the past three days sir how can i help you i apologize for disturbing you just coming topside to stretch my legs how are things faring fine sir were thirtysix hours out and ready very good the co nodded aft sir the marine commander is over in debark control i can let him know youre here no need houston stared out the greentinted windows of the bridge rain sluiced across the glass all day long a thin rain had been falling and a misty haze obscured the horizon having been holed up in his cabin since morning conferring with washington he had primarily come up here to see the sun he had thought a climb up to the bridge would do him some good cheer him up but instead he felt a heaviness grow in his chest how many would die these next few days at the communication station a lieutenant pulled headphones from his ears and turned to his captain sir i have an encrypted call from the pentagon theyre asking for admiral houston captain brenning nodded to his day cabin admiral if youd like you could take the call in my cabin houston shook his head thats no longer my place captain ill take it out here he crossed and picked up a handset admiral houston here as he listened the cold of the islands superstructure crept into his bones he could not believe what he was hearing but he had no choice yes i understand he handed the receiver back to the lieutenant the others must have sensed his dismay the bridge grew quiet sir captain brenning stepped toward him houston blinked a few times stunned maybe ill take you up on your offer to borrow your day cabin he turned and walked toward the door indicating that brenning should follow once inside he closed the door and turned to the co john ive just received new orders and a new objective where do they want us to go taiwan the captain blanched word has come down from the hill houston finished were officially at war with china cat and mouse august pm ruins of nan madol southheast of pohnpei island get down jack yelled he pulled karen to her knees bullets sprayed the courtyard jack quickly assessed the situation as the four of them took shelter behind the basalt crypt rifle fire from two locations he tried to spot the snipers along the walls but the suppressing gunfire was too intense he studied the others blood dribbled down karens cheek are you okay he asked eyes wide she nodded then touched her cheek rock shards the momentary shock faded from her eyes she crammed the crypts platinum book into her pack jack suspicious eyed mwahu do you know anything about this the islander shook his head vigorously jack leaned back against the stone he thought quickly none of them had been shot why they had been sitting ducks they should not have survived the surprise assault beyond the stone the rifle fire faded theyre pinning us down here he said aloud they want something from us or they wouldve killed us by now what do they want miyuki asked angrily the crystal karen said thats what everyone seems to want jack nodded he crept to the edge of the crypt the crystal star still rested atop the blocks lid its just out of reach im going to need a distraction in case im wrong he looked back over his shoulder miyuki the professor nodded as jack told her his plan then slid to the opposite end of the basalt coffin on my count jack whispered onetwothree miyuki shoved her umbrella into the air opening it and waving it about rifle fire blasted ripping and shredding the umbrellas cloth miyuki gasped cringing but held tight jack listened both guns were firing good he burst from his end of the crypt grabbed the crystal star and dove back into cover hunching he clutched the artifact to his chest youre bleeding karen said jack glanced down a trail of red dribbled across the crystal he hadnt felt the bullet that grazed the edge of his hand the snipers were damn fast he realized he had better not underestimate them im okay its just a scratch karen crawled to his side and wrapped his hand in her handkerchief tugging it tight ow he said oh quit complaining you baby even in their predicament jack couldnt help but grin the rifle fire again quieted as the targets remained hidden what now miyuki asked theyre holding us here which means others are on the way mwahu moved nearer i know a secret way out of forbidden city but we must get back there he pointed toward the dark hall into the central keep jack stared biting his lower lip thinking it was only ten yards away but it might as well have been a hundred they would be exposed to the snipers for too long too risky karen grabbed her pack and tugged a side pouch open i have an idea she pulled out a package of trident gum good jack said i was worried about my dental hygiene right now she smirked at him put the crystal down when jack complied she flipped the star over and unwrapped a piece of gum she popped it in her mouth chewed it for a couple seconds then stuck the wad on the back of the crystal what are you she nodded toward the lid and jack understood let me help you he grabbed a few pieces of gum and chewed them vigorously miyuki stared at them as if theyd gone crazy jack smeared a sticky chunk of gum on the crystals underside then held it up karen eyed the star that should be enough gum do i have to return the star to the exact spot he asked i dont know just make sure its in the sunlight jack grabbed the crystal star gummy side up taking a deep breath he reached up and slapped the crystal down upon the nearest edge of the stone lid he pressed hard twisting it to ensure the gum stuck well he yanked his hand back as gunfire spat again sparking off the stone he checked his hand then held it toward karen look ma no cavities very funny test the lid from the safety of the shelter jack reached out to the underside of the lids protruding edge he pushed up on it rock scraped on rock as the lid rose an inch light as a feather then lets get our asses out of here jack slid the lid to their side of the crypt then stood tilting the top between him and the snipers like a stone shield bullets rang off the rock oof jack felt the impacts all the way to his shoulders but the shield held backing up he dragged the makeshift shield off the crypt tilting the lid vertically so the others could crouch in its shadow okay time to vamoose shuffling backward he kept them all covered only his fingers were exposed on the far side he prayed the riflemen were not good enough shots to take off one of his fingers keep the crystal in the light karen urged were almost there rifle fire continued to pelt the stone lid jacks hands began to slip jarred by the force of the continued rifle blasts almost karen said jack stepped into darkness he took another step and the stone lids weight suddenly returned caught off guard he couldnt hold it back he yelled as it came toppling toward him from behind someone grabbed his belt and yanked him clear he stumbled and fell hard on his rear end the lid crashed to the ground barely missing his toes jack hoisted himself up to a crouch karen had also fallen to her knees she dusted off her hands standing up thanks he said grab the crystal she motioned to the cracked lid jack snatched the star peeling it off the basalt he passed it to karen who shoved it in her pack rifle blasts continued to abrade the halls entrance but the group was far enough down the passage to be out of the direct line of fire keep moving it wont be safe much longer this way mwahu hissed from farther down the tunnel hurry someone comes jack and karen joined the other two at the edge of the cavernous central chamber across the room jack spotted a shaft of light flaring from the opposite hall they were cut off from the exit this way mwahu whispered slinking along the wall to the left in the deep gloom the group slid close to the walls jack reached behind and took miyukis hand the professors fingers shook in his grip he squeezed reassuringly together they followed mwahu to a corner of the large chamber by now hushed voices echoed from the opposite hall no words could be made out but from the angry tone jack suspected that the snipers failure to hold the captives had been radioed the light quickly grew hurry he silently urged mwahu a flashlights beam speared across the chamber as someone entered jack pushed miyuki behind him a hiss drew jacks attention around in the deep shadows he barely saw mwahu crouched beside a thin crevice in the wall it was no higher than jacks knee and narrower than his shoulders karen was already crawling inside pack shoved in front of her mwahu stared with fear toward the men stepping into the chamber jack was sure they would be caught he pushed miyuki toward the opening and without any hesitation her small form vanished down the tunnels throat jack indicated mwahu should go next he was the only one who knew where the tunnel led the islander dove into the hole behind jack a new light bloomed crouching he spun around it came from the hall leading to the courtyard shadowy figures entered the snipers the two parties signaled each other with their lights jack saw one of the beams flash in his direction he dropped to the floor flattening himself the light passed over where he had been standing it did not pause crawling on hands and knees he slithered across the floor and into the crevice it was a tight fit holding his breath he crooked his shoulders and shoved himself inside crouching lower on his elbows and scrabbling with his fingers he worked deeper into the chute sure at any moment that lights would flare up around him but finally he pulled his feet fully into the tunnel he paused suppressing a sigh of relief he stared ahead and saw nothing the tunnel was pitchblack the only evidence of the others was the occasional furtive scuffling squeezing his large form along the chute jack listened for the noises as he followed the turns and twists of the tunnel he scraped his shoulders and tore his fingernails on the rough surface as he went in the dark blind his exertions seemed compounded how long was this tunnel finally he was able to make out the dim form of mwahu crawling a few yards ahead and he heard echoed whispers i see the end miyuki said distantly jack prayed they remained cautious he increased his pace scraping his elbows and knees soon he too saw the end of the passage a square of bright sunlight careful he whispered ahead jack watched the professor slide from the tunnel and vanish the others followed he crawled after them reached the tunnels exit and peered out below the others were crouched in a meterwide channel of stagnant water waistdeep he realized then where they were recalled the thin artificial creek bisecting the plaza head hanging out he surveyed the situation the stone bridge lay twenty yards away he listened for voices and heard none jack wormed out of the chute and lowered himself into the creek after the exertion the water felt wonderfully cool but the saltwater stung his cuts and abrasions karen nodded to the tunnel drainage system she said softly he nodded nothing like crawling through a sewage pipe he eyed mwahu silently asking the islander where to go next before mwahu could direct them however a loud voice cracked across the open plaza behind them kirkland if you want the others to live show yourself jack froze he knew that strident voice spangler his fists clenched karen touched his shoulder and shook her head she pointed to mwahu who was half swimming down the artificial creek away from them miyuki followed karen went next jack unclenched his fists he knew it was not the time to confront david not yet not when others were in harms way lowering himself into the water he silently glided after the others he heard the tromp of boots on stonecoming their way he hissed at the others pointing a thumb up mwahu ducked under the bridge and twisted around he motioned the others to join him jack and the two women were soon at his side the bridge was so low that only their heads were above water the tread of boots now running aimed right for their hiding place two men jack bit his lip with the sun so low the channel was thick with shadows under the bridge it was even darker still if they thought to flash a light the pair hit the bridge and stopped their shadows could be seen on the far wall of the canal any sign spangler asked harshly no sir were still combing the building they wont get away with the island under surveillance they wont be able to leave here without being spotted good sir im getting a report from rolfe over the radio a pause then the mans voice grew more excited he found a tunnel goddamn it why didnt someone spot this earlier cmon have rolfe ready with the grenades yes sir the echo of boot steps retreated from the bridge and headed back toward the large structure jack did not wait he thumbed for mwahu to continue one after the other the group swam toward the distant fortifications no one breathed all of them clung to the deepest shadows of the channel as they neared the wall jack spotted where the creek ended he saw no way forward mwahu waited for them to gather once jack was near enough the islander made a diving motion with his hand then to demonstrate he sank under the water and vanished karen whispered to jack the creek must connect to the canals or the channel would have dried out but she eyed the wall of stacked basalt logs with concern you can do it he said karen nodded unhooking her backpack so it was loose in her hands ill go next taking a deep breath she ducked under the stagnant water with a kick she vanished into the underwater tunnel miyuki looked too frightened to move jack slid beside her well go together she nodded swallowing hard im not the strongest swimmer but she held out her hand her eyes determined he took it on three he said on three she repeated jack counted it off and they both dove under he found the passage easily it was quite large kicking off the nearby creek wall he led miyuki through the tunnel it was no longer than two yards light filtered ahead jack popped out and found himself in one of the surrounding canals miyuki surfaced beside him wiping back her wet hair the group was hidden in an overhang of ferns jack heard a vague whining the noise grew as he listened shit what karen asked how long can everyone hold their breath karen shrugged as long as we need to the whining was now a highpitched screaming it came from just around the corner what is karen started to ask take each others hands jack said duck underwater until i signal you they obeyed and their heads vanished holding his breath jack sank until only his eyes were above the water peering between the fern fronds he watched a sleek black jet ski turn the corner with a roar it angled down the canal toward them sweeping back and forth lightly bumping the walls to either side jack pressed himself against the stones half standing the driver glided his jet ski along the passage he studied the walled island slowing as he puttered past jacks hiding spot the man in a black wet suit with his mask pushed up on his forehead wore a pair of mirrored sunglasses keep going asshole jack knew the others could not hold their breath forever in the reflection of the mans sunglasses jack spotted his own face hidden by leaves his skin pale seemed to shine in the shadows he should have smeared his face with mud he thought but it was too late now the jet ski inched past him its fiberglass edge almost grazing his cheek as it swept by him the man remained unaware of his presence as he drifted away jack recognized the automatic weapon strapped to the mans back a heckler koch mpa assault weapon the seals weapon of choice he kept an eye on the gunman until he disappeared around the corner then pulled the others up they gasped for air jack strained to listen another whine arose from across the ruins a second jet ski he surmised there were two guards circling in tandem around the island he had maybe three minutes to come up with a plan we need to get out of here he said now mwahu pointed toward an islet fifty yards down the waterway more tunnels go over to shore but he seemed unsure of himself are you certain mwahu stared jack down then shrugged jack sighed you make a very good point the group had no other choice theyd have to take their chances move fast folks weve got more company coming the sound of the second jet ski grew louder mwahu led the way here the water was deeper they were forced to swim jack cringed at the amount of splashing if the second guard should turn the corner now they would be spotted easily positioned at the rear jack kept glancing over his shoulder the whining began to roar echoing off the walls faster he urged the others the splashing worsened but their progress only improved slightly jack realized they would not make it ahead he spotted a narrow side channel jutting from the main canal turn in there with a kick mwahu led them into the tight alley jack swam after them into the cramped space bare walls surrounded them on either side and the canal deadended only a couple yards away they were boxed in jack swung around well have to hold our breath again resigned nods answered him jack judged their waning strength knowing they were all growing cold and exhausted the rising scream of the jet ski drew his attention around hes coming he knew he could not risk even peeking out he listened trying to time it grabbed karens hand and raised his other arm the noise drilled his ears he held his breath waiting tense then he lowered his arm and the others sucked air and dove again jack lowered his face to eye level with the water the jet ski roared up to the opening of the side channel but the driver a clone of the other maintained a watch on the larger island across the canal standing the man had a hand pressed to an ear listening to his radio reporting in his words were muffled by the jet skis engine jack willed him to continue past as if hearing his silent plea the man swung around jack just barely managed to duck underwater in time from under the surface he stared up he could see the mans watery image saw him pause floating the jet ski in place jack felt karen tug on his hand she and the others were running out of air he squeezed her hand then released his grip and slipped away from her side karen tried to grab the back of his shirt but he knocked her hand aside overhead the jet ski turned in their direction jack saw the man reach for his rifle exhaling slowly jack sank deeper he slid out of the side channel scuttling under the starboard edge of the ski he hated to abandon the others but he needed a moments distraction crouching down on the bottom of the canal he positioned his feet and squinted up cmon he urged the others then he heard a frantic kicking as one of his group ran out of air and was forced to surface jack did not wait he shoved with all the strength in his legs and shot out of the water the driver still facing the channel had his weapon pointed in the wrong direction he noticed jacks attack a moment too late jack knocked him off the jet skis seat the man grabbed the handlebars and twisted around but by then jacks elbow had smashed him in the face crushing his nose driving the bone into his brain instant death jack did not pause his old instincts arose he relieved the guard of his rifle and radio headpiece then shoved the man into the canal as he swung back into the jet skis seat he found karen staring up in shock from the canal kill or be killed he grumbled then gunned the jet ski cmon karen held out a hand and jack pulled her into the seat behind him there was not enough room for the other two grab the edge of the jet ski he instructed them ill drag you both miyuki and mwahu swam to either side fingers clutching for handholds ready yyes miyuki said shivering jack edged the ski forward over the noise of his own watercraft he heard the growing roar of the other jet ski he increased his pace but a squeal of protest from miyuki forced him to throttle down the professor gagged out a mouthful of seawater sorry he said twisting around and watching for the other guard jack clutched the handles in a tight grip we cant outrun them like this karen nodded down the canal what about mwahus tunnel they should have just enough time jack thought and slowly throttled up hold your breath gliding the jet ski he headed toward the islet mwahu had pointed out once abreast of it he ducked the ski into another side canal and parked it out of sight is this the place karen asked mwahu half drowned the islander indicated the rear side of the islets single squat building shouldering the rifle jack hopped to shore and helped the others up onto the weedchoked island he quickly led them around the building where he stumbled to a stop goddamn it the entrance to the building was blocked by a large basalt boulder he sagged and turned is this your entrance to the tunnels mwahu crossed and placed a hand on the boulder he looked near tears answer enough karen joined the islander we can move it she said wiggling out of her wet pack its basalt we have the crystal jack looked at the boulder it was deep in shadows as the sun hovered at the horizon we need sunlight karen passed him the crystal ill get it for you she removed a plastic compact from her pack opened it and broke off the mirror stepping back to the corner she aimed the mirror toward the sun and deflected a beam toward the boulder so a spot of sunlight danced on the boulders surface jack smiled its worth a try he crossed to the boulder and slapped on the star still sticky with gum it failed to adhere to the uneven surface but he found he could hold it in place and push with his shoulder he nodded to karen it took her a few tries to hit the star with the reflected sunlight jack pushed each time the star burst with radiance the boulder much more massive than the crypts lid was still heavy jack dug in his heels straining against the rock fighting it mwahu joined him and pushed too slowly the boulder shifted i dont hear the other jet ski miyuki said jack paused she was right silence lay over the ruins he must have discovered the body hes probably reporting in he hunkered down again cmon were running out of time karen tilted her mirror the star flashed brilliantly jack and mwahu groaned against it the boulder rolled a full foot the gap opened enough for a small person to crawl inside thatll have to do karen said we can squeeze she passed jack her pack and crouched down slithering into the space once through she called back mwahu was right there is a tunnel it leads steeply down from here jack waved for miyuki and mwahu to follow the pair quickly squeezed inside into the stone building while jack backed to the far side of the boulder the stones far edge now pushed beyond the shelter of the building was bathed in sunlight now you karen called out to him jack he hooked karens pack to his own shoulder and placed the crystal star against the sunlit edge of the boulder jack the crystal glowed brightly jack crouched down and shoved against the boulder legs straining the large stone rolled back into the shadows then he straightened and walked back around without sunlight the boulder was now impossible to move any farther what are you doing karen asked from the other side the crack was no wider than the palm of his hand her face was pressed to the gap we cant leave the way open he said theyll find the jet ski and quickly discover the opening theyll hunt us in the tunnels but the roar of a jet ski echoed over the water first one then another then another theyre coming jack said standing ill try and lead them away he stepped back and tucked the crystal into the pack on his shoulder but if they catch me ill have what they want the crystal either way they should leave you all alone jack karen wiggled a hand through the crack jack knelt and took her hand try to get to someone in authority karen nodded eyes moist i will jack turned her hand and gently pressed his lips to her palm ill see you soon she closed her hand savoring his kiss youd better jack pushed back up there was nothing else to say he hitched karens pack higher on his shoulder and hurried to the lone watercraft the screams of the other jet skis echoed across the ruins jack settled into the jet skis seat hooked the radio headset in place and strapped the assault weapon over his shoulder ready he gunned the jet ski adding its voice to the chorus of others opening the throttle he shot forward across nan madol the sun was sinking below the horizon as darkness descended jack remembered mwahus earlier warning an old superstition death lay among the ruins at night pm david spangler stood atop the stone roof of the central keep one of the tallest points in nan madol he had a comprehensive view of the entire megalithic city using a night vision scope he watched the chase begin he saw jacks jet ski suddenly burst from out of hiding behind one of the islets hes in quadrant four david radioed his men circle the area and keep him contained on his command the other three jet skis swung around circling toward the designated region he listened to the chatter over the radio as his team closed the noose david allowed himself a hard smile darkness was omega teams ally while jack stumbled around blindly his own men equipped with goggles and uv lanterns moved with skill and certainty he watched the trap tighten he would end this tonight he touched his microphone jeffreys check out the island where jack was hiding make sure he hasnt left anyone behind david knew it was not above jack to play hero leading his team on a wild goose chase while the real prize lay hidden below he heard a jet ski throttle up he had held omega teams last jet ski in reserve for emergencies and backup now the jet ski roared away angling toward the tiny islet sighing david returned his attention to the chase when they first arrived he had ordered his men to capture kirkland and the others alive but the man was proving more of an adversary than hed imagined as a consequence he adjusted his estimation of kirkland and upgraded his order to kill on sight still he found it frustrating his team had been outwitted hed spent many hours planning the days mission he had commandeered a local police cutter and the six jet skis drug runners was the official explanation he had stationed the boat outside the reef and awaited the arrival of jack and the others once they were there he had watched them paddle around the ruins and finally beach their canoes from that point it was a simple matter to jetski into the ruins through the sea gates and sneak onto the island silently he had then ordered the area cordoned off while he and his extraction team hunted jacks group even now david was not entirely certain how jack and the others had escaped his trap rolfe and handel had sketched a story of jack using some sort of stone shield to flee into hiding then he apparently disappeared down some secret tunnels where kirkland killed one of his men as he escaped it was a sorry excuse all around and he would demand a full debriefing on his mens failure once this was over from his vantage point david watched as jacks jet ski was encircled within an especially cramped section of the ruins all exits from the area were blocked by his men jack was trapped he would not escape a second time get him david ordered shoot to kill gleefully he watched his men close in if he couldnt be there personally this was the next best thing watching jack hunted down like a dog and shot i see him one of the men shouted over the radio the jet ski in the background made it difficult to hear rifle fire rang out the sound echoing over the ruins off to the left a flurry of birds took flight from their nests frightened by the blast but davids scope remained fixed on the glowing mote of jack and his jet ski the spot flared brightly stinging his eyes like a camera flash swearing david shoved away the night vision goggles and blinked away the glare he stared across the ruins noises of victory sounded over his radio david clenched a fist of satisfaction across the dark islands a bonfire burned high into the sky reflecting off the waters the radio squelched and rolfes voice whispered in his ear we got him sir blew his ass out of the water the targets eliminated pm down in the tunnels karen heard the gunshot she cringed then heard an even more ominous sound a muffled explosion the noise thundered through the tunnel system echoing and reverberating from everywhere sound traveled strangely through the low passages even their own echoing footsteps sounded more like a score of people tromping throughout the tunnels it made her edgyas if they werent alone and now the gunshot and explosion karen held a fist at her throat praying jack was okay ahead mwahu crouched in the low passage he held her small penlight it was their only source of light keep going miyuki said voice trembling theres nothing we can do to help jack mwahu nodded karen followed them the tunnels had been carved out of the coral itself the walls and roof were coarse and they had to be careful not to brush against it only the floor was smooth worn by centuries of feet and the occasional flood of water in fact several of the passages still held trapped pools of water chilly and oily with algae not much further mwahu promised karen hoped so rather than safe she felt helpless and trapped down here it seemed with each step she took she was abandoning jack to the murderous scum back there if only her pistol had not been confiscated back in japan mwahu turned a corner and gestured to her and miyuki come see they quickly joined the islander beyond the turn in the tunnel an opening lay directly ahead though the sun had set the early evening was still brighter than the dark tunnels together they hurried toward the exit karen was a moment too slow to realize the danger wait miyuki and mwahu were already outside karen stumbled after them she pointed at mwahus light turn it off mwahu gaped at his light as if it were a poisonous snake and dropped it diving down karen retrieved the penlight and flicked it off straightening she surveyed their surroundings they had exited a squat basalt building not far from the shore of temwen island in fact the stone quay where they had rented their canoes lay less than fifty meters away she looked down at the extinguished light had it been spotted had they just thwarted jacks attempt to draw the others away the answer came soon enough karen heard the whine of a jet ski escalate someone was coming to investigate she eyed the distance between them and the coastal gate the assassins alerted now would know where her group was heading where else could they go she closed her eyes and made a decision then flicked on the light what are you doing miyuki said they know well try for the exit but if i run the other way with the flashlightkaren pointed in the opposite directiontheyll have to follow karen she reached out and clutched her friends arm go i dragged you into all this ill get you out i dont care well i do she stared miyuki down as the noise of the jet ski grew louder go karen backed away lifting her penlight high she hopped into the canal this close to the shore the waters were shallow only chestdeep she slogged and swam away from the coastal gate behind her she heard splashes as miyuki and mwahu jumped into the canal and made for the exit alone karen swam through the murky water trying to put as much distance as possible between her and the others she soon lost sight of the exit only shadowy walls surrounded her but she was not completely alone she heard the growl of the jet ski as it roared toward her pm david rode behind jeffreys on the jet ski he clenched his teeth in a silent curse kirkland had tried to play him the fool shortly after the explosion lieutenant jeffreys had reported in david had almost forgotten he had sent the man to reconnoiter kirklands original hiding spot the lieutenant reported no sign of anyone else this news had puzzled david where had kirkland stashed the others his primary assignment after all had been to kidnap the canadian anthropologist and retrieve her crystal sample suspicious about their absence he had ordered jeffreys to come and get him together they would search the surrounding islets the others had to be somewhere it was only pure luck that he caught the brief clue to the others whereabouts donning his night vision goggles for the search he caught the flare of brightness off by the coast about a quarter mile away and knew what it meant he had read of the subterranean passages here while jack had distracted him the others had almost burrowed their way out of his trap but kirkland had failed david thought with satisfaction his sacrifice had achieved nothing now as he and jeffreys raced through the ruins on the jet ski david unhitched his rifle the target was within reach for a brief moment the light flicked out but now it had returned its moving away from the exit jeffreys yelled to him i see that keep following it they must be trying to make for another tunnel we have to catch them before they disappear jeffreys nodded swinging the ski around following the trajectory of their target they whipped back and forth through the maze of islets david kept a firm grip around the lieutenants waist his rifle resting on his shoulder as they swept around tight turns waves broke against the canal walls buffeting david with the spray he ignored the dousing and urged jeffreys to faster speeds jeffreys called out just ahead he spun around the next corner tilting the ski savagely run em down if you have to david yelled jeffreys raced down a channel and sped around another corner the wash of the jet ski swept forward as he dug in the source of the light lay just ahead david stood as jeffreys throttled down fuck the tiny penlight was jammed in the crook of a mangrove branch he searched around him no one was here he had been trickedagain his radio buzzed in his ear it was rolfe sir weve found no sign of kirklands body suspicion and mistrust rode high in davids mind especially after this newest ruse who shot him sir who the fuck got on the radio and yelled that he saw kirkland and shot him david listened to the radio silence no one answered did any of you actually fire your damn rifles again silence it dawned on david that his murdered teammate had not only been missing his rifle but his radio headpiece too shit jack had staged his own death eavesdropping over the radio and masquerading as one of his men fuck he touched his microphone and screamed find that bastard what is it jeffreys asked cutting off the throttle its kirkland hes escaped as david collapsed to his seat he heard a small splash echo from nearby he froze silencing jeffreys with a hand signal someone else was there pm on the other side of the ruins jack slowly surfaced stripped to his boxers he silently shoved his rifle under a heavy fern at the shoreline and strained for sounds of pursuit it was difficult to hear well his head still rang with the jet skis explosion hed been too close but had little choice he had to make sure the fuel tank was hit squarely by his single shot but the strength of the explosion had caught him by surprise throwing him backward singeing his eyebrows knocking off his radio headpiece dazed hed been forced to dive quickly and swim under the jet skis of the swarming ops team he swam until his lungs burned then surfaced as hed hoped the others had pulled off their night vision eyewear the flames too bright for their equipment the misdirection had allowed him time to escape deeper into the ruins as stealthily as possible he had hurried having no idea how long his ruse would last he searched for some way out of the ruins his plan was to reach the coastal mangrove swamps of temwen island but he knew he had wasted valuable time and only succeeded in getting himself lost in the dark a quarter mile away hearing the jet skis rev and whine he concluded that his pursuers had realized his ruse he listened for a few moments they were spreading out search pattern the hunt had started again so far he had kept in the water as much as possible staying hidden trying to keep his body heat from revealing the fact that he still lived but now he knew such subtlety was useless he needed to find a way out of here and quickly the mangrove swamps were his only hope the jet skis would be useless among the mud and dense roots but first to get there heaving his tired body up onto the islet jack sprawled on his belly before crawling to his feet a steep slope led up from there a difficult but not impossible climb he needed to reach higher ground to get his bearings even if it meant exposing himself for a few seconds he retrieved his rifle and shouldered the pack stifling a groan he pushed up the slope discovering it was steeper than hed estimated he scrabbled through clinging brush and terraces of basalt his fingers slipped and his knees already raw were savagely scraped his limbs leaden and weak shook with exhaustion but at last he dragged himself onto the summit staying on hands and knees he surveyed his position in the darkness he had not thought freedom was so close but under the starlight he watched small waves pound against the artificial breakwater just thirty yards away open sea lay beyond out in the deeper waters jack spotted a small cutter painted white with a blue light atop a tall pole a coastal police vehicle its running lights were ablaze a small figure stood on the bow deck a tiny glint indicated the man was spying with binoculars most likely equipped with night vision capability jack knew this was no friendly ship probably spanglers means of transportation now that he was at the summit for the first time jack noticed the body of water on top it was roughly square and looked like a small lake and for some reason he felt drawn to it in fact the dark body of water was ringed by a narrow beach of sand and finely crushed coral and jacks hands and knees sank into soft sand a grenade hit the far side of the islet exploding and casting dirt and shredded ferns high into the air jack flattened himself his ears ringing from the concussion as the blast subsided he heard the telltale sound of jet skis converging on his spot then spotted the tiny figure on the police ship the figure was frantically pointing toward him another grenade sailed through the air bounced across the stony summit of the island and rolled over the edge exploding in the canal water geysered up in a wide funnel someone was targeting the islet with a grenade launcher on his belly jack shimmied toward the summits edge he needed to reach the canals hed been lucky twice and knew the odds were running thin peering over he spotted two jet skis racing his way another arcing to circle around the back he was about to be surrounded then rifle fire spattered against the stones missing his head by no more than a foot he pulled back but not before he spotted his adversary the sniper was perched atop a low building about three islets away as jack rolled away another grenade whistled through the air exploding in the sand and water of the summit lake shrapnel tore through the air damn it jack unhooked his weapon and remained prone on the stone offering no target to the sniper he positioned the rifle and crawled forward keeping an eye focused through the scope as the squat building on the far side appeared in his sights he froze hoping his submersion in the seawater had not damaged the rifle he waited exhaling slowly steadying his gun spotting a flicker of movement he fired a volley of shots then rolled away on his back clutching the rifle to his chest he didnt know if he had nailed his target but either way it would make the sniper more cautious and now at least he knew that his gun would fire across the channel something heavy hit the water with a loud splash a voice called out from one of the jet skis handels down get that shithead jack rolled back to his stomach and crawled to the far side of the islet he would have to take his chances and leap the canals here were only six feet deep but the enemy was closing in too fast he had no choice reaching the edge he prepared to jump then spotted a jet ski directly under him in all the commotion he hadnt heard it come up he dove away as rifle fire peppered the edge his right ear flared with pain but he ignored it and rolled deeper reaching the sandy slope of the summit lake listening he heard the other jet skis closing in blood ran down his neck he positioned his rifle knowing he was doomed and edged farther back keeping his barrel forward his feet and ankles now dangled into the water of the lake he had nowhere else to go his only consolation was that karen and the others had escaped as he waited for the full assault tiny fish nibbled at his toes drawn by the blood of his abraded feet he kicked them away then he remembered the story karen had told him about the construction of darong island a sea tunnel connected the lake to the sea beyond the reef shed said allowing fish to enter he looked back the breakwater lay only thirty yards away a tough swim but not impossible he heard the scuffle of stone of the two risks he knew which was the less dicey he dropped his rifle and tugging the backpack over both shoulders slid into the lake its bottom fell away steeply he tread water for a few breaths taking deep lungfuls of air usually he could hold his breath for up to five minutes but this was going to be a long dark swim with a final deep breath he dove down into the depths the fresh wound in his ear burned in the saltwater but at least the pain kept him focused his hands reached the silty bottom curling around he searched the edges of the artificial lake struggling to find the sea tunnel opening he swam first along the section facing the breakwater believing this the most likely place it quickly proved true his arm disappeared down the throat of a stone tunnel fixing its location in his mind he rose to the surface and refreshed his lungs with rapid deep inhalations as he readied himself he listened it sounded like the jet skis were leaving but the sounds echoed strangely around the lake he couldnt be sure especially with so many then closer he heard whispers arguing and the rattle of loose rocks the word bomb that was enough for him he dove with a clean scissor kick and reached the entrance to the tunnel not pausing he ducked into the coralencrusted hole and pulled and propelled himself down the chute using hands and toes there was nothing to see scooting blindly his legs and arms were scraped and cut by the sharp coral but he no longer felt the pain he pushed past it concentrating on one thing moving forward as he wiggled and kicked his lungs began to ache he ignored this pain too reaching forward his hand touched stone a moment of panic clutched him he frantically reached out with both palms a wall of stone blocked his way forward he struggled gasping out a bit of air before he forced himself to calm down panic was a divers worst enemy he searched the walls on either side and realized the way opened to the right it was simply a blind turn in the tunnel he reached it and pulled himself around the corner though relieved he was also concerned how long and torturous was this tunnel darong island lay only thirty yards from the edge of the reef but if the passage twisted and turned how long did he really have to swim by now he was running out of air the hours of exertion were taking their toll his limbs demanded more oxygen small specks of light began to dance across his vision ghost lights of oxygen deprivation jack increased his pace refusing to let panic rule him he moved quickly but methodically the passage made two more turns his lungs began to spasm he knew that eventually reflexes would quickly kick in and make him gasp but blind with no idea how far he had yet to traverse he had no choice but to squeeze past his animal instincts jacks head began to pound lights swirled in multicolor spectrums knowing he was close to drowning he slowly exhaled a bit of air from his lungs this gave his body a false sense that he was about to breathe his lungs relaxed the trick bought him a bit more time he kicked onward periodically blowing out a bit more air but eventually this last ruse failed him his lungs were almost empty his body screamed for oxygen jack strained to see searching for some clue to how far he had to travel but darkness lay all around him there was no sign of an end to the tunnel he knew he was lost his arms scrabbled but he had no strength his fingers dug at the rock then a flicker of light appeared far ahead was it real or was he hallucinating close to death either way he forced his leaden limbs to move he heard a muffled explosion behind him the noise reverberating through his bones he glanced over his shoulder just as the shock wave struck him he was shoved roughly by a surge of water tumbled in the tide bumping along the walls water surged up his nose with the last of his air he choked it back out blindly he pawed around him it took him a second to realize walls no longer surrounded him he was out of the tunnel jack crawled toward the surface air all he needed was one breath he stared up and saw starlightand a moon kicking writhing he fought upward his fingers broke the surface just as his lungs gave out and spasmed sucking saltwater through his nose and mouth he choked and gasped his body wracked as it sought to expel the water then his hair was grabbed and his head pulled out of the water into air into light jack looked up the moon had come down to the sea a circle so bright he twisted aroundor was flung around get that light out of his face voices surrounded him familiar voices the voices of the dead he saw a dark visage bent over him it was an old friend come to take him away he reached numbly up as darkness again swept over him in his head he whispered his friends name charlie pm is he going to be okay lisa asked charlie hauled jacks limp body into the pontoon boat youre the doctor you tell me he rolled jack over pulled off the waterlogged backpack and pumped a wash of saltwater from his drowned chest jack coughed and vomited out more hes breathing at least lisa bent over jacks form but we need to get him back to the deep fathom hell need oxygen the motor revved as robert at the stern gunned the engine and spun the launch toward the waiting ship the fathom lay not far across the bay two other police cutters patrolled back and forth along the edge of the ruins earlier charlie had spent half the evening trying to convince the local authorities to aid him in his search for jack and the others no one had listened insisting he wait until morning then a frantic call had come in from professor nakano relating an attack upon their party at nan madol now motivated the police had converged on the location arriving with the fathom to find the place already deserted apparently spanglers assault team had been tipped off for just as they entered the bay a large blast blew apart one of nan madols tiny islets already in the fathoms launch charlie had aimed for the site knowing there must be a reason for the explosion as they neared the reefs edge robert spotted a bubbling surge he aimed for it just as a pale hand broke the surface then the fingers sank back down it would have been easy to miss the sea gods must have been watching over their captain he thought afterward in the boat jack groaned and struggled to right himself his eyelids fluttered but he did not regain consciousness charlie leaned down to his ear and whispered rest mon we got you youre safe his words seemed to sink in jacks limbs relaxed his colors looking better lisa said but she herself was as pale as a ghost bloodless with fear and worry if they had arrived even a minute later robert spoke up from the rear he had a radio pressed to his ear the police say theyll search the ruins until sunup he lowered the radio but it looks like the ops team got clean away damn those bastards charlie swore if i ever get my bloody hands on them pm david stormed down the narrow stairs of the small commandeered police cutter his teams escape had been too damn close over the radio he received word of the police at the same time his assault team found jack pressed for time david had ordered explosive charges set around the islet then ordered all of them to evacuate to the boat for a black ops mission exposure or capture was worse than death working efficiently they left no trail behind gathering their dead they quickly vanished into the maze of atolls and islands all told it took less than five minutes to evacuate the site even so it had been a close call running without his lights david had watched the first police cutter its sirens blaring enter the bay just as he slipped away the explosion helped cover their escape distracting the arriving ships still never in his career had he come so close to capture scowling david reached the lower level of the ship and crossed to a steel door he tapped in the electronic code and shoved into the small cell beyond though he had lost two good men on this mission the sortie hadnt been a total failure inside the cell the canadian anthropologist was tied spreadeagled to the bed she struggled against her bonds as he entered gagged her eyes grew large at the sight of him give it up you cant escape he slipped his diving knife from its thigh sheath and crossed toward her instead of crying or struggling further she just glared at him sitting on the edge of the bed he reached out with the knife and cut her gag she spit out the wad of cloth you bastard david fingered the edge of his blade were gonna have a little chat professor grace lets hope i dont have to free your tongue with this blade he spotted a trickle of blood running from her hairline down her neck reached out and pressed his thumb against the lump there she winced it was the spot where he had bludgeoned her with the butt of his rifle after discovering her hiding place her ruse with the penlight had come close to working he dug his thumb into the tender spot eliciting a sharp cry from her now are you done with your little tricks she spat at him the spittle striking his cheek he let it dribble down not bothering to wipe it away just so we both understand each other he grabbed her between the legs she was still damp from the swim through the canals he squeezed her hard she gasped her eyes growing wide and tried to squirm from his touch get away from me you goddamn bastard he held her tight though my bosses may want you alive to pick your brain that doesnt mean we cant hurt you in ways you never imagined so lets start again wheres the crystal you mentioned in your email to kirkland i dont know what youre talking about wrong answer he said with a hard smile a knock on the door drew him around from his play he saw rolfe standing at the threshold still in his wet suit half unzipped the man eyed their prisoner then his gaze returned to david sir jeffreys has continued to monitor the police bands someum startling news has come through rolfe nodded to the prisoner perhaps outside the woman spoke from the bed jacks alive isnt he david struck her with the heel of his hand mind your manners bitch rolfe nervously shifted his feet shes right sir theyve dragged kirkland from the ocean hes hurt but alive david felt a surge of heat goddamn it cant that man stay dead thats not all what hehes aboard the deep fathom david was too stunned to speak rolfe explained i dont know how but his ship is here closing his eyes rage swelled through david at every turn kirkland had thwarted him he swung to the bound woman kirkland had risked his own life so she could escape why he studied her he sensed an edge here a way of turning this to his advantage david stood up and pointed back at their prisoner haul her ass on deck pm jack woke slowly it took him several breaths to realize where he was the teak paneling the chest of drawers the captains table and hutch it was his own cabin aboard the deep fathom it made no sense well look whos up a voice said he turned his head noticing for the first time the oxygen mask strapped to his face tubes led to a portable tank he lifted a hand to brush it away leave it jack focused on his bedside companion lisa beyond her he saw charlie mollier standing over her shoulder at the sound of his masters voice elvis lifted his head from the floor and rested it on the bedside who did you expect lisa straightened his pillow do you feel strong enough to sit up jacks mind fumbled trying to recall his situation he remembered the chase through the ruins of nan madol the struggle through the underwater tunnel butyoure all dead he coughed thickly as he pushed up then groaned loudly careful lisa helped him sit up cushioning his back with pillows ow every inch of him ached he lifted his arms and saw an iv line trailing to a bag of saline his arms were smeared with salve and bandages were supposed to be dead charlie said with a toothy smile mon youre the lucky one to be alive he coughed again it felt as if someone had scoured his lungs with a brillo pad but the bomb charlie sat on the edge of his bed oh about that sorry but we needed to make everyone think we were sunk the bomb is down in my lab locked away jack shook his head then regretted it grimacing at the pain what the hell happened he barked with irritation charlie related the events the crew had found the bomb and robert recognized the trigger as a radio receiver with lisas skill at electronics it was a simple matter to remove the receiver but they knew whoever had set it would not be satisfied unless the ship blew up so they placed a call to jack and warned him about the bomb knowing that if someone were eavesdropping they would probably trigger the device which they did charlie explained when we saw the detached receiver blink we knew the signal to blow the bomb was being sent so we staged our own deaths dumped a bunch of oil and fuel threw in some deck chairs and floaters then lit the whole mess on fire jacks eyes had grown wide by now from there we just hightailed it here to pohnpei of course we had to run silent no communication of any sort or wed blow the ruse butbut jack felt his old anger returning fueling his strength he pushed off his oxygen mask and glowered at the two of them do you have any idea how worried i was charlie looked innocently at him so what are you sayingyoud rather we all blew up jack stared at charlies hurt expression then burst out laughing he held his sides against the pain of course not he glanced up at them his eyes began to tear up you have no idea what it means to see you all here lisa reached over and gave him a quick hug just rest youve had a rough day jack suddenly remembered but what about spangler and the others charlie looked to lisa then back at jack spanglers long gone but ive been in contact with professor nakano she was hoping you knew what had happened to dr grace theyve been unable to find her jack felt a sick lump in his gut what does she mean i left karen with her charlie shook her head the police are still questioning professor nakano on one of their boats she asked if she could join us here i said it would be okay jack nodded but his mind spun where was karen what had happened running footsteps sounded in the hall robert burst into the room and eyed the others thank god youre awake jack what is it a radio call he was out of breath from david spangler he wants to speak to you jack swung his legs off the bed moving elvis aside he motioned lisa to the iv unhook me lisa paused do it im fine now ive survived worse lisa peeled back the surgical tape and slid out the catheter covering the site with a small bandaid she glanced at charlie with concern jack stood wobbling on his feet charlie reached out to steady him but jack waved him away cmon lets see what this bastard wants now as a group they climbed up to the pilothouse jack grabbed the mike to the vhf radio kirkland here spanglers voice crackled from the radio jack glad to hear youre up and about rumor is you got pretty shook up and fuck you too what do you want it seems you have something i want and i have something you want what are you talking about a new voice came on the line jack he clutched the phone tighter karen are you okay spangler answered shes enjoying our company now lets talk business i have no need for this woman all i want is that bit of crystal jack switched off the transmitter and looked at lisa my pack its down in your cabin jack returned to the radio what are you proposing an even exchange the crystal for the woman then we all part friends and forget this ever happened right jack thought he trusted david about as far as he could throw him but he had little choice when just so no one tries to pull any stunts lets say dawn tomorrow at sea in the light of day fine but i pick the location a tentative plan began to gel agreedbut if i see a single police vehicle the woman gets cut up into bitesized pieces and fed to the sharks understood then well meet at dawn off the eastern coast of nahkapw island jack spelled the name out do you know where that is i can find it ill see you there the radio went dead jack rehooked the mike you know its a trap charlie said jack slumped into the pilots seat oh yeah no doubt about it change of course august am off the east coast of nahkapw island micronesia half an hour before sunrise jack swam through dark water he checked the glowing dial on his dive watch so far he was on schedule he had left the stern deck of the deep fathom ten minutes ago outfitted in a body glove neoprene wet suit fins tanks and buoyancy compensator he had long ago worked out of his aches and pains he swam steadily kicking his fins slowly but deeply sweeping rapidly along the seabed he swerved cleanly around another stone column that loomed out of the darkness equipped with roberts nightdive gear a small ultraviolet flashlight strapped to each wrist and a night vision mask he had no difficulty seeing he glanced at his compass maintaining his pace toward where spanglers police cutter floated an hour before dawn both mens ships had arrived on the eastern coast of nahkapw island each party maintained a cautious half nautical mile between them awaiting dawn but jack was already in the water before his ship had even come to a stop his plan required speed stealth and the cover of predawn earlier he had been faxed the layout of the pohnpeian police cutter and the code to the cipher lock of this particular ships brig if karen was held anywhere it was there or so he hoped another stone column appeared then another jack slowed ahead walls and crumbled buildings appeared all thickly coated with coral and waving fronds of kelp jack lifted his wrist lights more structures and facades stretched into the distance here was the sunken stone village of kahnihnw namkhet karen had described the place yesterday on the way to nan madol it was the reason he had chosen this spot the police cutters were outfitted with sonar and jack needed as much cover as possible to swim up on spanglers ship undetected he dove along the bottom sticking close to the columns walls and buildings he wanted to cast as little sonar signature as possible as he approached within an eighth of a mile of his target he began winding in a circuitous path attempting to keep stone walls between him and the ship overhead he saw the cutters searchlights basking over the waters through his night vision mask the place was lit up like a christmas tree he continued even more cautiously pausing and waiting in alcoves and behind piles of tumbled stone finally he found himself directly under the keel of the ship it floated thirtyfive feet above he checked his watch he was now a few minutes behind schedule the sun would soon be up emptying his buoyancy compensator jack settled to the sea bottom forty feet under the cutters keel he hid in the shadow of a thickwalled fortification wriggling he wormed out of his tanks kicked off his fins and dropped his weights he kept a bite on the air regulator as he did taking a few good breaths for the swim up bent over he unstrapped the second smaller reserve tank from his hip the thermossize pony tank was for karen he placed it beside his own gear all was in order straightening he patted his belt and doublechecked that the two waterproof plastic bags were still in place satisfied he switched off his uv lights darkness closed around him ready jack spit out the regulator and shot toward the surface kicking to aim for the stern as he raced upward he slowly exhaled compensating for the change in pressure he was rising too fast for safety but could not risk being exposed for too long within a few seconds his palm touched the smooth underside of the hull he worked toward the rear careful of the idling prop in the shadow of the stern he surfaced and pushed back his mask he had painted his face and hands with engine grease to limit any reflection he spotted one of spanglers men leaning on the rail a cigarette hung from his lips jack listened he heard no others but couldnt take any chances sliding to the starboard side he pulled out a mirror attached to a telescoping pole from his belt and extended it toward the rail in the mirrors reflection he surveyed the stern deck there was only the single guard good he thought with the cutters bow pointing toward the fathom they had posted little security at the rear he twisted the pole searched the ships forward section and spotted movement two men maybe more jack quickly lowered and secured the mirror then sidled back to the stern ladder he tested it with a hand the safety ladder was permanent secured with bolts so it shouldnt rattle from his belt he removed one of the clear plastic bags his hand settled around the grip of the pistol inside raising it above the water he poked his finger through the thin plastic to rest a finger on the trigger the safety was already off he waited for an opportunity as he did his eyes flicked to his watch the eastern horizon was already beginning to glow with the approach of dawn cmon damn you overhead the guard flicked his cigarette into the sea the glowing butt arced over jacks head and hit the water with a sizzle yawning the guard turned and leaned his back against the rail fishing in a pocket the man pulled out a pack of winstons he tapped it trying to free one of the cigarettes onehanded jack pulled himself up on the ladder planted his feet then pointed his gun and fired he covered the dull sound of the pistols silencer with an inconspicuous cough gore splattered the white deck jack reached out and grabbed the mans body as it fell using the mans dead weight for leverage he clambered over the rail then lowered the limp body to the deck in a crouch he ran to the cutters external reserve fuel tank freed the second plastic bag and pressed a red button swallowing hard he checked his watch then tucked the package beside the steel barrel he twisted around and darted to the door leading to the lower deck stairs gun pointed forward he peeked around the open door no one was there swinging it wide he raced down the dimly lit stairs to the lower deck at the end of the passageway lay a stainless steel door with a single tiny window jack entered the passage cautiously crates and rolls of tarpaulin were stored in the lower passage creating potential hiding places he continued carefully gun pointed ahead of him searching corners and blind spots no one was about reaching the far door he glanced through the tiny window and bit back a sigh of relief karen was tied to the thin bed inside jack quickly tapped in the code to the electronic cipher lock and heard the telltale click of the lock releasing he grabbed the door and yanked it open taking no chances he rolled into the room ready for an ambush he spun weapon ready no guards karen struggled in her bonds eyes wide with surprise jack as he stepped toward her jack realized that it was not surprise in her voice but fear he heard a rustling behind him from the doorway and turned around in the hall david stood with a gun pointing at his chest the crumpled tarpaulin hed been hiding under was now a cape about his shoulders drop your weapon kirkland jack hesitated then lowered his weapon and placed it on the floor david shrugged off the tarpaulin kick your gun here hands raised scowling jack did as hed been ordered you are so predictable jack always the hero david moved into the room with the right bait i knew i could lure you here but i must say you havent lost your training you got past my own men without alerting any of them he lifted the pistol luckily i trust no one but myself you never were a team player spangler thats why i was promoted over you as his opponents face reddened with anger jack spoke more slowly thats whats really got a corn cob up your ass about me isnt it its not your sister its not jennifers death you couldnt stand a commoner like me beating a purebred aryan stud like yourself could you david took an angry step toward him leveling the gun at his head dont ever speak jennifers name again jack risked a glance at his watch fifteen seconds he had to keep david angry and close quit the act spangler your sister and i had long talks about you i know about you and your father sputtering david pointed the gun his face was almost purple what did she tell youwhatever it was it was all lies he never touched me jack crinkled his brow long ago jennifer had mentioned that david had been physically abused by his father but had it gone further jack lowered his voice conspiratorially thats not the way i heard it david stepped nearer shut the fuck up five seconds jack braced his legs his hands formed fists spittle flew from davids lips in rage he never touched me one jack swung a fist as the explosion roared through the ship the deck bucked underfoot his fist glanced off davids jaw knocking him aside the pistol went off a wild shot the bullet dug into the wall behind jack he spun and kicked the gun from davids hand it went flying across the floor david lunged jack instinctively dodged to the side and as he swung back around realized the mistake his reflexes had betrayed him david might have been an asshole but he was a keen killer he landed near jacks discarded pistol which had been his intent and david rolled toward the weapon karen yelled from the bed run jack he froze hell kill you no his superiors want me alive go jack paused david reached to the gun run karen screamed swearing jack darted through the door slamming it behind him ahead smoke filled the hall flames danced at the top of the stairs jack tore into a neighboring cabin the bomb primed with a small bit of c from davids own bomb had been meant as a distraction so he and karen could escape jack crossed the cabin and tugged down the folded emergency ladder cinching down his diving mask he mounted the ladder and twisted the release to the aft decks hatch an alarm sounded flinging back the small door he dove out he rolled across the deck and to his feet men were running with buckets and hoses one stopped and blocked his escape mouth open in surprise as the man dropped his bucket and reached to a holstered pistol jack ran at him elbowing him across his adams apple the guard fell back gagging his way clear jack dove over the starboard rail holding his mask he struck the water then kicked and dug his way toward the bottom he flipped on his ultraviolet wrist lights just as bullets began to ping and zing through the water around him he ignored the threat and searched for where hed stored his equipment he quickly found it hidden in the shadow of the crumbling wall jack took a quick drag from the pony tanks regulator then tossed it aside karen would not be needing it he looked up the cutter remained topside but it wouldnt be there for long the exploding fuel tank was the signal for charlie to call in the police the original plan was for he and karen to hide down here until the police chased them off as he fit his feet into his fins jack spotted movement from the corner of his eye he twisted around glancing up small metallic objects no bigger than soda cans were sinking into the water around him a dozen maybe more as he watched one of them struck a tall column fifteen yards away the explosion threw jack to the sand slamming the air from his lungs his ears flared with pain bits of rock pelted him blind for a moment he rolled across the sea floor as his vision snapped back he spotted a dozen other charges falling around him another trap he had less than five seconds until the area was blown to fragments grabbing his buoyancy vest and attached air tank he twisted the vest around and jammed his arms in the wrong way the tank instead of on his back lay upside down on his chest swinging with his hips he jammed the tank against a nearby stone wall and the valve snapped off compressed oxygen exploded out the tank now a rocket jetted away hugging the tank tight to his chest jack rode it away from the cascade of depth charges fighting for control his back slammed into the side of one of the submerged ruins a rib snapped with a jolt of fire he bit his lips against the pain and twisted his arms more snugly in the tangled buoyancy vest using his fins and legs he roughly guided his trajectory through the maze of columns and walls shooting like a pinball through an underwater arcade game as he rode the explosions blasted behind him he felt each charge as if kicked by a mule a large chunk of basalt flew past him and bounced across the sand in seconds jacks flight slowed as the air evacuated from the tank he swam and kicked to put additional distance between him and the depth charges finally he could not ignore the fire in his lungs he dumped the expired tank and pushed for the surface the upper waters were no longer midnight blue but a deep aqua the sun was rising he paddled toward the weak light and sucked air as his head broke the surface his broken rib complained with each breath but the relief of fresh air overwhelmed the ache he swung around the morning was misty heavy with the promise of rain seventy yards away the seas still roiled around the police cutter it looked as if the ship floated on a boiling pan of water as he watched one last explosion blew to the surface casting a geyser of water high into the air in the distance the multiple sirens of police vessels whined closer the diesel motor of spanglers cutter began to roar its bow end surged up as the ship took flight wakes churned and the boat swept away jack watched helpless hurt as he tread in place a sense of defeat washed over him he had survived but hed lost karen and no matter what she argued her life was on a short fuse once her usefulness ended she would be eliminated off near the coast the cutter raced away moving faster disappearing around the headlands of nahkapw island as he stared hopeless a light rain began to fall pebbling the seas around him then he rolled onto his stomach and began the long swim back to the deep fathom am off the coast of pingelap atoll three hours after jacks escape david stood in the pilothouse of the sleek cutter rain sluiced and beat against the window the storm was worsening but he did not care the cover of rain and mist had allowed them to escape once again hidden by the heavy morning fog they had traveled over fifty miles putting as much distance as possible between them and pohnpei island off to the north he could see the small atoll of pingelap his men were busily offloading their equipment into the cutters launch after they finished and collected their prisoner they would scuttle the ship and travel to the nearby empty beach an evac helicopter was already on its way to collect them over the scrambled radio david listened as nicolas ruzickov continued to chastise him not only had the mission almost been a total failure it had been a sloppy one implicating the us government the american embassy on pohnpei was already spinning the events like a whirling top extolling the local authorities and spouting assurances that they would root out the culprits involved the ambassador had vigorously denied any knowledge of davids men or what they were doing at nan madol funds were already being wired into the private accounts of critical pohnpeian officials david knew there was no problem or embarrassment that couldnt be made to disappear by throwing enough cash at it by tomorrow all evidence of us involvement would be muddied away ruzickov finished his tirade i have enough problems with the war i dont need to be cleaning up your messes commander yes sir but jack kirkland your report stated that you eliminated him we believe so david remembered the seas erupting around the ship bobbling and rocking the vessel there was no way jack could have survived he thought but his eyes narrowed he could not be sure the bastard had more lives than a damn cat but his crew sir we believe they still possess the crystal that objective no longer matters the researchers managed to collect their own sample theyre experimenting with it as we speak and so far the initial results are intriguing but more importantly cortez believes translating the inscription on the obelisk may accelerate his research so forget the fragment of crystal your missions top priority is to bring the anthropologist to neptune base david clenched his fist yes sir after you accomplish this youll help the navys team extract the crystal pillar and return it to the states only then will you be allowed to tie up these loose ends anger ran clear in the former marines voice heat rose to davids face never before had he been reprimanded by the cia director three dead one severely injured the mission would be a black mark on his record did you hear me commander spangler david had stopped listening too filled with anger and shame yes sir well evacuate the professor to the sea base immediately a long sigh followed commander the conditions out east are worsening as we speak a major sea battle is raging around taiwan okinawa is under repeated missile attacks and in washington there is already talk of a nuclear response ruzickov paused to let the significance sink in so you understand the importance of your efforts if there is any way to utilize the power hidden in that crystal it must be discovered as soon as possible every means must be utilized to accomplish this end private wars and vendettas have no place here david closed his eyes i understand i wont fail you again prove it commander bring that woman to the neptune were already on our way very good the line went dead david held the receiver a moment fuck you he added silently then slammed down the phone in the distance a whumpwhump echoed over the waters their evac helicopter was early david cinched up his jacket and pushed out the door into the rainstorm he crossed to rolfe the lieutenant commander turned at his approach get the woman up here david ordered him i think shes still unconscious then carry her were leaving now david watched as his secondincommand swung away he placed his fists on his hips maybe he had been too rough on the woman he thought recalling how after losing kirkland he had vented his frustration on her but he would no longer tolerate failures not from himself not from his men not from her rolfe reappeared climbing from the doorway with their captive slung over a shoulder the rain seemed to revive the woman a bit she stirred raising her face her left eye was bruised and blood dribbled from her nose and split lip she coughed thickly david turned away satisfied she would live no i wasnt too rough pm uss gibraltar luzon strait the strip of water between taiwan and the philippines was tight with ships many with guns blazing admiral houston watched the fighting through the greentinted windows of the bridge overhead the sky was choked with smoke turning day to a gloomy twilight that morning the gibraltar had joined the battle group of the uss john c stennis consisting of the massive nimitzclass aircraft carrier its air wing and destroyer squadron just as the gibraltar arrived an attack by the chinese air force began jets roared across the skies bombarding the ships below with missile fire in response sea sparrow antiaircraft missiles blasted skyward a handful of jets exploded tumbling in fiery streams into the ocean but the true battle was only beginning the chinese navy over the horizon had soon joined the conflict bombarding the region with rocket barrages all day the sea war had raged off to the south a destroyer the uss jefferson city lay burning an evacuation was under way asw helicopters from the gibraltar were already in the air rising like hornets to aid in the defense of their section of the sea to houstons side captain brenning shouted orders to his bridge crew houston stared out over the smoke and chaos both sides were chewing each other apart and for what an alarm sounded the phalanx closein weapons system at the front end of the islands superstructure swung its mm gatling guns and began firing chugging out fifty rounds a second off on the starboard side an incoming missile a seaskimmer blew apart about two thousand yards away orders were screamed rocket fragments rained down upon the gibraltar pounding and peppering the ships kevlar armor panels the ship bore the assault with minimal damage sir one of the lieutenants pointed two of the asw helicopters pelted by the missile shards tumbled into the sea at the same time the phalanx ciws defensive guns near the fantail sponson rattled as more missiles bore down on the beleaguered ship mortars were launched by the slq throwing up a cloud of chaff against the attack the gibraltar echoed and rattled with frag impacts captain brenning said admiral we must retreat the zone is too hot for the helicopters houston clenched his fists but he nodded order the flight deck cleared as his command was relayed houston turned toward the jefferson bearing silent witness to the death of so many sailors he watched as the fires worsened tiny lifeboats fled the sinking giant then a huge explosion blew near the ships stern and a fireball rolled over the ship lifeboats too near were thrown through the air the great ships bow rose ominously its stern sinking in seconds the jefferson slipped deeper and deeper houston refused to look away sir a lieutenant yelled from the radar station i have multiple vampires vectoring in from the north thirty missile signatures across the board captain brenning responded screaming orders houston continued to watch the jefferson sink he knew the limits to the gibraltars defense systems and made a silent prayer for his crew as the first explosion blew out the fantail section of his ship pm en route to neptune base karen sat in the sea stallion helicopter through the windows she watched dully as the ocean passed beneath her her face ached and she could not completely swallow away the taste of blood the beating from this morning had left her weak and sick she had already vomited twice across from her spangler lay slumped in his seat eyes closed lightly snoring three of his men took up the other seats strapped in one of them spanglers secondincommand stared at her she glared back at him he looked away but not before she spotted the flicker of shame on his face she returned her attention to the sea thinking plotting they might hurt her physically but she would not give up fighting as long as she lived she would strive for a way to thwart spangler and his team as she stared at the passing water she leaned against the cool window even with all the horror of the past day one worry remained foremost in her mindjack bound to the cells bed she had heard the muffled explosions felt the ship rock she closed her eyes remembering the pain in his eyes as he swung through the door and left her behind was he alive she made a silent promise to herself she would survive if only to answer that question pm deep fathom off the northern coast of pohnpei island jack stood at the head of the worktable in roberts wet lab his crew were seated around its length including two newcomers to the fathom miyuki and mwahu the pair had boarded a few hours ago the police had questioned all of them but it was clear where the blame lay they were released the chief of police seemed more interested in seeing them gone from the area than in getting to the bottom of the nights attack and kidnapping jack suspected an unseen hand urging the whole matter to be brushed under the rug rogue pirates was the final lame answer the chief of police promised to continue the search for the missing anthropologist but jack knew it was a line of bullshit as soon as they left the matter would fade away so what do we do from here charlie asked with a wince of complaint from his wrapped rib cage jack lifted the backpack at his feet it was karens bag he dumped its contents on the worktable the crystal star rattled on the tabletop beside it dropped the platinumbound book recovered from the crypt we need answers he stated fiercely he slid the book toward miyuki first we need this translated miyuki opened it jack knew what lay inside earlier he had studied it himself its pages were thin sheaves of platinum crudely etched with more of the hieroglyphic writing gabriel and i will get to work on it immediately mwahu leaned over the book as miyuki closed it he touched the single symbol drawn into its top cover a triangle within a circle khamwau he said i know this mark my father teach it means danger thats a real surprise kendall mcmillan said sarcastically eyes turned in the accountants direction jack had offered to leave the nervous man on pohnpei but he had refused stating with the coverup going on here i wouldnt stand a rats ass of a chance getting off this island alive so he had stayed on the fathom returning his attention to the book jack said mwahu since you know some of the ancient language maybe you could help miyuki with its translation next jack passed the crystal star toward charlie i need you to research its properties and abilities the geologist smiled eyeing the artifact greedily george jack turned to the grayhaired historian i want you to continue researching the lost ships of this dragons triangle see if you can spot any other patterns he nodded im working on a few theories already kendall mcmillan frowned speaking up again how is any of this going to pull our asses out of the fire why dont we just lay low keep running because wed never stop running theyd never stop hunting us the only way out is to discover the true reason for the crash of air force one jack leaned on his fists that answer lies at the heart of it all i just know it lisa spoke up from the other end of the table but kendalls right what are we going to do in the meantime where are we going to go back to where we started back to the crash site lisa frowned but why its heavily guarded by the military we wont have a chance of getting near there jacks voice grew tight because if david is heading anywhere its there dark matters august am situation room white house lawrence nafe listened to the late night reports from each of his joint chiefs the news was grim the chinese naval and air forces were holding us forces at bay the secretary of the navy stood at the foot of the table following the earthquakes military bases up and down the west coast are still struggling to dig out of the rubble hampering an ability to sustain a prolonged conflict across the pacific a second aircraft carrier the uss abraham lincoln and its battle group are en route from the indian ocean but its still three days out so what are you saying nafe asked exhausted and irritable hank riley commandant of the marine corps answered were fighting this battle with one hand tied behind our back sir our supply lines across the pacific are weak at best after the tidal waves honolulu is still under three feet of water its air bases ive already heard from the air force chief of staff nafe said sourly i need answers alternatives general hickman chairman of the joint chiefs stood we do have one option left to consider and what is that as has been mentioned already were fighting this battle with one fist tied behind our backs we can change that nafe sat up straighter this was what he came to hear answers not problems what do you propose a limited nuclear response a hush fell over the situation room nafes hands gripped his knees he had already discussed such an option with nicolas ruzickov earlier in the day nafe tried to keep the excitement out of his voice have you formulated a plan the general nodded we break the blockade decisively a ballsout response military targets only nafes eyes narrowed go on from two ohioclass subs off the coast of the philippines we strike three critical zones with trident two missiles the general pointed out the targets on the highlighted map itll break the back of the blockade the chinese will be forced to retreat but more importantly theyll get the message how serious we are to protect our interests in the region nafe flicked a look toward nicolas ruzickov a similar scenario had been proffered by the cia director it was clear his influence and stringpulling had reached all the way to the joint chiefs nafe assumed a look of somber thoughtfulness playing the concerned patrician a nuclear response he shook his head its a sorry day that the chinese have driven us to yes sir the general agreed bowing his head nafe sighed sagging as if defeated but tragically i see no other choice proceed immediately after an appropriately long pause he dragged himself to his feet and may god forgive us all he turned and strode to the rooms exit flanked by his secret service once out the door nicolas ruzickov was not long in catching up with him in the hall matching his stride nafe allowed a slim smile to shine for a moment well done nick well done indeed am deep fathom central pacific lisa spotted jack by the bow rail staring at the horizon overhead the skies were slategray with thin scudding clouds and a perpetual haze that even the noon sun had failed to burn away jack stood in his customary red trunks a loose shirt open in front elvis sat by his side leaning against jacks leg lisa could not help but smile at the loyalty and affection in the simple gesture one of jacks hands lightly ruffled the fur behind the dogs ear lisa crossed to him compelled by the need to get something off her chest jack he turned toward her and winced fingering the ace bandage wrap around his chest what she moved to his side put her hands on the rail the solitary moment gone elvis loped to a sunny spot on the deck and sprawled out lisa stared out at sea silent for a moment then spoke jack why are we doing this what do you mean she turned to him leaning a hip against the rail weve got the crystal miyuki says shes close to a translation why dont we just keep a low profile until we have answers then send the entire story out to the new york times jack gripped the rail with fists if we did that jennifer would be dead before the first paper hit the stands silently lisa stared at him searching his face to see if he recognized his slip of the tongue he just kept staring off to sea jennifer what you just said jennifer would be as good as dead jack finally looked at her his face a mask of hurt and confusion you know what i meant he mumbled waving off any significance lisa grabbed his hand shes not jennifer i know that jack snapped lisa kept him from turning away talk to me jack he sighed but his shoulders remained tight karens in this danger because of me ii ran off leaving her with that madman and you explained why karen was right staying would have only gotten you both killed if shes as strong as you say she is shell survive only as long as shes useful to that bastard he twisted away i have to try to rescue her i cant just keep running away lisa touched his shoulder lightly jack for as long as ive known you youve been running away from jennifer the shuttle accident your past whats stopping you now what does this woman mean to you ii dont know jack sagged head hanging over the rail studying the waves finally he looked at lisa again but id like the chance to find out she slipped an arm around his waist thats all i wanted to hear she leaned her head on his shoulder swallowed back the twinge of sadness and the ache in her heart jack had finally opened himself if only a crack to a womanand it wasnt her he put his arm around her shoulders and pulled her close seeming to sense her sorrow im sorry im not jack but christ youve picked a hell of a time to fall in love he returned her smile and kissed her forehead they stood in each others arms until mwahu called from an open doorway miyuki says come jack slipped from beside her shes translated the language mwahu nodded vigorously come lisa followed jack as he strode after the darkskinned islander belowdecks miyuki had set up a computer station atop roberts long worktable the work space was crowded with printouts scribbled notes and coffee mugs miyuki looked up from a sheaf of papers with a worried expression youve succeeded jack asked she nodded straightening her papers gabriel succeeded but mwahus help was critical with his ability to apply context to a score of symbols gabriel was able to compile the entire vocabulary hes translated everything the crypts book the pillars inscription even the writing in the chatan pyramids great what have you learned she frowned the obelisk inscription appears to be mostly prayers asking the gods for a good harvest fertility that sort of thing she teased out one page and read may the sun shine on the empty fields and make them fertilemay the bellies of our women grow heavy with children as plentiful as the fish of the sea not much use jack concurred but the other writings are more interesting they both describe the same thing an ancient cataclysm jack picked up the book from the table karen suggested something like that a lost continent sunk during a great disaster she was right he raised the platinum book what does this say miyuki looked grim it appears to be the diary of horonko our most ancient teacher mwahu interjected miyuki nodded it recounts how his people a seafaring tribe once fished and traveled throughout the pacific some ten to twelve thousand years ago though they were fairly nomadic their homeland was a large continent in the middle of the pacific they lived in small coastal villages and seaside towns then one day a hunter returned from a journey to the inner continent with a piece of the suns magic a magical stone that shone and glowed horonko spoke at length of how the gift granted his people the ability to make stones fly the crystal jack said exactly they excavated other crystalsall at the same location deep in the interior of their continent they carved tools and worship fetishes what does it say about the crystals properties lisa interrupted maybe charlie ought to listen to this jack nodded gather everyone they all should hear this it took less than five minutes to reconvene in roberts lab once everyone was settled lisa motioned to miyuki go on with a nod miyuki quickly repeated the story then continued anew these crystals changed horonkos people they were able to build great cities and temples throughout many lands as they spread their society constructed elaborate mines searching for more crystals then one day they found a rich vein of crystal buried in the heart of a hilltop over the course of fifteen years they excavated the entire hill away exposing the crystal spire the pillar jack exclaimed so it would appear they worshiped the spire believing it a blessing from their gods it became a great pilgrimage spot in fact horonko was one of the priests of the pillar and this great cataclysm thats the strange part miyuki replied turning to her computer system gabriel could you read the translation starting from section twenty certainly professor nakano the computer responded from the tiny speakers there came a time of bad omens strange lights were seen in the north ribbons of light like waves of the sea rode the night skies the grounds trembled the people came to the god pillar to pray for help sacrifices were made but on that last day the moon came and ate the sun the goddess of night walked the land an eclipse charlie mumbled gabriel continued the god pillar angry at the moon blazed brightly the ground shook mountains fell seas rose fires opened in the ground swallowing villages but the gods did not forsake us a god of light stepped from the pillar and ordered us to build great ships to gather our flocks and people the god spoke of a terrible time of darkness when the seas would rise up and swallow our land in our great ships we must travel the drowning seas so we gathered our seeds and our animals we built a great ship like noahs ark and the flood lisa whispered gabriel continued his recitation the god spoke true a great darkness filled the skies for many moons the sun was gone fiery pits blazed openings to the lower world killing smoke filled the air it grew hot the seas rose and took our lands in great boats we traveled to the land of big ice far to the south and once there miyuki cut him off thank you gabriel thats enough she stood the remainder of the book relates how the survivors kept their civilizations history alive they traveled all around the world finding other races of man to whom to pass on their stories and teachings until eventually they were spread so thin that their civilization ceased to exist only horonko and a handful of others returned to the grave of their homeland to die he warned those that remained to beware the old places and avoid trespassing lest the angry gods reawaken miyuki sighed it is there the tale ends jack glanced around the room so what do you all think no one spoke jack eyed george does this help with your research into the dragons triangle im not sure the old historian had remained quiet during the discourse smoking a pipe he cleared his throat earlier today i came up with intriguing statistics concerning the lost ships of the region but im not sure what they mean what did you find out let me show you he rifled through his pockets searching one then another finally he yanked out a folded computer printout i plotted the number of recorded disappearances for each year going back a hundred years he unfolded the paper as you can see theres a pattern he tapped the paper the number of incidences peak and trough very regularly the numbers grow to a certain peak then taper back off the size of the peak varies but not the frequency theres a distinct clustering every eleven years bent over the sheet charlie let out a murmur of surprise heads turned in the geologists direction is this significant lisa asked im not sure i need to follow up on a few things charlie turned to george can i borrow this george shrugged its all in my computer whatre you thinking jack pressed charlie shook his head lost in thought not yet he excused himself and crossed to his own lab closing the door behind him they all stared after him until lisa said so jack now its your turn what about karen whats this rescue plan of yours am neptune base the submersible glided toward the deepsea research station from the rear passenger compartment of the twoman sub karen stared in awe after twenty minutes of sinking through an everdeepening gloom the base had appeared below like a rising sun in the dark lit by external lamps its portholes aglow with a warm yellow radiance she almost forgot about her situation as she gaped at the wondrous sight the sub dove toward the docking bay on the underside of the stations lowest tier as the vessel banked around karen noted the trundling boxlike robots at work hauling cables and equipment among them moved other figures men in armored and helmeted deepwater suits they looked like spacemen working on the surface of an alien planet and considering the hostile environment and strangely twisted landscape of tumbled lava pillars it was another world a lantern fish attracted by their movement drew nearer the sub karen stared back through the five inches of glass two strangers from different lands ogling each other then with a flick of its tail it vanished back into the gloom from the forward compartment she heard the muffled voice of the subs pilot attending to the docking procedure confirming and rechecking the stations status an okay must have been given because the sub and its two occupants were rising through a garagedoorsize hatch and into the docking bay in short order the hatch was sealed and the water pumped out soon afterward karen was helped out of the subs cramped compartment she stretched a kink from her back the pilot lieutenant rolfe ordered her to hold out her arms and then undid her handcuffs it was the first time since her capture that she was unfettered rubbing her wrists she gazed around and understood why she was granted this new freedom where could she go there was no better maximumsecurity prison in the world escape was unthinkable a door opened near the rear of the bay a man in his early sixties grayhaired and stocky stormed inside to join them he strode up to the lieutenant what is the meaning of this there was no reason to bring her down here the professor could have aided us just as well topside the risks to her those were my orders dr cortez rolfe said curtly the prisoner is your responsibility from here cortez moved to block the lieutenant then thought better of it and what about these new orders your commander cant be serious youve read the reports the lieutenant climbed back into the pilots seat ill be returning next with commander spangler take up your objections with him cortezs attention shifted to karen his brows furrowing as he took in the condition of her face what the hell happened to her he reached a tentative hand toward her puffy eye but she shied from him cortez swung on the lieutenant answer me goddamn it the lieutenant avoided eye contact take it up with commander spangler he repeated from the subs pilot compartment the researchers face darkened cmon he said brusquely to karen ill have dr obannon take a look at you im fine she said as she followed him toward the exit earlier she had been given a couple of aspirin and a shot of antibiotics she was sore but not incapacitated once through the hatch cortez led her to the upper deck ladders he gave her a running tour of the facility as he guided her up karen listened intently impressed by her surroundings she was two thousand feet underwater it was hard to believe she climbed the ladder up to the second tier where men and women bustled around minilabs heads turned in her direction as she stepped forward whispers were shared she knew what a sight she must look and the level up from here is the living quarters tight but with all the conveniences of home he tried a weak smile karen nodded feeling out of place eyes staring at her cortez sighed im sorry professor grace he said this is hardly the most opportune way for colleagues to meet and colleagues she frowned at him im a prisoner professor cortez her words wounded him that was none of our doing i assure you commander spangler has full control and authority over these facilities with the nation at war we have little say our research here has been labeled a matter of national security liberties have been taken in the name of protecting our nations shores its not my nation im canadian cortez frowned not seeming to see the significance the best way to keep furtherum he frowned at her bruised face abuses of power from occurring is to cooperate to work from within after this is over im sure the government will have a place for you bullshit karen thought she knew where her place would be six feet under shot as a spy but she saw no need to burst this mans bubble so what have you learned down here she asked changing the subject he brightened quite a lot we managed to harvest a small sample of the crystal after a cursory study it has displayed the most surprising properties karen nodded remaining silent about her own knowledge but with the newest directives from washington any further research has been put on hold new directives with the war so close washington now considers the site too vulnerable just yesterday we were ordered to extract the crystal pillar and ship it back to the united states for further study but now even that orders been changed what do you mean initial assays of the sediment and seabed show the spire is but a single pinnacle of a larger sample much larger at the moment weve not even been able to determine the deposits true depth and extent so far the damned thing has defied standard scanning methods all we know is that its massive once word reached washington of our newest discovery our orders were revised his eyes narrowed with worry rather than just the pillar weve been ordered to harvest the entire deposit if possible how are you going to do that he waved her to one of the portholes she peered out in the distance she could just make out a tall spire beyond the lights jacks pillar around the area more of the armorsuited deepsea workers labored who are those men the navys demolitions experts they plan to use explosives to blast a hole into the core of the deposit then mine the load from there karen stared in shock when do they begin tomorrow she turned but the obeliskthe writing he looked stricken too i know ive been trying to urge caution this whole region is geologically unstable weve had daily temblors and even one serious quake two days ago but no one will listen to me thats why regardless of the circumstances of your arrival im glad to have you here with us if we knew what was written on the obelisk it might stay the governments hand longer buy us some time for our own research karen balked at helping her captors but the thought of the ancient artifacts destruction disturbed her even more she stepped away from the porthole what if i can point you in the right direction about the inscription his eyebrows rose with interest she lowered her voice but well need to trust each other he slowly nodded karen said ill need a computer and your current research into the language he waved for her to follow him and kept his voice low rick is our teams archaeologist hes still topside but i can have him transmit the data to an empty workstation good lets get to work as cortez led her to an unoccupied cubicle karen calculated planned as much as it bothered her to deceive the man she had no choice if you can get me an open internet line she said ill show you what ive learned pm deep fathom central pacific jack knocked on charlies door no one had heard from the geologist all day except george klein and afterward the historian locked himself into the ships small library the two were clearly working on something but jack was losing his patience who is it charlie called out his voice hoarse its jack open up a shuffle of noises then the door cracked open what without invitation jack pushed inside what he found startled him charlies usually tidy lab was in a shambles the worktable along one wall was covered in equipment and gadgets in the center of the mess the crystal star was clamped in a stainless steel vise charlies computer displayed inexplicable graphs and tables jack had to step over piles of journals and scientific magazines specific articles were ripped and hung on the bare wall it was as if a hurricane had struck there and charlie looked no better his eyes were redrimmed his lips chapped his clothes baggy shorts and a shirt were stained with ink oil and grease it was hot and humid in the room and sweat soaked his armpits and lower back jack noticed that the rooms single fan had been unplugged to make outlet room for charlies equipment jack yanked a cord shoved in the fans plug and switched it to high christ charlie what are you doing in here the geologist ran a hand through his hair research what do you think he kicked aside some of the scattered magazines and pulled up a chair sitting on its edge have you even slept since i gave you that thing how could i its amazing nothing like this substance has ever been discovered im sure of it ive hit it with every test i can manage here the mass spectrometer the proton magnetometer xray diffraction but it defies everything at this point i couldnt tell you its atomic weight its valence its specific gravity nothing i cant even get the friggin thing to melt he tapped his minioven and this thing heats to a temperature of seven hundred degrees so you dont know what it is jack leaned against the worktable ii have my theories charlie bit his lip but you have to understand my research is still preliminary a lot is still speculative jack nodded i trust your hunches charlie scanned the lab where to begin how about at the beginning well first there was the big bang jack held up a hand not that far back the story goes that far back jacks eyebrows rose id better take you through it a step at a time after i heard your description of the crystals effect on basalt it got me thinking i tried to repeat the effect on other rocks granite obsidian sandstone no luck only basalt why basalt thats just what i wondered basalt is actually hardened magma not only is it abundant in prismatic crystals but its rich in iron too so rich in fact its capable of being magnetic really you remember the strange magnetization of air force ones metal parts the same thing happens to basalt when it comes in close contact with the energized crystal when powered the crystal is able to emit a strange magnetizing energy so how does this magnetization make the mass of the rock change the mass doesnt change only its weight you lost me charlie frowned youve been in space so in space youre weightless right yeah but you still had mass didnt you it is gravity that gives mass its weight the more gravity the more something weighs okay i get that well the converse is true the less gravity the less something weighs jack began to catch on so the crystal is not changing the mass of an object its changing gravitys effect on it exactly making the magnetic basalt weigh less but how charlie rolled a chunk of basalt toward jack he caught it do you even know what gravity is sure itswell itsokay you smartass what is it according to einsteins unified field theory gravity is merely a frequency like a radio station pretty much the frequency of earths gravity has been determined to be hertz somewhere between shortwave radio and infrared radiation if you could get an object to resonate at this frequency it would lose its weight and the crystal can do this yes the crystal emits this energy it magnetizes the basalts iron content which triggers the crystalline structure to resonate vibrating at a frequency equal to gravity the rock loses its weight and you learned all this overnight actually i learned it within the first hour of experimenting with the crystal that was the easy part but understanding the energy radiating from the crystalthat was the hard part charlie grinned tiredly at him youve figured it out i have my theory oh out with it already tell me its dark energy jack sighed sensing another lecture and whats dark energy its a force conjectured by a cosmologist michael turner in an article in the physical review letters charlie nodded to one of the pages taped to the wall after the big bang the universe blew outward spreading in all directions and its still expanding but from the newest studies of the movement of distant galaxies and the brightness of supernovas it is now accepted that the rate of expansion is accelerating i dont understand the universe is expanding faster and faster to explain this phenomenon a new force had to be coineddark energy a strange force that keeps the universe expanding by repelling gravity and you think this energy given off by the crystal may be dark energy its a theory im working to prove but its a theory that could possibly explain the crystals substance too dark energy is tied to another theoretical bit of physics dark matter jack rolled his eyes charlie chuckled what do you see when you look up at the night sky stars exactly mon what astronomers call luminous matter stuff we can see stuff that lights up the sky but there is not enough of the observable stuff to explain the motion of galaxies or the current expansion of the universe according to calculations of physicists for every gram of luminous matter there must be nine grams of matter we cant see invisible matter dark matter exactly charlie nodded his gaze flicking to the crystal we know a lot of the missing matter is just runofthemill stuff black holes dark planets brown dwarves and other material our telescopes just havent been able to detect but with ninety percent of the universes matter still missing most physicists suspect the true source of dark matter will be something totally unexpected like our crystal that emits dark energy why not the crystal acts as a perfect superconductor absorbing energy so completely that most methods for scanning for its presence would fail so astronomers have been looking the wrong way all along rather than in the night sky they should have been looking under their own feet the geologist shrugged jack finally understood charlies drive if he was right the answer to the fundamental mysteries of the universes origin lay in this room not to mention a source of amazing power a power never seen before jack pictured the massive crystal on the seabed floor what could the world do with such an energy source george appeared in the open doorway behind him shuffling papers charlie you shouldoh jack youre here george looked disheveled and out of sorts were you able to find out what i asked charlie asked george nodded a glint of fear in his eyes jack turned to charlie whats going on charlie nodded to george his graph the fact that every eleven years the number of ships missing in the area spiked it got me thinking it looked familiar especially the dates i rechecked georges data his graph follows almost exactly the cycle of sunspot activity every eleven years the sun enters a period of increased magnetic storms sunspots and solar flares reach peaks of activity these peaks coincided with the years when the most vessels vanished in the region and you knew this solar cycle off the top of your head not exactly i was already researching this angle remember on the day of the pacificwide quakes there was an eclipse coinciding with a major solar storm i wondered if there might be some correlation you think the solar storms triggered the quakes and the pillar had something to do with it think about the platinum book even back then the writer reports seeing strange lights in the northern skies before the big quake the aurora borealis it grows more brilliantly and expands far south during a solar storm the ancients were experiencing a peak of solar activity prior to the disaster jack shook his head this is all too much then let me put it all together for you you remember our talk about the dragons triangle a few days back jack nodded and do you remember me telling you how it is exactly opposite the infamous bermuda triangle how the two create some type of axis through the planet that causes disturbances in the magnetic lines of the earth well now i think i have an explanation i would wager there are two massive deposits of this dark matter crystal one under the dragons triangle and one under the bermuda triangle the two poles have been acting like the positive and negative ends of a battery creating a massive electromagnetic field i believe it is this field that drives the earths magma to flow jack tried to wrap his mind around this concept the earths battery are you serious im beginning to think so and if im right those ancients made a horrible mistake by digging free a sliver of this battery and exposing it to direct sunlight they made it vulnerable to the big solar storm a lightning rod if you will the crystal took the solar radiation converted it into dark energy and whipped up the earths magma core creating the tectonic explosion that destroyed the continent and youre suggesting something like that happened here two weeks ago a watereddown version of it yes remember in the past the pillar was on dry land today its insulated by six hundred meters of water the depths served to shield it from the strongest of the storms energy it wouldve taken a significant solar event to trigger the recent quakes george lifted his hand to speak but jack interrupted afraid to lose his train of thought how does all this tie into the presidents plane if it was passing over the site when the crystal was radiating the dark energy could have damaged the jets systems ive noted strange fluxes myself when experimenting with the crystal magnetic spikes em surges even tiny fluctuations in time not unlike your own short lapses in the sub i bet these bursts of energy have been messing with vessels in the area for centuries if what you say is true charlie shrugged i dont purport to be an expert on dark energyat least not yet but can you imagine the devastation here millennia ago quakes that tore apart continents massive volcanic eruptions ash clouds that circled the world floods jack remembered words in the ancient text the time of darkness the insulating layer of ash would have created a greenhouse effect melting the ice caps and drowning their ravaged lands we got off easy charlie said can you imagine living during that time we may have to george said sharply his face stern jack and charlie turned to him george held up a sheet of paper i contacted the marshall space flight center i confirmed what you wanted charlie on july twentyfirst four days before the quakes the yohkoh satellite recorded a massive cme on the suns surface cme jack asked coronal mass ejection charlie translated like a super solar flare they can hurl billions of tons of ionized gas from the suns surface it takes four days for the explosion to hit the earth creating a geomagnetic storm to support my theory i postulated that such a violent event would have been necessary for the submerged pillar to react so severely george sighed they also confirmed that the epicenter for the pacific quakes has been calculated to be where the pillar lies at the spot where air force one crashed charlie lit up i was right not bad for a couple days work jack turned to george the historian held a second piece of paper at which he was glancing nervously you have more news dont you george swallowed after i contacted the space center they forwarded the latest pictures from the japanese satellite another coronal mass ejection occurred just three days ago it was the biggest ever recorded george stared at them a hundred times larger than the last one oh shit charlie said his grin fading away when does nasa expect its energy wave to hit us tomorrow afternoon damn what jack asked whats gonna happen then charlie looked over at him were not talking quakes and tidal waves this time were talking the end of the world pm miyuki sat at the worktable in the marine biology lab in the background she heard the muffled voices of jack and a pair of his crew talking animatedly in the geology suite around her a thousand eyes watched from the clear plastic specimen jars lining the shelves and cabinets it made it hard to concentrate shaking her head against these distractions miyuki continued her own line of research earlier she had gabriel do a global search through all the rongorongo examples gleaned from easter island to see if there were any other references to the pillar or the ancient disaster she had little luck a few scant allusions but nothing significant now she was rereading through the passages in the platinum diary at her elbow the briefcasemounted computer chimed gabriels voice came through the tiny speakers he had been assigned to work out a linguistic equivalent to the language using phonetics supplied by mwahu miyuki looked up from her sheets im sorry to disturb you professor nakano what is it gabriel i have an incoming call from dr grace would you care to take it miyuki almost fell out of her chair karen she slid in front of the computer gabriel patch in the call above the flat monitor the oneinch video camera blinked on on the screen a cascade of pixels slowly formed a jerky image of her friend miyuki leaned near the microphone karen where are you karens computer image flittered i dont have much time i was able to contact gabriel with your coded address for him on the internet he was able to encrypt this video line but i cant trust that someone wont catch on where are you at some undersea research base near jacks obelisk is he there miyuki nodded she leaned back jack come quick the captain of the fathom poked his head out of the geology lab his face worried what is it miyuki stood up and pointed to the screen its karen his eyes widened he fell out the door of the geology lab and stumbled around the table what do you then he came in view of the computers screen he rushed forward leaning close karen is that you pm neptune base karen watched jacks face form in the small square in the lower righthand side of her computer monitor he was alive tears welled in her eyes karen where are you she coughed to clear her throat then briefly summarized the past twentyfour hours her capture the trip by helicopter the imprisonment in the sea base afterward she continued i tossed a bone the researchers way and told them about the rongorongo connection its a useless lead without the additional examples we discovered but they dont know that by feigning cooperation theyve given me a little latitude she looked over her shoulder when a spat of laughter echoed down the curving length of the tier the others are up at dinner or working in private i dont know how long i can keep this line open without arousing suspicion ill find a way to get you out of there jack said trust me karen leaned closer to the screen i wanted you to know theyre planning to blow up the obelisk sometime tomorrow afternoon theyve probed the area and seem to believe theres a larger deposit under it the tip of the proverbial iceberg on the monitor jack glanced to the side you were right charlie of course i was someone said off screen karen frowned what do you mean what do you know she listened as jack sketchily recounted what they had learned from the platinum book and charlies theories karen sat frozen as the story unfolded ancient disasters dark matter solar storms she listened with her mouth hanging open as jack told her of the coming danger oh my god she said when is this storm supposed to strike just after noon tomorrow a new face appeared on the screen jack made the introduction this is charlie mollier the ships geologist so what do we do karen asked sweat trickled down her back she was sure she would be caught any moment tell me about the explosives and intent of the demolition squad charlie said karen explained the navys plan to blast into the core of the crystals main vein jack spoke up maybe thatd be good at least the pillar wont be poking out any longer no charlie said if they succeed itll make matters worse theyll be laying open the very heart of the deposit increasing not lessening the area of exposure to the solar storm the only way to protect against this disaster is to bury the pillar or cleanly clip it off separating it from the main deposit in other words knock down the lightning rod jack said karen checked her watch if the geologist was right they had only seventeen hours what if we specifically target the crystal pillar with the explosives still dangerous charlie mumbled even if you could arrange it the kinetic energy of the blast could be absorbed into the main deposit he shook his head its risky the strength of an explosion sufficient to crack a pillar of that immense size could trigger the very disaster were trying to avoid the video phone line went silent as parties pondered the hopelessness of their situation we need more help charlie mumbled karen chewed on this idea i could try enlisting the aid of the head researcher here dr cortez hes cautioned the navy against blasting the crystal and i dont think hes a big fan of spanglers either i dont know jack said im suspicious of anyone working alongside that bastard but hes a geophysicist karen argued renowned in his field and i could truly use some expert help charlie agreed jack frowned and looked directly into the camera but can we trust him karen she sat quiet for a long moment then sighed i think so but ill need your data ill need to convince him jack turned to charlie can you download your research he nodded and disappeared miyuki spoke from off screen ill compile all the translations and prepare gabriel to transmit everything great jack replied he turned back to the camera and karen thought he seemed to stare right into her heart how are you doing he asked softly considering the fact that im imprisoned a mile under the sea and the worlds gonna end tomorrow im not too bad did they rough you up she remembered her black eye fingering its sore edges no i fell onto a doorknoba few times in a row im sorry karen i shouldnt have gotten you involved in all this she sat straighter dont take the guilt for this jack id rather be where i am now than back at the university oblivious to all this if theres a way to stop whats gonna happen id rather be here on the front lines miyuki spoke from off screen ive got all the data collected but to send it ill need this video line to upload the information jack nodded you hear that yyes karen fought to keep her voice from breaking she hated the thought of losing contact with her friends gabriel will keep monitoring this channel afterward miyuki said use his code if you want to speak to us jack leaned nearer his face filling the little screen be careful karen david is an ass but hes no fool i know they stared at one another for an extra breath jack kissed his fingers and pressed them against the screen ill get you out of there before she could answer the phone line switched off and the video square vanished replacing it was a colored bar filling slowly with the incoming data stream she directed the information to a dvd recorder alone she waited for the file to be transmitted a voice spoke off to the side what are you doing karen turned david was climbing up from the lower deck he was supposed to be out in the perseus overseeing the demolition team he must have returned early barefoot and in a wet suit he stepped from the ladder and moved toward her i told cortez to keep someone with you at all times what are you doing here unattended she fixed a bland expression on her face out of the corner of her eye she watched the colored bar fill slowly i gave cortez what you wanted the key to the ancient script theyre researching it and didnt want my help he moved to her side karen twisted around blocking the view of the data bar with her elbow he glanced at the screen then back at her his eyes narrowed if youre not needed you should be confined to your quarters he grabbed her by the shoulder come with me he yanked her to her feet she dared not even glance back at the screen lest it draw his attention why confine me she asked boldly stepping in front of him blocking his view where am i going to go david scowled because those were my orders no one goes against them not even cortez to hell with the back of his hand struck her face hard knocking her to the side caught by surprise karen gasped and almost fell to one knee she grabbed her chair to keep upright no one questions my orders he said thickly rubbing the back of his hand his eyes flicked to the computer monitor karen winced oh godshe turned to the screen it was mercifully empty the transmission had been completed she straightened with relief david glanced along the curved row of labs clearly suspicious looking for some evidence of a foul plan she saw his nostrils flaring scenting the air like a bloodhound before he whipped back toward her karen inadvertently shied away he leaned near her i can smell kirkland on you bitch i dont know what youre up to but ill find out a cold chill slithered up her back he snatched her by the elbow fingers digging hard now lets find the others its time they were taught a thing or two about military protocol as she was pulled away she glanced at the empty workstation hidden on a little silver disk over there were the answers to everything ancient mysteries the origin of the universe even the fate of the world she had to find a way to place it in the hands of someone who could help but how pm deep fathom jack sat on a stool in the geology lab charlie worked at his computer reviewing his data both were searching for answers jack struggled to think but karens face bruised and scared kept appearing in his head distracting him he closed his eyes how bout if we tried shortcircuiting the damn thing what charlie asked you said the deposit acts like some electromagnetic battery what if we i dont know overloaded it or something charlie turned from his computer frowning tiredly that would only accelerate the geologists frown deepened jack could practically see the calculations running in the mans head do you think it might work his eyes focused back on jack no not at all but youve given me an idea he stood crossed to the worktable and scrounged through his gadgetry in a few moments charlie had a spare marine battery hooked to a meter what are you doing jack asked running a little experiment he lifted the batterys leads and connected them to the steel clamps holding the crystal star he put on one of roberts night vision masks can you hit the lights jack slid off his stool and flicked the switch in the dark cabin he heard charlie shuffling around then he heard a tiny snap of electricity a blue arc zapped between the batterys leads painfully bright in the dark the crystal artifact lit up like a real star the radiant light fractured into a spectrum of colors jack remembered a similar sight when the electromagnet used to haul up sections of air force one had brushed too near the pillar the spire had glowed with the same brightness as he watched the star grew brighter and brighter he raised a hand to shield his eyes charlie was bent over the star flicking his gaze between it and the meter one hand turned a dial the hum of the battery grew louder charlie hush he twisted the dial more the star began to rise from the table floating a few inches off the surface its light was almost too intense an electric tingling swept through the air the small hairs began to dance on jacks arms and the fillings in his teeth began to ache in his jaw it was like being back in the sub his eyes were drawn to a wall clock hanging above the experiment the second hand was running in the wrong direction amazing charlie mumbled still bent over the floating star then a loud crack exploded in the small space darkness fell over the room jack heard the crystal star drop back to the tabletop with a clatter get the lights charlie ordered jack rubbed the tingling from his arms then flipped the switch what were you doing using tongs charlie picked up the star the steel clamps holding it glowed hot hmminteresting what the geologist tilted the star for jack to see within the clamps the crystal had cracked in half what does it mean jack asked charlie looked up im not sure yet pm neptune base karen tried not to cry she sat on a narrow cot in a cabin no larger than a half bath what was she going to do david had gathered the entire crew of the station in the dining room he spent fifteen minutes browbeating them all one of the scientists made the mistake of asking a simple question for his impudence david shattered his nose with a sudden blow the room had grown deathly silent afterward david had proven his point he was the master here after his demonstration he stormed out with karen in tow she soon found herself locked in this cabin it all seemed impossible hopeless over the past two days she had hardly slept at all she was sore exhausted and drained she rested her face in her hands she couldnt do this alone as a sob welled up from deep inside a soft knock sounded on her door dr grace she sat up wary who is it its dr cortez may i come in karen almost choked with relief of course she stood as she heard the key in the lock the older scientist slipped in and closed the door behind him im sorry to disturb you so late no its okay i can use the company she allowed the relief to ring in her voice hes one scary bastard isnt he i should never have left you alone down there i wasnt thinking i was too excited about your discovery of the connection to the rapa nui script karen sat down she waved him to the sole stool it wasnt your fault well after this is over im filing a formal complaint she nodded allowing him the fantasy that it would have any impact spangler was operating under the guise of the highest office in the nation he could act with full impunity cortez continued i came here to see if you could help us were still having trouble deciphering these glyphs karen swallowed if there was to be any hope it was time to start trusting someone else no more games dr cortez i havent been totally honest what do you mean i possess the full translation not only of the pillars inscription but additional texts written at the time of the obelisks discovery cortez sat stunned silent then tried to talk i donthow couldbut when i have information i must get to someone in authority karen said someone out of spanglers chain of command information about what about the end of the world cortez frowned looking doubtful karen stood i know how it must sound but get me to the workstation on level and ill get you proof still he hesitated karen stared him down after tonights demonstration who are you willing to trust more spangler or me cortez bowed his head for a moment then pushed off his stool thats no contest cmon the commander is bunked out in his cabin but his secondincommand is patrolling stick to my side as long as youre with me we should be okay he opened the door karen followed him out though there was no ban on her being free under supervision it still felt like a prison break both crept silently through the living quarters peeking around corners holding their breath no one was around they got to the ladder heading down to the lab level and cortez went first he signaled the all clear for her to follow as she climbed the interlevel hatch sealed with a snug hiss silently they worked around the ring of labs to the tiny station assigned to her what now cortez asked glancing about the deserted space karen pointed cortez to the chair while she remained standing i have the data on a disk reaching past him she punched the keyboard calling up the information data scrolled across the screen she helped guide the researcher through the information pointing out the text of the platinum book and where it was found she gave him a shortened version of her own exploits and jacks after a bit cortez waved her silent he leaned closer his fingers flying over the keyboard calling up screen after screen of data much of it was too technical for karen but cortez was drinking it up this charles mollier is an amazing scientist what hes discovered about the crystal in such a short time its astounding but it corroborates much of my own early testing he continued reading through the streaming text and graphs as he did so karen watched his face slowly change from amazement to horror once done he sat back and took off his glasses i knew we should have proceeded with more caution its madness to be fooling with a power of this magnitude she crouched beside him will you help get this to somebody who will listen we have only fifteen hours until the solar storm strikes yes of course i have friends at los alamos and at the lawrence berkeley national laboratory there are ways to circumvent the normal government channels karen felt a surge of hope cortez rubbed his eyes is there any more data im not sure thats all they sent me but i can find out how she typed in gabriels code on the computer keyboard almost immediately a voice came over the speakers how may i help you dr grace who is that cortez asked no onereally karen directed her attention back to the computer gabriel i need to contact the deep fathom of course right away the connection whirred through to the distant ship and a small video window bloomed in the screens corner miyukis face flickered into existence karen i have dr cortez with me hes willing to help miyuki vanished from the cameras view for a few moments then jack and charlie appeared introductions were quickly made do either of you have any recommendations cortez asked i can get the information to the right people but what then from the data i can only assume we must find a way to block the solar storms bombardment from reaching the main deposit that leaves few options jack nodded weve been discussing it the easiest method is to shield the pillar bury it seal it in a lead box something like that but i dont know if either is feasible in the narrow time frame if this cant be done then we take our chances and adjust the explosives to a specific focused charge aimed at cracking the pillar from its base cortez frowned but the kinetic energy from the blast we know but like i said its our second option and its better than doing nothing because theres only one option after that and what might that be we kiss our asses goodbye cortezs face grew grim charlie spoke into the silence ill keep working with the crystal see if i can come up with anything else but he didnt sound hopeful jack continued that leaves only one other obstacle spangler i cant risk leaving karen over there any longer than necessary once word reaches david that youre going behind his back her life wont be worth a plug nickel we need to make sure shes out of there before spangler finds out what were doing cortez frowned thatll be difficult tomorrow morning theyre evacuating the station as a safety precaution before they blow the explosives i already checked on the departure schedule karen and i are the last to leave along with spangler karen moved in front of the camera and after todays incident i doubt spangler will let me out of his sight tomorrow then it looks like well need your help again professor cortez my ship is a half day out from your perimeter once close enough ill dive down in my own submersible from there well need to coordinate sneaking karen out from under that mans nose ill do my best ill show dr grace everything i know about the neptune and well come up with some sort of game plan jack nodded ill contact you when im en route somewhere behind karen a hatch clanged shut both she and cortez jumped someones coming karen hissed she faced the screen we have to sign off jack stared back at her ill see you tomorrow karen touched the screen as the line went dead cortez slipped out the dvd disk and pocketed it ill get on the wire as soon as i settle you back in your room by morning it will be a whole new day well get through this both you and the world karen grinned finding a twinge of hope she remembered jacks last words ill see you tomorrow she meant to hold him to that promise pm you were right sir rolfe said pulling off his radio headpiece huddled in his cabin david yanked off his own headphones the two with topside assistance from jeffreys had eavesdropped on the covert transmission to kirklands ship david threw his radio headpiece across the room the bastards still alive the next time i see kirkland im going to shove a grenade up his ass make sure he stays dead yes sir what are your orders david leaned back in the chair and folded his fingers across his stomach he had heard only the last portion of the conversation jeffreys the teams communication expert had kept a close ear to the wire and knew when the connection was made but the damn thing had been cleverly encrypted by the time jeffreys decoded it the conversation was ending still david had heard enough the group was planning to sabotage the site and free the woman sir david cleared his throat arranging a plan in his head we keep quiet let them think theyve won then when do we act once we know kirklands on his way here away from his ship isolated he sat up then we end it you take his ship jam all communication and leave jack to me as long as i have the woman hell come to us rolfe nodded very good sir but what about cortez david grinned unfolding his hands it seems we still have a bit of housecleaning to do tonight pm grumbling cortez climbed down the ladder to the docking level the lowest tier was divided into three sections the large docking bay the pump room with its quad of sixhundredpound hydraulic ram pumps and a small control room with neighboring storage facilities called garages the dsus armored suits were currently stored here cortez crossed to the control panel the board was automated push one button and the whole docking procedure would run smoothly the bay would pressurize to match the outside water once done the doors would open allowing a sub egress or ingress then the doors would close again or so the blueprints suggested after dropping karen off in her cabin he had been informed by one of his technicians that there was a problem with the docking board he thought about leaving it to one of the technicians but no one knew the neptunes systems as well as he did and with a call out already to his friend at los alamos he was full of nervous energy crouching by the control panel cortez slipped out a tool kit and quickly had the board open the problem was easy enough to discover one of the pumps had burned out a fuse a minor problem the docking bay could still function with the three remaining pumps but it would slow things down cursing the nuisance cortez made sure his toolbox held the proper fuses and entered the empty bay the two subs the perseus and the arguswere currently topside in preparation for tomorrows evacuation of the sea base both subs were being drydocked and examined empty the bay looked like a large warehouse the walls lined by thick water pipes toolbox in hand he crossed toward the far side it was a simple repair as he walked he sensed that he wasnt alone some primitive intuition of danger tingled his nerves he slowed and turned saw movement outside the bay door a twitch of shadows his heart thundered in his chest whos there he studied the door and the tiny observation window over the control station no one answered no one moved maybe it had been his imagination slowly he turned and continued walking toward the screw plate on the far side of the room already on edge his nerves jangled warnings his ears were keen to the smallest noises all he heard was his own footsteps as he neared the far wall a loud clang rang across the bay he gasped with shock with his heart now in his throat he swung around the bays hatch was closed he watched the latches wheel tight hey he hollered im in here he dropped the toolbox pushed up his glasses and hurried across the bay what if he got locked down here all night the others were counting on him halfway across he heard a highpitched hissing from overhead he looked up in horror he knew every inch of this place every sound and wheeze of the great station oh godno the docking procedure had been engaged the room was pressurizing he ran toward the door he had to let someone know he was in here then movement caught his eye through the observation window a head came into view cortez knew that face and its twisted condescending smirk spangler this was no accident cortez stumbled to a stop already the pressure grew in his ears unchecked it would build to match the outside depths over a thousand pounds per square inch cortez spun spangler must have been the one who had damaged the pumps fuse a trap to lure him down here his only hope was to disable the remaining pumps engines if he could remove the other three fuses he crossed toward the far wall and the abandoned toolbox as he did the pressure climbed in the room it was getting hard to breathe his vision narrowed gasping he struggled onward pain exploded in his head as his eardrums ruptured he cried out his hands flailing up knocking his eyeglasses off blood ran down his neck and still the pressure built stumbling his vision dimmed lights danced at the edges falling to his knees he fought for breath he collapsed to one hand then another as the pressure crushed him unable to breathe he rolled to his side and fell on his back he was blind now his eyes forced too deep into their bony sockets his fingers scrabbled at the floor begging for mercy the large weight on his chest continued to grow a flood of fire pained him as his ribs began to break collapsing ripping lungs that could no longer expand and still the weight grew he quit struggling releasing control his wife maria had given her life to the neptune project before she died it was somehow fitting that it should take his life too mariahoneyi love you then at last as if sighing out a final breath his consciousness fled and darkness took him pm through the observation window david stared out at the sprawled and broken body of the former research leader he watched the mans skull implode under the pressure brain matter splattering out as a diver he had always known such a danger was faced by all who challenged the depths but to witness it firsthand david turned away swallowing back a twinge of queasiness horrible rolfe stood by the control board sir flush this toilet his secondincommand obeyed flooding the bay man o war august am uss hickman east china sea admiral houston stood on the stern deck of the destroyer the uss hickman dawn had yet to rise but to the south fires raged lighting the entire horizon he had never seen the ocean burn the nuclear strikes had been clean and decisive destroying missile and air support installations along the blockades front batan senkaku shoto lu wan unknown to most of the world these tiny outlying islands would soon become synonymous with nagasaki and hiroshima already american forces were moving in to shatter the remaining blockade but not the hickman it was limping with the wounded back to the refuge of okinawa his right arm in a cast houston was counted among the injured he had survived the sinking of the gibraltar escaping the ship just before the rain of missiles had torn her apart many had not the dead and missing numbered in the thousands including the co of the ship and much of his command staff as he stood he silently spoke their namesthose he knew there were so many more he did not sir you shouldnt be out here a lieutenant said softly at his side the young hispanic officer had been assigned as his aide were all supposed to be belowdecks dont worry were far enough away by now the captain lieutenant he warned sternly yes sir the young man fell silent stepping back houston felt a chill morning breeze slip through his loose flight jacket with his arm in a sling he couldnt zip the jacket fully he shivered against the cold they would be reaching naha on okinawa within the hour just as the sun rose from there he was scheduled to ship back to the states slowly the fiery devastation sank beyond the horizon becoming a fading glow dull booms occasionally echoed over the waters houston finally turned his back im ready to go below he said tiredly the lieutenant nodded offering an arm of support just as a klaxon blared both men froze radar warning incoming missile then houston heard it a whistling roar the lieutenant grabbed his good arm meaning to drag the admiral to the closest hatch he shook off the grip its heading away as proof the fiery trail arced high across the night sky aiming north over the ship an m houston noted moving to the starboard rail with the lieutenant in tow as they followed its course another missile joined the flaming displaythen another the new rockets rose from the west from china though coming from different directions houston could guess their target okinawa lay directly ahead oh god what is it to the northeast new fireworks joined the show a dozen thin flames streaked upward into the night on intercept courses the bevy of patriot ii missiles whistled skyward like bottle rockets on the fourth of july one of the chinese missiles was struck a glancing blow its fiery arc became a tumbling fall flaming out and disappearing but the other two continued their course vanishing over the dark horizon whats happening the lieutenant asked houston just stared at first there was no sound just a flash of light as if the sun itself had exploded beyond the horizon the lieutenant backed away a low sound flowed over the water like thunder under the sea at the horizon the brilliant light coalesced down upon itself forming a pair of glowing clouds sitting at the edge of the world slowly too slowly they rolled skyward pushed up atop fiery stalks brilliant hues glowed from the hearts of the caldrons fiery oranges magentas dark roses houston closed his eyes the blast wave even from so far off struck the hickman like a hammer burning houston from the deck before even a last prayer could be uttered am nautilus dressed in an insulated dry suit jack climbed into the nautilus as it bobbed in the small waves behind the stern of his ship he wiggled himself down into the pilots seat and began running through one last systems check he knew it probably wasnt necessary and the press of time weighed upon him but he used the routine to settle himself he would not fail he must not fail all night long as the deep fathom continued to steam toward the site where air force one had crashed his crew had labored at readying the sub for the long trek charging the main batteries topping off the oxygen tanks changing the filters to the carbon dioxide scrubbers lubricating the thruster assemblies with a fresh wax and polish it couldve passed for new but it was all necessary today jack was about to take the nautilus on its longest trip yet an hour ago the fathom had dropped anchor on the lee side of a small island no bigger than a baseball field it lay some twenty nautical miles from the crash site jacks plan was to sneak the sub in as close as possible then coordinate with dr cortez and karen on a plan to free her from the sea base it would take impeccable timing jack gave a thumbsup to robert who lowered the acrylic dome and used a portable power drill to screw the orings tight this was normally charlies job but he had been holed up in his lab all night working with the crystal robert patted the side of the sub the usual twothump signal that it was okay to dive jack nodded to the marine biologist robert laid a palm atop the dome silently wishing him good luck then dove off the sub jack glanced back his entire crew had gathered along the stern rail even elvis stood by lisas side the old dogs tail slowly wagging he saluted them all then hit a button sucking ballast water into the empty tanks on either side the submersible slowly sank as the waterline rose over the dome he felt a twinge of misgiving he dismissed it as the usual predive jitters but in his heart he knew that this time it was more in six hours the mother of all solar storms was going to strike the earth and if he and the others failed it wouldnt matter if karen were rescued or not jack let the sub sink under its own weight he could have descended faster under thruster power but he had to reserve his batteries around him the water turned a midnightblue as he aimed for the fifty meter mark once there he gave the thrusters the tiniest juice to push the nautilus into a gentle glide aiming away from the tiny island and out into open sea slowly the sub sank into twilightone hundred metersthen full night jack kept the ships xenon lamps switched off preserving the batteries guiding himself through the black waters with the computer alone the region had been mapped by sonar when the fathom first arrived and the information loaded into the subs navigation he would switch to active sonar once he was near the bottom he had also ordered radio silence between himself and the ship maintaining as much stealth as possible two hundred meterssmall pinpoints of light began to appear bioluminescent plankton and other tiny multicelled bits of life jack enjoyed the display even here life found a way to survive the sight gave him a flicker of hope four hundred meters he finally switched on the subs sonar for the final approach to the seabed where he was headed it was too dangerous to fly blind he watched both the analog depth meter and the sonar readings with the deftest touches he manipulated the foot pedals to make tiny course corrections he watched the numbers climb five hundred meters finally he thumbed the switch and twin spears of light shot forward penetrating the gloom illuminating the landscape below jack pushed a pedal and tilted the sub on its side surveying the terrain below him it was as perfect as he had hoped the seabed maze of deep canyons the section of broken landscape beneath him led all the way to the crash site the plan was for him to use the sheltering cover to mask his approach similar to the way he had used the sunken ruins to sneak up on davids cutter however this time he hoped the end result would improve before he had come back emptyhanded as the depth gauge approached the six hundred meter mark jack angled the sub into a wide canyon between two ridges he slowed his speed balancing out his ballast to neutral buoyancy ready he engaged the thrusters and began the long winding journey the walls to either side were covered with clams and mussels anemones and deepsea coral lobsters and crabs worked around the boulders waving and clacking claws at the stranger in their midst other life fled from his lights schools of silverbellied fish darted in unison and vanished in a blink bloodred octopi swept away in panicked clouds of murky ink and winged black skates shuffled deeper into the silt momentarily awed by the marine life around him jack continued gliding along the canyon over the next hour using his sonar and compass he navigated the maze as best he could wending a zigzag path circling around a seamount he dove into a long narrow canyon it was perfect side channels and offshoots branched away but ahead was a straight shot to his target he checked his watch four hours till noon he was cutting it close gunning the thrusters he shot into the channel it was this sudden burst of speed that saved his life as the rock wall to his right suddenly exploded caught from behind the subs stern catapulted upward flipping the nautilus end over end and slamming it into the far cliff jack gasped his head cracking against the dome the nautilus scraped down the rockface rolling a sickening metallic scrunch sounded as something tore away from the subs undercarriage one of the xenon lamps burst with an audible pop casting shards of thick glass he fought to keep his seat praying for the inner shell of titanium and bulletproof acrylic to maintain its integrity even a single seam rupture at these depths would implode the sub in a nanosecond crushing the life from him working the foot pedals he righted the sub his visibility was zero as he hovered in a cloud of silt and sand through his hydrophones a hollow tumble of rock sounded behind him looking over his shoulder he could just make out a collapsed wall of boulders he craned his neck up beyond the top of the seamounts the silt cloud was clearing as swifter currents swept it away overhead he spotted his attacker another sub circled like a shark cigarshaped with stubby wings it prowled along hunting he knew this vessel the perseusthe navys newest submersible as deadly as she was sleek the admiral had shown him the specs on the night of the sabotage she was twice the vessel the nautilus was quicker able to dive deeper more maneuverable but worst of all she had teeth jack spotted the dorsal fin of this titanium great white a stacked array of minitorpedoes with a twitch jack flicked off the remaining lamp of his sub darkness collapsed over him through the murk above a weak beam of light sought him out circling and circling overhead the hungry predator hunted its trapped prey am deep fathom charlie paced the small confines of his lab mumbling to himself the idea could work he had run the calculations over and over again and tested the crystal several more times still he remained unconvinced theory was one thing before he was ready to commit to his plan he wanted to consult with dr cortez at the sea base but time was running out and charlie had no way of checking in with the geophysicist they were dependent on the sea base calling there leaning back over the computer he tapped a button and a threedimensional globe of the earth appeared on the monitor a hundred small xs orbited the planet they moved slowly in a complex ballet off to the left a radiating wavefront of tiny lines edged minutely toward the center of the screen toward earth it marked the front edge of the solar storm blowing their way charlie checked the upper righthand corner where a little clock was counting down the time until collision with the upper atmosphere four hours the dance of xs around the globe were based on realtime data from the marshall space flight center monitoring the incoming wavefront and extrapolating how it might affect the satellites in orbit charlie placed his finger on one of the small xs a knock on his door interrupted him lisa said charlie we have a call from karen charlie straightened with relief thank god its about bloody time mon he popped the disk of his latest data from the computers zip drive and dashed out the door he found lisa and miyuki gathered in front of the professors portable supercomputer he immediately sensed the tension in the room neither woman looked happy whats wrong he asked lisa coming around the table on the screen karen had heard him and answered i was calling to see if you had heard from dr cortez charlie bent in front of the camera what do you mean why not ask him yourself because this morning id heard hed gone topside during the night and ive heard no word since i had hoped he contacted you no not a word charlie assimilated the information i dont like this with dr cortez awol maybe wed better rethink things on our own just in case jacks already left in the sub ill patch you to the nautilus so you two can coordinate on getting your ass out of there karens image flickered maybe wed better the last scientists are due to leave in an hour leaving me alone with davids secondincommand if theres gonna be a rescue itll have to be soon but what about the pillar what are we going to do if we dont hear from dr cortez pray we do pray hes been too damn busy making arrangements to save the world to bother updating us but even charlie knew that such a prayer was unlikely to be answered listen karen ive been working on something something we might try lets all keep in close contact from here ill try but itll be difficult lieutenant rolfe is below assisting in the launch of the next sub i feigned an urgent need to go to the bathroom to make this call she checked her watch and im running out of time i should be getting back down there then let me patch you through to jack charlie turned to miyuki the professor hit a button and spoke aloud gabriel can you patch this line to the nautilus a pause i am afraid i cannot comply there appears to be some sort of interference karens brows knit with worry then her image flickered giving way to static which ate the rest of the transmission gabriel get her back charlie ordered i am afraid i cannot comply there appears to be some sort of interference before charlie could ask for clarification the sound of someone running down the stairs drew his attention roberts voice came over the tiny intercom speakers weve got company kendall mcmillan finished as he burst into the room two ships military circling around from both sides of the island they all moved toward the stairs except miyuki who remained at her computer her fingers flying over the keyboard im not abandoning karen she called to him ill keep trying to reach her let her know whats happening charlie nodded do your best but if were boarded hide that computer it may be all that stands between us and the end of the world he climbed to the stern deck of the fathom and watched a long ship sweep around the southern coast of their little islet an air horn blared from its deck followed by a message prepare to be boarded any resistance will be met with deadly force mcmillan stared what are we going to do we have no choice charlie said not this time we surrender am neptune base karen tried typing in gabriels address again still no answer checking her watch she pushed out of her seat she could delay no longer without risking suspicion she frowned one last time at the computer the abrupt end to her conversation with the deep fathom threatened to send her into a panic crossing to level s ladder she climbed down her mind still on the communication glitch as she reached a leg down to the next rung her ankle was grabbed and yanked she squawked and fell from the ladder rolfe caught her clamping her upper arm what took you so long karen swallowed avoiding his accusing stare she forced a tremor into her voice not all of it was feigned itits its what she glared at him its my time of the month if you must know rolfes face grew a shade more ruddy it seemed even these tough sealtrained assassins did not care to know about such fine womanly details okay then but stick by my side were just about to launch the last shuttle to the surface karen did not like the sound of that last shuttlewhat about her rolfe led her to the docking bays control station he gazed through the window then spoke into the thinpoled mike all set argus karen peeked through the window the pilot and the last two scientists both crammed into the rear passenger compartment were locked into the sub systems green ready for launch the pilot radioed pressurizing rolfe poked a large blue button initiating the docking bay system karen watched as soon as the pressures equalized the outlet pipes opened and water poured into the bay quickly swallowing up the sub she studied it all intently without dr cortez here she might need to do this herself all morning long she had dogged rolfes steps learning by quiet observation how the base operated it was all userfriendly thanks mostly to this compact control station a bank of four monitors showed external views from all around the station an additional two monitors for the rov robots rested above a pair of joysticks the remainder of the panel was devoted to the docking bay itself she watched the seawater level rise past the tiny porthole observation window as the bay filled a glint of metal caught her eye something small floated loose in the docking space she dismissed it as some mislaid tool and returned her focus to the sub across the bay the pilot tested the subs thrusters floating up from the deck but again the glint drew her eye it was the same object whirling past the tiny window now leaning closer karen recognized the bit of flotsam a pair of eyeglasses its lenses broken its frame twisted and bent she covered a gasp with a hand over her mouth am nautilus hidden in a cloud of silt jack edged his sub along the base of the cliff clinging under a lip of rock to diminish his sonar shadow to the sub above he feathered his pedals with the lightest touches trying to move no faster than the current he dared not move any quicker lest he raise a wake trail in the cloud and reveal his position overhead the glow of the perseuss spotlight swept past in a crisscrossing pattern searching waiting for the silt to settle jack knew he had to be gone before that happened still he forced himself to maintain a snails pace flying the sub blind no lights guided by sonar alone he edged forward his goal a side canyon up ahead he had no idea where it led or if it was a blind alley but knew he had to be out of the main channel before the cloud dissipated then a voice blared from his radio earpiece i know youre down there kirkland you cant hide forever spanglergreatno surprise there jack remained silent playing dead i have your woman trapped at the sea base and your ship impounded show yourself and ill let the others live jack resisted the urge to laugh sure you will the silence stretched davids voice returned again growing more angry would you like me to teach professor grace a few lessons in your absence perhaps hear her screams as lieutenant rolfe rapes her jack clenched his hands into fists but remained silent revealing himself would hurt karen more than it would help his best chance lay in stealth ahead a side canyon finally opened on the right jack guided the nautilus into the narrow cut he juiced the thrusters sonar feed began to fill the computer navigation screen he sighed in relief the side canyon was not a dead end it wound far branching and dividing anxious he moved more swiftly he raced along the deep crack walls flashed past he needed time and distance to shake the bastard where you going jack lights flared behind him jumping jack craned around damn it the perseus swept down into the slot canyon after him diving with murderous intent staring behind him jack realized his error a dusty spray of silt trailed behind the subs tail coughed up from the seabed floor by his passage a clear trail a stupid mistake giving up any pretense of hiding he speared on his lamplight and floored the pedals the nautilus shot up corkscrewing out of the canyon as he spun a minitorpedo zipped past the subs dome narrowly missing his vessel to the left a brief explosion flared as the torpedo struck a seamount its thunder echoing through his hydrophones jack tilted his sub into a steep dive riding the shockwave and dropped into a neighboring canyon flattening out the bottom of his sub scraped through the silt casting up a cloud what had betrayed him a moment ago could save him now he thumbed off his lamp and coasted without thrusters vanishing into the widening cloud of sand and silt he heard david over the radio swearing in davids anxiousness to pursue him he had forgotten his radio line was still open jack did not correct this mistake he eavesdropped goddamn you kirkland ill see you die before this day is out jack grinned keep trying asshole he raced down the chute gliding around an outcropping a sonar warning chimed the canyon ended in a flat cliff face only twenty yards away oh shit he flung the thrusters in reverse earning a highpitched whine of protest and flung the nose of the sub straight up but it wasnt enough to halt his momentum the bottom of the nautilus struck the wall hard jarred forward the belts of his harness dug into his shoulders he forced himself back and worked the thrusters climbing straight up the wall a new warning rang from his computer his batteries were running low greatjust great clearing the wall jack leveled out and sped along the mounts summit he prayed his power lasted long enough sensing movement on his left he turned and was blinded by a shaft of light the perseus flew out of a nearby canyon straight at him rather than being rammed broadside jack rolled the sub taking the collision on his undercarriage the nautilus jolted violently struck at the stern jacks sub spun he struggled to right himself to no avail the sub struck the seamount burying its nose in the thick silt sweating ears ringing he fought the thrusters to tug himself out with a groan of stressed metal the nautilus popped free as he swung his sub upright he peripherally saw the perseus swinging in a tight loop its torpedo array swiveling in his direction time to go he slammed the foot pedals thrusters whined the sub rumbled and tremored but refused to move his front thruster assembly was jammed with sand cmon cmon he slammed the sub into reverse blowing clear the choked props the perseus sped closer determined not to miss this time ready to die kirkland free of debris jack goosed his thrusters with no time to escape he aimed straight for his adversary playing a risky game of chicken trusting in davids cowardice an explosion too close would threaten davids own sub he floored the foot pedals and streaked forward rather than shying the perseus remained on course jack flicked on his xenon lamp light lanced out to stab the other sub blinding its pilot at the last moment spangler angled away jack flashed under the enemy sub he caught a quick glimpse of david sprawled on his belly in his cigarshaped glass pod then the perseus was gone watching it retreat jack spotted the torpedo array spinning to track him as the perseus fled a finger of fire spat from the array oh crap jack straightened in his seat the nearest canyon lay too far away his sonar picked up the incoming torpedo as it sped toward him he found himself leaning forward as if that would increase his speed move it laughter sounded over his radio adios asshole jack realized he would never make the canyon he searched for other options and spotted a large boulder resting on the seamounts summit slamming the left pedal he dove at a steep angle toward it suicide jack at least die with honor jacks gaze flickered between the speeding torpedo and the oncoming collision he bit his lip calculating at the last moment he blew out his ballast tanks and gunned his thrusters the nose end of his sub slammed into the silty bottom in front of the boulder and bounced with the increased buoyancy the tiny vessel flipped over the boulder like a gymnast flying over a vaulting horse but the torpedo couldnt the huge rock burst under the nautilus the blast shoved up the subs stern peppering its underside with shards jack whooped riding the concussion while sucking up new ballast the shock wave shoved him right over the edge of the canyon he dove dropping like a lead weight straight into the next chute near the bottom he angled out skimming along the seabed relief and excitement mixed but it was shortlived the dark waters above him soon grew lighter as david pursued closing in with his faster sub jack examined his sonar readings a strange shadow showed up ahead he kept his lamps lit unsure what was coming he needed a place to hide and soon sliding around a slight curve in the canyon he spotted the anomaly an arch of rock spanned the chute a high bridge of thin stone he glided under it it was too small to hide him but it gave him an idea he slowed and settled to the silty bottom it was time to even the odds situation room white house lawrence nafe stood before the computerized strategy map glowing on the rear wall of the white houses situation room behind him were gathered the joint chiefs the cabinet and the secret service on the map the tiny island of okinawa glowed red destroyed hundreds of thousands killed in a blinding flash his secretary of defense spoke behind him we need to choose a target mr president retaliation must be swift and severe nafe stepped away from the map and turned around beijing the men around the table stared burn it to the bedrock am perseus on his belly in the subs sleek pod david sped around a curve sweat ran down his face into his nose and mouth he didnt bother wiping it away he dared not release his grip on the controls a headsup display glowed across the polyacrylic nose cone sonar lines were superimposed over the view of the real terrain circling around the bend david spotted his quarry he smiled so the bastard hadnt escaped the blast unharmed under an arch of stone jacks darkened sub limped and teetered clearly compromised david watched as the desperate man fought to get his sub moving sand and silt choking up but with no success his sub continued to founder like a fledgling with an injured wing having problems he radioed over go fuck yourself david grinned he lowered the perseus adjusting his lights to illuminate the interior of the other subs dome inside he saw jack struggling excited david lifted his sub and angled over his enemy as he glided under the arch he adjusted the perseuss lights keeping the focus on his trapped enemy it gave him a thrill to see jack fighting frantically for his life as david passed directly over the damaged sub the two adversaries faced each other jack glanced up at him while david grinned down that close david saw no fear in jacks eyes only satisfaction jack lifted a hand and flipped him off then the nautilus blasted straight up caught off guard david couldnt get out of the way in time the two vessels collided davids chin cracked against the pod he bit the tip of his tongue stars flared across his vision blood filled his mouth for a moment jacks dome ground against davids nose cone both men lay within an arms reach of the other yet remained untouchable jack grinned up at him time to even the odds you bastard david glanced to his sonar array he suddenly understood the trap but a fraction too late the top of the perseus struck the stone arch overhead david swore a litany of curses with a screech of titanium the torpedo array struck the unyielding rock one of the minitorpedoes ignited shooting down the canyon and exploding against a distant cliff face the remainder of the array broke off and tumbled away his trap sprung jacks sub sank away as you saidadios the nautilus dove forward aiming for the sheltering cloud cast up by the stray torpedos explosion spitting blood david flicked a switch no you dont asshole am nautilus jacks grin disappeared as the nautilus suddenly lurched under him he jerked hard in his harness as the subs progress was halted in middive twisting around he saw the perseus had latched onto his subs frame with a single manipulator arm its pincers clamped tight david was not letting him run the titanium arm tugged metal screeched warning lights flashed red across jacks computer screen he was snagged and trapped caught from behind his own subs manipulator arms could not fight back titanium continued to protest as the pincers on davids sub crushed and tore the computer flickered the carbon dioxide scrubbers went silent david had clamped the main power line this was not good thinking fast he dove toward the bottom taking on ballast dragging the navys sub behind him meanwhile beginning to circle during the descent flashing on his xenon headlight jack aimed at the mangled torpedo array on the seabed floor his lights dimmed as the nautiluss power line was crimped he ignored it concentrating on his goal when he was close enough jack reached to the controls for his own subs manipulator arms he extended the right arm and grabbed one of the discarded torpedoes resting on the seabed by now david realized the danger the nautilus was jostled as david shook the vessel rattled jack bobbled and dropped the torpedo but he deftly snatched it back up with his other manipulator arm before he lost it again jack wound back the arm and whipped it forward lobbing the torpedo against the base of the stone arch the blast blew out the support the stone arch broke falling toward them as jack had hoped david was not willing to risk his own skin he freed the nautilus spinning away but jack spun the other way and grabbed the perseuss back frame turning the tables catching the shark by its tail leaving so soon he asked overhead the main section fell toward them let me go youll kill us both both i dont think so smaller boulders landed around them blasting craters in the silt jack monitored both his sonar and the tumble of rock using his other manipulator arm he tore at the perseuss main thruster assembly damaging the propellers then released his pincers and backed at full throttle davids sub lurched trying to crawl from under the fall of rock but it was no use boulders crashed deep into the silt as jack watched a small burst of bubbles exploded from around the perseus he initially thought the sub had imploded but as the bubbles cleared a small pod of acrylic shot out from the external titanium frame spangler had employed his subs emergency escape mechanism the ejected glass lifeboat blasted away from its heavier external shell the abandoned section was immediately pounded flat by tons of rock the bastard was escaping jack scowled climbing with his thrusters above the spreading silk cloud under positive buoyancy the lifeboat and its single passenger rose rapidly a tiny red emergency light on its tail winked mockingly back at him in his heavier sub jack had no hope of catching it he followed the escape pods course with his xenon light as it cleared the canyon walls and climbed into the open sea jaw muscles tense jack gripped his controls unsure about what to do then a flurry of movement to the side caught his eye a large creature stretched from a rocky den reaching for the escaping glass bubble the explosions the threat to its territory must have drawn it jack touched his throat mike david i think youre about to be dinner am david frowned at jacks radioed message what was he talking about what harm could he do jacks sub could never catch him though his own lifeboat bore no weapons and had no maneuverability it did have speed the sleek torpedo of acrylic was light and extremely buoyant david tapped in a code on his computer preparing to patch through to the sea base he would order the anthropologist killed slowly rolfe was a skilled interviewer he had loosened many a stubborn tongue david would make sure her cries and pleadings were dispatched to jack before she was killed as he typed in the final connection the life pod was jolted tossing david onto his side he searched the water around him but saw nothing in the weak glow of the blinking emergency beacon in the stern he rose up on an elbow then the lifeboat was jarred again and suddenly dragged straight down davids head struck the thick acrylic what the fu words died in his mouth as he glanced past his toes in the light of the red beacon he spotted a large dinnerplatesize sucker attached to the shell of the lifeboat he watched a long tentacle wrap around the pod drawing him back into the depths reeling him in like a hooked fish a giant squid he had read the report of jacks battle with the same monster he pressed his palms against the glass panic setting in he had no weapons he searched the sea around him strobed in the red light other tentacles and arms flailed descending on its trapped prey the pod was flipped around roughly david rolled and found a huge black eye staring at him a small gasp choked out of him the eye disappeared as the pod spun in the monsters grip david braced himself all around was a blur of tentacles staring past his toes david suddenly sensed danger above his head he jerked around and screamed an arms length away a huge maw opened lined by razorsharp beaks large enough to bite the slender pod in half still crying out in horror he was drawn head first into the hungry creatures mouth it gnawed on the glass end grinding its surface with its viselike beak david retreated cramming himself into the stern half of the lifeboat as he did his elbow struck the communication system his eyes flicked to its palmsize screen he still had communications he could call in a rescue perhaps the bulletproof glass would resist the creature long enough or maybe the squid would tire of its stubborn prey and simply let him go clinging to this small hope he forced down his panic told himself to stay focused in charge elbowing his way forward david reached the transmitter as he called up topside a horrible noise echoed through the pod crack he stared overhead tiny cracks skittered across the glass oh godno he remembered the way dr cortez had died crushed his skull imploding the monster continued to gnaw the threadlike stress cracks spiderwebbed around him at these immense pressures implosion was imminent david clenched his fists as his hopes bled away he was left with only one desire revenge his boss nicolas ruzickov ever paranoid had built in a failsafe system in case the pillar site were ever compromised the cia director had not wanted the power here falling into foreign hands better no one get it than lose it to another ruzickov had explained david called up a special screen and typed in a coded sequence his finger hovered above the enter key he looked up the beasts maw continued to grind against the glass more cracks monster or pressurewhich death was worse he tapped the final key failsafe activated blinked for a brief second then the lifeboat collapsed crushing the life out of him in a heartbeat am neptune base sitting beside her captor karen knew time was running out in a little over two hours the solar storm would hit she had to contact the fathom and let them know dr cortez had been murdered but her bodyguard had refused to let her out of his sight as she sat with her hands clutched in her lap lieutenant rolfe leaned over the radio a call had been wired down from topside though he whispered she managed to make out two words evacuation and failsafe straining she tried to eavesdrop on more of the conversation finally the lieutenant hung up the receiver and turned to her theyre sending down the argus were leaving immediately karen noted the man refused to make eye contact he was lying he might be leaving but she wouldnt be feigning acquiescence she stood and stretched its about time the lieutenant got to his feet too karen saw his left hand drift to the knife strapped to his thigh no bullets not at these pressures turning she hurriedly crossed toward the ladder that led down to the docking bay she mounted it first keeping an eye on her adversary he nodded for her to climb down hand leaving the hilt of his knife karen quickly calculated shed been taught the safety systems as soon as she boarded here everything was automated for her plan to work she had to time this perfectly she moved slowly down the ladder a rung at a time rolfe followed keeping close as usual good halfway down karen leaped from the ladder landing with a thud lieutenant rolfe frowned down at her careful damn it karen thrust herself to the wall and smashed her elbow into the safety glass breaking the seal pushing through the glass slicing her fingertips she reached to the emergency manual override it was a safety feature to lock down the levels in case of flooding understanding in his eyes the lieutenant who stood halfway through the interlevel hatch pushed off the rungs dropping toward her karen yanked the red lever emergency klaxons blared the hatch whisked shut karen rolled away as the lieutenant fell through the hatch kicking at her head but his attack was halted in midswing twisting around she saw him hanging from the hatch gurgling his neck caught in the sliding door it closed with a pressure meant to hold back six hundred meters of water pressure bones cracked blood splattered the deck she turned away as his body fell to the floor headless twitching she ran a few steps away and vomited remaining bent over her stomach quivering she knew she had no other choice kill or be killed jack had told her once still an intercom at the control station buzzed a voice spoke neptune this is topside control were reading an emergency hatch closure are you okay karen straightened heart thudding the argus must be on its way down she could not risk being caught hurrying to the controls she frantically tried to remember how to work the radio moving toggles and dials finally she thumbed the right switch and leaned to the mike topside this is neptune do not attempt evacuation i repeat do not attempt evacuation the station has been damaged implosion imminent do you copy the voice returned somber read you implosion imminent a long pause our prayers are with you neptune thank you topside over and out karen bit her lip finally free she now turned her attention to more important concerns where the hell was jack am nautilus jack limped down the last canyon he spotted lights ahead it was the crash site he was so close he pumped the foot pedals trying to eke a little more power from the drained batteries the thrusters whined weakly if nothing else the frantic chase through the seamounts had brought him within a quarter mile of the base after watching davids lifeboat implode it had taken jack only eight minutes to reach the site however his computer screen was riddled with blinking warning lights in hues of red and yellow worst of all the battery power level read zero the charge was so low that hed been forced to turn off all immediately unnecessary systems lights carbon dioxide scrubbers even heaters after such a short trip he was already shivering violently lips blue from the icy cold of these depths and now with the lights of the base illuminating the last of the canyon jack turned off his sonar this earned him another half minute of power to his thrusters he glided the nautilus forward the subs skids bent and twisted rode an inch above the sandy bottom at long last he pulled free of the canyons after so long in the dark the lights glared he squinted the pillar lay twenty yards to his right the sea base straight ahead its three doughnutshaped sections lit up brightly he swore under his breath at the distance yet to travel why had they constructed the base so far away hed never make it proving his words true the thrusters whined down and stopped with an ominous silence jack pounded the foot pedals cmon not when were this damn close he managed to earn a weak whine but nothing more he settled back thinking he rubbed his hands together his fingertips numb from the cold now what am neptune base karen wiped the blood from her hands onto her pants she had climbed back up to level after disengaging the emergency lockdown for the past five minutes she had been fruitlessly trying to raise gabriel cut off she felt blind and deaf what was she going to do she stood up trying to pace away her nervousness she considered calling topside and coming clean the fate of the world depended on someone taking actionanyone but she knew her chances of convincing somebody in authority were futile the disk with the data from the fathom was gone missing along with the body of dr cortez and who would believe a woman who had just decapitated a decorated member of the us military karen scratched her head her heart pounding there had to be a way as she paced a small temblor shook underfoot she stopped the vibrations rattled up her legs she held her breath all she needed right now was a deepsea quake she moved to one of the portholes as she peered out the rattling died away a fading light caught her eye it was coming from the pillar karen narrowed her eyes studying it strange suddenly the light flared up in the pillar the ground shook again she gripped the walls holding herself steady for the briefest moment as the light flared she spotted the glint of something shiny and metallic something was out there the quake ended and the light faded she stared straining squinting but could discern nothing more what was that she mumbled to herself as she stood arms tight around her karen thought of a way to find out am nautilus teeth chattering and weak from stale air jack struggled to grab another rock from the silt with the subs manipulator arm of the first four stones he had managed to hit the pillar twice not bad earlier as the sub had rested dead on the seabed floor hed remembered charlies lesson about the pillars sensitivity to energy even kinetic energy like something striking its surface he had just enough battery power to work one of the manipulator arms and lob stones at the pillar the ground trembled the pillar flared but was there anyone to see his sos had the base been abandoned already he had no way of knowing he struggled to dig free another stone his vision blurred the cold and the carbon dioxide were taking their toll as he fought to stay conscious the manipulator arm froze up he tugged at the controls not enough power he tried the radio one last time the batteries remaining dribble of juice was enough to power a final call can anyone hear me charlieanyone groaning jack collapsed back into his cold seat no answer he shivered and trembled all over waiting the deep waters had sucked all heat from the small sub his vision dimmed again he began to swim in and out of consciousness he fought it but the ocean was stronger on his last flicker of consciousness he spotted the large monster bearing down at himthen darkness swallowed him am neptune base karen sat before the control station on level she manipulated the joystick for the rov robot named huey guiding its arms to grab onto jacks sub on the monitor before her she watched her work from remote the grips extended and latched onto a section of the subs titanium tubing clamping tight satisfied she had a firm hold she backed huey along the path toward the base the sub seemed to resist for a moment then budged slowly karen wiped sweat from her eyes you can do it huey the volkswagen bugsize robot continued backing dragging the sub with it as it retreated karen swiveled the remote cameras eye making sure to avoid obstructions while ensuring that she didnt lose jack and his sub through the acrylic dome she watched jacks form jostle around as the sub was hauled his head lolled and his arms hung limp unconscious dead she had no way of knowing but refused to give up working quickly her eyes darted from the screen to the clock on the wall her grip grew slick on the joystick less than two hours how could they possibly hope to succeed on the screen she watched huey trundle backward hauling the dead sub either way she wasnt going to leave jack out there struggling with the joystick she steadily drew the sub along the silt luckily the track between the pillar and the station had already been cleared by workers even the stray bits of jet pieces had been vacuumed from the silt karen worked as quickly as safety allowed praying for more time then a familiar voice rose from the control stations speakers dr grace if you can hear us please respond karen cried out with relief keeping one hand on the joystick she used her free hand to patch into the communication system gabriel good morning dr grace please hold for the deep fathom on the monitor huey finally reached the station karen slowed the robot and carefully pulled jacks sub underneath the base she tilted the camera coordinating to position the sub under the docking bay doors karen miyuki oh thank god before her friend could respond a new voice came on it was the ships geologist his jamaican accent giving him away professor grace time is of the essence have you heard from dr cortez what is going on karen gave him a summary as she initiated the docking bay pressurization the two quickly compared notes she learned the support ships topside were all leaving steaming under full power away from the site and abandoning the fathom once they were gone communications had reopened why are they leaving she asked gabriel picked up a coded transmission he was able to decrypt it apparently some failsafe command was initiated to wipe out the area it seems theyre not taking any chances on losing whatever resources lie down there to a foreign power the place has been targeted for a missile strike when gabriel is still trying to work that out karen suddenly felt faint lightheaded from how many different directions could death aim their way what about jack charlie asked karen focused back on the monitors im trying to get him on board but i dont know the robot cant lift his sub into the bay jack has to do that himself and i think hes out of power ill have gabriel patch you over to the sub see if you can wake him ill try as she waited karen leaned over and peered through the observation window the bay was flooded and the doors were gliding open dr grace you are hooked up to the deepwater radio of the nautilus karen spoke into the microphone jack if you can hear me wake up she kept an eye on the monitor focusing hueys camera on the glass dome she used the robots arms to shake the sub wake up damn it am nautilus jack swam through darkness chasing a whisper a familiar voice he followed it up toward a bright light the voice of an angel goddamn it jack wake your ass up he jolted in his seat groggy and blinded he threw his head back lights shone all around him he couldnt see jack its karen karen he wasnt sure if he spoke or if it was all in his head the world swam with light jack you have to raise your sub fifteen feet i need you to enter the bay over your head jack craned his head up as his eyes adjusted to the light he saw a large open hatch above his head understanding seeped through to him cant he mumbled no power there must be a way youre so close jack stared up remembering spanglers death maybe there was a way karen spoke desperate jack ill see if the rov robots arms are strong enough to push you inside no his tongue felt thick and slow he searched between his legs his fingers found the release brake for jettisoning the external sub frame he yanked on it it was stuck or he was too weak jack taking a deep breath he grabbed it again with numb fingers bracing his feet he used both his arms and his upper back to crank the lever up between his legs he heard the muffled pop of the manual pyrotechnics the external frame locks blew off freeing the inner pilots chamber buoyant the chamber rose from its shell like an insect shedding its old carapace pressures thrust it upward through the open hatch jack saw none of it passing out again am neptune base on the screen karen saw the sub appear to crack in half she gasped with fright until she saw the inner chamber shoot upward right through the open hatch she hit a button on the controls initiating repressurization she stepped to the observation window jacks escape pod bounced and rolled along the ceiling under it the bay doors closed the thump of the pumps began to sound karen watched holding her breath jack hung slack in his harness the five minutes to drain and equalize the pressure was interminable she briefly contacted the fathom updating them she learned that charlie was working on some plan of his own with gabriel karen afraid for jack barely listened at last the green light flashed above the door to the bay she twirled the lock and hauled the hatch open the pilot pod half acrylic half titanium lay on its side karen had already been instructed over the radio by robert on how to open it snatching an emergency oxygen bottle from beside the bay door she ducked through the hatch she ran over to the pod grabbed the manual screw pull and began winding it around like a cars jack handle she stared inside jacks face was blue she cranked harder pumping her arms the seals peeled open with a hiss of escaping air karen smelled the foulness to it stale dead she reached to the loosened dome top and kicked it open kneeling down she freed jacks harness and hauled out his limp body his skin was cold and clammy she was sure he was dead sprawled on the bay floor karen checked for a pulse in his neck faint and thready his breathing was shallow she slid on her knees and collected the small oxygen bottle unhooking the tiny mask she twisted the flow valve and placed the mask over his mouth and nose leaning near his ear she whispered breathe jack somewhere deep inside he must have heard her his chest rose and fell more deeply she turned and zippered down his neoprene dive suit freeing his rib cage as she did so a hand rose and weakly took her wrist she looked down at jacks face and found him staring at her he spoke through the mask his voice was hoarse karen she began to cry and hugged him gently around the neck for a moment neither one tried to move finally jack struggled to sit up karen helped him he shoved aside the oxygen mask and minitank his color was already improving tell me whats happening he asked teeth chattering she did jack rolled to his knees and coughed thickly whats this plan of charlies he wouldnt exactly say that sounds like charlie jack stood with her help rubbing his arms how much time do we have left one hour nick of time august am neptune base central pacific jack sat buried in warm towels he was finally starting to feel his toes charlies image flickered on the computer screen in front of him first tell me about this missile strike whats that all about a failsafe mechanism was initiated from a radio transmission from below i thought you might know more about it jack glanced at karen it wasnt from here she said i was with rolfe at the time then it must have been spangler jack said with a scowl his final attempt to kill me from the grave he must have really hated you jack charlie chimed in a nucleartipped icbm has our names on it jacks eyes grew wide he forgot about the chill in his limbs how long do we have from gabriels estimation fiftyseven minutes one minute after the solar storm hits jack shook his head so even if we can block this pillar and save the world we still die in a nuclear blast charlie shrugged pretty much jack sat quietly stubbornly considering their options then sighed what the hell heroes arent suppose to live forever lets get this done whats this new plan of yours charlie its a long shot jack considering our current state of affairs ill take any damn shot but i really wanted to run my calculations by dr cortez first well unless you have a ouija board that aint happening so spit it out whats this plan charlie looked grim you gave me the idea jack we overload the pillar with energy try to shortcircuit it not exactly if we overload the crystal with precisely enough energy pulse it at exactly the right frequency it should fracture the crystal without a kinetic backlash like shattering a crystal goblet by striking the right note and you know the right note charlie nodded i think i do but the hard part was finding a way to deliver the note the energy has to be precise and sustained for three minutes and you figured this out i think so charlie sighed thats what gabriel and i have been working on since you left and youre not going to like it jack for this type of sustained power well need a particlebeam weapon how are we supposed to get our hands on such a thing charlie just stared at him as if he should already know the answer then understanding struck jack between the eyes he jerked to his feet waityou cant mean the spartacus gabriel obtained its specs it should work whats this spartacus karen interrupted jack sank back down its a navy satellite the one i was putting into orbit when the shuttle atlantis was damaged its equipped with an experimental particlebeam cannon engineered to knock out targets from space airplanes missiles ships even submarines jack turned back to charlie but its defunct damaged charlie shook his head only its guidance and tracking systems which of course makes it useless to the government for it to work theyd need an operator sitting up there aiming the thing by hand charlie paused but luckily we have that operator right here jack did not understand but karen realized the answer gabriel exactly i sent him earlier to try to access the satellites central processor with the current global crisis and with the spartacus classified as dead in space he and miyuki succeeded in slipping past the old firewalls the satellites processor is still active youre kiddingafter all these years karen asked skeptically its solar powered an infinite energy source as the others talked jack sat quietly flashing back to the bright satellite lifting from its shuttle bay cradle silvery solar wings spreading wide he tried to close his mind against what happened afterward but failed the explosion the screams the endless fall through space he shivered not from cold but from a twinge of superstitious dread the spartacus was cursed death surrounded it nothing good could come from the wretched thing it wont work he grumbled do we have any other choice karen asked she placed a hand on his shoulder then spoke to charlie when can we try it well thats the clincher well have only the one chance the satellite wont come within orbital range until fortyeight minutes from now jack checked the clock thats three minutes before the solar storm hits three minutes is all ill need either it works or it doesnt jack shook his head this is insane what do we have to do karen asked to target the pillar gabriel will need an active gps lock something upon which to focus the cannon were going to need you to place the nautiluss magellan gps homing device over by the pillar itll feed data to the fathom and in turn ill send it to gabriel jack shook his head then we have a problem the nautilus is still outside the sea base i had to do an emergency jettison to enter the docking bay theres no way to get to the magellan unit outside karen spoke up what about the rov robot its too crude to extract the magellan unit without harming it someone would have to do it by hand no one spoke everyone sat sullenly then karen brightened i may have an idea am standing in the docking bay jack watched the water level rise past the front port of his helmet he moved his arms acquainting himself to the deepsea armored ensemble it was one of the navy divers suits the large helmet had four viewing ports forward right left and above the bulbous helmet was so wide that it blended flush with the suits shoulders creating a bulletshaped form with jointed arms and legs protruding from it small lights were mounted atop the helmet and at each wrist there were also thruster assemblies built into the back like the old rocket packs in scifi serials as jack moved slowly about the filling bay he found its operation fairly intuitive similar to the eva suits used for spacewalks howre you doing karens voice came through the helmet radio through the seawater he spotted her waving to him from the bays observation window after talking with charlie karen had taken jack down to the docking level and shown him the garages where the huge suits were stored he had to give her credit it was a clever solution he waved back doing fine charlie is jacked into the radio system hes monitoring also charlie jack called out right here mon hows gabriel doing the little bugger has finished troubleshooting the satellites systems theyre powering up and awaiting our signal just get that gps unit and haul ass were running out of time jacks gaze flicked to the helmets internal computer screen sixteen minutes i hear you karen came back on line careful the docking bay doors are opening jack bent a bit peering down a few feet away the huge doors slid open the ocean lay beyond jack stepped toward the opening id better get going from across the way he spotted karens face through the window she held a fist to her throat worried and scared jack sensed her fear was more for his own safety than the fate of the world with a last wave he stepped from the bay and sank down to the ocean floor using a hand pad he adjusted his buoyancy and settled in place the remains of the nautilus lay two yards away playing with the thrusters jack spun himself around until he faced the sub then moved over to its side bending at the knee he searched the vessel the magellan unit was just forward to the portside thruster assembly he shuffled around until he found it reaching with an arm he used the threepronged pincer grip to unscrew its cover plate it took a little prying since it was bent inward from the hard use the sub had recently faced the plate fell away jack kneeled lower awkward in the bulky suit he shone the tiny wrist lamps inside oh shit the shoeboxsize device was smashed its inner components open to the seawater he groaned aloud you okay jack karen asked he straightened the magellan is toast the units fried hopelessness hollowed his chest goddamn that asshole spangler charlies voice echoed through the tiny speakers but jack im picking up a gps signal impossible not from the nautilus step away charlie said get clear of the sea base using his thrusters jack skimmed between two of the steel support legs and out into open ocean its you charlie said that navy suit must be engineered with an automatic gps homing device a safety feature in case a diver gets stranded jack felt hope rekindle then all i have to do is reach the pillar you have eight minutes charlie paused but jack if the gps is a part of the suit youll have to stay by the pillar jack understood what charlie was implying it would mean his death karen came to the same realization there has to be another way what about that other plan the last resort to reset the explosive charges and blow up just the pillar charlie argued the kinetic energy backlash fingering his controls jack goosed his thrusters folks either way theres a nuke with our names on it already in the air this is the only viable option he swung around and flew across the seabed floor the pillar lay fifty yards away be ready am deep fathom lisa stood with robert and george by the bow rail the sun overhead shone brilliantly there was not a cloud in the sky they had come up to the deck to await the outcome with the other four belowdecks the lab had been too crowded too cramped lisa needed to feel the breeze on her cheekif only for one last time george and robert had accompanied her george smoked his pipe robert had his sony walkman over his ears faintly lisa could hear the tinny sounds of bruce springsteen singing born to run she sighed if only they could run but they couldnt the fathom needed to stay nearby to aid in the flow of transmissions between the station below and the satellite overhead there would be no escape for any of them even if their plan succeeded the area would soon be wiped out destroyed in a decisive nuclear strike george removed his pipe and silently pointed its stem toward the horizon lisa looked a small contrail rose from the northeast streaking higher as it arced into the sky the failsafe missile george replaced his pipe his eyes on the sky no one said a word am encased in his reinforced suit jack stood with his back to the crystal pillar the ocean bottom lay dark all around him a moment ago he had ordered karen to turn off the grid to the lamp poles plunging the seas back into darkness he had also turned off his own suit lights he could not risk exciting the pillar prematurely and interfering with his gps signal are you registering me okay he asked charlie answered from the fathom loud and clear transmitting data up to gabriel he gazed around him the only light came from the yellow glow through the portholes of the neptune sea base though he could not see her jack felt karen staring back at him he sighed he would have liked the chance to have known her better his only regret he waited there was nothing else for him to do he was now just a living and breathing target for a spacebased weapons system he glanced up through the upper port of his helmet as if he could see the satellite spartacus he had somehow known one day their paths would cross again a destiny that needed to be fulfilled he had escaped death once the only survivor now he was standing in the crosshairs of the same satellite death would not be denied a second time he closed his eyes karen whispered in his ear like a ghost were with you jack all of us he silently acknowledged her all his life he had been surrounded by ghosts memories of the dead now at this last moment he let it all go finally realizing how much power he had given to the shades of his past well no longer at this moment he wanted only his fleshandblood friends at his side he opened his eyes and his comlink good luck everyone lets get this done charlies voice came next here we go pm low earth orbit nautical miles above the pacific sunlight reflected off the wings of the brilliant satellite upon its flank stenciled markings as crisp as the day they had been painted were easy to see a tiny flag identification numbers and broad red letters spelling out its name spartacus as it swept over the expanse of the pacific ocean the satellite slowly rotated an internal gyro spinning like a childs top pinioned solar wings tilted to catch more energy in turn powering up the highenergy chemical laser it was a ballet of power and force on its underside a hatch opened and a telescoping barrel protruded around the awakening satellite the upper atmosphere began to be peppered with ionized particles charging the ionosphere with tiny bursts of radiation like raindrops on a pond ripples began to spread the satellites communication system crackled something inside listened and compensated tuning away the interference however these raindrops were but the first trickle of a coming flood overhead past the orbit of the moon the true storm rushed toward earth a raging gale of wild energy and particles plunging through the vacuum of space at million miles per hour oblivious to the threat the satellite finished its cascade the chemical laser fed energy in microbursts to the particlebeam generator power levels rose exponentially building to thresholds that could only be sustained by a whirling pair of electromagnets its shielded central processor registered the escalation making one final adjustment locking on a signal far below power screamed between whirling magnets seeking a way out at last a switch was opened energy pulsed out in a narrow beam of neutrons ripping through the atmosphere striking the sea below and passing through the waters as easily as it had the air fed from space the beam raced into the midnight depths of the ocean where even the light of the sun could not penetrate pm neptune base karen stood face pressed to the cold window beyond the weak light of the portholes she searched for some sign of jack but could see nothing a starless midnight then in a blinding flash the crystal pillar burst with radiance karen gasped blinded she closed her eyes covering her face with an arm but the pillar still shone the image burned into her retina she stumbled back tears running down her face it took several seconds before she could even open her eyes when she did each porthole shone with such brilliance that it seemed the sun itself had descended atop the sea base my god shielding her eyes she moved to one of the ports trying to see outside nothing was visible not jack not the seabed beyond the world was just light jack pm deep fathom lisa continued to stand near the bow rail with george and robert the old historian sighed out a long stream of smoke seemingly unperturbed by the missile aiming across the sky toward them by now its fiery tail was easy to see lisa reached out and took georges hand he squeezed her fingers in his grip dont worry he whispered suddenly fatherly his eyes on the sky as they watched together the missile seemed to freeze in place hanging as if caught in amber lisa stared mouth hanging open surely it was an optical illusion one secondthen another and another passed it still refused to move robert spoke up drawing her attention away from the strange sky he was bent over the steel rail looking down he turned to them taking off his headphones guyswheres the ocean what do you mean lisa and george joined the young marine biologist she stared past the rail and gasped beyond the keel there was no water the ship was floating in midair rocking gently on invisible waves lisa bent over the rail far below a fierce light shone she looked around turning inside a hundredyard perimeter of the ship the sea was gone beyond this circle the ocean was as normal as any day it was as if the deep fathom were floating over a deep well in the ocean only this well had a sun at the bottom of it look at the sky george called out lisa tore her eyes from the wonders below to see something even more amazing overhead in the sky the small missile once hanging in place began to slide back down its smoke trail as if it were retreating what is going on she asked pm jack stood with his arms blocking his helmet ports he huddled against the light mouth open in a silent scream the power surging inches from his back vibrated his armor shell his skin was flushed hairs tingling he felt the energy down to his bones god before his sanity was burned away in the brightness he sensed a change in the timbre of the energy the light softened he lowered his arm rather than blinding the radiance from the pillar had become a silvery wash through the dark waters the seamounts the research station the lava pillars were all limned in stark relief etched in silver becoming mirrors themselves in the strange light a voice whispered in his ear hopeless scared jack as he stared knowing death lay moments away he spotted movement from the corner of his eye he turned searching out the helmet ports then he saw them reflected in the silvery surfaces of the nearby sea cliffs he watched images of men and women kneeling arms raised to the heavens more gathered behind throngs of robed and cloaked figures some with elaborate headdresses of feathers and jewels others bearing platters laden with fruits or leading sheep and pigs on leather tethers my god he whispered searching around he saw similar images in all the mirrored surfaces warped figures moving across the curved skin of the sea base fractured images on the broken wall of lava pillars even on a nearby boulder the reflection of a tall man kneeling with his face to the ground it was as if the silvery surfaces had become a magical looking glass to another world jack if youre out there answer me it was karen jacks voice filled with wonder his fear fading can you see them the kneeling figure lifted his face he was bearded with piercing eyes and strong limbs he stood and stepped from the mirrored boulder jack gasped backing and bumping into the pillar behind him all around him the procession of people moved forward leaving their reflected surfaces he now heard distant voices echoing songs chanting the figure from the boulder lifted his arms high a shout of joy on his lips jack found his gaze drawn upward there was no ocean only sky a bright sun hung above eclipsed by the moon glancing back down he saw hazy mountains in the distance and dense forests yet strangely at the same time he could still sense the ocean the sea base the cliffs he suddenly understood these were the ancient ones the people of the lost continent he was glimpsing their world karen whispered in his ear barely audible past the growing songs and chants ii see people around you jack it wasnt just him jack stepped forward to view the wonder better as he did so the tall bearded man crashed to his knees a look of rapture on his face he was staring right at jack i think they can see me too he said astounded who are they jack stopped and raised an arm all around the ghostly clearing men and women fell in postures of worship and prostration theyre your ancients the ones youve been looking for all these years were seeing back into their world through some strange warp and theyre in turn seeing into ours the kneeling man some sort of leader or shaman called loudly though the words were unintelligible he was clearly pleading jack had an idea karen are we still patched through to the fathom yes can you feed what this man is saying up to gabriel can he translate ill try there was a long pause jack gazed around in amazement finally a familiarly tinny voice scratchy with distance spoke in his ear i will attempt to translatebut i have only begun to attach phonetics to the ancient language do your best gabriel charlie spoke up youll have to hurry were escalating to the peak pulse frequency in thirtytwo seconds the man at jacks feet continued to speak gabriels translation overlapped our need is great spirit of the pillar oh god of the sun what message do you bring us that the land shakes and cracks with fire for the first time jack noticed the ground was trembling underfoot at that moment he realized not only where he was but when he stood at the dawn of this continents devastation jack also grasped his own role here he remembered the platinum diarys story the god of light stepped from his pillar outfitted in his armored suit basked by brilliance he was that god knowing his duty jack stepped forward and raised both arms flee he yelled as gabriel translated his words echoing out to those gathered a time of darkness is upon you a time of hardship the waters of the sea will claim your homelands and drown them away you must be prepared jack saw the shocked look on the others face the man had understood charlie yelled through the speakers get ready for the final pulse the view of the lost continent began to flicker hurrying jack stepped forward build great ships he ordered gather your flocks and fill the ships bellies with food from the fields save your people the shaman bowed his head your humble servant horonko hears and will obey a shocked gasp arose from the radio horonko karen said the one who wrote the diarythe bones in the coffin jack nodded staring down at the man their shared stories had come full circle as he stood the images sank back into the mirrored reflections here it comes charlie screamed jack braced tense waiting for the coming explosion but it never arrived instead the brightness simply blinked away like a candle snuffed jack straightened after the intense light the midnight seas were especially dark the glow from the bases portholes appeared anemic and wan karen yelled fear in her voice jack im still here she sighed with relief then charlie interrupted what about the pillar jack spun with his thrusters thumbing on his suits lamps his lights spread far in the darkness nothing the crystal pillar was gone all that remained were bits and chunks scattered across the dark seabed floor glowing in his beams like a sprinkle of stars he moved forward stepping among the shining constellations jack charlie whispered we did it the pillars destroyed charlie whooped with joy jack frowned charlies happiness was hard to share the world was saved but what about them the tactical nuclear strike jack asked spanglers revenge whens it due to hit i wouldnt worry about that mon deep fathom charlie sat in the pilothouse radio pressed to his lips jack you missed the eclipse the last time you might want to get back up here so you dont miss it a second time what the hell are you talking about charlie grinned at jacks consternation he couldnt resist stringing his captain along his heart was too full of amazement and joy he stood and stared out the wide window the others were all gathered on deck pointing up in the clear sky a black sun shone down casting the ocean in platinum charlie checked his wristwatch a little after twelve oclock he glanced back at the sun it was low in the sky too low shaking his head in wonder charlie glanced to the satellite navigation system its clock and date were constantly updated with a feed from a dozen satellites in geosynchronous orbit he stared at the digital time and date stamp he had confirmed the anomalous results with the local weather band too tuesday july pm goddamn it charlie what are you talking about charlie sighed letting jack off the hook we ran into a little anomaly jack like i said before im no expert on this new science of dark energy yeah so what happened well when we bombarded the pillar the dark energy behaved as i had hoped radiating straight back out rather than down but it had a side effect i hadnt anticipated what rather than stirring up the magma the dark energy spike triggered a massive global time flux resetting the earths battery to the moment when the dark matter had last been excited back to the solar storm two weeks ago back to the day of the eclipse jacks voice was incredulous what the hell are you saying that weve traveled back in time not us the world except for our local pocket here the rest of the planet slipped back sixteen days neptune base in the docking bay of the research station karen helped jack out of his bulky suit she had listened in on the geologists conversation with jack a global time flux it was too wild to comprehend right now all her mind could grasp was that they had survived the pillar was gone the world was safe the mysteries of einsteinian anomalies dark matter and dark energy would have to wait jack groaned climbing out of the unhinged armored suit karen held his arm assisting him here was what she understood flesh and blood jack had survived and returned to her as he had promised as he stumbled free he straightened with a large smile we did it karen opened her mouth to congratulate him then their eyes met she realized words were too weak to convey her true feelings instead she threw her arms around his neck knocking and pinning him back against the heavy suit before either of them knew it their lips sought each other out karen kissed him hard as if proving him no ghost he pulled her closer his lips moved from her mouth to her throat the heat of his touch was electric a dark energy of his own she gasped his name winding her fingers through his hair tangling and twisting refusing to let him go their flaring passion was not love nor even lust it was something more two people needing to prove they lived in the warmth of lips the touch of skin they celebrated life in all its physical needs sensations and wonder he pressed against her urgent and hungry she squeezed him harder arms trembling finally he broke away from her wewenot now not this way not enough time he sagged back one hand vaguely waving up we need to find a way topside karen grabbed his wrist follow me she brusquely guided him to the ladder climbing she still felt the heat of his touch on her skin a gentle warmth that spread through her limbs reaching the topmost tier she helped him off the ladder i was given a safety briefing when i first arrived she explained theres a builtin emergency evacuation system she hurried to a panel marked with large warning labels and pulled the door open a large red thandle lay snugly in place help me with this jack moved to her side his shoulders brushing hers what is it the upper tier acts as an emergency lifeboat sort of like the subs evacuation system this lever pops and separates the top level from the other two then according to the specs the positive buoyancy will float the tier to the surface ready jack nodded together they yanked the handle a muffled explosion sounded rattling the floor underfoot the wall lamps blinked off as the tier separated from the main generators karen found jacks hand in the dark in moments red emergency lights flickered on the floor swayed then tilted karen tumbled into jacks arms he held her snugly were free were floating up after a moment he turned to her eyes bright in the weak light how long till we breach the surface karen recognized the hunger in his voice she matched it with her own thirty or forty minutes she said huskily she slipped from his embrace and reached to her blouse freeing the top buttons she stepped back toward the sleeping quarters her eyes never left his it seems i never did give you a proper tour did i he followed her step for step his hand reached to the zipper of his dive suit tugging it down no and i think its long overdue deep fathom seven hours later out on the open deck jack and the others sat around a makeshift dining table jack had broken out the champagne and pulled the last of the porterhouse steaks from the freezer it was to be a sunset dinner to celebrate their survival and the secret shared by the nine people gathered here only they knew what had truly transpired earlier they had broken into teams to discover how the rest of the world had fared charlie discovered that this time around with the pillar destroyed the world had been spared the pacificwide devastation not even a tremor george in the meantime investigated if there was another deep fathom sailing the seas the old timeline counterparts there wasnt it was as if we were plucked from where we were and placed here the historian also confirmed from the hawaiian news wires that the neptune sea base had vanished from its dock in the waters off of wailea he read aloud the news report with a smile the head of the experimental project dr ferdinand cortez spoke to authorities expressing his dismay and bafflement at the theft karen was especially relieved he survived charlie answered i guess the currents must have dragged his body beyond the zone around the pillar when the flux occurred he simply popped back into the old timeline a timeline where he never came out here never died and he has no memory of what happened charlie shrugged i doubt it maybe somewhere deep inside something unspoken more an odd feeling but what about lieutenant rolfe his body is still down there exactly he remained within the zone so he stays dead i bet if you checked on him youd find him missing from the real world plucked out of the timeline just like the fathom and the sea base had been intrigued jack had taken it upon himself to check this angle he had dialed admiral houston and found him still in san diego the admiral had been thrilled to hear from him after so many years goddamn if i wasnt just thinking about you today jack during the eclipse after exchanging pleasantries and a promise to get together jack hurriedly explained how he wanted to check into a friends whereabouts lieutenant ken rolfe after a couple hours the admiral had called back suspicious jack do you know something youre not telling me a report came in an hour ago from turkey it says your friend went missing during a special ops mission at the iraq border along with another old friend of yours an old friend david spangler jack had to cover his surprise and talk his way off the phone once free he sat quietly for several moments so david had stayed dead probably still in the belly of the giant squid the great beast must have nested close to the pillar jack felt a twinge of regret alive and free he allowed himself the luxury of pity for the man david had been warped by his upbringing his fathers unspoken abuses so where did the true blame lie jack knew such answers were beyond him later as the afternoon had worn on lisa suggested the special dinner to toast their survival it was heartily agreed upon by all now with the sun sinking into the western ocean jack settled to the table and the celebration from across the way kendall mcmillan caught his eye the accountant wore shorts and a loose pullover extremely casual for the man captain kendall said i have a request to make what is it he cleared his throat and spoke firmly id like to officially join your crew this news surprised him kendall had always maintained an officious distance from the others jack frowned i dont know if we have the need for a fulltime accountant kendall glanced to his plate and mumbled you will when youre all millionaires what are you talking about he looked around the table then spoke loudly im talking about the kochi maru if mr mollier is correct in his assessment that there were no quakes this time around there is a good chance the previous volcanic eruption that swallowed the treasure ship may not have occurred the ship may still be down there jacks brows rose and his eyes widened he remembered the ships hold full of gold bricks at least a hundred tons jack stood and reached across the table he took the accountants hand and pumped it vigorously welcome to the crew of the deep fathom mr mcmillan for that timely observation you just earned yourself a tenth of the haul kendall grinned like a schoolboy jack lifted a glass of champagne well share equally everyone that includes our newest shipmates karen miyuki and mwahu kendall looked down the table but you said a tenth there are only nine of us here jack patted the tabletop the old german shepherd squatting at his feet jumped up his paws on the table he ruffled the dogs thick mane anyone object to elvis getting his fair share after all he did save all your asses from being blown to kingdom come kendall was the first on his feet raising his glass to elvis the others followed suit the old dog barked loudly jack sat back down smiling slowly as dinner became dessert people began to wander away into private groups to discuss the day and their futures all happy to still have one jack spotted karen by the starboard rail she stared into the suns last glow he pushed to his feet feeling slightly tipsy from the champagne he crossed to the rail and put his arm around her shoulders pulling her closer as he did he saw she held the broken shards of the crystal star in her palms she spoke her voice melancholy with the revelations of these past days my research is over my greatgrandfather was right there was a lost continent i now know the ancients truly existed she looked up at him sadly but if we are to keep the secret of the dark matter hidden then none must ever know the truth look how close we came to destroying ourselves with the mere power of the atom can you imagine what wed do with the power of an entire planet leaning over she tumbled the bright crystal shards into the dark sea like the ancients themselves were not ready for such power jack took her palms cradling them in his own dont worry there are other mysteries yet to be discovered leaning down he stared deeply into her eyes his lips brushing hers his voice low you just need to know where to look epilogue tuesday july san francisco california hours after the eclipse doreen mccloud left her office building she stared down market street the sun was a mere glow on the western horizon as she stared skyward she felt a surge of inexplicable joy she didnt understand this sudden emotion she had lost a critical client today and the senior partners had scheduled an early morning meeting with her to discuss the loss where normally such a thought would fill her with dread this evening all she felt was a simple appreciation of the cool san francisco breeze as she walked toward the bart station she noticed others glancing skyward smiles on their faces laughter stopping atop the stairs to the station doreen glanced to the setting sun what a strangely wonderful day aleutian islands alaska jimmy pomautuk climbed down the path his malamute nanook at his side the noisy english trio clambered ahead of him chattering nonstop full of grins and jokes though the group had complained all the way up here the eclipse had not failed to impress them in fact the sight had even touched his cynical soul the dark sun the silver ocean the brilliant borealis he wished he could have shared it with his son one generation passing a special heritage to another glancing back jimmy watched the sun set beyond glacial point for some reason today he felt closer to his grandfather his ancestors even the old gods of his people sighing jimmy patted nanook its been a good day boy hagatna territory of guam in the garden atrium of the governors mansion jeffrey hessmire stood beside the secretary of state together they watched president bishop cross the courtyard the festivities associated with the eclipse were dying away people were returning to their normal activities president bishop stepped in front of the chairman of the peoples republic he bowed slightly a show of respect and held out his hand after a short pause the chairman lifted an arm and gripped the presidents hand off to the side there was a flourish of camera flashes as the press documented the momentous occasion i know there is still much to settle between our countries the president said but together well find a way to peace the chairman bowed his head in agreement at jeffreys side secretary elliot snorted this is just gonna kill lawrence nafe both him and his hawkish cronies after today the vice presidents political support will dry up faster than a puddle in the sahara and though it may take some time for nafe to realize it his career just ended here today elliot clapped jeffrey on the shoulder all in all i must say its been one hell of a great day watching the ceremony
