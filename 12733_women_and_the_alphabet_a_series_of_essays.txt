women and the alphabet a series of essays by thomas wentworth higginson prefatory note the first essay in this volume ought women to learn the alphabet appeared originally in the atlantic monthly of february and has since been reprinted in various forms bearing its share i trust in the great development of more liberal views in respect to the training and duties of women which has made itself manifest within forty years there was for instance a report that it was the perusal of this essay which led the late miss sophia smith to the founding of the womens college bearing her name at northampton massachusetts the remaining papers in the volume formed originally a part of a book entitled common sense about women which was made up largely of papers from the womans journal this book was first published in and was reprinted in somewhat abridged form some years later in london sonnenschein it must have attained a considerable circulation there as the fourth stereotyped edition appeared in from this london reprint a german translation was made by fräulein eugenie jacobi under the title die frauenfrage und der gesunde menschenverstand schupp neuwied and leipzig twh cambridge

alphabet paris smiled for an hour or two in the year when amidst napoleons mighty projects for remodelling the religion and government of his empire the ironical satirist sylvain maréchal thrust in his plan for a law prohibiting the alphabet to women daring keen sarcastic learned the little tract retains today so much of its pungency that we can hardly wonder at the honest simplicity of the authors friend and biographer madame gacon dufour who declared that he must be insane and soberly replied to him his proposed statute consists of eightytwo clauses and is fortified by a whereas of a hundred and thirteen weighty reasons he exhausts the range of history to show the frightful results which have followed this taste of fruit of the tree of knowledge quotes from the encyclopédie to prove that the woman who knows the alphabet has already lost a portion of her innocence cites the opinion of molière that any female who has unhappily learned anything in this line should affect ignorance when possible asserts that knowledge rarely makes men attractive and females never opines that women have no occasion to peruse ovids art of love since they know it all in advance remarks that three quarters of femaleauthors are no better than they should be maintains that madame guion would have been far more useful had she been merely pretty and an ignoramus such as nature made herthat ruth and naomi could not read and boaz probably would never have married into the family had they possessed that accomplishmentthat the spartan women did not know the alphabet nor the amazons nor penelope nor andromache nor lucretia nor joan of arc nor petrarchs laura nor the daughters of charlemagne nor the three hundred and sixtyfive wives of mohammed but that sappho and madame de maintenon could read altogether too well while the case of saint brigitta who brought forth twelve children and twelve books was clearly exceptional and afforded no safe precedent it would seem that the brilliant frenchman touched the root of the matter ought women to learn the alphabet there the whole question lies concede this little fulcrum and archimedea will move the world before she has done with it it becomes merely a question of time resistance must be made here or nowhere obsta principiis woman must be a subject or an equal there is no middle ground what if the chinese proverb should turn out to be after all the summit of wisdom for men to cultivate virtue is knowledge for women to renounce knowledge is virtue no doubt the progress of events is slow like the working of the laws of gravitation generally certainly there has been but little change in the legal position of women since china was in its prime until within the last half century lawyers admit that the fundamental theory of english and oriental law is the same on this point man and wife are one and that one is the husband it is the oldest of legal traditions when blackstone declares that the very being and existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage and american kent echoes that her legal existence and authority are in a manner lost when petersdorff asserts that the husband has the right of imposing such corporeal restraints as he may deem necessary and bacon that the husband hath by law power and dominion over his wife and may keep her by force within the bounds of duty and may beat her but not in a violent or cruel manner when mr justice coleridge rules that the husband in certain cases has a right to confine his wife in his own dwellinghouse and restrain her from liberty for an indefinite time and baron alderson sums it all up tersely the wife is only the servant of her husbandthese high authorities simply reaffirm the dogma of the gentoo code four thousand years old and more a man both day and night must keep his wife so much in subjection that she by no means be mistress of her own actions if the wife have her own free will notwithstanding she be of a superior caste she will behave amiss yet behind these unchanging institutions a pressure has been for centuries becoming concentrated which now that it has begun to act is threatening to overthrow them all it has not yet operated very visibly in the old world where even in england the majority of women have not till lately mastered the alphabet sufficiently to sign their own names in the marriage register but in this country the vast changes of the last few years are already a matter of history no trumpet has been sounded no earthquake has been felt while state after state has ushered into legal existence one half of the population within its borders surely here and now might poor m maréchal exclaim the bitter fruits of the original seed appear the sad question recurs whether women ought ever to have tasted of the alphabet it is true that eve ruined us all according to theology without knowing her letters still there is something to be said in defence of that venerable ancestress the veronese lady isotta nogarola five hundred and thirtysix of whose learned epistles were preserved by de thou composed a dialogue on the question whether adam or eve had committed the greater sin but ludovico domenichi in his dialogue on the nobleness of women maintains that eve did not sin at all because she was not even created when adam was told not to eat the apple it was in adam all died he shrewdly says nobody died in eve which looks plausible be that as it may eves daughters are in danger of swallowing a whole harvest of forbidden fruit in these revolutionary days unless something be done to cut off the supply it has been seriously asserted that during the last half century more books have been written by women and about women than during all the previous uncounted ages it may be true although when we think of the innumerable volumes of mémoires by french women of the seventeenth and eighteenth centurieseach justifying the existence of her own ten volumes by the remark that all her contemporaries were writing as manywe have our doubts as to the increased multitude of general treatises on the female sex howeverits education life health diseases charms dress deeds sphere rights wrongs work wages encroachments and idiosyncrasies generallythere can be no doubt whatever and the poorest of these books recognizes a condition of public sentiment of which no other age ever dreamed still literary history preserves the names of some reformers before the reformation in this matter there was signora moderata fonte the venetian who left a book to be published after her death in dei meriti delle donne there was her townswoman lucrezia marinella who followed ten years after with her essay la nobilità e la eccelenza delle donne con difetti e mancamenti degli uominia comprehensive theme truly then followed the allaccomplished anna maria schurman in with her dissertatio de ingenii muliebris ad doctrinam et meliores literas aptitudine with a few miscellaneous letters appended in greek and hebrew at last came boldly jacquette guillaume in and threw down the gauntlet in her titlepage les dames illustres où par bonnes et fortes raisons il se prouve que le sexe feminin surpasse en toute sorte de genre le sexe masculin and with her came margaret boufflet and a host of others and finally in england mary wollstonecraft whose famous book formidable in its day would seem rather conservative now and in america that pious and worthy dame mrs h mather crocker cotton mathers grandchild who in published the first book on the rights of woman ever written on this side the atlanticmeanwhile there have never been wanting men and strong men to echo these appeals from cornelius agrippa and his essay on the excellence of woman and her preëminence over man down to the first youthful thesis of agassiz mens feminae viri animo superior there has been a succession of voices crying in the wilderness in england anthony gibson wrote a book in called a womans woorth defended against all the men in the world proving them to be more perfect excellent and absolute in all vertuous actions than any man of what qualitie soever interlarded with poetry per contra the learned acidalius published a book in latin and afterwards in french to prove that women are not reasonable creatures modern theologians are at worst merely subacid and do not always say so if they think so meanwhile most persons have been content to leave the world to go on its old course in this matter as in others and have thus acquiesced in that stern judicial decree with which timon of athens sums up all his curses upon womankindif there sit twelve women at the table let a dozen of them beas they are ancient or modern nothing in any of these discussions is so valuable as the fact of the discussion itself there is no discussion where there is no wrong nothing so indicates wrong as this morbid selfinspection the complaints are a perpetual protest the defences a perpetual confession it is too late to ignore the question and once opened it can be settled only on absolute and permanent principles there is a wrong but where does woman already know too much or too little was she created for mans subject or his equal shall she have the alphabet or not ancient mythology which undertook to explain everything easily accounted for the social and political disabilities of woman goguet quotes the story from saint augustine who got it from varro cecrops building athens saw starting from the earth an oliveplant and a fountain side by side the delphic oracle said that this indicated a strife between minerva and neptune for the honor of giving a name to the city and that the people must decide between them cecrops thereupon assembled the men and the women also who then had a right to vote and the result was that minerva carried the election by a glorious majority of one then attica was overflowed and laid waste of course the citizens attributed the calamity to neptune and resolved to punish the women it was therefore determined that in future they should not vote nor should any child bear the name of its mother thus easily did mythology explain all troublesome inconsistencies but it is much that it should even have recognized them as needing explanation the real solution is however more simple the obstacle to the womans sharing the alphabet or indeed any other privilege has been thought by some to be the fear of impairing her delicacy or of destroying her domesticity or of confounding the distinction between the sexes these may have been plausible excuses they have even been genuine though minor anxieties but the whole thing i take it had always one simple intelligible basissheer contempt for the supposed intellectual inferiority of woman she was not to be taught because she was not worth teaching the learned acidalius aforesaid was in the majority according to aristotle and the peripatetics woman was animal occasionatum as if a sort of monster and accidental production mediaeval councils charitably asserting her claims to the rank of humanity still pronounced her unfit for instruction in the hindoo dramas she did not even speak the same language with her master but used the dialect of slaves when in the sixteenth century françoise de saintonges wished to establish girls schools in france she was hooted in the streets and her father called together four doctors learned in the law to decide whether she was not possessed by demons to think of educating womenpour sassurer quinstruire des femmes nétait pas un oeuvre du démon it was the same with political rights the foundation of the salic law was not any sentimental anxiety to guard female delicacy and domesticity it was as stated by froissart a blunt hearty contempt the kingdom of france being too noble to be ruled by a woman and the same principle was reaffirmed for our own institutions in rather softened language by theophilus parsons in his famous defence of the rights of massachusetts men the essex result in women what age soever they are of are not considered as having a sufficient acquired discretion to exercise the franchise in harmony with this are the various maxims and bonmots of eminent men in respect to women niebuhr thought he should not have educated a girl wellhe should have made her know too much lessing said the woman who thinks is like the man who puts on rouge ridiculous voltaire said ideas are like beards women and young men have none and witty dr maginn carries to its extreme the atrocity we like to hear a few words of sense from a woman as we do from a parrot because they are so unexpected yet how can we wonder at these opinions when the saints have been severer than the sagessince the pious fénelon taught that true virgin delicacy was almost as incompatible with learning as with vice and dr channing complained in his essay on exclusion and denunciation of women forgetting the tenderness of their sex and arguing on theology now this impression of feminine inferiority may be right or wrong but it obviously does a good deal towards explaining the facts it assumes if contempt does not originally cause failure it perpetuates it systematically discourage any individual or class from birth to death and they learn in nine cases out of ten to acquiesce in their degradation if not to claim it as a crown of glory if the abbé choisi praised the duchesse de fontanges for being beautiful as an angel and silly as a goose it was natural that all the young ladies of the court should resolve to make up in folly what they wanted in charms all generations of women having been bred under the shadow of intellectual contempt they have of course done much to justify it they have often used only for frivolous purposes even the poor opportunities allowed them theyhave employed the alphabet as molière said chiefly in spelling the verb amo their use of science has been like that of mlle de launay who computed the decline in her lovers affection by his abbreviation of their evening walk in the public square preferring to cross it rather than take the circuit from which i inferred she says that his passion had diminished in the ratio between the diagonal of a rectangular parallelogram and the sum of two adjacent sides and their conception even of art has been too often on the scale of properzia de rossi who carved sixtyfive heads on a walnut the smallest of all recorded symbols of womans sphere all this might perhaps be overcome if the social prejudice which discourages women would only reward proportionately those who surmount the discouragement the more obstacles the more glory if society would only pay in proportion to the labor but it does not women being denied not merely the training which prepares for great deeds but the praise and compensation which follow them have been weakened in both directions the career of eminent men ordinarily begins with college and the memories of miltiades and ends with fortune and fame woman begins under discouragement and ends beneath the same single she works with half preparation and half pay married she puts name and wages into the keeping of her husband shrinks into john smiths lady during life and john smiths relict on her tombstone and still the world wonders that her deeds like her opportunities are inferior evidently then the advocates of womans claimsthose who hold that the virtues of the man and the woman are the same with antisthenes or that the talent of the man and the woman is the same with socrates in xenophons banquetmust be cautious lest they attempt to prove too much of course if women know as much as the men without schools and colleges there is no need of admitting them to those institutions if they work as well on half pay it diminishes the inducement to give them the other half the safer position is to claim that they have done just enough to show what they might have done under circumstances less discouraging take for instance the common remark that women have invented nothing it is a valid answer that the only implements habitually used by woman have been the needle the spindle and the basket and tradition reports that she herself invented all three in the same way it may be shown that the departments in which women have equalled men have been the departments in which they have had equal training equal encouragement and equal compensation as for instance the theatre madame lagrange the prima donna after years of costly musical instruction wins the zenith of professional success she receives the newspapers affirm sixty thousand dollars a year travelling expenses for ten persons countryhouses stables and liveries besides an uncounted revenue of bracelets bouquets and billetsdoux of course every young débutante fancies the same thing within her own reach with only a brief stagevista between on the stage there is no deduction for sex and therefore woman has shown in that sphere an equal genius but every female commonschool teacher in the united states finds the enjoyment of her four hundred dollars a year to be secretly embittered by the knowledge that the young college stripling in the next schoolroom is paid twice that sum for work no harder or more responsible than her own and that too after the whole pathway of education has been obstructed for her and smoothed for him these may be gross and carnal considerations but faith asks her daily bread and fancy must be fed we deny woman her fair share of training of encouragement of remuneration and then talk fine nonsense about her instincts and intuitions we say sentimentally with the oriental proverbialist every book of knowledge is implanted by nature in the heart of womanand make the compliment a substitute for the alphabet nothing can be more absurd than to impose entirely distinct standards in this respect on the two sexes or to expect that woman any more than man will accomplish anything great without due preparation and adequate stimulus mrs patten who navigated her husbands ship from cape horn to california would have failed in the effort for all her heroism if she had not unlike most of her sex been taught to use her bowditchs navigator florence nightingale when she heard of the distresses in the crimea did not as most people imagine rise up and say i am a woman ignorant but intuitive with very little sense and information but exceedingly sublime aspirations my strength lies in my weakness i can do all things without knowing anything about them not at all during ten years she had been in hard training for precisely such services had visited all the hospitals in london edinburgh dublin paris lyons rome brussels and berlin had studied under the sisters of charity and been twice a nurse in the protestant institution at kaiserswerth therefore she did not merely carry to the crimea a womans heart as her stock in trade but she knew the alphabet of her profession better than the men around her of course genius and enthusiasm are for both sexes elements unforeseen and incalculable but as a general rule great achievements imply great preparations and favorable conditions to disregard this truth is unreasonable in the abstract and cruel in its consequences if an extraordinary male gymnast can clear a height of ten feet with the aid of a springboard it would be considered slightly absurd to ask a woman to leap eleven feet without one yet this is precisely what society and the critics have always done training and wages and social approbation are very elastic springboards and the whole course of history has seen these offered bounteously to one sex and as sedulously withheld from the other let woman consent to be a doll and there was no finery so gorgeous no babyhouse so costly but she might aspire to share its lavish delights let her ask simply for an equal chance to learn to labor and to live and it was as if that same doll should open its lips and propound euclids fortyseventh proposition while we have all deplored the helpless position of indigent women and lamented that they had no alternative beyond the needle the washtub the schoolroom and the street we have usually resisted their admission into every new occupation denied them training and cut their compensation down like charles lamb who atoned for coming late to the office in the morning by going away early in the afternoon we have first half educated women and then to restore the balance only half paid them what innumerable obstacles have been placed in their way as female physicians whata complication of difficulties has been encountered by them even as printers engravers and designers in london mr bennett was once mobbed for lecturing to women on watchmaking in this country we have known grave professors refuse to address lyceums which thought fit to employ an occasional female lecturer mr comer stated that it was in the face of ridicule and sneers that he began to educate american women as bookkeepers many years ago and it was a little contemptible in miss muloch to revive the same satire in a womans thoughts on women when she must have known that in half the retail shops in paris her own sex rules the ledger and mammon knows no salic law we find on investigation what these considerations would lead us to expect that eminent women have commonly been exceptional in training and position as well as in their genius they have excelled the average of their own sex because they have shared the ordinary advantages of the other sex take any department of learning or skill take for instance the knowledge of languages the universal alphabet philology on the great stairway at padua stands the statue of elena cornaro professor of six languages in that once renowned university but elena cornaro was educated like a boy by her father on the great door of the university of bologna is inscribed the epitaph of clotilda tambroni the honored correspondent of porson and the first greek scholar of southern europe in her day but clotilda tambroni was educated like a boy by emanuele aponte how fine are those prefatory words by a right reverend prelate to that pioneer book in anglosaxon lore elizabeth elstobs grammar our earthly possessions are indeed our patrimony as derived to us by the industry of our fathers but the language in which we speak is our mother tongue and who so proper to play the critic in this as the females yet this particular female obtained the rudiments of her rare education from her mother before she was eight years old in spite of much opposition from her right reverend guardians adelung declares that all modern philology is founded on the translation of a russian vocabulary into two hundred different dialects by catherine ii but catherine shared in childhood the instructors of her brother prince frederick and was subject to some reproach for learning though a girl so much more rapidly than he did christina of sweden ironically reproved madame dacier for her translation of callimachus such a pretty girl as you are are you not ashamed to be so learned but madame dacier acquired greek by contriving to do her embroidery in the room where her father was teaching her stupid brother and her queenly critic had herself learned to read thucydides harder greek than callimachus before she was fourteen and so down to our own day who knows how many mute inglorious minervas may have perished unenlightened while margaret fuller ossoli and elizabeth barrett browning were being educated like boys this expression simply means that they had the most solid training which the times afforded most persons would instantly take alarm at the very words that is they have so little faith in the distinctions which nature has established that they think if you teach the alphabet or anything else indiscriminately to both sexes you annul all difference between them the common reasoning is thus boys and girls are acknowledged to be very unlike now boys study greek and algebra medicine and bookkeeping therefore girls should not as if one should say boys and girls are very unlike now boys eat beef and potatoes therefore obviously girls should not the analogy between physical and spiritual food is precisely in point the simple truth is that amid the vast range of human powers and properties the fact of sex is but one item vital and momentous in itself it does not constitute the whole organism but only a part the distinction of male and female is special aimed at a certain end and apart from that end it is throughout all the kingdoms of nature of minor importance with but trifling exceptions from infusoria up to man the female animal moves breathes looks listens runs flies swims pursues its food eats it digests it in precisely the same manner as the male all instincts all characteristics are the same except as to the one solitary fact of parentage mr ten broecks racehorses pryor and prioress were foaled alike fed alike trained alike and finally ran side by side competing for the same prize the eagle is not checked in soaring by any consciousness of sex nor asks the sex of the timid hare its quarry nature for high purposes creates and guards the sexual distinction but keeps it subordinate to those still more important now all this bears directly upon the alphabet what sort of philosophy is that which says john is a fool jane is a genius nevertheless john being a man shall learn lead make laws make money jane being a woman shall be ignorant dependent disfranchised underpaid of course the time is past when one would state this so frankly though comte comes quite near it to say nothing of the mormons but this formula really lies at the bottom of the reasoning one hears every day the answer is soul before sex give an equal chance and let genius and industry do the rest la carrière ouverte aux talens every man for himself every woman for herself and the alphabet for us all thus far my whole course of argument has been defensive and explanatory i have shown that womans inferiority in special achievements so far as it exists is a fact of small importance because it is merely a corollary from her historic position of degradation she has not excelled because she has had no fair chance to excel man placing his foot upon her shoulder has taunted her with not rising but the ulterior question remains behind how came she into this attitude originally explain the explanation the logician fairly demands granted that woman is weak because she has been systematically degraded but why was she degraded this is a far deeper questionone to be met only by a profounder philosophy and a positive solution we are coming on ground almost wholly untrod and must do the best we can i venture to assert then that womans social inferiority has been to a great extent in the past a legitimate thing to all appearance history would have been impossible without it just as it would have been impossible without an epoch ofwar and slavery it is simply a matter of social progressa part of the succession of civilizations the past has been inevitably a period of ignorance of engrossing physical necessities and of brute forcenot of freedom of philanthropy and of culture during that lower epoch woman was necessarily an inferior degraded by abject labor even in time of peacedegraded uniformly by war chivalry to the contrary notwithstanding behind all the courtesies of amadis and the cid lay the stern factwoman a child or a toy the flattering troubadours chanted her into a poets paradise but alas that kingdom of heaven suffered violence and the violent took it by force the truth simply was that her time had not come physical strength must rule for a time and she was the weaker she was very properly refused a feudal grant by reason say les coustumes de normandie of her unfitness for war or policy cest lhomme ki se bast et ki conseille other authorities put it still more plainly a woman cannot serve the emperor or feudal lord in war on account of the decorum of her sex nor assist him with advice because of her limited intellect nor keep his counsel owing to the infirmity of her disposition all which was no doubt in the majority of cases true and the degradation of woman was simply a part of a system which has indeed had its day but has bequeathed its associations from this reign of force woman never freed herself by force she could not fight or would not bohemian annals to be sure record the legend of a literal war between the sexes in which the womens army was led by libussa and wlasla and which finally ended with the capture by the army of men of castle dziewin maidens tower whose ruins are still visible near prague the armor of libussa is still shown at vienna and the guide calls attention to the longpeaked toes of steel with which he avers the tender princess was wont to pierce the hearts of her opponents while careering through the battle and there are abundant instances in which women have fought side by side with men and on equal terms the ancient british women mingled in the wars of their husbands and their princesses were trained to the use of arms in the maidens castle at edinburgh in the isle of skye the moorish wives and maidens fought in defence of their european peninsula and the portuguese women fought on the same soil against the armies of philip ii the king of siam has at present a bodyguard of four hundred women they are armed with lance and rifle are admirably disciplined and their commander appointed after saving the kings life at a tigerhunt ranks as one of the royal family and has ten elephants at her service when the allconquering dahomian army marched upon abbeokuta in they numbered ten thousand men and six thousand women the women were as usual placed foremost in the assault as being most reliable and of the eighteen hundred bodies left dead before the walls the vast majority were of women the hospital of the invalides in paris has sheltered for half a century a fine specimen of a female soldier lieutenant madame bulan who lived to be more than eighty years old had been decorated by napoleons own hand with the cross of the legion of honor and was credited on the hospital books with seven years service seven campaigns three wounds several times distinguished especially in corsica in defending a fort against the english but these cases though interesting to the historian are still exceptional and the instinctive repugnance they inspire is a condemnation not of women but of war the reason then for the long subjection of woman has been simply that humanity was passing through its first epoch and her full career was to be reserved for the second as the different races of man have appeared successively upon the stage of history so there has been an order of succession of the sexes womans appointed era like that of the teutonic races was delayed but not omitted it is not merely true that the empire of the past has belonged to man but that it has properly belonged to him for it was an empire of the muscles enlisting at best but the lower powers of the understanding there can be no question that the present epoch is initiating an empire of the higher reason of arts affections aspirations and for that epoch the genius of woman has been reserved the spirit of the age has always kept pace with the facts and outstripped the statutes till the fulness of time came woman was necessarily kept a slave to the spinningwheel and the needle now higher work is ready peace has brought invention to her aid and the mechanical means for her emancipation are ready also no use in releasing her till man with his strong arm had worked out his preliminary share in civilization earth waits for her queen was a favorite motto of margaret fuller ossoli but it would be more correct to say that the queen has waited for her earth till it could be smoothed and prepared for her occupancy now cinderella may begin to think of putting on her royal robes everybody sees that the times are altering the whole material position of woman but most people do not appear to see the inevitable social and moral changes which are also involved as has been already said the woman of ancient history was a slave to physical necessities both in war and peace in war she could do too little in peace she did too much under the material compulsions which controlled the world how could the jews for instance elevate woman they could not spare her from the wool and the flax and the candle that goeth not out by night in rome when the bride first stepped across her threshold they did not ask her do you know the alphabet they asked simply can you spin there was no higher epitaph than queen amalasonthasdomum servavit lanam fecit in boeotia brides were conducted home in vehicles whose wheels were burned at the door in token that they were never to leave the house again pythagoras instituted at crotona an annual festival for the distaff confucius in china did the same for the spindle and these celebrated not the freedom but the serfdom of woman and even into modern days this same tyrannical necessity has lingered go spin you jades go spin was the only answer vouchsafed by the earl of pembroke to the twicebanished nuns of wilton even now travellers agree that throughout civilized europe with the partial exception of england and france the profound absorption of the mass of women in household labors renders their general elevation impossible but with us americans and in this age when allthese vast labors are being more and more transferred to arms of brass and iron when rochester grinds the flour and lowell weaves the cloth and the fire on the hearth has gone into black retirement and mourning when the wiser a virgin is the less she has to do with oil in her lamp when the needle has made its last dying speech and confession in the song of the shirt and the sewingmachine has changed those doleful marches to delightful measureshow is it possible for the blindest to help seeing that a new era is begun and that the time has come for woman to learn the alphabet nobody asks for any abolition of domestic labor for women any more than of outdoor labor for men of course most women will still continue to be mainly occupied with the indoor care of their families and most men with their external support all that is desirable for either sex is such an economy of labor in this respect as shall leave some spare time to be appropriated in other directions the argument against each new emancipation of woman is precisely that always made against the liberation of serfs and the enfranchisement of plebeiansthat the new position will take them from their legitimate business how can he or she get wisdom that holdeth the plough or the broomwhose talk is of bullocks or of babies yet the american farmer has already emancipated himself from these fancied incompatibilities and so will the farmers wife in a nation where there is no leisure class and no peasantry this whole theory of exclusion is an absurdity we all have a little leisure and we must all make the most of it if we will confine large interests and duties to those who have nothing else to do we must go back to monarchy at once if otherwise then the alphabet and its consequences must be open to woman as to man jean paul says nobly in his levana that before and after being a mother a woman is a human being and neither maternal nor conjugal relation can supersede the human responsibility but must become its means and instrument and it is good to read the manly speech on this subject of john quincy adams quoted at length in quincys life of him in which after fully defending the political petitions of the women of plymouth he declares that the correct principle is that women are not only justified but exhibit the most exalted virtue when they do depart from the domestic circle and enter on the concerns of their country of humanity and of their god there are duties devolving on every human beingduties not small nor few but vast and variedwhich spring from home and private life and all their sweet relations the support or care of the humblest household is a function worthy of men women and angels so far as it goes from these duties none must shrink neither man nor woman the loftiest genius cannot ignore them the sublimest charity must begin with them they are their own exceeding great reward their selfsacrifice is infinite joy and the selfishness which discards them is repaid by loneliness and a desolate old age yet these though the most tender and intimate portion of human life do not form its whole it is given to noble souls to crave other interests also added spheres not necessarily alien from these larger knowledge larger action also duties responsibilities anxieties dangers all the aliment that history has given to its heroes not home less but humanity more when the highborn english lady in the crimean hospital ordered to a post of almost certain death only raised her hands to heaven and said thank god she did not renounce her true position as woman she claimed it when the queen of james i of scotland already immortalized by him in stately verse won a higher immortality by welcoming to her fair bosom the dagger aimed at his when the countess of buchan hung confined in her iron cage outside berwick castle in penalty for crowning robert the bruce when the stainless soul of joan of arc met god like moses in a burning flamethese things were as they should be man must not monopolize these privileges of peril the birthright of great souls serenades and compliments must not replace the nobler hospitality which shares with woman the opportunity of martyrdom great administrative duties also cares of state for which one should be born grayheaded how nobly do these sit upon a womans brow each year adds to the storied renown of elizabeth of england greatest sovereign of the greatest of historic nations christina of sweden alone among the crowned heads of europe so

is growing more feminine it is a compliment whether the naturalist intended it or not time has brought peace peace invention and the poorest woman of today is born to an inheritance of which her ancestors never dreamed previous attempts to confer on women social and political equalityas when leopold grand duke of tuscany made them magistrates or when the hungarian revolutionists made them voters or when our own new jersey tried the same experiment in a guarded fashion in early times and then revoked the privilege because as in the ancient fable the women voted the wrong waythese things were premature and valuable only as recognitions of a principle but in view of the rapid changes now going on he is a rash man who asserts the woman question to be anything but a mere question of time the fulcrum has been already given in the alphabet and we must simply watch and see whether the earth does not move there is the plain fact woman must be either a subject or an equal there is no middle ground every concession to a supposed principle only involves the necessity of the next concession for which that principle calls once yield the alphabet and we abandon the whole long theory of subjection and coverture tradition is set aside and we have nothing but reason to fall back upon reasoning abstractly it must be admitted that the argument has been thus far entirely on the womens side inasmuch as no man has yet seriously tried to meet them with argument it is an alarming feature of this discussion that it has reversed very generally the traditional positions of the sexes the women have had all the logic and the most intelligent men when they have attempted the other side have limited themselves to satire andgossip what rational woman can be really convinced by the nonsense which is talked in ordinary society around heras that it is right to admit girls to common schools and equally right to exclude them from colleges that it is proper for a woman to sing in public but indelicate for her to speak in public that a postoffice box is an unexceptionable place to drop a bit of paper into but a ballotbox terribly dangerous no cause in the world can keep above water sustained by such contradictions as these too feeble and slight to be dignified by the name of fallacies some persons profess to think it impossible to reason with a woman and such critics certainly show no disposition to try the experiment but we must remember that all our american institutions are based on consistency or on nothing all claim to be founded on the principles of natural right and when they quit those they are lost in all european monarchies it is the theory that the mass of the people are children to be governed not mature beings to govern themselves this is clearly stated and consistently applied in the united states we have formally abandoned this theory for one half of the human race while for the other half it flourishes with little change the moment the claims of woman are broached the democrat becomes a monarchist what americans commonly criticise in english statesmen namely that they habitually evade all arguments based on natural right and defend every legal wrong on the ground that it works well in practice is the precise defect in our habitual view of woman the perplexity must be resolved somehow most men admit that a strict adherence to our own principles would place both sexes in precisely equal positions before law and constitution as well as in school and society but each has his special quibble to apply showing that in this case we must abandon all the general maxims to which we have pledged ourselves and hold only by precedent nay he construes even precedent with the most ingenious rigor since the exclusion of women from all direct contact with affairs can be made far more perfect in a republic than is possible in a monarchy where even sex is merged in rank and the female patrician may have far more power than the male plebeian but as matters now stand among us there is no aristocracy but of sex all men are born patrician all women are legally plebeian all men are equal in having political power and all women in having none this is a paradox so evident and such an anomaly in human progress that it cannot last forever without new discoveries in logic or else a deliberate return to m maréchals theory concerning the alphabet meanwhile as the newspapers say we anxiously await further developments according to present appearances the final adjustment lies mainly in the hands of women themselves men can hardly be expected to concede either rights or privileges more rapidly than they are claimed or to be truer to women than women are to each other in fact the worst effect of a condition of inferiority is the weakness it leaves behind even when we say hands off the sufferer does not rise in such a case there is but one counsel worth giving more depends on determination than even on ability will not talent

natural history there are a good many writersusually menwho with the best intentions discuss woman as if she had merely a physical organization and as if she existed only for one object the production and rearing of children against this some protest may well be made doubtless there are few things more important to a community than the health of its women the sandwich island proverb saysif strong is the frame of the mother the son will give laws to the people and in nations where all men give laws all men need mothers of strong frames moreover there is no harm in admitting that all the rules of our structure are imperative that soul and body whether of man or woman are made in harmony so that each part of our nature must accept the limitations of the other a mans soul may yearn to the stars but so long as the body cannot jump so high he must accept the bodys veto it is the same with any veto interposed in advance by the physical structure of woman nobody objects to this general principle it is only when clerical gentlemen or physiological gentlemen undertake to go a step farther and put in that veto on their own responsibility that it is necessary to say hands off gentlemen precisely because women are women they not you are to settle that question one or two points are clear every specialist is liable to overrate his own specialty and the man who thinks of woman only as a wife and mother is apt to forget that before she was either of these she was a human being women as such says an able writer are constituted for purposes of maternity and the continuation of mankind undoubtedly and so were men as such constituted for paternity but very much depends on what relative importance we assign to the phrase as such even an essay so careful so moderate and so free from coarseness as that here quoted suggests after all a slight onesidednessperhaps a natural reaction from the onesidedness of those injudicious reformers who allow themselves to speak slightingly of the merely animal function of childbearing higher than eitherwiser than both put togetheris that noble statement with which jean paul begins his fine essay on the education of girls in levana before being a wife or mother one is a human being and neither motherly nor wifely destination can overbalance or replace the human but must become its means not end as above the poet the painter or the hero so above the mother does the human being rise preëminent here is sure anchorage we can hold to this and fortunately all the analogies of nature sustain this position throughout nature the laws of sex rule everywhere but they rule a kingdom of their own always subordinate to the greater kingdom of the vital functions every creature male or female finds in its sexual relations only a subordinate part of its existence the need of food the need of exercise the joy of living these come first and absorb the bulk of its life whether the individual be male or female this antiope butterfly that flits at this moment past my windowthe first of the seasonspends almost all its existence in a form where the distinction of sex lies dormant a few days i might almost say a few hours comprise its whole sexual consciousness and the majority of its race die before reaching that epoch the law of sex is written absolutely through the whole insect world yet everywhere it is written as a secondary and subordinate law the life which is common to the sexes is the principal life the life which each sex leads as such is a minor and subordinate thing the same rule pervades nature two riders pass down the street before my window one rides a horse the other a mare the animals were perhaps foaled in the same stable of the same progenitors they have been reared alike fed alike trained alike ridden alike they need the same exercise the same grooming nine tenths of their existence are the same and only the other tenth is different their whole organization is marked by the distinction of sex but though the marking is ineffaceable the distinction is not the first or most important fact if this be true of the lower animals it is far more true of the higher the mental and moral laws of the universe touch us first and chiefly as human beings we eat our breakfasts as human beings not as men or women and it is the same with nine tenths of our interests and duties in life in legislating or philosophizing for woman we must neither forget that she has an organization distinct from that of man nor must we exaggerate the fact not first the womanly and then the human but first the human and then the womanly is to be the order of her training darwin huxley and buckle when any woman old or young asks the question which among all modern books ought i to read first the answer is plain she should read buckles lecture before the royal institution upon the influence of woman on the progress of knowledge it is one of two papers contained in a thin volume called essays by henry thomas buckle as a means whereby a woman may become convinced that her sex has a place in the intellectual universe this little essay is almost indispensable nothing else quite takes its place darwin and huxley seem to make woman simply a lesser man weaker in body and mindan affectionate and docile animal of inferior grade that there is any aim in the distinction of the sexes beyond the perpetuation of the race is nowhere recognized by them so far as i know that there is anything in the intellectual sphere to correspond to the physical difference that here also the sexes are equal yet diverse and each the natural completion and complement of the otherthis neither huxley nor darwin explicitly recognizes and with the utmost admiration for their great teachings in other ways i must think that here they are open to the suspicion of narrownesshuxley wrote in the reader in a short paper called emancipationblack and white in which while taking generous ground in behalf of the legal and political position of woman he yet does it pityingly de haut en bas as for a creature hopelessly inferior and so heavily weighted already by her sex that she should be spared all further trials speaking through an imaginary critic who seems to represent himself he denies even the natural equality of the sexes and declares that in every excellent character whether mental or physical the average woman is inferior to the average man in the sense of having that character less in quantity and lower in quality finally he goes so far as to defend the startling paradox that even in physical beauty man is the superior he admits that for a brief period of early youth the case may be doubtful but claims that after thirty the superior beauty of man is unquestionable thus reasons huxley the whole essay being included in his volume of lay sermons addresses and reviews darwins best statements on the subject may be found in his descent of man he is as usual more moderate and guarded than huxley he says for instance it is generally admitted that with women the powers of intuition of rapid perception and perhaps of imitation are more strongly marked than in man but some at least of these faculties are characteristic of the lower races and therefore of a past and lower state of civilization then he passes to the usual assertion that man has thus far attained to a higher eminence than woman if two lists were made of the most eminent men and women in poetry painting sculpture music comprising composition and performancehistory science and philosophy with half a dozen names under each subject the two lists would not bear comparison but the obvious answer that nearly every name on his list upon the masculine side would probably be taken from periods when woman was excluded from any fair competitionthis he does not seem to recognize at all darwin of all men must admit that superior merit generally arrives later not earlier on the scene and the question for him to answer is not whether woman equalled man in the first stages of the intellectual struggle for life but whether she is not gaining on him now if in spite of mans enormous advantage in the start woman is already overtaking his very best performances in several of the highest intellectual departmentsas for instance prose fiction and dramatic representationthen it is mere dogmatism in mr darwin to deny that she may yet do the same in other departments we in this generation have actually seen this success achieved by rachel and ristori in the one art by george sand and george eliot in the other woman is then visibly gaining on man in the sphere of intellect and if so mr darwin at least must accept the inevitable inference but this is arguing the question on the superficial facts merely buckle goes deeper and looks to principles that superior quickness of women which darwin dismisses so lightly as something belonging to savage epochs is to buckle the sign of a quality which he holds essential not only to literature and art but to science itself go among ignorant women he says and you will find them more quick and intelligent than equally ignorant men a woman will usually tell you the way in the street more readily than a man can a woman can always understand a foreigner more easily and dr currie says in his letters that when a laborer and his wife came to consult him the man always got all the information from the wife buckle illustrates this at some length and points out that a womans mind is by its nature deductive and quick a mans mind inductive and slow that each has its value and that science profoundly needs both i will endeavor he says to establish two propositions first that women naturally prefer the deductive method to the inductive secondly that women by encouraging in men deductive habits of thought have rendered an immense though unconscious service to the progress of science by preventing scientific investigators from being as exclusively inductive as they would otherwise be then he shows that the most important scientific discoveries of modern timesas of the law of gravitation by newton the law of the forms of crystals by haüy and the metamorphosis of plants by goethewere all essentially the results of that a priori or deductive method which during the last two centuries englishmen have unwisely despised they were all the work in a manner of the imaginationof the intuitive or womanly quality of mind and nothing can be finer or truer than the words in which buckle predicts the benefits that are to come from the intellectual union of the sexes for the work of the future in that field which we and our posterity have yet to traverse i firmly believe that the imagination will effect quite as much as the understanding our poetry will have to reinforce our logic and we must feel quite as much as we must argue let us then hope that the imaginative and emotional minds of one sex will continue to accelerate the great progress by acting upon and improving the colder and harder minds of the other sex by this coalition by this union of different faculties different tastes and different methods we shall go on our way with the greater ease footnote pp am ed footnote vol ii p am ed the spirit of small tyranny when mr john smauker and the bath footmen invited sam weller to their swarry consisting of a boiled leg of mutton each guest had some expression of contempt and wrath for the humble little greengrocer who served themin the true spirit dickens says of the very smallest tyranny the very fact that they were subject to being ordered about in theirown persons gave them a peculiar delight in issuing tyrannical orders to others just as sophomores in college torment freshmen because other sophomores once teased the present tormentors themselves and irishmen denounce the chinese for underbidding them in the labor market precisely as they were themselves denounced by nativeborn americans thirty years ago so it has sometimes seemed to me that the men whose own positions and claims are really least commanding are those who hold most resolutely that women should be kept in their proper place of subordination a friend of mine maintains the theory that men large and strong in person are constitutionally inclined to do justice to women as fearing no competition from them in the way of bodily strength but that small and weak men are apt to be vehemently opposed to anything like equality in the sexes he quotes in defence of his theory the big soldier in london who justified himself for allowing his little wife to chastise him on the ground that it pleased her and did not hurt him and on the other hand cites the extreme domestic tyranny of the dwarf quilp he declares that in any difficult excursion among woods and mountains the guides and the ablebodied men are often willing to have women join the party while it is sure to be opposed by those who doubt their own strength or are reluctant to display their weakness it is not necessary to go so far as my friend goes but many will remember some fact of this kind making such theories appear not quite so absurd as at first thus it seems from the life and letters of sydney dobell the english poet that he was opposed both to woman suffrage and woman authorship believing the movement for the former to be a blundering on to the perdition of womanhood it appears that against all authorship by women his convictions yearly grew stronger he regarding it as an error and an anomaly it seems quite in accordance with my friends theory to hear after this that sydney dobell was slight in person and a lifelong invalid nor is it surprising on the same theory that his poetry took no deep root and that it will not be likely to survive long except perhaps in his weird ballad of ravelston but he represents a large class of masculine intellects of secondary and mediocre quality whose opinions on this subject are not so much opinions as instinctive prejudices against a competitor who may turn out their superior whether they know it or not their aversion to the authorship of women is very much like the conviction of a weak pedestrian that women are not naturally fitted to take long walks or the opinion of a man whose own accounts are in a muddle that his wife is constitutionally unfitted to understand business it is a pity to praise either sex at the expense of the other the social inequality of the sexes was not produced so much by the voluntary tyranny of man as by his great practical advantage at the outset human history necessarily beginning with a period when physical strength was sole ruler it is unnecessary too to consider in how many cases women may have justified this distrust and may have made themselves as obnoxious as horace walpoles maids of honor whose coachman left his savings to his son on condition that he should never marry a maid of honor but it is safe to say that on the whole the feeling of contempt for women and the love to exercise arbitrary power over them is the survival of a crude impulse which the world is outgrowing and which is in general least obvious in the manliest men that clear and able english writer walter bagehot well describes the contempt for physical weakness and for women which marks early society the noncombatant population is sure to fare ill during the ages of combat but these defects too are cured or lessened women have now marvellous means of winning their way in the world and mind without muscle has far greater force than muscle without mind footnote physics and politics p the noble sex a highly educated american woman of my acquaintance once employed a french tutor in paris to assist her in teaching latin to her little grandson the frenchman brought with him a latin grammar written in his own language with which my friend was quite pleased until she came to a passage relating to the masculine gender in nouns and claiming grammatical precedence for it on the ground that the male sex is the noble sexle sexe noble upon that she said i burst forth in indignation and the poor teacher soon retired but i do not believe she added that the frenchman has the slightest conception up to this moment of what i could find in that phrase to displease me i do not suppose he could from the time when the salic law set french women aside from the royal succession on the ground that the kingdom of france was too noble to be ruled by a woman the claim of nobility has been all on one side the state has strengthened the church in this theory the church has strengthened the state and the result of all is that french grammarians follow both these high authorities when even the good père hyacinthe teaches through the new york independent that the husband is to direct the conscience of his wife precisely as the father directs that of his child what higher philosophy can you expect of any frenchman than to maintain the claims of le sexe noble we see the consequence even among the most heterodox frenchmen rejecting all other precedents and authorities the poor communists still held to this consider for instance this translation of a marriage contract under the commune which lately came to light in a trial reported in the gazette des tribunauxfrench republicthe citizen anet son of jean louis anet and the citoyenne maria saint she engaged to follow the said citizen everywhere and to love him always anet maria saint witnessed by the undermentioned citizen and citoyennefourier laroche paris april what a comfortable arrangement is this poor citoyenne maria saint even when all human laws have suspended their action still holds by her grammar still must annex herself to le sexe noble she still must follow citizen anet as the feminine pronoun follows the masculine or as a verb agrees with its nominative case in number and in person but with what a lordly freedom from all obligation does citizen anet representative of this nobility of sex accept the allegiance the citizeness may follow him certainlyso long as she is not in the wayand she must love him always but he is not bound why should he be it would be quite ungrammatical yet after all is said and done there is a brutal honesty in this frank subordination of the woman according to the grammar it has the same merit with the old russian marriage consecration here wolf take thy lamb which at least put the thing clearly and made no nonsense about it i do not know that anywhere in france the wedding ritual is now so severely simple as this but i know that in some french villages the bride is still married in a mourninggown i should think she would be the truth about our grandmothers every young woman of the present generation so soon as she ventures to have a headache or a set of nerves is immediately confronted by indignant critics with her grandmother if the grandmother is living the fact of her existence is appealed to if there is only a departed grandmother to remember the maiden is confronted with a ghost that ghost is endowed with as many excellences as those with which miss betsey trotwood endowed the niece that never had been born and just as david copperfield was reproached with the virtues of his unborn sister who would never have run away so that granddaughter with the headache is reproached with the ghostly perfections of her grandmother who never had a headacheor if she had it is luckily forgotten it is necessary to ask sometimes what was really the truth about our grandmothers were they such models of bodily perfection as is usually claimed if we look at the early colonial days we are at once met by the fact that although families were then often larger than is now common yet this phenomenon was by no means universal and was balanced by a good many childless homes of this any one can satisfy himself by looking over any family history and he can also satisfy himself of the factfirst pointed out i believe by mrs ballthat third and fourth marriages were then obviously and unquestionably more common than now the inference would seem to be that there is a little illusion about the health of those days as there is about the health of savage races in both cases it is not so much that the average health is greater under rude social conditions as that these conditions kill off the weak and leave only the strong modern civilized society on the other hand preserves the health of many men and womenand permits them to marry and become parentswho under the severities of savage life or of pioneer life would have died and given way to others on this i will not dwell because these primeval ladies were not strictly our grandmothers being farther removed but of those who were our grandmothersthe women of the revolutionary and postrevolutionary epochswe happen to have very definite physiological observations recorded not very flattering it is true but frank and searching what these good women are in the imagination of their descendants we know mrs stowe describes them as the race of strong hardy cheerful girls that used to grow up in country places and made the bright neat new england kitchens of olden times and adds this race of women pride of olden time is daily lessening and in their stead come the fragile easily fatigued languid girls of a modern age drilled in booklearning ignorant of common things what now was the testimony of those who saw our grandmothers in the flesh as it happens there were a good many foreigners generally frenchmen who came to visit the new republic during the presidency of washington let us take for instance the testimony of the two following the abbé robin was a chaplain in rochambeaus army during the revolution and wrote thus in regard to the american ladies in his nouveau voyage dans lamerique septentrionale published in they are tall and wellproportioned their features are generally regular their complexions are generally fair and without color at twenty years of age the women have no longer the freshness of youth at thirtyfive or forty they are wrinkled and decrepit the men are almost as premature again the chevalier louis félix de beaujour lived in the united states from to as consulgeneral and chargé daffaires and wrote a book immediately after which was translated into english under the title a sketch of the united states at the commencement of the present century in this he thus describes american womenthe women have more of that delicate beauty which belongs to their sex and in general have finer features and more expression in their physiognomy their stature is usually tall and nearly all are possessed of a light and airy shapethe breast high a fine head and their color of a dazzling whiteness let us imagine under this brilliant form the most modest demeanor a chaste and virginal air accompanied by those single and unaffected graces which flow from artless nature and we may have an idea of their beauty but this beauty fades and passes in a moment at the age of twentyfive their form changes and at thirty the whole of their charms have disappeared these statements bring out a class of facts which as it seems to me are singularly ignored by some of our physiologists they indicate that the modification of the american type began early and was as a rule due to causes antedating the fashions or studies of the present day here are our grandmothers and greatgrandmothers as they were actually seen by the eyes of impartial or even flattering critics these critics were not englishmen accustomed to a robust and ruddy type of women but frenchmen used to a type more like the american they were not mere hasty travellers for the one lived here ten years and the other was stationed for some time at newport ri in a healthy locality noted in those days for the beauty of its women yet we find it their verdict upon these grandmothers of nearly a hundred years ago that they showed the same delicate beauty the same slenderness the same pallor the same fragility the same early decline with which their granddaughters are now reproached in some respects probably the physical habits of the grandmothers were better but an examination of their portraits will satisfy any one that they laced more tightly than their descendants and wore their dresses lower in the neck and as for their diet we have the testimony of another french traveller volney who was in america from to that if a premium were offered for a regimen most destructive to the teeth the stomach and the health in general none could be devised more efficacious for these ends than that in use among this people and he goes on to give particulars showing a far worse condition in respect to cookery and diet than now prevails in any decent american society we have therefore strong evidence that the essential change in the american type was effected in the last century not in this dr eh clarke says a century does not afford a period long enough for the production of great changes that length of time could not transform the sturdy german fräulein and robust english damsel into the fragile american miss and yet it is pretty clear that the first century and a half of our colonial life had done just this for our grandmothers and if so our physiologists ought to conform their theories to the facts the physique of american women i was talking the other day with a new york physician long retired from practice who after an absence of a dozen years in europe has returned within a year to this country he volunteered the remark that nothing had so impressed him since his return as the improved health of americans he said that his wife had been equally struck with it and that they had noticed it especially among the inhabitants of cities among the more cultivated classes and in particular among women it so happened that within twentyfour hours almost precisely the same remark was made to me by another gentleman of unusually cosmopolitan experience and past middle age he further fortified himself by a similar assertion made him by charles dickens in comparing his second visit to this country with his first in answer to an inquiry as to what points of difference had most impressed him dickens said your people especially the women look better fed than formerly it is possible that in all these cases the witnesses may have been led to exaggerate the original evil while absent from the country and so may have felt some undue reaction on their arrival one of my informants went so far as to express confidence that among his circle of friends in boston and in london a dinner party of half a dozen americans would outweigh an english party of the same number granting this to be too bold a statement and granting the unscientific nature of all these assertions they still indicate a probability of their own truth until refuted by facts on the other side they are further corroborated by the surprise expressed by huxley and some other recent englishmen at finding us a race more substantial than they had supposed the truth seems to be that nature is endeavoring to take a new departure in the american and to produce a race more finely organized more sensitive more pliable and of more nervous energy than the races of northern europe that this change of type involves some risk to health in the process but promises greater results whenever the new type shall be established i am confident that there has been within the last halfcentury a great improvement in the physical habits of the more cultivated classes at least in this countrybetter food better air better habits as to bathing and exercise the great increase of athletic games the greatly increased proportion of seaside and mountain life in summer the thicker shoes and boots of women and little girls permitting them to go out more freely in all weathersthese are among the permanent gains the increased habit of dining late and of taking only a lunch at noon is of itself an enormous gain to the professional and mercantile classes because it secures time for eating and for digestion even the furnaces in houses which seemed at first so destructive to the very breath of life turn out to have given a new lease to it and open fires are being rapidly reintroduced as a provision for enjoyment and health when the main body of the house has been tempered by the furnace there has been furthermore a decided improvement in the bread of the community and avery general introduction of other farinaceous food all this has happened within my own memory and gives a priori probability to the alleged improvement in physical condition within twenty years and if these reasonings are still insufficient on the one side it must be remembered that the facts of the census are almost equally inadequate when quoted on the other if for instance all the young people of a new hampshire village take a fancy to remove to wisconsin it does not show that the race is dying out because their children swell the birthrate of wisconsin instead of new hampshire if in a given city the births among the foreignborn population are twice as many in proportion as among the american we have not the whole story until we learn whether the deaths are not twice as many also if so the inference is that the same recklessness brought the children into the world and sent them out of it and no physiological inference whatever can be drawn it was clearly established by the medical commission of the boston board of health a few years ago that the general mortality of the foreign element is much greater than that of the native element of our population this is found to be the case they add throughout the united states as well as in boston so far as i can judge all our physiological tendencies are favorable rather than otherwise and the transplantation of the english race seems now likely to end in no deterioration but in a type more finely organized and more comprehensive and cosmopolitan and this without loss of health of longevity or of physical size and weight and if this is to hold true it must be true not only of men but of women the limitations of sex are there any inevitable limitations of sex some reformers apparently think that there are not and that the best way to help woman is to deny the fact of limitations but i think the great majority of reformers would take a different ground and would say that the two sexes are mutually limited by nature they would doubtless add that this very fact is an argument for the enfranchisement of woman for if woman is a mere duplicate of man man can represent her but if she has traits of her own absolutely distinct from his then he cannot represent her and she should have a voice and a vote of her own to this last body of believers i belong i think that all legal or conventional obstacles should be removed which debar woman from determining for herself as freely as man determines what the real limitations of sex are and what restrictions are merely conventional but when all is said and done there is no doubt that plenty of limitations will remain on both sides that man has such limitations is clear no matter how finely organized he may be how sympathetic how tender how loving there is yet a barrier never to be passed that separates him from the most precious part of the womans kingdom all the wondrous world of motherhood with its unspeakable delights its holy of holies remains forever unknown by him he may gaze but never enter that halo of pure devotion which makes a madonna out of so many a poor and ignorant woman can never touch his brow many a man loves children more than many a woman but after all it is not he who has borne them to that peculiar sacredness of experience he can never arrive but never mind whether the loss be a great one or a small one it is distinctly a limitation and to every loving mother it is a limitation so important that she would be unable to weigh all the privileges and powers of manhood against this peculiar possession of her child now if this be true and if man be thus distinctly limited by the mere fact of sex can the woman complain that she also should have some natural limitations grant that she should have no unnecessary restrictions and that the course of human progress is constantly setting aside as unnecessary point after point that was once held essential still if she findsas she undoubtedly will findthat some natural barriers and hindrances remain at last and that she can no more do mans whole work in the world than he can do hers why should she complain if he can accept his limitations she must be prepared also to accept hers some of our physiological reformers declare that a girl will be perfectly healthy if she can only be sensibly dressed and can have just as much outdoor exercise as the boys and of the same sort if she choose it but i have observed that matter a good deal and have watched the effect of boyish exercise on a good many girls and i am satisfied that so far from being safely turned loose as boys can be they need for physical health the constant supervision of wise mothers otherwise the very exposure that only hardens the boy may make the girl an invalid for life the danger comes from a greater sensitiveness of structurenot weakness properly so called since it gives in certain ways more power of endurancea greater sensitiveness which runs through all a womans career and is the expensive price she pays for the divine destiny of motherhood it is another natural limitation no wise person believes in any reform against nature or that we can get beyond the laws of nature if i believed the limitations of sex to be inconsistent with woman suffrage for instance i should oppose it but i do not see why a woman cannot form political opinions by her babys cradle as well as her husband in his workshop while her very love for the child commits her to an interest in good government our duty is to remove all the artificial restrictions we can thatdone it will not be

head it is not that any considerable portion of mankind actually wishes to abolish woman from the universe but the opinion dies hard that she is best off when least visible these appeals which still meet us for the sacred privacy of woman are only the invisible lady on a larger scale in ancient boeotia brides were carried home in vehicles whose wheels were burned at the door in token that they would never again be needed in ancient rome it was a queens epitaph she stayed at home and spundomum servavit lanam fecit in turkey not even the officers of justice can enter the apartments of a woman without her lords consent in spain and spanish america the veil replaces the four walls of the house and is a portable seclusion to be visible is at best a sign of peasant blood and occupations to be highbred is to be invisible in the azores i found that each peasant family endeavored to secure for one or more of its daughters the pride and glory of living unseen the other sisters secure in innocence tended cattle on lonely mountainsides or toiled barelegged up the steep ascents their heads crowned with orangebaskets the chosen sister was taught to read to embroider and to dwell indoors if she went out it was only under escort and with her face buried in a hood of almost incredible size affording only a glimpse of the poor pale cheeks quite unlike the rosy vigor of the damsels on the mountainside the girls i was told did not covet this privilege of seclusion but let us be genteel or die now all that is left of the invisible lady among ourselves is only the remnant of this absurd tradition in the seaside town where i write ladies of fashion usually go veiled in the streets and so general is the practice that little girls often veil their dolls they all suppose it to be done for complexion or for ornament just as people still hang straps on the backs of their carriages not knowing that it is a relic of the days when footmen stood there and held on but the veil represents a tradition of seclusion whether we know it or not and the dread of hearing a woman speak in public or of seeing a woman vote represents precisely the same tradition it is entitled to no less respect and no more like all traditions it finds something in human nature to which to attach itself early girlhood like early boyhood needs to be guarded and sheltered that it may mature unharmed it is monstrous to make this an excuse for keeping a woman any more than a man in a condition of perpetual subordination and seclusion the young lover wishes to lock up his angel in a little world of her own where none may intrude the harem and the seraglio are simply the embodiment of this desire but the maturer man and the maturer race have found that the beloved being should be something more after this discovery is made the theory of the invisible lady disappears it is less of a shock for an american to hear a woman speak in public than it is for an oriental to see her show her face in public at all once open the door of the harem and she has the freedom of the house the house includes the front door and the street is but a prolonged doorstep with the freedom of the street comes inevitably a free access to the platform the tribunal and the pulpit you might as well try to stop the air in its escape from a punctured balloon as to try when woman is once out of the harem to put her back there ceasing to be an invisible lady she must become a visible force there is no middle ground there is no danger that she will not be anchored to the cradle when cradle there is but it will be by an elastic cable that will leave her as free to think and vote as to pray no woman is less a mother because she cares for all the concerns of the world into which her child is born it was john quincy adams who said defending the political petitions of the women of plymouth that women are not only justified but exhibit the most exalted virtue when they do depart from the domestic circle and enter on the concerns of their country of humanity and of their godsacred obscurity in the preface to that illnamed but delightful book the remains of the late mrs richard trench there is a singular remark by the editor her son he says that the adage is certainly true in regard to the british matron bene vixit quae bene latuit the meaning of this phrase being she has lived well who has kept herself well out of sight applying this to his beloved mother he further expresses a regret at disturbing her sacred obscurity then he goes on to disturb it pretty effectually by printing a thick octavo volume of her most private letters it is a great source of strength and advantage to reformers that there are always men preserved to be living examples of this good old oriental doctrine of sacred obscurity just as mr darwin needs for the demonstration of his theory that the lower orders of creation should still be present in visible form for purposes of comparison so every reformer needs to fortify his position by showing examples of the original attitude from which society has been gradually emerging if there had been no oriental seclusion many things in the present position of woman would be inexplicable but when we point to that when we show that even in the more enlightened eastern countries it is still held indecorous to allude to the feminine members of a mans family when we see among the christian nations of southern europe many lingering traits of this same habit of seclusion and when we find an archdeacon of the english church still clinging to the theory even while exhibiting his mothers family letters to the whole worldwe more easily understand the course of development these reassertions of the oriental theory are simply reversions as a naturalist would say to the original type they are instances of atavism like the occasional appearance of six fingers on one hand in a family where the greatgreatgrandfather happened to possess that ornament such instances can always be found when one takes the pains to look for them thus a critic discussing in the atlantic monthly mr mahaffys book on social life in greece is surprised that this writer should quote in proof of the degradation of woman in athens the remark attributed to pericles that woman is best who is least spoken of among men whether for good or for evil in our opinion adds the reviewer that remark was wise then and is wise now the oriental theory is not then it seems extinct and we are spared the pains of proving that it ever existed if this theory be true how falsely has the admiration of mankind been given if the most obscure woman is best the most conspicuous must undoubtedly be worst tried by this standard how unworthy must have been elizabeth barrett browning how reprehensible must be dorothea dix what a model of all that is discreditable is rosa bonheur what a crowning instance of human depravity is florence nightingale yet how consoling the thought that while these disreputable persons were thus wasting their substance in the riotous performance of what the world weakly styled good deeds there were always women who saw the folly of such efforts women who by steady devotion to eating drinking and sleeping continued to keep themselves in sacred obscurity and to prove themselves the ornaments of their sex inasmuch as no human being ever had occasion to mention their names but alas for human inconsistency as for this inverseratio theorythis theory of virtue so exalted that it has never been known or felt or mentioned among menit is to be observed that those who hold it are the first to desert it when stirred by an immediate occasion just as a slaveholder in the old times after demonstrating to you that freedom was a curse to the negro would instantly turn round and inflict this greatest of all curses on some slave who had saved his life so i fear would one of these philosophers if he were profoundly impressed with any great action done by a woman give the lie to all his theories and celebrate her fame in spite of all his fine principles if he happened to be rescued from drowning by grace darling he would put her name in the newspaper if he were tended in hospital by clara barton he would sound her praise and if his mother wrote as good letters as did mrs trench he would probably print them to the extent of five hundred pages as the archdeacon did and all his gospel of silence would exhale itself in a single sigh of regret in the preface virtues in common a young friend of mine who was educated at one of the very best schools for girls in new york city told me that one day her teacher requested the older girls to write out a list of virtues suitable to manly character which they did a month or more later when this occurrence was well forgotten the same teacher bade them write out a list of womanly virtues she making no reference to the other list then she made each girl compare her lists and they all found with surprise that there was no substantial difference between them the only variation in most cases was that they had put in a rather vague special virtue of manliness in the one case and womanliness in the other a sort of miscellaneous department or odd drawer apparently in which to group all traits not easily analyzed the moral is that as tested by the common sense of these young people duty is duty and the difference between ethics for men and ethics for women lies simply in practical applications not in principles who can deny that the philosopher antisthenes was right when he said the virtues of the man and the woman are the same not the christian certainly for he accepts as his highest standard the being who in all history best united thehighest qualities of both sexes not the metaphysician for his analysis deals with the human mind as such not with the mind of either sex not the evolutionist for he is accustomed to trace back qualities to their source and cannot deny that there is in each sex at least a survival of every good and every bad trait we may say that these qualities are or may be or ought to be distributed unequally between the sexes but we cannot reasonably deny that each sex possesses a share of every quality and that what is good in one sex is also good in the other man may be the braver and yet courage in a woman may be nobler than cowardice woman may be the purer and yet purity may be noble in a man so clear is this that some of the very coarsest writers in all literature and those who have been severest upon women have yet been obliged to acknowledge it take for instance dean swift who writesi am ignorant of any one quality that is amiable in a woman which is not equally so in a man i do not except even modesty and gentleness of nature nor do i know one vice or folly which is not equally detestable in both mrs jameson in her delightful commonplace book illustrates this admirably by one or two test cases she takes for instance from one of humboldts letters a muchadmired passage on manly charactermasculine independence of mind i hold to be in reality the first requisite for the formation of a character of real manly worth the man who allows himself to be deceived and carried away by his own weakness may be a very amiable person in other respects but cannot be called a good man such beings should not find favor in the eyes of a woman for a truly beautiful and purely feminine nature should be attracted only by what is highest and noblest in the character of man take now this same bit of moral philosophy she says and apply it to the feminine character and it reads quite as wellfeminine independence of mind i hold to be in reality the first requisite for the formation of a character of real feminine worth the woman who allows herself to be deceived and carried away by her own weakness may be a very amiable person in other respects but cannot be called a good woman such beings should not find favor in the eyes of a man for a truly beautiful and purely manly nature should be attracted only by what is highest and noblest in the character of woman i have never been able to perceive that there was a quality or grace of character which really belonged exclusively to either sex or which failed to win honor when wisely exercised by either it is not thought necessary to have separate editions of books on ethical science the one for man the other for woman like almanacs calculated for different latitudes the books that vary are not the scientific works but little manuals of practical applicationduties of men duties of women these vary with times and places where women do not know how to read no advice on reading will be found in the womens manuals where it is held wrong for women to uncover the face it will be laid down in these manuals as a sin but ethics are ethics the great principles of morals as proclaimed either by science or by religion do not fluctuate for sex their basis is in the very foundations of right itself this grows clearer when we remember that it is equally true in mental science there is not one logic for men and another for women a separate syllogism a separate induction the moment we begin to state intellectual principles that moment we go beyond sex we deal then with absolute truth if an observation is wrong if a process of reasoning is bad it makes no difference who brings it forward any list of mental processes any inventory of the contents of the mind would be identical so far as sex goes whether compiled by a woman or a man these things like the circulation of the blood or the digestion of food belong clearly to the ground held in common the london spectator well said some time sinceafter all knowledge is knowledge and there is no more a specifically feminine way of describing correctly the origin of the lollard movement or the character of spensers poetry than there is a specifically feminine way of solving a quadratic equation or of proving the fortyseventh problem of euclids first book all we can say in modification of this is that there is after all a foundation for the rather vague item of manliness and womanliness in these schoolgirl lists of duties there is a difference after all is said and done but it is something that eludes analysis like the differing perfume of two flowers of the same genus and even of the same species the method of thought must be essentially the same in both sexes and yet an average woman will put more flavor of something we call instinct into her mental action and the average man something more of what we call logic into his whipple tells us that not a man guessed the plot of dickenss great expectations while many women did and this certainly indicates some average difference of quality or method so the average opinions of a hundred women on some question of ethics might very probably differ from the average of a hundred men while it yet remains true that the virtues of the man and the woman are the same individual differencesblackburn in his entertaining book artists and arabs draws a contrast between friths painting of the derby day and rosa bonheurs horse fairthe former pleasing the eye by its cleverness and prettiness the latter impressing the spectator by its power and its truthful rendering of animal life the difference between the two painters is probably more one of education than of natural gifts but whilst the style of the former is grafted on a fashion the latter is founded on a rockthe result of a close study of nature chastened by classic feeling and a remembrance it may be of the friezes of the parthenon now it is to be observed that this description runs precisely counter to the popular impression as to the work of the two sexes novelists like charles reade for instance who have apparently seen precisely one woman in their lives and hardly more than one man and who keep on sketching these two figures most felicitously and brilliantly thenceforward would be apt to assign these qualities of the artist very differently their typical man would do the truthful and powerful work and everybody would say how manly their woman would please by cleverness and prettiness and everybody would say how womanly yet blackburn shows us that these qualities are individual not sexual that they result from temperament or he thinks still more from training if rosa bonheur does better work than frith it is not because she is a woman nor is it in spite of that but because setting sex aside she is a better artist this is not denying the distinctions of sex but only asserting that they are not so exclusive and allabsorbing as is supposed it is easy to name other grounds of difference which entirely ignore those of sex striking directly across them and rendering a different classification necessary it is thus with distinctions of race or color for instance an indian man and woman are at many points more like to each other than is either to a white person of the same sex a blackhaired man and woman or a fairhaired man and woman are to be classified together in these physiological aspects so of differences of genius a man and woman of musical temperament and training have more in common than has either with a person who is of the same sex but who cannot tell one note from another so two persons of ardent or imaginative temperament are thus far alike though the gulf of sex divides them and so are two persons of cold or prosaic temperament in a mixed school the teacher cannot class together intellectually the boys as such and the girls as such bright boys take hold of a lesson very much as bright girls do and slow girls as slow boys nature is too rich too full too varied to be content with a single basis of classification she has a hundred systems of grouping according to sex age race temperament training and so on and we get but a narrow view of life when we limit our theories to one set of distinctions as a matter of social philosophy this train of thought logically leads to coeducation impartial suffrage and free cooperation in all the affairs of life as a matter of individual duty it teaches the old moral to act well your part no wise person will ever trouble himself or herself much about the limitations of sex in intellectual labor rosa bonheur was not trying to work like a woman or like a man or unlike either but to do her work thoroughly and well he or she who works in this spirit works nobly and gives an example which will pass beyond the bounds of sex and help all the abbé liszt the most gifted of modern pianists told a friend of mine his pupil that he had learned more of music from hearing madame malibran sing than from anything else whatever angelic superiority it is better not to base any plea for woman on the ground of her angelic superiority the argument proves too much if she is already so perfect there is every inducement to let well alone it suggests the expediency of conforming mans condition to hers instead of conforming hers to mans if she is a winged creature and man can only crawl it is his condition that needs mending besides one may well be a little incredulous of these vast claims granting some average advantage to woman it is not of such completeness as to base much argument upon it the minister looking on his congregation rarely sees an unmixed angel either at the head or at the foot of any pew the domestic servant rarely has the felicity of waiting on an absolute saint at either end of the dinnertable the ladysmaid has to compare her little observations of human infirmity with those of the valet de chambre the lover worships the beloved whether man or woman but marriage bears rather hard on the ideal in either case and those who pray out of the same book have mercy upon us miserable sinners are not supposed to be offering up petitions for each other only we all know many women whose lives are made wretched by the sins and follies of their husbands there are also many men whose lives are turned to long wretchedness by the selfishness the worldliness or the bad temper of their wives domestic tyranny belongs to neither sex by monopoly if man tortures or depresses woman she also has a fearful power to corrupt and deprave man on the other hand to quote old antisthenes once more the virtues of the man and woman are the same a refined man is more refined than a coarse woman a childloving man is infinitely tenderer and sweeter toward children than a hard and unsympathetic woman the very qualities that are claimed as distinctively feminine are possessed more abundantly by many men than by many of what is called the softer sex why is it necessary to say all this because there is always danger that we who believe in the equality of the sexesshould be led into overstatements which will react against ourselves it is not safe to say that the ballotbox would be reformed if intrusted to feminine votes alone had the voters of the south been all women it would have plunged earlier into the gulf of secession dived deeper and come up even more reluctantly were the women of spain to rule its destinies unchecked the pope would be its master and the inquisition might be reëstablished for all that we can see the rule of women alone would be as bad as the rule of men alone it would be as unsafe to give women the absolute control of man as to make man the master of woman let us be a shade more cautious in our reasonings woman needs equal rights not because she is mans better half but because she is his other half she needs them not as an angel but as a fraction of humanity her political education will not merely help man but it will help herself she will sometimes be right in her opinions and sometimes be altogether wrong but she will learn as man learns by her own blunders the demand in her behalf is that she shall have the opportunity to make mistakes since it is by that means she must become wise in all our towns there is a tendency toward mixed schools we rarely hear of the sexes being separated in a school after being once united but we constantly hear of their being brought together after separation this union is commonly but mistakenly recommended as an advantage to the boys alone i once heard an accomplished teacher remonstrate against this change when thus urged why should my girls be sacrificed she said to improve your boys six months after she had learned by experience why she asked did you rest the argument on so narrow a ground since my school consisted half of boys i find with surprise that the change has improved both sexes my girls are more ambitious more obedient and more ladylike i shall never distrust the policy of mixed schools again what is true of the school is true of the family and of the state it is not good for man or for woman to be alone granting the woman to be on the whole the more spiritually minded it is still true that each sex needs the other when the rivet falls from a pair of scissors we do not have than mended because either half can claim angelic superiority over the other half but because it takes two halves to make a whole vicarious honors there is a story in circulationpossibly without authorityto the effect that a certain young lady has ascended so many alps that she would have been chosen a member of the english alpine club but for her misfortune in respect to sex as a matter of personal recognition however and as it were of approximate courtesy her dog who has accompanied her in all her trips and is not debased by sex has been elected into the club she has therefore an opportunity for exercising in behalf of her dog that beautiful selfabnegation which is said to be a part of womans nature impelling her always to prefer that her laurels should be worn by somebody else the dog probably made no objection to these vicarious honors nor is any objection made by the young gentlemen who reply eloquently to the toast the ladies at public dinners or who kindly consent to be educated at masculine colleges on scholarships perhaps founded by women those who receive the emoluments of these funds must reflect within themselves occasionally how grand a thing is this power of substitution given to women and how pleasant are its occasional results to the substitute it is doubtless more blessed to give than to receive but to receive without giving has also its pleasures very likely the holder of the scholarship and the orator who rises with his hand on his heart to reply in behalf of the ladies may do their appointed work well and so did the alpine dog yet after all but for the work done by his mistress the dog would have won no more honor from the alpine club than if he had been a chamois nothing since artemus ward and his wifes relations has been finer than the generous way in which fathers and brothers disclaim all desire for profits or honors on the part of their feminine relatives in a certain system of schools once known to me the boys had prizes of money on certain occasions but the successful girls at those times received simply a testimonial of honor for each the committee being convinced it was said that this was more consonant with the true delicacy and generosity of womans nature so in the new arrangements for opening the university of copenhagen to young women karl blind writes to the new york evening post that it is expressly provided that they shall not share in the academic benefices and stipends which have been set apart for male students half of these charities may for aught that appears have been established originally by women like the american scholarships already mentioned women however can avail themselves of them only by deputy as the alpclimbing young lady is represented by her dog it is all a beautiful tribute to the disinterestedness of woman the only pity is that this virtue so much admired should not be reciprocated by showing the like disinterestedness toward her it does not appear that the butchers and bakers of copenhagen propose to reduce in the case of women students the benefices and stipends which are to be paid for daily food young ladies at the university are only prohibited from receiving money not from needing it nor will any of the necessary fatigues of alpine climbing be relaxed for any young lady because she is a woman the fatigues will remain in full force though the laurels be denied the mountainpasses will make small account of the tenderness and delicacy of her sex when the toil is over she will be regarded as too delicate to be thanked for it but by way of compensation the alpine club will allow her to be represented by her dogthe gospel of humiliation the silliest man who ever lived wrote fanny fern once has always known enough when he says his prayers to thank god he was not born a woman president of college is not a silly man at all and he is devoting his life to the education of women yet he seems to feel as vividly conscious of his superior position as even fanny fern could wish if he had been born a jew he would have thanked god in the appointed ritual for not having made him a woman if he had been a mohammedan he would have accepted the rule which forbids a fool a madman or a woman to summon the faithful to prayer being a christian clergyman with several hundred immortal souls clothed in female bodies under his charge he thinks it his duty at proper intervals to notify his young ladies that though they may share with men the glory of being sophomores they still are in a position as regards the other sex of hopeless subordination this is the climax of his discourse which in its earlier portions contains many good and truthful thingsand as the woman is different from the man so is she relative to him this is true on the other side also they are bound together by mutual relationship so intimate and vital that the existence of neither is absolutely complete except with reference to the other but there is this difference that the relation of woman is characteristically that of subordination and dependence this does not imply inferiority of character of capacity of value in the sight of god or man and it has been the glory of woman to have accepted the position of formal inferiority assigned her by the creator with all its responsibilities its trials its possible outward humiliations and sufferings in the proud consciousness that it is not incompatible with an essential superiority that it does not prevent her from occupying if she will an inward elevation of character from which she may look down with pitying and helpful love on him she calls her lord jesus said ye know that the princes of the gentiles exercise dominion over them and they that are great exercise authority upon them but it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister and whosoever will be chief among you let him be your servant even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many surely woman need not hesitate to estimate her status by a criterion of dignity sustained by such authority she need not shrink from a position which was sought by the son of god and in whose trials and griefs she will have his sympathy and companionship there is a comforting aspect to this discourse after all it holds out the hope that a particularly noble woman may not be personally inferior to a remarkably bad husband but may look down with pitying and helpful love on him she calls her lord the drawback is not only that it insults woman by a reassertion of a merely historical inferiority which is steadily diminishing but that it fortifies this by precisely the same talk about the dignity of subordination which has been used to buttress every oppression since the world began never yet was there a pious slaveholder who did not quote to his slaves on sunday precisely the same texts with which president favors his meek young pupils never yet was there a slaveholder who would not shoot through the head anybody who should attempt to place him in that beautiful position of subjection whose spiritual merits he had just been proclaiming when it came to that he was like thoreau who believed resignation to be a virtue but preferred not to practice it unless it was quite necessary thus when the rev charles c jones of savannah used to address the slaves on their condition he proclaimed the beauty of obedience in a way to bring tears to their eyes and this he frankly assures the masters is the way to check insurrection and advance their own pecuniary interests he says of the slave that under proper religious instruction his conscience is enlightened and his soul is awed to god he commits the ordering of his lot and in his station renders to all their dues obedience to whom obedience and honor to whom honor he dares not wrest from god his own care and protection while he sees a preference in the various conditions of men he remembers the words of the apostle art thou called being a servant care not for it but if thou mayest be free use it rather for he that is called in the lord being a servant is the lords freeman likewise also he that is called being free is christs servant i must say that the rev mr joness preaching seems to me precisely as good as drs and that a sensible woman ought to be as much influenced by the one as was frederick douglass by the otherthat is not at all let the preacher try subordination himself and see how he likes it the beauty of service such as jesus praised lay in the willingness of the service a service that is serfdom loses all beauty whether rendered by man or by woman my objection to separate schools and colleges for women is that they are too apt to end in such instructions as this footnote religious instruction of the negroes savannah pp celery and cherubs there was once a real or imaginary old lady who had got the metaphor of scylla and charybdis a little confused wishing to describe a perplexing situation this lady saidyou see my dear she was between celery on one side and cherubs on the other you know about celery and cherubs dont you they was two rocks somewhere and if you didnt hit one you was pretty sure to run smack on the otherthis describes as a clever writer in the new york tribune declares the present condition of women who agitate their celery and cherubs are tears and temper it is a good hit and we may well make a note of it it is the danger of all reformers that they will vibrate between discouragement and anger when things go wrong what is it ones impulse to do to be cast down or to be stirred up to wring ones hands or clench ones fistsin short tears or temper mother said a resolute little girl of my acquaintance if the dinner was all spoiled i wouldnt sit down and cry id say hang it this cherub preferred the alternative of temper on days when the celery turned out badly probably her mother was addicted to the other practice and exhibited the tears but as this alternative is found to exist for both sexes and on all occasions why charge it especially on the womansuffrage movement men are certainly as much given to ill temper as women and if they are less inclined to tears they make it up in sulks which are just as bad nicholas nickleby when the pump was frozen was advised by mr squeers to content himself with a dry polish and so there is a kind of dry despair into which men fall which is quite as forlorn as any tears of women how many a man has doubtless wished at such times that the pump of his lachrymal glands could only thaw out and he could give his emotions something more than a dry polish the unspeakable comfort some women feel in sitting for ten minutes with a handkerchief over their eyes the freshness the heartiness the new life visible in them when the crying is done and the handkerchief comes down again and indeed this simple statement brings us to the real truth which should have been more clearly seen by the writer who tells this story she is wrong in saying it is urged that men and women stand on an equality are exactly alike many of us urge the equality very few of us urge the exactly alike an apple and an orange a potato and a tomato a rose and a lily the episcopal and the presbyterian churches oxford and cambridge yale and harvardwe may surely grant equality in each case without being so exceedingly foolish as to go on and say that they are exactly alike and precisely here is the weak point of the whole case as presented by this writer women give way to tears more readily than men granted is their sex any the weaker for it not a bit it is simply a difference of temperament that is all it involves no inferiority if you think that this habit necessarily means weakness wait and see who has not seen women break down in tears during some domestic calamity while the stronger sex were calm and who has not seen those same women that temporary excitement being over rise up and dry their eyes and be thenceforth the support and stay of their households and perhaps bear up the stronger sex as a stream bears up a ship i said once to an experienced physician watching such a woman that woman is really greatof course she is he answered did you ever see a woman who was not great when the emergency required now will women carry this same quality of temperament into their public career doubtless otherwise they would cease to be women will it be betraying confidence if i own that i have seen two of the very bravest women of my acquaintancewomen who have swayed great audiencesburst into tears during a committee meeting at a moment of unexpected adversity for the cause how pitiable our critical observers would have thought in five minutes that april shower had passed and those women were as resolute and unconquerable as queen elizabeth they were again the natural leaders of those around them and the cool and tearless men who sat beside them were nothingmen were a lost art as some one sayscompared with the inexhaustible moral vitality of those two women no the dangers of celery and cherubs are exaggerated for temper women are as good as men and no better as for tears long may they flow they are symbols of that mighty distinction of sex which is as ineffaceable and as essential as the difference between land and sea the need of cavalry in the interesting buddhist book the wheel of the law translated by henry alabaster there is an account of a certain priest who used to bless a great king saying may your majesty have the firmness of a crow the audacity of a woman the endurance of a vulture and the strength of an ant the priest then told anecdotes illustrating all of these qualities who has not known occasions wherein some daring woman has been the joan of arc of a perfectly hopeless cause taken it up where men shrank carried it through where they had failed and conquered by weapons which men would never have thought of using and would have lacked faith to employ even if put into their hands the wit the resources the audacity of women have been the key to history and the staple of novels ever since that larger novel called history began to be written how is it done who knows the secret of their success all that any man can say is that the heart takes a large share in the magic rogers asserts in his tabletalk that often when doubting how to act in matters of importance he had received more useful advice from women than from men women have the understanding of the heart he said which is better than that of the head then this instinct that begins from the heart reaches other hearts also and through that controls the will win hearts said lord burleigh to queen elizabeth and you have hands and purses and the greatest of english sovereigns in spite of ugliness and rouge in spite of coarseness and cruelty and bad passions wasadored by the nation that she first made great it seems to me that women are a sort of cavalry force in the army of mankind they are not always to be relied upon for that steady hammering away which was grants one method but there is a certain sheridan quality about them lightarmed audacious quick irresistible they go before the main army their swift wits go scouting far in advance they are the first to scent danger or to spy out chances of success their charge is like that of a tartar horde or the wild sweep of the apaches they are upon you from some wholly unexpected quarter and this respectable systematic welldrilled masculine force is caught and rolled over and over in the dust before the man knows what has hit him even if repelled and beaten off this formidable cavalry is unconquered routed and in confusion today it comes back upon you tomorrowfresh alert with new devices bringing new dangers in dealing with it as the french complained of the arabs in algiers peace is not to be purchased by victory and even if all seems lost with what a brilliant final charge it will cover a retreat decidedly we need cavalry in older countries where it has been a merely undisciplined and irregular force it has often done mischief and public men from demosthenes down have been lamenting that measures which the statesman has meditated a whole year may be overturned in a day by a woman under our american government we have foolishly attempted to leave out this arm of the service altogether and much of the alleged dulness of our american history has come from this attempt those who have been trained in the various reforms where woman has taken an equal partthe antislavery reform especiallyknow well how much of the energy the dash the daring of those movements have come from her a revolution with a woman in it is stronger than the established order that omits her it is not that she is superior to man but she is different from man and we can no more spare her than we could spare the cavalry from an army the reason firm the temperate will it is a part of the necessary theory of republican government that every class and race shall be judged by its highest types not its lowest the proposition of the french revolutionary statesman to begin the work of purifying the world by arresting all the cowards and knaves is liable to the objection that it would find victims in every circle republican government begins at the other end and assumes that the community generally has good intentions at least and some common sense however it may be with individuals take the very quality which the newspapers so often deny to womenthe quality of steadiness in fact mens great objection to the entrance of the female mind into politics is drawn from a suspicion of its unsteadiness on matters in which the feelings could by any possibility be enlisted thus says the new york nation let us consider this implied charge against women and consider it not by generalizing from a single instancejust like a woman as the editors would doubtless say if a woman had done itbut by observing whole classes of that sex taken together these classes need some care in selection for the plain reason that there are comparatively few circles in which women have yet been allowed enough freedom of scope or have acted sufficiently on the same plane with men to furnish a fair estimate of their probable action were they enfranchised still there occur to me three such classesthe antislavery women the quaker women and the women who conduct philanthropic operations in our large cities if the alleged unsteadiness of women is to be felt in public affairs it would have been felt in these organizations has it been so felt of the antislavery movement i can personally testifyand i have heard the same point fully recognized among my elders such as garrison phillips and quincythat the women contributed their full share if not more than their share to the steadiness of that movement even in times when the feelings were most excited as for instance in fugitiveslave cases who that has seen mobs practically put down and mayors cowed into decency by the silent dignity of those rows of women who sat with their knitting more imperturbable than the men can read without a smile these doubts of the steadiness of that sex again among quaker women i have asked the opinion of prominent friends as of john g whittier whether it has been the experience of that body that women were more flighty and unsteady than men in their official action and have been uniformly answered in the negative and finally as to benevolent organizations a good test is given in the factfirst pointed out i believe by that eminently practical philanthropist rev augustus woodbury of providencethat the whole tendency has been during the last twenty years to put the management even the financial control of our benevolent societies more and more into the hands of women and that there has never been the slightest reason to reverse this policy ask the secretaries of the various boards of state charities or the officers of the social science associations if they have found reason to complain of the want of steadfast qualities in the weaker sex why is it that the legislation of massachusetts has assigned the class requiring the steadiest of all supervisionthe imprisoned convictsto five commissioners of prisons two of whom shall be women these are the points which it would be worthy of our journals to consider instead of hastily generalizing from single instances let us appeal from the typical woman of the editorial picturefickle unsteady foolishto the nobler conception of womanhood which the poet wordsworth found fulfilled in his own householda being breathing thoughtful breath a traveller betwixt life and deaththe reason firm the temperate will endurance foresight strength and skill a perfect woman nobly planned to warn to comfort to command and yet a spirit still and bright with something of an angel light allures to brighter worlds and leads the way when a certain legislature had school suffrage under consideration the other day the suggestion was made by one of the pithiest and quaintest of the speakers that men were always better for the society of women and therefore ought to vote in their company if all of us he said would stay away from all places where we cannot take our wives and daughters with us we should keep better company than we now do this expresses a feeling which grows more and more common among the better class of men and which is the key to much progress in the condition of women there can be no doubt that the increased association of the sexes in society in school in literature tends to purify these several spheres of action yet when we come to philosophize on this there occur some perplexities on the way for instance the exclusion of woman from all these spheres was in ancient greece almost complete yet the leading greek poets as homer and the tragedians are exceedingly chaste in tone and in this respect beyond most of the great poets of modern nations again no european nation has quite so far sequestered and subordinated women as has spain and yet the whole tone of spanish literature is conspicuously grave and decorous this plainly indicates that race has much to do with the matter and that the mere admission or exclusion of women is but one among several factors in short it is easy to make out a case by a rhetorical use of the facts on one side but if we look at all the facts the matter presents greater difficulties again it is to be noted that in several countries the first women who have taken prominent part in literature have been as bad as the men as for instance marguerite of navarre and mrs aphra behn this might indeed be explained by supposing that they had to gain entrance into literature by accepting the dissolute standards which they found prevailing but it would probably be more correct to say that these standards themselves were variable and that their variation affected at certain periods women as well as men marguerite of navarre wrote religious books as well as merry stories and we know from lockharts life of scott that ladies of high character in edinburgh used to read mrs behns tales and plays aloud at one time with delightalthough one of the same ladies found in her old age that she could not read them to herself without blushing shakespeare puts coarse repartees into the mouths of women of stainless virtue george sand is not considered an unexceptionable writer but she tells us in her autobiography that she found among her grandmothers papers poems and satires so indecent that she could not read them through and yet they bore the names of abbés and gentlemen whom she remembered in her childhood as models of dignity and honor voltaire inscribes to ladies of high rank who doubtless regarded it as a great compliment verses such as not even a poet of the english fleshly school would now print at all in poems by eminent ladiespublished in and reprinted in there are one or two poems as gross and disgusting as anything in swift yet their authors were thought reputable women allan ramsays teatable miscellanya collection of english and scottish songswas first published in and in his preface to the sixteenth edition the editor attributes its great success especially among the ladies to the fact that he has carefully excluded all grossness that the modest voice and ear of the fair singer might meet with no affront and adds the chief bent of all my studies being to attain their good graces there is no doubt of the great popularity enjoyed by the book in all circles yet it contains a few songs which the most licentious newspaper would not now publish the inference is irresistible from this and many other similar facts that the whole tone of manners and decency has very greatly improved among the european races within a century and a half i suspect the truth to be that besides the visible influence of race and religion there has been an insensible and almost unconscious improvement in each sex with respect to these matters as time has passed on and that the mutual desire to please has enabled each sex to help the otherthe sex which is naturally the more refined taking the lead but i should lay more stress on this mutual influence and less on mere feminine superiority than would be laid by many it is often claimed by teachers that coeducation helps not only boys but also girls to develop greater propriety of manners when the sexes are wholly separate or associate on terms of entire inequality no such good influence occurs the more equal the association the better for both parties after all the divine model is to be found in the family and the best ingenuity cannot improve much upon itiv the home in respect to the powers and rights of married women the law is by no means abreast of the spirit of the age here are seen the old fossil footprints of feudalism the law relating to woman tends to make every family a barony or a monarchy or a despotism of which the husband is the baron king or despot and the wife the dependent serf or slave that this is not always the fact is not due to the law but to the enlarged humanity which spurns the narrow limits of its rules the progress of civilization has changed the family from a barony to a republic but the law has not kept pace with the advance of ideas manners and customsww storys treatise on contracts not under seal third edition p wantedhomes we see advertisements occasionally of homes for aged women and more rarely homes for aged men the question sometimes suggests itself whether it would not be better to begin the provision earlier and see that homes are also provided in some form for the middleaged and even the young the trouble is i suppose that as it takes two to make a bargain so it takes at least two to make a home and unluckily it takes only one to spoil it madame roland once defined marriage as an institution where one person undertakes to provide happiness for two and many failures are accounted for no doubt by this false basis sometimes it is the man more often the woman of whom this extravagant demand is made there are marriages which have proved a wreck almost wholly through the fault of the wife nor is this confined to wedded homes alone i have known a son who lived alone patiently and uncomplainingly with that saddest of all conceivable companions a drunken mother i have known another young man who supported in his own home a mother and sister both habitual drunkards all these were americanborn and all of respectable social position a house shadowed by such misery is not a home though it might have proved such but for the sins of women such instances are however rare and occasional compared with the cases where the same offence in the husband makes ruin of the home then there are the cases where indolence or selfishness or vanity or the love of social excitement in the woman unfits her for home life here we come upon ground where perhaps woman is the greater sinner it must be remembered however that against this must be balanced the neglect produced by clublife or by the life of societymembership in a man a brilliant young married belle in london once told me that she was glad her husband was so fond of his club for it amused him every night while she went to balls married men do not go much into society here she said unless they are regular flirtswhich i do not think my husband would ever be for he is very fond of meso he goes every night to his club and gets home about the same time that i do it is a very nice arrangement it is perhaps needless to add that they are long since divorced it is common to denounce clublife in our large cities as destructive of the home the modern club is simply a more refined substitute for the oldfashioned tavern and is on the whole an advance in morals as well as manners in our large cities a man in a certain social coterie belongs to a club if he can afford it as a means of contact with his fellows and to have various conveniences which he cannot so economically obtain at home a few haunt clubs constantly the many use them occasionally more absorbing than these perhaps are the secret societies which have so revived among us since the war and which consume time so fearfully there was a case mentioned in the newspapers lately of a man who belonged to some twenty of these associations and when he died and each wished to conduct his funeral great was the strife in the small city where i write there are seventeen secret societies down in the directory and i suppose as many more not so conspicuous i meet men who assure me that they habitually attend a society meeting every evening of the week except sunday when they go to church meeting these are rarely men of leisure they are usually mechanics or business men of some kind who are hard at work all day and never see their families except at mealtimes their case is far worse so far as absence from home is concerned than that of the clubmen of large cities for these are often men of leisure who if married at least make home one of their loungingplaces which such secretsociety men do not i honestly believe that this melancholy desertion of the home is largely due to the traditional separation between the alleged spheres of the sexes the theory still prevails largely that home is the peculiar province of the woman that she has almost no duties out of it and hence naturally enough that the husband has almost no duties in it if he is amused there let him stay there but as it is not his recognized sphere of duty he is not actually violating any duty by absenting himself this theory even pervades our manuals of morals of metaphysics and of popular science and it is not every public teacher who has the manliness having once stated it to modify his statement as did the venerable president hopkins of williams college when lecturing the other day to the young ladies of vassari would he said at this point correct my teaching in the law of love to the effect that home is peculiarly the sphere of woman and civil government that of man i now regard the home as the joint sphere of man and woman and the sphere of civil government more of an open question as between the two it is however to be lamented that the present agitation concerning the rights of woman is so much a matter of rights rather than of duties as the reform of the latter would involve the former if our instructors in moral philosophy will only base their theory of ethics as broadly as this we shall no longer need to advertise homes wanted for the joint efforts of men and women will soon provide them the origin of civilization nothing throws more light on the whole history of woman than the first illustration in sir john lubbocks origin of civilization a young girl almost naked is being dragged furiously along the ground by a party of naked savages armed literally to the teeth while those of another band grasp her by the arm and almost tear her asunder in the effort to hold her back these last are her brothers and her friends the others areher enemies as you please to call them they are her future husband and his kinsmen who have come to aid him in his wooing this was the primitive rite of marriage vestiges of it still remain among savage nations and all the romance and grace of the most refined modern marriagethe orangeblossoms the bridal veil the church service the wedding feastthese are only the bright consummate flower reared by civilization from that rough seed all the brutal encounter is softened into this nothing remains of the barbarism except the one word obey and even that is going now to say that a thing is going is to say that it will presently be gone to say that anything is changed is to say that it is to change further if it never has been altered perhaps it will not be but a proved alteration of an inch in a year opens the way to an indefinite modification the study of the glaciers for instance began with the discovery that they had moved and from that moment no one doubted that they were moving all the time it is the same with the position of woman once open your eyes to the fact that it has changed and who is to predict where the matter shall end it is sheer folly to say her relative position will always be what it has been when one glance at sir john lubbocks picture shows that there is no fixed has been but that her original position was long since altered and revised those who still use this argument are like those who laughed at the lines of stakes which agassiz planted across the aar glacier in but the stakes settled the question and proved the motion però sim muove but it moves the motion once proved the whole range of possible progress is before us the amazement of that chinese visitor in boston the other day when he saw a woman addressing a missionary meeting the astonishment of all english visitors when young ladies teach classes in geometry and latin in our high schools the surprise of foreigners at seeing the rough throng in the cooper institute readingroom submit to the sway of one young woman with a crochetneedleall these simply testify to the fact that the stakes have moved that they have yet been carried halfway to the end who knows what a step from the horrible nuptials of those savage days to the poetic marriage of robert browning and elizabeth barrettthe sonnets from the portuguese on one side the one word more on the other but who can say that the whole relation between man and woman reached its climax there and that where the past has brought changes so vast the future is to add nothing who knows that when the worlds great bridals come people may not look back with pity even on this era of the brownings perhaps even elizabeth barrett promised to obey at any rate it is safe to say that each step concedes the probability of another even from the naked barbarian to the veiled oriental from the savage hut to the carefully enshrined harem there is a step forward one more step in the spiral line of progress has brought us to the unveiled face and comparatively free movements of the english or american woman from the kitchen to the public lectureroom from that to the lectureplatform and from that again to the ballotboxthese are far slighter steps than those which gradually lifted the savage girl of sir john lubbocks picture into the possession of the alphabet and the dignity of a home so easy are these future changes beside those of the past that to doubt their possibility is as if agassiz after tracing year by year the motion of his alpine glacier should deny its power to move one inch farther into the sunny valley and there to melt harmlessly away the lowwater mark we constantly see it assumed in arguments against any step in the elevation of woman that her position is a thing fixed permanently by nature so that there can be in it no great or essential change every successive modification is resisted as a reform against nature and this argument from permanence is always that which appears most convincing to conservative minds let us see how the facts confirm ita story is going the rounds of the newspapers in regard to a russian peasant and his wife for some act of disobedience the peasant took the law into his own hands and his mode of discipline was to tie the poor creature naked to a post in the street and to call on every passerby to strike her a blow not satisfied with this he placed her on the ground and tied heavy weights on her limbs until one arm was broken when finally released she made a complaint against him in court the court discharged him on the ground that he had not exceeded the legal authority of a husband encouraged by this he caused her to be arrested in return and the same court sentenced her to another public whipping for disobedience no authority was given for this story in the newspaper where i saw it but it certainly did not first appear in a womansuffrage newspaper and cannot therefore be a manufactured outrage i use it simply to illustrate the lowwater mark at which the position of woman may rest in the largest christian nation of the world all the refinements all the education all the comparative justice of modern society have been gradually upheaved from some such depth as this when the gypsies described by leland treat even the ground trodden upon by a woman as impure they simply illustrate the low plane from which all the elevation of woman has begun all these things show that the position of that sex in society so far from being a thing in itself permanent has been in reality the most changing of all factors in the social problem and this inevitably suggests the question are we any more sure that her present position is finally and absolutely fixed than were those who observed it at any previous time in the worlds history granting that her condition was once at lowwater mark who is authorized to say that it has yet reached high tide it is very possible that this russian wife once scourged back to submission ended her days in the conviction and taught it to her daughters that such was a womans rightful place when an american woman of today says i have all the rights i want is she on any surer ground grant that the difference is vast between the two how do we know that even the later condition is final or that anything is final but entire equality before the laws it is not many years since william storyin a legal work inspired and revised by his father the greatest of american juristswrote this indignant protest against the injustice of the old common lawin respect to the powers and rights of married women the law is by no means abreast of the spirit of the age here are seen the old fossil footprints of feudalism the law relating to woman tends to make every family a barony or a monarchy or a despotism of which the husband is the baron king or despot and the wife the dependent serf or slave that this is not always the fact is not due to the law but to the enlarged humanity which spurns the narrow limits of its rules the progress of civilization has changed the family from a barony to a republic but the law has not kept pace with the advance of ideas manners and customs and although public opinion is a check to legal rules on the subject the rules are feudal and stern yet the position of woman throughout history serves as the criterion of the freedom of the people or an age when man shall despise that right which is founded only on might woman will be free and stand on an equal level with hima friend and not a dependent we know that the law is greatly changed and ameliorated in many places since story wrote this statement but we also know how almost every one of these changes was resisted and who is authorized to say that the final and equitable fulfilment is yet reached footnote storys treatise on the law of contracts not under seal p obey after witnessing the marriage ceremony of the episcopal church the other day i walked down the aisle with the young rector who had officiated it was natural to speak of the beauty of the church service on an occasion like that but after doing this i felt compelled to protest against the unrighteous pledge to obey i hope i said to live to see that word expunged from the episcopal service as it has been from that of the methodists the roman catholics you know have never had it why do you object he asked is it because you know that they will not obey because they ought not i said well said he after a few moments reflection and looking up frankly i do not think they ought here was a young clergyman of great earnestness and selfdevotion who included it among the sacred duties of his life to impose upon ignorant young girls a solemn obligation which he yet thought they ought not to incur and did not believe that they would keep there could hardly be a better illustration of the confusion in the public mind or the manner in which the subjection of woman is being outgrown or the subtile way in which this subjection has been interwoven with sacred ties and baptized duty the advocates of woman suffrage are constantly reproved for using the terms subjection oppression and slaveryas applied to woman they simply commit the same sin as that committed by the original abolitionists they are as harsh as truth as uncompromising as justice of course they talk about oppression and emancipation it is the word obey that constitutes the one and shows the need of the other whoever is pledged to obey is technically and literally a slave no matter how many roses surround the chains all the more so if the slavery is selfimposed and surrounded by all the prescriptions of religion make the marriage tie as close as church or state can make it but let it be equal impartial that it may be so the word obey must be abandoned or made reciprocal where invariable obedience is promised equality is gone that there may be no doubt about the meaning of this word in the marriage covenant the usages of nations often add symbolic explanations these are generally simple and brutal enough to be understood the hebrew ceremony when the bridegroom took off his slipper and struck the bride on the neck as she crossed his threshold was unmistakable as my black sergeant said when a white prisoner questioned his authority and he pointed to the chevrons on his sleeve dat mean guvment all these forms mean simply government also the ceremony of the slipper has now no recognition except when people fling an old shoe after the bride which is held by antiquarians to be the same observance but it is all preserved and concentrated into a single word when the bride promises to obey the deepest wretchedness that has ever been put into human language or that has exceeded it has grown out of that pledge there is no misery on earth like that of a pure and refined woman who finds herself owned body and soul by a drunken licentious brutal man the very fact that she is held to obedience by a spiritual tie makes it worse chattel slavery was not so bad for though the master might pervert religion for his own satisfaction he could not impose upon the slave never yet did i see a negro slave who thought it a duty to obey his master and therefore there was always some dream of release but who has not heard of some delicate and refined woman one day of whose torture was equivalent to years of that possible to an obtuse framewho had the door of escape ready at hand for years and yet died a lingering death rather than pass through it and this because she had promised to obey it is said of one of the most gifted women who ever trod american soil she being of english birththat before she obtained the divorce which separated her from her profligate husband she once went for counsel to the wife of her pastor she unrolled before her the long catalogue of merciless outrages to which she had been subject endangering finally her health her life and that of her children born and to be born when she turned at last for advice to her confessor with the agonized inquiry what is it my duty to dodo said the stern adviser lie down on the floor and let your husband trample on you if he will that is a womans duty the woman who gave this advice was not naturally inhuman nor heartless she had simply been trained in the school of obedience the jesuit doctrine that a priest should be as a corpse perinde ac cadaver in the hands of a superior priest is not worse woman has no right to delegate nor man to assume a responsibility so awful just in proportion as it is consistently carried out it trains men from boyhood into selfindulgent tyrants and while some women are transformed by it to saints others are crushed into deceitful slaves that this was the result of chattel slavery this nation has at length learned we learn more slowly the profounder and more subtile moral evil that follows from the unrighteous promise to obey woman in the chrysalis when the bride receives the ring upon her finger and uttersif she utters itthe promise to obey she sees a poetic beauty in the rite turning of her own free will from her maiden liberty she voluntarily takes the yoke of service upon her this is her view but is this the historic fact in regard to marriage not at all the pledge of obediencethe whole theory of inequality in marriageis simply what is left to us of a former state of society in which every woman old or young must obey somebody the state of tutelage implied in such a marriage is merely what is left of the old theory of the perpetual tutelage of women under the roman law roman law from which our civil law is derived has its foundation evidently in patriarchal tradition it recognized at first the family only and that family was held together by paternal power patria potestas if the father died his powers passed to the son or grandson as the possible head of a new family but these powers could never pass to a woman and every woman of whatever age must be under somebodys legal control her father dying she was still subject through life to her nearest male relations or to her fathers nominees as her guardians she was under perpetual guardianship both as to person and property no years no experience could make her anything but a child before the law in oriental countries the system was still more complete a man says the gentoo code of laws must keep his wife so much in subjection that she by no means be mistress of her own action if the wife have her own free will notwithstanding she be of a superior caste she will behave amiss but this authority which still exists in india is not merely conjugal the husband exerts it simply as being the wifes legal guardian if the woman be unmarried or a widow she must be as rigorously held under some other guardianship it is no uncommon thing for a woman in india to be the ward of her own son lucretia mott or florence nightingale would there be in personal subjection to somebody any manof legal age would be recognized as a fit custodian for them but there must be a man with some variation of details at different periods the same system prevailed essentially at rome down to the time when rome became christian those who wish for particulars will find them in an admirable chapter the fifth of maines ancient law at one time the husband was held to possess the patria potestas or paternal power in its full force by law the woman passed in manum viri that is she became the daughter of her husband all she had became his and after his death she was retained in the same strict tutelage by any guardians his will might appoint afterwards to soften this rigid bond the woman was regarded in law as being temporarily deposited by her family with her husband the family appointed guardians over her and thus between the two tyrannies she won a sort of independence then came christianity and swept away the merely parental authority for married women concentrating all upon the husband hence our legislation bears the mark of a double origin and woman is half recognized as an equal and half as a slave it is necessary to remember therefore that all the relation of subjection in marriage is merely the residue of an unnatural system of which all else is long since outgrown it would have seemed to an ancient roman a matter of course that a woman should all her life long obey the guardians set over her person it still seems to many people a matter of course that she should obey her husband to others among us on the contrary both these theories of obedience seem barbarous and the one is merely a relic of the other we cannot disregard the history of the theory of tutelage if we could believe that a chrysalis is always a chrysalis and a butterfly always a butterfly we could easily leave each to its appropriate sphere but when we see the chrysalis open and the butterfly come half out of it we know that sooner or later it must spread wings and fly the theory of tutelage implies the chrysalis woman is the butterfly sooner or later she will be wholly out two and two a young man of very good brains was telling me the other day his dreams of his future wife rattling on more in joke than in earnest he said she must be perfectly ignorant and a bigot she must know nothing and believe everything i should wish to have her from the adjoining room call to me my dear what do two and two make it did not seem to me that his demand would be so very hard to fill since bigotry and ignorance are to be had almost anywhere for the asking and as for two and two i should say that it had always been the habit of women to ask that question of some man and to rest easily satisfied with the answer they have generally called as my friend wished from some other room saying my dear what do two and two make and the husband or father or brother has answered and said my dear they make four for a man and three for a woman at any given period in the history of woman she has adopted mans whim as the measure of her rights has claimed nothing has sweetly accepted anything the law of twoandtwo itself should be at his discretion at any given moment so well was his interpretation received that it stood for absolute right in rome a woman married or single could not testify in court in the middle ages and down to quite modern times she could not hold real estate thirty years ago she could not in new england obtain a collegiate education even now she can only vote for school officers the first principles of republican government are so rehearsed and rerehearsed that one would think they must become as plain as that two and two make four but we find throughout that as emerson said of another class of reasoners their two is not the real two their four is not the real four we find different numerals and diverse arithmetical rules for the two sexes as in some oriental countries men and women speak different dialects of the same language in novels the hero often begins by dreaming like my friend of an ideal wife who shall be ignorant of everything and have only brains enough to be bigoted instead of sighing like falstaff oh for a fine young thief of the age of two and twenty or thereabouts the hero sighs for a fine young idiot of similar age when the hero is successful in his search and wooing the novelist sometimes mercifully removes the young woman early like david copperfields dora she bequeathing the bereaved husband on her deathbed to a woman of sense in real life these convenient interruptions do not commonly occur and the foolish youth regrets through many years that he did not select an agnes instead the acute observer stendhal saysin paris the highest praise for a marriageable girl is to say she has great sweetness of character and the disposition of a lamb nothing produces more impression on fools who are looking out for wives i think i see the interesting couple two years after breakfasting together on a dull day with three tall lackeys waiting upon them and he adds still speaking in the interest of menmost men have a period in their career when they might do something great a period when nothing seems impossible the ignorance of women spoils for the human race this magnificent opportunity and love at the utmostin these days only inspires a young man to learn to ride well or to make a judicious selection of a tailor society however discovers by degrees that there are conveniences in every womans knowing the four rules of arithmetic for herself two and two come to the same amount on a butchers bill whether the order be given by a man or a woman and it is the same in all affairs or investments financial or moral we shall one day learn that with laws customs and public affairs it is the same once get it rooted in a womans mind that for her two and two make three only and sooner or later the accounts of the whole human race fail to balance footnote de lamour par de stendhal henri beyle paris written in pp a model household there is an african bird called the hornbill whose habits are in some respects a model the female builds her nest in a hollow tree lays her eggs and broods on them so far so good then the male feels that he must also contribute some service so he walls up the hole closely giving only room for the point of the females bill to protrude until the eggs are hatched she is thenceforth confined to her nest and is in the mean time fed assiduously by her mate who devotes himself entirely to this object dr livingstone has seen these nests in africa layard and others in asia and wallace in sumatra personally i have never seen a hornbills nest the nearest approach i ever made to it was when in fayal i used to pass near a gloomy mansion of which the front windows were walled up and only one high window was visible in the rear beyond the reach of eyes from any neighboring house in this cheerful abode i was assured a portuguese lady had been for many years confined by her jealous husband it was long since any neighbor had caught a glimpse of her but it was supposed that she was alive there is no reason to doubt that her husband fed her well it was simply a case of human hornbill with the imprisonment made perpetual i have more than once asked lawyers whether in communities where the old common law prevailed there was anything to prevent such an imprisonment of a married woman and they have always answered nothing but public opinion where the husband has the legal custody of the wifes person no habeas corpus can avail against him the hornbill household is based on a strict application of the old common law a hindoo household was a hornbill household a woman of whatsoever age should never be mistress of her own actions said the code of menu an athenian household was a hornbills nest and great was the outcry when some aspasia broke out of it when the remonstrant petitions legislatures against the emancipation of woman we seem to hear the twittering of the hornbill mother imploring to be left inside under some forms the hornbill theory becomes respectable there are many peaceful families innocent though torpid where the only dream of existence is to have plenty of quiet plenty of food and plenty of wellfed children for them this african household is a sufficient model the wife is a home body the husband is a good provider these are honest people and have a right to speak the hornbill theory is only dishonest when it comesas it often comesfrom women who lead the life not of good stayathome fowls but of paroquets and hummingbirdswho sorrowfully bemoan the active habits of enlightened women while they themselves bear about the mockery of woe to midnight dances and the public show it is from these women in washington new york and elsewhere that the loudest appeal for the hornbill standard of domesticity proceeds put them to the test and give them their chickensalad and champagne through a hole in the wall only and see how they like it but even the most honest and peaceful conservatives will one day admit that the hornbill is not the highest model plato thought that the soul of our grandame might haply inhabit the body of a bird but nature has kindly provided various types of birdhouseholds to suit all varieties of taste the bright orioles filling the summer boughs with color and with song are as truly domestic in the freedom of their airy nest as the poor hornbills who ignorantly make home into a dungeon and certainly each new generation of orioles spreading free wings from that pendent cradle affords a happier illustration of judicious nurture than is to be found in the uncouth little offspring of the hornbills which wallace describes as so flabby and semitransparent as to resemble a bladder of jelly furnished with head legs and rudimentary wings but with not a sign of a feather except a few lines of points indicating where they would come a safeguard for the family many germanamericans are warm friends of woman suffrage but the editors of puck it seems

correspondent mrs blake very naturally asks what this touching picture has to do with woman suffrage puck says if the husband in our pretty family scene should propose to vote for the candidate who was obnoxious to his wife would this pretty family scene continue to be a domestic paradise or would it remind the spectator of the region in which dante spent his fortnight off it is beautiful to see how much anxiety there is to preserve the family every step in the modification of the old common law whereby the wife was in baron aldersons phrase the servant of her husband was resisted as tending to endanger the family the proposal that the wife should control her own earnings so that her husband should not have the right to collect them in order to pay his gambling debts was declared by english advocates in the celebrated case of the hon mrs norton the poetess to imperil all the future peace of british households even the liberalminded punch about the time girton college was founded in england expressed grave doubts whether the harmony of wedded unions would not receive a blow from the time when wives should be liable to know more greek than their husbands yet the marriage relation has withstood these innovations it has not been impaired either by separate rights private earnings or independent greek can it be possible that a little voting will overthrow it the very ground on which woman suffrage is opposed by its enemies might assuage these fears if as we are told women will not take the pains to vote except upon the strongest inducements who has so good an opportunity as the husband to bring those inducements to bear and if so what is the separation or if as we are told women will merely reflect their husbands political opinions why should they dispute about them the mere suggestion of a difference deep enough to quarrel for implies a real difference of convictions or interests and indicates that there ought to be an independent representation of each unless we fall back once for all on the commonlaw tradition that man and wife are one and that one is the husband either the antagonisms which occur in politics are comparatively superficial in which case they would do no harm or else they touch matters of real interest and principle in which case every human being has a right to independent expression even at a good deal of risk in either case the objection falls to the ground we have fortunately a means of testing with some fairness of estimate the probable amount of this peril it is generally admittedand certainly no germanamerican will denythat the most fruitful sources of hostility and war in all times have been religious not political all merely political antagonism certainly all which is possible in a republic fades into insignificance before this more powerful dividing influence yet we leave all this great explosive force in unimpeded operationat any moment it may be set in action in any one of those pretty family scenes which puck depictswhile we are solemnly warned against admitting the comparatively mild peril of a political difference it is like cautioning a manufacturer of dynamite against the danger of meddling with mere edgetools even with all the intensity of feeling on religious matters few families are seriously divided by them and the influence of political differences would be still more insignificant the simple fact is that there is no better basis for union than mutual respect for each others opinions and this can never be obtained without an intelligent independence i would rather have a thorn in my side than an echo said emerson of friendship and the same is true of married life it is the echoes the nonentities of whom men grow tired it is the women with some flavor of individuality who keep the hearts of their husbands this is only applying in a higher sense what shakespeares cleopatra saw when her handmaidens are questioning how to hold a lover and one saysgive way to him in all cross him in nothingcleopatra from the depth of an unequalled experience retortsthou speakest like a fool the way to lose him and what the serpent of old nile said the wives of the future who are to be wise as serpents and harmless as doves may well ponder it takes two things different to make a union and part of that difference may as well lie in matters political as anywhere else women as economists an able lawyer of boston arguing the other day before a legislative committee in favor of giving to the city council a check upon the expenditures of the school committee gave as one reason that this body would probably include more women henceforward and that women were ordinarily more lavish than men in their use of money the truth of this assumption was questioned at the time and the more i think of it the more contrary it is to my whole experience i should say that women from the very habit of their lives are led to be more particular about details and more careful asto small economies the very fact that they handle less money tends to this when they are told to spend money as they often are by loving or ambitious husbands they no doubt do it freely they have naturally more taste than men and quite as much love of luxury in some instances in this country they spend money recklessly and wickedly like the heroines of french novels but as even in brilliant paris the women of the middle classes are notoriously better managers than the men so we often see in our scheming america the same relative superiority often have i heard young men say i never knew how to economize until after my marriage and who has not seen multitudes of instances where women accustomed to luxury have accepted poverty without a murmur for the sake of those whom they loved i remember a young girl accustomed to the gayest society of new york who engaged herself to a young naval officer against the advice of the friends of both one of her near relatives said to me of all the young girls i have ever known she is the least fitted for a poor mans wife yet from the very moment of her marriage she brought their joint expenses within his scanty pay and even saved a little money from it everybody knows such instances we hear men denounce the extravagance of women while those very men spend on wine and cigars on clubs and horses twice what their wives spend on their toilet if the wives are economical the husbands perhaps urge them on to greater lavishness why do you not dress like mrs soandsoi cant afford itbut i can afford it and then when the bills come in the talk of extravagance recommences at one time in newport that lady among the summer visitors who was reported to be worths best customer was also well known to be quite indifferent to society and to go into it mainly to please her husband whose social ambition was notorious it has often happened to me to serve in organizations where both sexes were represented and where expenditures were to be made for business or pleasure in these i have found as a rule that the women were more careful or perhaps i should say more timid than the men less willing to risk anything the bolder financial experiments came from the men as one might expect in talking the other day with the secretary of an important educational enterprise conducted by women i was surprised to find that it was cramped for money though large subscriptions were said to have been made to it on inquiry it appeared that these ladies having pledged themselves for four years had divided the amount received into four parts and were resolutely limiting themselves for the first year to one quarter part of what had been subscribed no board of men would have done so any board of men would have allowed far more than a quarter of the sum for the first years expenditures justly reasoning that if the enterprise began well it would command public confidence and bring in additional subscriptions as time went on i would appeal to any one whose experience has been in joint associations of men and women whether this is not a fair statement of the difference between their ways of working it does not prove that women are more honest than men but that their education or their nature makes them more cautious in expenditure the habits of society make the dress of a fashionable woman far more expensive than that of a man of fashion formerly it was not so and so long as it was not so the extravagance of men in this respect quite equalled that of women it now takes other forms but the habit is the same the waiters at any fashionable restaurant will tell you that what is a cheap dinner for a man would be a dear dinner for a woman yet after all the test is not in any particular class of expenditures but in the businesslike habit men are of course more businesslike in large combinations for they are more used to them but for the small details of daily economy women are more watchful the cases where women ruin their husbands by extravagance are exceptional as a rule the men are the breadwinners but the careful saving and managing and contriving come from the women greater includes less i was once at a little musical party in new york where several accomplished amateur singers were present and with them the eminent professional miss adelaide phillipps the amateurs were first called on each chose some difficult operatic passage and sang her best when it came to the great operasingers turn instead of exhibiting her ability to eclipse those rivals on her own ground she simply seated herself at the piano and sang kathleen mavourneen with such thrilling sweetness that the young irish girl who was setting the suppertable in the next room forgot all her plates and teaspoons threw herself into a chair put her apron over her face and sobbed as if her heart would break all the training of adelaide phillippsher magnificent voice her stage experience her skill in effects her power of expressionwent into the performance of that simple song the greater included the less and thus all the intellectual and practical training that any woman can have all her public action and her active career will make her if she be a true woman more admirable as a wife a mother and a friend the greater includes the less for her also of course this is a statement of general facts and tendencies there must be among women as among men an endless variety of individual temperaments there will always be plenty whose career will illustrate the infirmities of genius and whom no training can convince that two and two make four but the general fact is sure as no sensible man would seriously prefer for a wife a hindoo or tahitian woman rather than one bred in england or america so every further advantage of education or opportunity will only improve not impair the true womanly type lucy stone once said womans nature was stamped and sealed by the almighty and there is no danger of her unsexing herself while his eye watches her margaret fuller said one hour of love will teach a woman more of her truerelations than all your philosophizing these were the testimony of women who had studied greek and were only the more womanly for the study they are worth the opinions of a million halfdeveloped beings like the duchess de fontanges who was described as being as beautiful as an angel and as silly as a goose the greater includes the less your view from the mountainside may be very pretty but she who has taken one step higher commands your view and her own also it was no dreamy recluse but the accomplished and experienced stendhal who wrote the joys of the gay world do not count for much with happy women if a highly educated man is incapable and unpractical we do not say that he is educated too well but not well enough he ought to know what he knows and other things also never yet did i see a woman too well educated to be a wife and a mother but i know multitudes who deplore or have reason to deplore every day of their lives the untrained and unfurnished minds that are so illprepared for these sacred duties every step towards equalizing the opportunities of men and women meets with resistance of course but every step as it is accomplished leaves men still men and women still women and as we who heard adelaide phillipps felt that she had never had a better tribute to her musical genius than this young irish girls tears so the true woman will feel that all her college training for instance if she has it may have been well invested even for the sake of the baby on her knee and it is to be remembered after all that each human being lives to unfold his or her own powers and do his or her own duties first and that neither woman nor man has the right to accept a merely secondary and subordinate life a noble woman must be a noble human being and the most sacred special duties as of wife or mother are all included in this as the greater includes the less footnote de lamour par de stendhal henri beyle les plaisirs du grand monde nen sont pas pour les femmes heureuses p a copartnership marriage considered merely in its financial and business relations may be regarded as a permanent copartnership now in an ordinary copartnership there is very often a complete division of labor among the partners if they manufacture locomotiveengines for instance one partner perhaps superintends the works another attends to mechanical inventions and improvements another travels for orders another conducts the correspondence another receives and pays out the money the latter is not necessarily the head of the firm perhaps his place could be more easily filled than some of the other posts nevertheless more money passes through his hands than through those of all the others put together now should he at the years end call together the inventor and the superintendent and the traveller and the correspondent and say to them i have earned all this money this year but i will generously give you some of ithe would be considered simply impertinent and would hardly have a chance to repeat the offence the year after yet precisely what would be called folly in this business partnership is constantly done by men in the copartnership of marriage and is there called common sense and social science and political economy for instance a farmer works himself half to death in the hayfield and his wife meanwhile is working herself wholly to death in the dairy the neighbors come in to sympathize after her demise and during the few months interval before his second marriage they say approvingly he was always a generous man to his folks he was a good provider but where was the room for generosity any more than the member of any other firm is to be called generous when he keeps the books receipts the bills and divides the money in case of the farming business the share of the wife is so direct and unmistakable that it can hardly be evaded if anything is earned by the farm she does her distinct and important share of the earning but it is not necessary that she should do even that to make her by all the rules of justice an equal partner entitled to her full share of the financial proceeds let us suppose an ordinary case two young people are married and begin life together let us suppose them equally poor equally capable equally conscientious equally healthy they have children those children must be supported by the earning of money abroad by attendance and care at home if it requires patience and labor to do the outside work no less is required inside the duties of the household are as hard as the duties of the shop or office if the wife took her husbands work for a day she would probably be glad to return to her own so would the husband if he undertook hers their duties are ordinarily as distinct and as equal as those of two partners in any other copartnership it so happens that the outdoor partner has the handling of the money but does that give him a right to claim it as his exclusive earnings no more than in any other business operation he earned the money for the children and the household she disbursed it for the children and the household the very laws of nature by giving her the children to bear and rear absolve her from the duty of their support so long as he is alive who was left free by nature for that purpose her task on the average is as hard as his nay a portion of it is so especially hard that it is distinguished from all others by the name labor if it does not earn money it is because it is not to be measured in money while it existsnor to be replaced by money if lost if a business man loses his partner he can obtain another and a man no doubt may take a second wife but he cannot procure for his children a second mother indeed it is a palpable insult to the whole relation of husband and wife when one compares it even in a financial light to that of business partners it is only because a constant effort is made to degrade the practical position of woman below even this standard of comparison that it becomes her duty to claim for herself at least as much as this there was a tradition in a town where i once lived that a certain quaker who had married a fortune was once heard to repel his wife who had asked him for money in a public place with the response rachel where is that ninepence i gave thee yesterday when i read in scribners monthly an article deriding the right to representation of the massachusetts women who pay two millions of tax on one hundred and thirtytwo million dollars of propertyasserting that they produced nothing of it that it was only men who produced this wealth and bestowed it upon these women that it was all drawn from land and sea by the hands of men whose largess testifies alike of their love and their munificencei must say that i am reminded of rachels ninepence one responsible head when we look through any business directory there seem to be almost as many copartnerships as single dealers and three quarters of these copartnerships appear to consist of precisely two persons no more no less these partners are in the eye of the law equal it is not found necessary under the law to make a general provision that in each case one partner should be supreme and the other subordinate in many cases by the terms of the copartnership there are limitations on one side and special privileges on the othermarriage settlements as it were but the general law ofcopartnership is based on the presumption of equality it would be considered infinitely absurd to require that as the general rule one party or the other should be in a state of coverture during which the very being and existence of the one should be suspended or entirely merged and incorporated into that of the other and yet this requirement which would be an admitted absurdity in the case of two business partners is precisely that which the english common law still lays down in case of husband and wife the words which i employed to describe it in the preceding sentence are the very phrases in which blackstone describes the legal position of women and though the english common law has been in this respect greatly modified and superseded by statute law yet when it comes to an argument on woman suffrage it is constantly this same tradition to which men and even women habitually appealthe necessity of a single head to the domestic partnership and the necessity that the husband should be that head this is especially true of english men and women but it is true of americans as well nobody has stated it more tersely than fitzjames stephen in his liberty equality and fraternity p when arguing against mr mills view of the equality of the sexes marriage is a contract one of the principal objects in which is the government of a family this government must be vested either by law or by contract in the hands of one of the two married persons then follow some collateral points not bearing on the present question therefore if marriage is to be permanent the government of the family must be put by law and by morals into the hands of the husband for no one proposes to give it to the wife this argument he calls as clear as that of a proposition in euclid he thinks that the business of life can be carried on by no other method how is it then that when we come to what is called technically and especially the business of every day this whole finespun theory is disregarded and men come together in partnership on the basis of equality nobody is farther than i from regarding marriage as a mere business partnership but it is to be observed that the points wherein it differs from a merely mercantile connection are points that should make equality more easy not more difficult the tie between two ordinary business partners is merely one of interest it is based on no sentiments sealed by no solemn pledge enriched by no home associations cemented by no new generation of young life if a relation like this is found to work well on terms of equalityso well that a large part of the business of the world is done by itis it not absurd to suppose that the same equal relation cannot exist in the married partnership of husband and wife and if law custom society all recognize this fact of equality in the one case why in the name of commonsense should they not equally recognize it in the other and again it may often be far easier to assign a sphere to each partner in marriage than in business and therefore the double headship of a family will involve less need of collision in nine cases out of ten the external support of the family will devolve upon the husband unquestioned by the wife and its internal economy upon the wife unquestioned by the husband no voluntary distribution of powers and duties between business partners can work so naturally on the whole as this simple and easy demarcation with which the claim of suffrage makes no necessary interference it may require angry discussion to decide which of two business partners shall buy and which shall sell which shall keep the books and which do the active work and so on but all this is usually settled in married life by the natural order of things even in regard to the management of children where collision is likely to come if anywhere it can commonly be settled by that happy formula of jean pauls that the mother usually supplies the commas and the semicolons in the childs book of life and the father the colons and periods and as to matters in general the simple and practical rule that each question that arises should be decided by that partner who has personally most at stake in it will in ninetynine times out of a hundred carry the domestic partnership through without shipwreck those who cannot meet the hundredth case by mutual forbearance are in a condition of shipwreck already asking for money one of the very best wives and mothers i have ever known once said to me that whenever her daughters should be married she should stipulate in their behalf with their husbands for a regular sum of money to be paid them at certain intervals for their personal expenditures whether this sum was to be larger or smaller was a matter of secondary importance that must depend on the income and the style of living but the essential thing was that it should come to the wife regularly so that she should no more have to make a special request for it than her husband would have to ask her for a dinner this ladys own husband was as i happened to know of a most generous disposition was devotedly attached to her and denied her nothing she herself was a most accurate and careful manager there was everything in the household to make the financial arrangements flow smoothly yet she said to me i suppose no man can possibly understand how a sensitive woman shrinks from asking for money if i can prevent it my daughters shall never have to ask for it if they do their duty as wives and mothers they have a right to their share of the joint income within reasonable limits for certainly no money could buy the services they render moreover they have a right to a share in determiningwhat those reasonable limits are now it so happened that i had myself gone through an experience which enabled me perfectly to comprehend this feeling in early life i was for a time in the employ of one of my relatives who paid me a fair salary but at no definite periods i was at liberty to ask him for money up to a certain amount whenever i needed it this seemed to me in advance a most agreeable arrangement but i found it quite otherwise it proved to be very disagreeable to apply for money it made every dollar seem a special favor it brought up all kinds of misgivings as to whether he could spare it without inconvenience whether he really thought my services worth it and so on my employer was a thoroughly upright and noble man and i was much attached to him i do not know that he ever refused or demurred when i made my request the annoyance was simply in the process of asking and this became so great that i often underwent serious inconvenience rather than do it finally at the years end i surprised my relative very much by saying that i would accept if necessary a lower salary on condition that it should be paid on regular days and as a matter of business the wish was at once granted without the reduction and he probably never knew what a relief it was to me now if a young man is liable to feel this pride and reluctance toward an employer even when a kinsman it is easy to understand how many women may feel the same even in regard to a husband and i fancy that those who feel it most are often the most conscientious and highminded women it is unreasonable to say of such persons too sensitive too fastidious for it is just this quality of finer sensitiveness which men affect to prize in a woman and wish to protect at all hazards the very fact that a husband is generous the very fact that his income is limitedthese may bring in conscience and gratitude to increase the restraining influence of pride and make the wife less willing to ask money of such a husband than if he were a rich man or a mean one the only dignified position in which a man can place his wife is to treat her at least as well as he would treat a housekeeper and give her the comfort of a perfectly clear and definite arrangement as to money matters she will not then be under the necessity of nerving herself to solicit from him as a favor what she really needs and has a right to spend nor will she be torturing herself on the other side with the secret fear lest she has asked too much and more than they can really spare she will in short be in the position of a woman and a wife not of a child or a toy i have carefully avoided using the word allowance in what has been said because that word seems to imply the untrue and mean assumption that the money is all the husbands to give or withhold as he will yet i have heard this sort of phrase from men who were living on a wifes property or a wifes earnings from men who nominally kept boardinghouses working a little while their wives worked hardor from farmers who worked hard and made their wives work harder even in cases where the wife has no direct part in the moneymaking the indirect part she performs if she takes faithful charge of her household is so essential so beyond all compensation in money that it is an utter shame and impertinence in the husband when he speaks of giving money to his wife as if it were an act of favor it is no more an act of favor than when the business manager of a firm pays out money to the unseen partner who directs the indoor business or runs the machinery be the joint income more or less the wife has a claim to her honorable share and that as a matter of right without the daily ignominy of sending in a petition for it womanhood and motherhood i always groan in spirit when any advocate of woman suffrage carried away by zeal says anything disrespectful about the nursery it is contrary to the general tone of feeling among reformers i am sure to speak of this priceless institution as a trivial or degrading sphere unworthy the emancipated woman it is rarely that anybody speaks in this way but a single such utterance hinders progress more than any arguments of the enemy for every thoughtful person sees that the cares of motherhood though not the whole duty of woman are an essential part of that duty wherever they occur and that no theory of womanly life is good for anything which undertakes to leave out the cradle even her school education is based on this fact were it only on stendhals theory that the sons of a woman who reads gibbon and schiller will be more likely to show talent than those of one who only tells her beads and reads mme de genlis and so clearly is this understood among us that when we ask for suffrage for woman it is almost always claimed that she needs it for the sake of her children to secure her in her right to them to give her a voice in their education to give her a vote in the government beneath which they are to livethese points are seldom omitted in our statement of her claims anything else would be an error but there is an error at the other extreme which is still greater a woman should no more merge herself in her child than in her husband yet we often hear that she should do just this what is all the public sphere of woman it is saidwhat good can she do by all her speaking and writing and actioncompared with that she does by properly training the soul of one child it is not easy to see the logic of this claim for what service is that child to render in the universe except that he too may write and speak and act for that which is good and true and if the mother foregoes all this that the child in growing up may simply do what the mother has left undone the world gains nothing in sacrificing her own work to her childs moreover she exchanges a present good for a prospective and merely possible one if she does this through overwhelming love we can hardly blame her but she cannot justify it before reason and truth her child may die and the service to mankind be done by neither her child maygrow up with talents unlike hers or with none at all as the son of howard was selfish the son of chesterfield a boor and the son of wordsworth in the last degree prosaic or the special occasion when she might have done great good may have passed before her boy or girl grows up to do it if mrs child had refused to write an appeal for that class of americans called africans or mrs stowe had laid aside uncle toms cabin or florence nightingale had declined to go to the crimea on the ground that a womans true work was through the nursery and they must all wait for that the consequence would be that these things would have remained undone the brave acts of the world must be performed when occasion offers by the first brave soul who feels moved to do them man or woman if all the children in all the nurseries are thereby helped to do other brave deeds when their turn comes so much the better but when a great opportunity offers for direct aid to the world we have no right to transfer that work to other handsnot even to the hands of our own children we must do the work and train the children besides i am willing to admit therefore that the work of education in any form is as great as any other work but i fail to see why it should be greater usefulness is usefulness there is no reason why it should be postponed from generation to generation or why it is better to rear a serviceable human being than to be one in person carry the theory consistently out if each mother must simply rear her daughter that she in turn may rear somebody else then from each generation the work will devolve upon a succeeding generation so that it will be only the last woman who will personally do any service except that of motherhood and when her time comes it will be too late for any service at all if it be said but some of these children will be men who are necessarily of more use than women i deny the necessity if it be said the children may be many and the mother who is but one may well be sacrificed it might be replied that as one great act may be worth many smaller ones so all the numerous children and grandchildren of a woman like lucretia mott may not collectively equal the usefulness of herself alone if she like many women had held it her duty to renounce all other duties and interests from the time her motherhood began i think that the world and even her children would have lost more than could ever have been gained by her more complete absorption in the nursery the true theory seems a very simple one the very fact that during one half the years of a womans average life she is made incapable of childbearing shows that there are even for the most prolific and devoted mothers duties other than the maternal even during the most absorbing years of motherhood the wisest women still try to keep up their interest in society in literature in the worlds affairswere it only for their childrens sake multitudes of women will never be mothers and those more fortunate may find even the usefulness of their motherhood surpassed by what they do in other ways if maternal duties interfere in some degree with all other functions the same is true though in a far less degree of those of a father but there are those who combine both spheres the german poet wieland claimed to be the parent of fourteen children and forty books and who knows by which parentage he served the world the best a german point of view many americans will remember the favorable impression made by professor christlieb of germany when he attended the meeting of the evangelical alliance in new york some years ago his writings like his presence show a most liberal spirit and perhaps no man has ever presented the more advanced evangelical theology of germany in so attractive a light yet i heard a story of him the other day which either showed him in an aspect quite undesirable or else gave an unpleasant view of the social position of women in germany the story was to the effect that a young american student recently called on professor christlieb with a letter of introduction the professor received him cordially and soon entered into conversation about the united states he praised the natural features of the country and the enterprising spirit of our citizens but expressed much solicitude about the future of the nation on being asked his reasons he frankly expressed his opinion that the spirit of christ was not here being still further pressed to illustrate his meaning he gave as instances of this deficiency not the crédit mobilier or the tweed scandal but such alarming facts as the following he seriously declared that on more than one occasion he had heard an american married woman say to her husband dear will you bring me my shawl and the husband had brought it he further had seen a husband return home at evening and enter the parlor where his wife was sittingperhaps in the very best chair in the roomand the wife not only did not go and get his dressinggown and slippers but she even remained seated and left him to find a chair as he could these things as professor christlieb pointed out suggested a serious deficiency of the spirit of christ in the community with our american habits and interpretations it is hard to see this matter just as the professor sees it one would suppose that if there is any meaning in the command bear ye one anothers burdens and so fulfil the law of christ a little of such fulfilling might sometimes be good for the husband as for the wife and though it would undoubtedly be more pleasing to see every wife so eager to receive her husband that she would naturally spring from her chair and run to kiss him in the doorway yet where such devotion was wanting it would be but fair to inquire which of the two had done the more fatiguing days work and to whom the easychair justly belonged the truth is i suppose that the good professorsremark indicated simply a survival in his mind or in his social circle of a barbarous tradition under which the wife of a mexican herdsman cannot eat at the table with her lord and master and the wife of a german professor must vacate the best armchair at his approach if so it is not to be regretted that we in this country have outgrown a relation so unequal nor am i at all afraid that the great teacher who pointing to the multitude for whom he was soon to die said of them whosoever shall do the will of god the same is my brother and my sister and my mother would have objected to any mutual and equal service between man and woman if we assume that two human beings have immortal souls there can be no want of dignity to either in serving the other the greater equality of woman in america seems to be on this reasoning a proof of the presence not the absence of the spirit of christ nor does dr christlieb seem quite worthy of the beautiful name he bears if he feels otherwise but if it is really true that a german professor has to cross the atlantic to witness a phenomenon so very simple as that of a loverlike husband bringing a shawl for his wife i should say let the immigration from germany be encouraged as much as possible in order that even the most learned immigrants may discover something new childless women it has not always been regarded as a thing creditable to woman that she was the mother of the human race on the contrary the fact was often mentioned in the middle ages as a distinct proof of inferiority the question was discussed in the mediaeval council of maçon and the position taken that woman was no more entitled to rank as human because she brought forth men than the gardenearth could take rank with the fruit and flowers it bore the same view was revived by a latin writer of on the thesis mulieres non homines esse a french translation of which essay was printed under the title of paradoxe sur les femmes in napoleon bonaparte used the same image carrying it almost as farwoman is given to man that she may bear children woman is our property we are not hers because she produces children for us we do not yield any to her she is therefore our possession as the fruittree is that of the gardener even the fact of parentage therefore has been adroitly converted into a ground of inferiority for women and this is ostensibly the reason why lineage has been reckoned almost everywhere through the male line only ignoring the female just as in tracing the seed of some rare fruit the gardener takes no genealogical account of the garden where it grew this view is now seldom expressed in full force but one remnant of it is to be found in the lingering impression that at any rate a woman who is not a mother is of no account as worthless as a fruitless garden or a barren fruittree created only for a certain object she is of course valueless unless that object be fulfilled but the race must have fathers as well as mothers and if we look for evidence of public service in great men it certainly does not always lie in leaving children to the republic on the contrary the rule has rather seemed to be that the most eminent men have left their bequest of service in any form rather than in that of a great family recent inquiries into the matter have brought out some remarkable facts in this regard as a rule there exist no living descendants in the male line from the great authors artists statesmen soldiers of england it is stated that there is not one such descendant of chaucer shakespeare spenser butler dryden pope cowper goldsmith scott byron or moore not one of drake cromwell monk marlborough peterborough or nelson not one of strafford ormond or clarendon not one of addison swift or johnson not one of walpole bolingbroke chatham pitt fox burke grattan or canning not one of bacon locke newton or davy not one of hume gibbon or macaulay not one of hogarth or reynolds not one of garrick john kemble or edmund kean it would be easy to make a similar american list beginning with washington of whom it was said that providence made him childless that his country might call him father now however we may regret that these great men have left little or no posterity it does not occur to any one as affording any serious drawback upon their service to their nation certainly it does not occur to us that they would have been more useful had they left children to the world but rendered it no other service lord bacon says that he that hath wife and children hath given hostages to fortune for they are impediments to great enterprises either of virtue or mischief certainly the best works and of greatest merit for the public have proceeded from the unmarried or childless men which both in affection and means have married and endowed the public and this is the view generally acceptedthat the public is in such cases rather the gainer than the loser and has no right to complain since therefore every child must have a father and a mother both and neither will alone suffice why should we thus heap gratitude on men who from preference or from necessity have remained childless and yet habitually treat women as if they could render no service to their country except by giving it children if it be folly and shame as i think to belittle and decry the dignity and worth of motherhood as some are said to do it is no less folly and shame quite as great to deny the grand and patriotic service of many women who have died and left no children among their mourners platoputs into the mouth of a womanthe eloquent diotima in the banquetthat after all we are more grateful to homer and hesiod for the children of their brain than if they had left human offspring the prevention of cruelty to mothers from the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals we have now advanced to a similar society for the benefit of children when shall we have a movement for the prevention of cruelty to mothers a rhode island lady who had never taken any interest in the womansuffrage movement came to me in great indignation the other day asking if it was true that under rhode island laws a husband might by his last will bequeath his child away from its mother so that she might if the guardian chose never see it again i said that it was undoubtedly true and that such were still the laws in many states of the union but she said it is an outrage the husband may have been one of the weakest or worst men in the world he may have persecuted his wife and children he may have made the will in a moment of anger and have neglected to alter it at any rate he is dead and the mother is living the guardian whom he appoints may turn out a very malicious man and may take pleasure in torturing the mother or he may bring up the children in a way their mother thinks ruinous for them why do not all the mothers cry out against such a law i wish they would i said i have been trying a good many years to make them understand what the law is but they do not people who do not vote pay no attention to the laws until they suffer from them she went away protesting that she at least would not hold her tongue on the subject and i hope she will not the actual text of the law to which she objected is as followsevery person authorized by law to make a will except married women shall have a right to appoint by his will a guardian or guardians for his children during their minority there is not associated with this in the statute the slightest clause in favor of the mother nor anything which could limit the power of the guardian by requiring deference to her wishes although he could in case of gross neglect or abuse be removed by the court and another guardian appointed there is not a line of positive law to protect the mother now in a case of absolute wrong a single sentence of law is worth all the chivalrous courtesy this side of the middle ages it is idle to say that such laws are not executed they are executed i have had letters too agonizing to print expressing the sufferings of mothers under laws like these there lies before me a letternot from rhode islandwritten by a widowed mother who suffers daily tortures even while in possession of her child at the knowledge that it is not legally hers but held only by the temporary permission of the guardian appointed under her husbands will i beg you she says to take this will to the hilltop and urge lawmakers in our next legislature to free the state record from the shameful story that no mother can control her child unless it is born out of wedlock from the moment she says when the will was read to me i have made no effort to set it aside i wait till god reveals his plans so far as my own condition is concerned but out of my keen comprehension of this great wrong notwithstanding my submission for myself my whole soul is stirredfor my child who is a little woman for all women that the laws may be changed which subject a true woman a devoted wife a faithful mother to such mental agonies as i have endured and shall endure till i die in a later letter she says i now have his the guardians solemn promise that he will not remove her from my control to some extent my sufferings are allayed and yet never till she arrives at the age of twentyone shall i fully trust i wish that mothers who dwell in sheltered and happy homes would try to bring to their minds the condition of a mother whose possession of her only child rests upon the promise of a comparative stranger we should get beyond the meaningless cry i have all the rights i want if mothers could only remember that among these rights in most states of the union the right of a widowed mother to her child is not included by strenuous effort the law on this point has in massachusetts been gradually amended till it now stands thus the father is authorized to appoint a guardian by will but the powers of this guardian do not entitle him to take the child from the mother the guardian of a minor shall have the custody and tuition of his ward and the care and management of all his estate except that the father of the minor if living and in case of his death the mother they being respectively competent to transact their own business shall be entitled to the custody of the person of the minor and the care of his education down to the cruel words while she remains unmarried followed the word mother in the above law until that timethe mother if remarried had no claim to the custody of her child in case the guardian wished otherwise and a very painful scene once took place in a boston courtroom where children were forced away from their mother by the officers under this statute in spite of her tears and theirs and this when no sort of personal charge had been made against her this could not now happen in massachusetts but it might still happen in some other states it is true that men are almost always better than their laws but while a bad law remains on the statutebook it gives to any unscrupulous man the power to be as bad as the law footnote gen statutes ri

womenemerson society and solitude p foam and current sometimes on the beach at newport i look at the gayly dressed ladies in their phaetons and then at the foam which trembles on the breaking wave or lies palpitating in creamy masses on the beach it is as pretty as they as light as fresh as delicate as changing and no doubt the graceful foam if it thinks at all fancies that it is the chief consummate product of the ocean and that the main end of the vast currents of the mighty deep is to yield a few glittering bubbles like those at least this seems to me what many of the fair ladies think as to themselves here is a nation in which the most momentous social and political experiment ever tried by man is being worked out day by day there is something oceanlike in the way in which the great currents of life race religion temperament are here chafing with each other safe from the storms through which all monarchical countries may yet have to pass as these great currents heave there are tossed up in every wateringplace and every city in america as on an ocean beach certain pretty bubbles of foam and each spot we may suppose counts its own bubbles brighter than those of its neighbors and christens them society it is an unceasing wonder to a thoughtful person at any such resort to see the unconscious way in which fashionable society accepts the foam and ignores the currents you hear people talk of a position in society the influential circles in society as if the position they mean were not liable to be shifted in a day as if the essential influences in america were not mainly to be sought outside the world of fashion in other countries it is very different the circle of social caste whose centre you touch in london radiates to the farthest shores of the british empire the upper class controls not merely fashion but government it rules in country as well as city genius and wealth are but its tributaries wherever it is not so it is because england is so far americanized but in america the social prestige of the cities is nothing in the country it is a matter of the pavement of a threemile radius go to the farthest borders of england there are still the county families and you meet servants in livery on the other hand in a little village in northern new hampshire my friend was visited in the evening by the landlady who said that several of their most fashionable ladies had happened in and she would like to show them her guests bonnet then the different cities ignore each other the rulers of select circles in new york may find themselves nobodies in washington while a washington social passport counts for as little in new york boston and philadelphia affect to ignore both and st louis and san francisco have their own standards the utmost social prestige in america is local provincial a matter of the square inch it is as if the foam of each particular beach along the seacoast were to call itself society there is something pathetic therefore in the unwearied pains taken by ambitious women to establish a place in some little local transitory domain to bring out their daughters for exhibition on a given evening to form a circle for them to marry them well a dozen years hence the millionaires whose notice they seek may be paupers or these ladies may be dwelling in some other city where the visiting cards will bear wholly different names how idle to attempt to transport into american life the social traditions and delusions which require monarchy and primogeniture and a standing army to keep them upand which cannot always hold their own in england even with the aid of these every woman like every man has a natural desire for influence and if this instinct yearns as it often should yearn totake in more than her own family she must seek it somewhere outside i know women who bring to bear on the buildingup of a frivolous social circlefrivolous because it is not really brilliant but only showy not really gay but only boredtalent and energy enough to influence the mind and thought of the nation if only employed in some effective way who are the women of real influence in america they are the schoolteachers through whose hands each successive american generation has to pass they are those wives of public men who share their husbands labor and help mould their work they are those women who through their personal eloquence or through the press are distinctly influencing the american people in its growth the influence of such women is felt for good or for evil in every page they print every newspaper column they fill the individual women may be unworthy their posts but it is they who have got hold of the lever and gone the right way to work as american society is constituted the largest social success that can be attained here is trivial and local and you have to make believe very hard like that other imaginary marchioness to find in it any career worth mentioning that is the foam but these other women are dealing with the main currents in society one sometimes hears from some lady the remark that very few people in society believe in any movement to enlarge the rights or duties of women in a community of more marked social gradations than our own this assertion if true might be very important and even here it is worth considering because it leads the way to a little social philosophy let us for the sake of argument begin by accepting the assumption that there is an inner circle at least in our large cities which claims to be society par excellence what relation has this favored circle if favored it be to any movement relating to women it has to begin with the same relation that society has to every movement of reform the proportion of smiles and frowns bestowed from this quarter upon the womansuffrage movement for instance is about that formerly bestowed upon the antislavery agitation i see no great difference in boston for example the names contributed by society to the womansuffrage festivals are about as numerous as those which used to be contributed to the antislavery bazaars no more no less indeed they are very often the same names and it has been curious to see for nearly fifty years how radical tendencies have predominated in some of the wellknown boston families and conservative tendencies in others the traits of blood seem to outlast successive series of special reforms be this as it may it is safe to assume that as the antislavery movement prevailed with only a moderate amount of sanction from our best society the womansuffrage agitation which has at least an equal amount has no reason to be discouraged on looking farther we find that not reforms alone but often most important and established institutions exist and flourish with only incidental aid from those in society take for instance the whole public school system of our larger cities grant that out of twenty ladies in society taken at random not more than one would personally approve of womens voting it is doubtful whether even that proportion of them would personally favor the public school system so far as to submit their children or at least their girls to it yet the public schools flourish and give a better training than most private schools in spite of this inert practical resistance from those in society the natural inference would seem to be that if an institution so well established as the public schools and so generally recognized can afford to be ignored by society then certainly a wholly new reform must expect no better fate as a matter of fact i apprehend that what is called society in the sense of the more fastidious or exclusive social circle in any community exists for one sole objectthe preservation of good manners and social refinements for this purpose it is put very largely under the sway of women who have all the world over a better instinct for these important things it is true that society is apt to do even this duty very imperfectly and often tolerates and sometimes even cultivates just the rudeness and discourtesy that it is set to cure nevertheless this is its mission but so soon as it steps beyond this and attempts to claim any special weight outside the sphere of good manners it shows its weakness and must yield to stronger forces one of these stronger forces is religion which should train men and women to a far higher standard than society alone can teach this standard should be embodied theoretically in the christian church but unhappily society is too often stronger than this embodiment and turns the church itself into a mere temple of fashion other opposing forces are known as science and commonsense which is only science written in shorthand on some of these various forces all reforms are based the womansuffrage reform among them if it could really be shown that some limited social circle was opposed to this then the moral would seem to be so much the worse for the social circle it used to be thought in antislavery days that one of the most blessed results of that agitation was the education it gave to young men and women who would otherwise have merely grown up in society but were happily taken in hand by a stronger influence it is goethe who suggests when discussing hamlet in wilhelm meister that if an oak be planted in a flowerpot it will be worse in the end for the flowerpot than for the tree and to those who watch year after year the young human seedlings planted in society the main point of interest lies in the discovery which of these are likely to grow into oaks but the truth is that the very use of the word society in this sense is narrow and misleading we americans are fortunate enough to live in a larger society where no conventional position or family traditions exert an influence that is tobe in the least degree compared with the influence secured by education energy and character no matter how fastidious the social circle one is constantly struck with the limitations of its influence and with the little power exerted by its members as compared with that which may easily be wielded by tongue and pen no merely fashionable woman in new york for instance has a position sufficiently important to be called influential compared with that of a woman who can speak in public so as to command hearers or can write so as to secure readers to be at the head of a normal school or to be a professor in a college where coeducation prevails is to have a sway over the destinies of america which reduces all mere social position to a matter of cards and compliments and pages buttons the battle of the cards the great winters contest of the visitingcards recommences at the end of every autumn suspended during the summer or only renewed at newport and such thoroughbred and thoroughly sophisticated haunts it will set in with fury in the habitable regions of our cities before the snow falls now will the atmosphere of certain streets and squares be darkenedor whitenedat the appointed hour by the shower of pasteboard transmitted from dainty kidgloved hands to the cottongloved hands of john and destined through him to reach the possibly gloveless hands of some other john who stands obsequious in the doorway now will every lady after john has slammed the door drive happily on to some other door rearranging as she goes her display of cards laid as if for a game on the opposite seat of her carriage and dealt perhaps in four suitsher own cards her daughters her husbands her mr and mrs cards and who knows how many more with all this ammunition what a very mitrailleuse of good society she becomes what an accumulation of polite attentions she may discharge at any door that one wellappointed woman as she sits in her carriage represents the total visiting power of self husband daughters and possibly a son or two beside she has all their counterfeit presentments in her hands how happy she is and how happy will the others be on her return to think that dear mamma has disposed of so many dear beloved tiresome social foes that morning it will be three months at least they think before the as and the bs and the cs will have to be done again ah but who knows how soon these fatiguing letters of the alphabet rallying to the defence will come pasteboard in hand to return the onset in this contest fair ladies there are blows to take as well as blows to give in the words of the immortal webster some day on returning you will find a halfdozen cards on your own table that will undo all this mornings work and send you forth on the warpath again is it not like a campaign it is from this subtle military analogy doubtless that when gentlemen happen to quarrel in the very best society they exchange cards as preliminary to a duel and that when french journalists fight all other french journalists show their sympathy for the survivor by sending him their cards when we see therefore these heroic ladies riding forth in the social battles magnificently stern array our hearts render them the homage due to the brave when we consider how complex their military equipment has grown we fancy each of these selfdevoted mothers to be an arnold winkelried receiving in her martyrbreast the points of a dozen different cards and shouting make way for liberty for is it not securing liberty to have cleared off a dozen calls from your list and found nobody at home if this sort of thing goes on who can tell where the paper warfare shall end if ladies may leave cards for their husbands who are never seen out of wall street except when they are seen at their clubs or for their sons who never forsake their billiards or their bookswhy can they not also leave them for their ancestors or for their remotest posterity who knows but people may yet drop cards in the names of the grandchildren whom they only wish for or may reconcile hereditary feuds by interchanging pasteboard in behalf of two hostile grandparents who died half a century ago and there is another social observance in which the introduction of the card system may yet be destined to save much laborthe attendance on fashionable churches already it is said a family may sometimes reconcile devout observance with a late breakfast by stationing the family carriage near the churchdoorempty really it would not be a much emptier observance to send the cards alone by the footman and doubtless in the progress of civilization we shall yet reach that point it will have many advantages the effete of society as some cruel satirist has called them may then send their orisons on pasteboard to as many different shrines as they approve thus insuring their souls as it were at several different offices church architecture may be simplified for it will require nothing but a cardbasket the clergyman will celebrate his solemn ritual and will then look in that convenient receptacle for the names of his fellowworshippers as a fine lady after her reception looks over the cards her footman hands her to know which of her dear friends she has been welcoming religion as well as social proprieties will glide smoothly over a surface of glazed pasteboard and it will be only very humble christians indeed who will do their worshipping in person and will hold to the wornout and obsolete practice of no cards some workingwomen it is almost a stereotyped remark that the women of the more fashionable and worldly class in america are indolent idle incapable and live feeble and lazy lives it has always seemed to me that on the contrary they are compelled by the very circumstances of their situation to lead very laborious lives requiring great strength and energy whether many of their pursuits are frivolous is a different question but that they are arduous i do not see how any one can doubt ithink it can be easily shown that the common charges against american fashionable women do not hold against the class i describe there is for instance the charge of evading the cares of housekeeping and of preferring a boardinghouse or hotel but no woman with high aims in the world of fashion can afford to relieve herself from household cares in this way except as an exceptional or occasional thing she must keep house in order to have entertainments to form a circle to secure a position the law of give and take is as absolute in society as in business and the very first essential to social position in our larger cities is a household and a hospitality of ones own it is far more practicable for a family of high rank in england to live temporarily in lodgings in london than for any family with social aspirations to do the same in new york the married woman who seeks a position in the world of society must therefore keep house and with housekeeping there comes at once to the american woman a world of care far beyond that of her european sisters abroad everything in domestic life is systematized and services of any grade up to that of housekeeper or steward can be secured for money and for a moderate amount of that the mere amount of money might not trouble the american woman but where to get the service such a thing as a trained housekeeper who can undertake at any salary to take the work off the shoulders of the lady of the housesuch a thing america hardly affords without this the multiplication of servants only increaseth sorrow the servants themselves are often but an undisciplined mob and the lady of the house is like a general attempting to drill his whole command personally without the aid of a staffofficer or so much as a sergeant for an occasional grand entertainment she can perhaps import a special force some fashionable sexton can arrange her invitations and some genteel caterer her supper but for the daily routine of the householdguests children doorbell equipagethere is one vast constant toil every day and the woman who would have these things done well must give her own orders and discipline her own retinue the husband may have no business his wealth may supersede the necessity of all toil beyond daily billiards but for the wife wealth means business and the more complete the social triumph the more overwhelming the daily toil for instance i know a fair woman in an atlantic city who is at the head of a household including six children and nine servants the whole domestic management is placed absolutely in her hands she engages or dismisses every person employed incurs every expense makes every purchase and keeps all the accounts her husband only ordering the fuel directing the affairs of the stable and drawing checks for the bills every hour of her morning is systematically appropriated to these things among other things she has to provide for nine meals a day in diningroom kitchen and nursery three each then she has to plan her social duties and to drive out exquisitely dressed to make her calls then there are constantly dinnerparties and evening entertainments she reads a little and takes lessons in one or two languages meanwhile her husband has for daily occupation his books his club and the abovementioned light and easy share in the cares of the household many men in his position do not even keep an account of personal expenditures there is nothing exceptional in this ladys case except that the work may be better done than usual the husband could not well contribute more than his present share without hurting domestic discipline nor does the wife do all this from pleasure but in a manner from necessity it is the condition of her social position to change it she must withdraw herself from her social world a few improvements such as family hotels are doing something to relieve this class to whom luxury means labor the great undercurrent which is sweeping us all toward some form of associated life is as obvious in this new improvement in housekeeping as in coöperative stores or tradesunions but it will nevertheless be long before the women of society in america can be anything but a hardworking class the question is not whether such a life as i have described is the ideal life my point is that it is at any rate a life demanding far more of energy and toil at least in america than the men of the same class are called upon to exhibit there is growing up a class of men of leisure in america but there are no women of leisure in the same circle they hold their social position on condition of an establishment and an establishment makes them workingwomen one result is the constant exodus of this class to europe where domestic life is just now easier another consequence is that you hear woman suffrage denounced by women of this class not on the ground that it involves any harder work than they already do but on the ground that they have work enough already and will not bear the suggestion of any more the empire of manners i was present at a lively discourse administered by a young lady just from europe to a veteran politician it is of very little consequence she said what kind of men you send out as foreign ministers the thing of real importance is that they should have the right kind of wives any man can sign a treaty i suppose if you tell him what kind of treaty it must be but all his social relations with the nations to which you send him will depend on his wife there was some truth certainly in this audacious conclusion it reminded me of the saying of a modern thinker the only empire freely conceded to women is that of mannersbut it is worth all the rest put together every one instinctively feels that the graces and amenities of life must be largely under the direction of women the factthat this feeling has been carried too far and has led to the dwarfing of womens intellect must not lead to a rejection of this important social sphere it is too strong a power to be ignored george eliot says well that the commonest man who has his ounce of sense and feeling is conscious of the difference between a lovely delicate woman and a coarse one even a dog feels a difference in their presence at a summer resort for instance one sees women who may be intellectually very ignorant and narrow yet whose mere manners give them a social power which the highest intellects might envy to lend joy and grace to all ones little world of friendship to make ones house a place which every guest enters with eagerness and leaves with reluctance to lend encouragement to the timid and ease to the awkward to repress violence restrain egotism and make even controversy courteousthese belong to the empire of woman it is a sphere so important and so beautiful that even courage and selfdevotion seem not quite enough without the addition of this supremest charm this courtesy is so far from implying falsehood that its very best basis is perfect simplicity given a naturally sensitive organization a loving spirit and the early influence of a refined home and the foundation of fine manners is secured a person so favored may be reared in a log hut and may pass easily into a palace the few needful conventionalities are so readily acquired but i think it is a mistake to tell children as we sometimes do that simplicity and a kind heart are absolutely all that are needful in the way of manners there are persons in whom simplicity and kindness are inborn and who yet never attain to good manners for want of refined perceptions and it is astonishing how much refinement alone can do even if it be not very genuine or very full of heart to smooth the paths and make social life attractive all the acute observers have recognized the difference between the highest standard which is natures and that next to the highest which is arts george eliot speaks of that fine polish which is the expensive substitute for simplicity and tennyson says of mannerskind natures are the best those next to best that fit us like a nature secondhand which are indeed the manners of the great in our own national history we have learned to recognize that the personal demeanor of women may be a social and political force the slavepower owed much of its prolonged control at washington and the larger part of its favor in europe to the fact that the manners of southern women had been more sedulously trained than those of northern women even at this moment one may see at any wateringplace that the relative social influence of different cities does not depend upon the intellectual training of their women so much as on the manners and even if this is very unreasonable the remedy would seem to be not to go about lecturing on the intrinsic superiority of the muses to the graces but to pay due homage at all the shrines it is a great deal to ask of reformers especially that they should be ornamental as well as useful and i would by no means indorse the views of a lady who once told me that she was ready to adopt the most radical views of the womenreformers if she could see one welldressed woman who accepted them the place where we should draw the line between independence and deference between essentials and nonessentials between great ideas and little courtesies will probably never be determinedexcept by actual examples yet it is safe to fall back on miss edgeworths maxim in helen that every one who makes goodness disagreeable commits high treason against virtue and it is not a pleasant result of our good deeds that others should be immediately driven into bad deeds by the burning desire to be unlike us girlsterousness they tell the story of a little boy a young scion of the house of beecher that on being rebuked for some noisy proceeding in which his little sister had also shared he claimed that she also should be included in the indictment if a boy makes too much noise he said you tell him he mustnt be boisterous well then when a girl makes just as much noise you ought to tell her not to be so girlsterous i think that we should accept with a sense of gratitude this addition to the language it supplies a name for a special phase of feminine demeanor inevitably brought out of modern womanhood any transitional state of society develops some evil with the good good results are unquestionably proceeding from the greater freedom now allowed to women the drawback is that we are developing here and now more of girlsterousness than is apt to be seen in less enlightened countries the more complete the subjection of woman the more subdued in every sense she is the typical woman of savage life is at least in youth gentle shy retiring timid a bedouin woman is modest and humble an indian girl has a voice gentle and low the utmost stretch of the imagination cannot picture either of them as girlsterous that perilous quality can only come as woman is educated selfrespecting emancipated girlsterousness is the excess attendant on that virtue the shadow which accompanies that light it is more visible in england than in france in america than in englandit is to be observed that if a girl wishes to be noisy she can be as noisy as anybody her noise if less clamorous is more shrill and penetrating the shrieks of schoolgirls playing in the yard at recesstime seem to drown the voices of the boys as you enter an evening party it is the womens tones you hear most conspicuously there is no defect in the organ but at least an adequate vigor in travelling by rail when sitting near some rather underbred party of youths and damsels i have commonly noticed that the girls were the noisiest the young men appeared more regardful of public opinion and looked round with solicitude lest they should attract too much attention it is girlsterousness that dashes straight on regardless of all observers of course reformers exhibit their full share of this undesirable quality where the emancipation of women is much discussed in any circle some young girls will put it in practice gracefully and with dignity others rudely yet even the rudeness may be but a temporary phase and at last end well when women were being first trained as physicians years ago i remember a young girl who came from a southern state to a northern city and attended the medical lectures having secured her lecturetickets she also bought seasontickets to the theatre and to the pistolgallery laid in a box of cigars and began her professional training if she meant it as a satire on the pursuits of the young gentlemen around her it was not without point but it was i suppose a clear case of girlsterousness and i dare say that she sowed her wild oats much more innocently than many of her male contemporaries and that she has long since become a sedate matron but i certainly cannot commend her as a model yet i must resolutely deny that any sort of hoydenishness or indecorum is an especial characteristic of radicals or even provincials as a class some of the fine ladies who would be most horrified at the girlsterousness of this young maiden would themselves smoke their cigarettes in much worse company morally speaking than she ever tolerated and so far as manners are concerned i am bound to say that the worst cases of rudeness and illbreeding that have ever come to my knowledge have not occurred in the rural districts or among the lower ten thousand but in those circles of america where the whole aim in life might seem to be the cultivation of its elegances and what confirms me in the fear that the most profound and serious types of this disease are not to be found in the wildcat regions is the fact that so much of it is transplanted to europe among those who have the money to travel it is there described broadly as americanism and so surely as any peculiarly shrill group is heard coming through a european picturegallery it is straightway classed by all observers as belonging to the great republic if the observers are enamoured at sight with the beauty of the young ladies of the party they excuse the voices strange or wild or madly gay they call it only pretty fannys way but other observers are more apt to call it only columbias way and if they had ever heard the word girlsterousness they would use that too emerson says a gentleman makes no noise a lady is serene if we americans often violate this perfect maxim of good manners it is something that america has at least furnished the maxim and between emerson and girlsterousness our courteous philosopher may yet carry the day are women natural aristocrats a clergymans wife in england has lately set on foot a reform movement in respect to dress and like many english reformers she aims chiefly to elevate the morals and manners of the lower classes without much reference to her own social equals she proposes that no servant under pain of dismissal shall wear flowers feathers brooches buckles or clasps earrings lockets neckribbons velvets kid gloves parasols sashes jackets or trimming of any kind on dresses and above all no crinoline no pads to be worn or frisettes or chignons or hairribbons the dress is to be gored and made just to touch the ground and the hair to be drawn closely to the head under a round white cap without trimming of any kind the same system of dress is recommended for sundayschool girls schoolmistresses churchsingers and the lower orders generally the remark is obvious that in this country such a course of discipline would involve the mistress not the maid in the pain of dismissal the american clergyman and clergymans wife who should even recommend such a costume to a schoolmistress churchsinger or sundayschool girlto say nothing of the rest of the lower orderswould soon find themselves without teachers without pupils without a choir and probably without a parish it is a comfort to think that even in older countries there is less and less of this impertinent interference the costume of different ranks is being more and more assimilated and the incidental episode of a few liveries in our cities is not enough to interfere with the general current never yet to my knowledge have i seen even a livery worn by a white native american and to restrain the sunday bonnets of her handmaidens what lady has attempted this is as it should be the sunday bonnet of the irish damsel is only the symbol of a very proper effort to obtain her share of all social advantages long may those ribbons wave meanwhile i think the fact that it is easier for the gentleman of the house to control the dress of his groom than for the lady to dictate that of her waitingmaidthis must count against the theory that it is women who are the natural aristocratswomen are no doubt more sensitive than men upon matters of taste and breeding this is partly from a greater average fineness of natural perception and partly because their more secluded lives give them less of miscellaneous contact with the world if maud muller and her husband had gone to board at the same boardinghouse with the judge and his wife that lady might have held aloof from the rustic bride simply from inexperience in life and not knowing just how to approach her but the judge who might have been talking politics or real estate with the young farmer on the doorsteps that morning would certainly find it easier to deal with him as a man and a brother at the dinnertable from these different causes women get the credit or discredit of being more aristocratic than men are so that in england the tory supporters of female suffrage base it on the ground that these new voters at least will be conservative but on the other hand it is women even more than men who are attracted by those strong qualities of personal character which are always the antidote to aristocracy no bold revolutionist ever defied the established conventionalisms of his times without drawing his strongest support from women poet and novelist love to depict the princess as won by the outlaw the gypsy the peasant women have a way of turning from the insipidities and proprieties of life to the wooer who has the stronger hand from the silken darnley to the rude bothwell this impulse is the natural corrective to the aristocratic instincts of womanhood and though men feel it less it is still even among them one of the supports of republican institutions we need to keep always balanced between the two influences of refined culture and of native force the patrician class wherever there is one is pretty sure to be the more refined the plebeian class the more energetic that woman is able to appreciate both elements is proof that she is quite capable of doing her share in social and political life this english clergymans wife who devotes her soul to the trimmings and gored skirts of the lower orders is no more entitled to represent her sex than are those ladies who give their whole attention to the novel and intricate bonnets advertised this season on broadway mrs blanks daughters mrs blank of far westlet us not draw her from the sacred privacy of woman by giving the name or place too preciselyhas an insurmountable objection to womans voting so the newspapers say and this objection is that she does not wish her daughters to encounter disreputable characters at the polls it is a laudable desire to keep ones daughters from the slightest contact with such persons but how does mrs blank precisely mean to accomplish this will she shut up the maidens in a harem when they go out will she send messengers through the streets to bid people hide their faces as when an oriental queen is passing will she send them travelling on camels veiled by yashmaks will she prohibit them from being so much as seen by a man except when a physician must be called for their ailments and miss blank puts her arm through a curtain in order that he may feel her pulse and know no more who is mrs blank and how does she bring up her daughters does she send them to the postoffice if so they may wait a halfhour at a time for the mail to open and be elbowed by the most disreputable characters waiting at their side if it does the young ladies no harm to encounter this for the sake of getting their letters out will it harm them to do it in order to get their ballots in if they go to hear a concert they may be kept half an hour at the door elbowed by saint and sinner indiscriminately if they go to washington to the presidents inauguration they may stand two hours with mary magdalen on one side of them and judas iscariot on the other if this contact is rendered harmless by the fact that they are receiving political information will it hurt them to stay five minutes longer in order to act upon the knowledge they have received this is on the supposition that the household of blank are plain practical women unversed in the vanities of the world if they belong to fashionable circles how much harder to keep them wholly clear of disreputable contact should they for instance visit newport they may possibly be seen at the casino looking very happy as they revolve rapidly in the arms of some very disreputable characters they will be seen in the surf attired in the most scanty and clinging drapery and kindly aided to preserve their balance by the devoted attentions of the same companions mrs blank meanwhile will look complacently on with the other matrons they are not supposed to know the current reputation of those whom their daughters meet in society and so long as there is no actual harm done why should they care very well but why then should they care if they encounter those same disreputable characters when they go to drop a ballot in the ballotbox it will be a more guarded and distant meeting it is not usual to dance rounddances at the wardroom so far as i know or to bathe in clinging drapery at that rather dry and dusty resort if such very close intimacies are all right under the gaslight or at the beach why should there be poison in merely passing near a disreputable character at the city hall on the whole the prospects of mrs blank are not encouraging should she consult a physician for her daughters he may be secretly or openly disreputable should she call in a clergyman he may though a bishop have carnal rather than spiritual eyes if miss blank be caught in a shower she may take refuge under the umbrella of an undesirable acquaintance should she fall on the ice the woman who helps to raise her may have sinned there is not a spot in any known land where a woman can live in absolute seclusion from all contact with evil should the misses blank even turn roman catholics and take to a convent their very confessor may not be a genuine saint and they may be glad to fleefor refuge to the busy buying selling dancing voting world outside no mrs blanks prayers for absolute protection will never be answered in respect to her daughters why not then find a better model for prayer in that made by jesus for his disciples i pray thee not that thou shouldst take them out of the world but that thou shouldst keep them from the evil a woman was made for something nobler in the world mrs blank than to be a fragile toy to be put behind a glass case and protected from contact it is not her mission to be hidden away from all lifes evil but bravely to work that the world may be reformed the european plan every mishap among american women brings out renewed suggestions of what may be called the european plan in the training of young girlsthe plan that is of extreme seclusion and helplessness it is usually forgotten in these suggestions that not much protection is really given anywhere to this particular class as a whole everywhere in europe the restrictions are of caste not of sex even in turkey travellers tell us women of the humbler vocations are not much secluded it is not the object of the european plan in any form to protect the virtue of young women as such but only of young ladies and the protection is pretty effectually limited to that order among the portuguese in the island of fayal i found it to be the ambition of each humble family to bring up one daughter in a sort of ladylike seclusion she never went into the street alone or without a hood which was equivalent to a veil she was taught indoor industries only she was constantly under the eye of her mother but in order that one daughter might be thus protected all the other daughters were allowed to go alone day or evening bareheaded or barefooted by the loneliest mountainpaths to bring oranges or firewood or whatever their work may beheedless of protection the safeguard was for a class the average exposure of young womanhood was far greater than with us so in london while you rarely see a young lady alone in the streets the housemaid is sent on errands at any hour of the evening with a freedom at which our city domestics would quite rebel and one has to stay but a short time in paris to see how entirely limited to a class is the alleged restraint under which young french girls are said to be kept again it is to be remembered that the whole european plan so far as it is applied on the continent of europe is a plan based upon utter distrust and suspicion not only as to chastity but as to all other virtues it is applied among the higher classes almost as consistently to boys as to girls in every school under church auspices it is the french theory that boys are never to be left unwatched for a moment and it is as steadily assumed that girls will be untruthful if left to themselves as that they will do every other wrong this to the anglosaxon race seems very demoralizing suspicion said sir philip sidney is the way to lose that which we fear to lose readers of the bronte novels will remember the disgust of the english pupils and teachers in french schools at the constant espionage around them and i have more than once heard young girls who had been trained at such institutions say that it was a wonder if they had any truthfulness left so invariable was the assumption that it was the nature of young girls to lie i cannot imagine anything less likely to create upright and noble character in man or woman than the systematic application of the european plan and that it produces just the results that might be feared the whole tone of european literature proves foreigners no doubt do habitual injustice to the morality of french households but it is impossible that fiction can utterly misrepresent the community which produces and reads it when one thinks of the utter lightness of tone with which breaches both of truth and chastity are treated even in the better class of french novels and plays it seems absurd to deny the correctness of the picture besides it is not merely a question of plays and novels consider for instance the contempt with which taine treats thackeray for representing the mother of pendennis as suffering agonies when she thinks that her son has seduced a young girl a social inferior thackeray is not really considered a model of elevated tone as to such matters among english writers but the frenchman is simply amazed that the englishman should describe even the saintliest of mothers as attaching so much weight to such a small affair an able newspaper writer quoted with apparent approval by the boston daily advertiser praises the supposed foreign method for the habit of dependence and deference that it produces and because it gives to a young man a wife whose habit of deference is established but it must be remembered that where this theory is established the habit of deference is logically carried much farther than mere conjugal convenience would take it its natural outcome is the authority of the priest not of the husband that domination of the women of france by the priesthood which forms even now the chief peril of the republicwhich is the strength of legitimism and imperialism and all other conspiracies against the liberty of the french peopleis only the visible and inevitable result of this dangerous docility one thing is certain that the best preparation for freedom is freedom and that no young girls are so poorly prepared for american life as those whose early years are passed in europe some of the worst imprudences the most unmaidenly and offensive actions that i have ever heard of in decent society have been on the part of young women educated abroad who have been launched into american life without its early traininghave been treated as children until they suddenly awakened to the freedom of women on the other hand i remember with pleasure that a cultivated french mother whose daughters fine qualities were the best seal of her motherhood once told me that the models she hadchosen in her daughters training were certain families of american young ladies of whom she had through peculiar circumstances seen much in paris one of the most amusing letters ever quoted in any book is that given in curzons monasteries of the levant as the production of a turkish sultana who had just learned english it is as followsnote from adile sultana the betrothed of abbas pasha to her armenian commissioner constantinople my noble friendhere are the featherses sent my soul my noble friend are there no other featherses leaved in the shop besides these featherses and these featherses remains and these featherses are ukly they are very dear who buyses dheses and my noble friend we want a noat from yourself those you brought last tim those you sees were very beautiful we had searched my soul i want featherses again of those featherses in kalada there is plenty of feather whatever bees i only want beautiful featherses i want featherses of every desolation tomorrow signed you know who the first steps in culture do not then it seems remove from the feminine soul the love of pretty things nor do the later steps wholly extinguish it for did not grace greenwood hear the learned mary somerville conferring with the wise harriet martineau as to whether a certain dress should be dyed to match a certain shawl well why not because women learn the use of the quill are they to ignore featherses because they learn science must they unlearn the arts and above all the art of being beautiful if men have lost it they have reason to regret the loss let women hold to it while yet within their reach mrs rachel rowland of new bedford much prized and trusted as a public speaker among friends and a model of taste and quiet beauty in costume delighted the young girls at a newport yearly meeting a few years since by boldly declaring that she thought god meant women to make the world beautiful as much as flowers and butterflies and that there was no sin in tasteful dress but only in devoting to it too much money or too much time it is a blessed doctrine the utmost extremes of dress the love of colors of fabrics of jewels of featherses are after all but an effort after the beautiful the reason why the beautiful is not always the result is because so many women are ignorant or merely imitative they have no sense of fitness the short wear what belongs to the tall and brunettes sacrifice their natural beauty to look like blondes or they have no adaptation and even an emancipated woman may show a disregard for appropriateness as where a fine lady sweeps the streets or a fair orator the platform with a silken or velvet train which accords only with a carpet as luxurious as itself what is inappropriate is never beautiful what is merely in the fashion is never beautiful but who does not know some woman whose taste and training are so perfect that fashion becomes to her a means of grace instead of a despot and the worst excrescence that can be prescribeda chignon a hoop a panieris softened into something so becoming that even the parisian bondage seems but a chain of roses in such hands even featherses become a fine art not a matter of vanity are women so much more vain than men no doubt they talk more about their dress for there is much more to talk about yet did you never hear the men of fashion discuss boots and hats and the liveries of grooms a good friend of mine a shoemaker who supplies very high heels for a great many pretty feet on fifth avenue in new york declares that women are not so vain in that direction as men a man who thinks he has a handsome foot quoth our fashionable crispin is apt to give us more trouble than any lady among our customers i have noticed this for twenty years the testimony is consolingto women and this naturally suggests the question what is to be the future of masculine costume is the present formlessness and gracelessness and monotony of hue to last forever as suited to the rough needs of a workaday world it is to be remembered that the difference in this respect between the dress of the sexes is a very recent thing till within a century or so men dressed as picturesquely as women and paid as minute attention to their costume even the fashions in armor varied as extensively as the fashions in gowns one of henry iiis courtiers sir j arundel had fiftytwo complete suits of cloth of gold no satin no velvet was too elegant for those who sat to copley for their pictures in puritan days the laws could hardly be made severe enough to prevent men from wearing silverlace and broad bonelace and shoulderbands of undue width and double ruffs and immoderate great breeches what seemed to the cavaliers the extreme of stupid sobriety in dress would pass now for the most fantastic array fancy samuel pepys going to a wedding of today in his new colored silk suit and coat trimmed with gold buttons and gold broad lace round his hands very rich and fine it would give to the ceremony the aspect of a fancy ball yet how much prettier a sight is a fancy ball than the ordinary entertainment of the period at intervals the rigor of masculine costume is a little relaxed velvets resume their picturesque sway and instead of the customary suit of solemn black gentlemen even appear in blue and gold editions at evening parties let us hope that good sense and taste may yet meet each other for both sexes that men may borrow for their dress some womanly taste women some masculine sense and society may again witness a graceful and appropriate costume without being too much absorbed in feathersesvi study and work movet me ingens scientiarum admiratio seu legis communis aequitas ut in nostro sexu rarum non esse feram id quod omnium votis dignissimum est nam cum sapientia

most worthy the aspirations of all for since wisdom is so great an ornament of the human race that it should of right be extended so far as practicable to each and every one i have not perceived why this fairest of ornaments should not be appropriate for the maiden to whom we permit all diligence in the decoration and adornment of herself experiments why is it that whenever anything is done for women in the way of education it is called an experimentsomething that is to be long considered stoutly opposed grudgingly yielded and dubiously watched while if the same thing is done for men its desirableness is assumed as a matter of course and the thing is done thus when harvard college was founded it was not regarded as an experiment but as an institution the general court in agreed to give l towards a schoale or colledge and the affair was settled every subsequent step in the expanding of educational opportunities for young men has gone in the same way but when there seems a chance of extending however irregularly some of the same collegiate advantages to women i observe that respectable newspapers in all good faith are apt to speak of the measure as an experiment it seems to me no more of an experiment than when a boy who has usually eaten up his whole apple becomes a little touched with a sense of justice and finally decides to offer his sister the smaller half if he has ever regarded that offer as an experiment the first actual trial will put the result into the list of certainties and it will become an axiom in his mind that girls like apples whatever may be said about the position of women in law and society it is clear that their educational disadvantages have been a prolonged disgrace to the other sex and one for which women themselves are in no way accountable when françoise de saintonges in the sixteenth century wished to establish girls schools in france she was hooted in the streets and her father called together four doctors of law to decide whether she was possessed of a devil in planning to teach womenpour sassurer quinstruire des femmes nétait pas un oeuvre du démon from that day to this we have seen women almost always more ready to be taught than was any one else to teach them talk as you please about their wishing or not wishing to vote they have certainly wished for instruction and have had it doled out to them almost as grudgingly as if it were the ballot itself consider the educational history of massachusetts for instance the wife of president john adams was born in and she says of her youth that female education in the best families went no farther than writing and arithmetic barry tells us in his history of massachusetts that the public education was first provided for boys only but light soon broke in and girls were allowed to attend the public schools two hours a day it appears from president quincys municipal history of boston that from girls were there admitted to such schools but during the summer months only when there were not boys enough to fill themfrom april to october of each year this lasted until when boston became a city four years after an attempt was made to establish a high school for girls which was not however to teach latin and greek it had in the words of the school committee of an alarming success and the school was abolished after eighteen months trial because the girls crowded into it and as mr quincy with exquisite simplicity records not one voluntarily quitted it and there was no reason to suppose that any one admitted to the school would voluntarily quit for the whole three years except in case of marriage how amusing seems it now to read of such an experiment as this abandoned only because of its overwhelming success how absurd now seem the discussions of a few years agothe doubts whether young women really desired higher education whether they were capable of it whether their health would bear it whether their parents would permit it an address i gave before the social science association on this subject at boston may now seems to me such a collection of platitudes that i hardly see how i dared come before an intelligent audience with such needless reasonings it is as if i had soberly labored to prove that two and two make four or that ginger is hot i the mouth yet the subsequent discussion in that meeting showed that around even these harmless and commonplace propositions the battle of debate could rage hot and it really seemed as if even to teach women the alphabet ought still to be mentioned as a promising experiment now with the successes before us of so many colleges with the spectacle at cambridge of young women actually reading plato at sight with professor goodwinit surely seems as if the higher education ofwomen might be considered quite beyond the stage of experiment and might henceforth be provided for in the same commonsense and matterofcourse way which we provide for the education of young men and if this point is already reached in education how long before it will also be reached in political life and womens voting be viewed as a matter of course and a thing no longer experimental footnote vol iii footnote page intellectual cinderellas when some thirty years ago the extraordinary young mathematician truman henry safford first attracted the attention of new england by his rare powers i well remember the pains that were taken to place him under instruction by the ablest harvard professors the greater his abilities the more needful that he should have careful and symmetrical training the men of science did not say stand off let him alone let him strive patiently until he has achieved something positively valuable and he may be sure of prompt and generous recognitionwhen he is fifty years old if such a course would have been mistaken and ungenerous if applied to professor safford why is it not something to be regretted that it was applied to mrs somerville in her case the mischief was done she was happily strong enough to bear it but as the english critics say we never shall know what science has lost by it we can do nothing for her now but we could do something for future women like her by pointing this obvious moral for their benefit instead of being content with a mere tardy recognition of success after a woman has expended half a century in struggle it is commonly considered to be a step forward in civilization that whereas ancient and barbarous nations exposed children to special hardships in order to kill off the weak and toughen the strong modern nations aim to rear all alike carefully without either sacrificing or enfeebling if we apply this to muscle why not to mind and if to mens minds why not to womens why use for mens intellects which are claimed to be stronger the forcing processoffering for instance many thousand dollars a year in gratuities at our colleges that young men may be induced to come and learnand only withhold assistance from the weaker minds of women a little schoolgirl once told me that she did not object to her teachers showing partiality but thought she ought to show partiality to all alike if all our university systems are wrong and the proper diet for mathematical genius consists of fifty years snubbing let us employ it by all means but let it be applied to both sexes that it is the duty of women even under disadvantageous circumstances to prove their purpose by labor to verify their credentials is true enough but this moral is only part of the moral of mrs somervilles book and is cruelly incomplete without the other half what a garden of roses was mrs somervilles life according to some comfortable critics all that for which too many women nowadays are content to sit and whine or fitfully and carelessly struggle came naturally and quietly to mrs somerville and the reason was that she never asked for anything until she had earned it or rather she never asked at all but was content to earn naturally and quietly you might as well say that garrison fought slavery quietly or that frederick douglasss escape came to him naturally turn to the book itself and see with what strong though never actually bitter feeling the author looks back upon her hard struggle i was intensely ambitious to excel in something for i felt in my own breast that women were capable of taking a higher place in creation than that assigned them in my early days which was very low p nor should i have had courage to ask any of them a question for i should have been laughed at i was often very sad and forlorn not a hand held out to help me p my father came home for a short time and somehow or other finding out what i was about said to my mother peg we must put a stop to this or we shall have mary in a straitjacket one of these days p i continued my mathematical and other pursuits but under great disadvantages for although my husband did not prevent me from studying i met with no sympathy whatever from him as he had a very low opinion of the capacity of my sex and had neither knowledge of nor interest in science of any kind p i was considered eccentric and foolish and my conduct was highly disapproved of by many especially by some members of my own family p a man can always command his time under the plea of business a woman is not allowed any such excuse p and so on at last in mrs somerville being then fiftyoneher work on the mechanism of the heavens appeared then came universal recognition generous if not prompt a tardy acknowledgment our relations she says and others who had so severely criticised and ridiculed me astonished at my success were now loud in my praise no doubt so were probably cinderellas sisters loud in her praise when the prince at last took her from the chimneycorner and married her they had kept for themselves to be sure as long as they could the delights and opportunities of life while she had taken the place assigned her in her early dayswhich was very low as mrs somerville says but for all that they were very kind to her in the days of her prosperity and no doubt packed their little trunks and came to visit their dear sister at the palace as often as she could wish and doubtless the fairyland monthly of that day when it came to review cinderellas personal recollections pointed out that as soon as that distinguished lady had achievedsomething positively valuable she received prompt and generous recognition footnote page cupidandpsychology the learned master of trinity college cambridge england is frequently facetious and his jokes are quoted with the deference due to the chief officer of the chief college of that great university now it is known that the cambridge colleges and trinity college in particular are doing a great deal for the instruction of women the young women of girton college and newnham collegeboth of these being institutions for their benefit in or near cambridgenot only enjoy the instruction of the university but they share it under a guaranty that it shall be of the best quality because they attend in many cases the very same lectures with the young men where this is not done they sometimes use the vacant lecturerooms of the college and it was in connection with an application for this privilege that the master of trinity college made a celebrated joke when told that the lectureroom was needed for a class of young women in psychology he said psychology what kind of psychology cupidandpsychology i suppose cupidandpsychology is after all not so bad a department of instruction it may be taken as a good enough symbol of that mingling of head and heart which is the best result of all training one of the worst evils of the separate education of the sexes has been the easy assumption that men were to become all head and women all heart it was to correct the evils of this that ben jonson proposed for his ideal woman a learned and a manly soul it was an implied recognition of it from the other side when the great masculine intellect goethe held up as a guiding force in his faust the eternal womanly das ewige weibliche after all each sex must teach the other and impart to the other it will never do to have all the brains poured into one human being and christened man and all the affections decanted into another and labelled woman nature herself rejects this theory darwin himself the interpreter of nature shows that there is a perpetual effort going on by unseen forces to equalize the sexes since sons often inherit from the mother and daughters from the father and we all take pleasure in discovering in the noblest of each sex something of the qualities of the otherthe tender affections in great men the imperial intellect in great women on the whole there is no harm but rather good in the new science of cupidandpsychology there are combinations for which no single word can suffice the phrase belongs to the same class with lowells witty denunciation of a certain tiresome letterwriter as being not his incubus but his penandinkubus it is as well to admit it first as last cupidandpsychology will be taught wherever young men and women study together not in the direct and simple form of mutual lovemaking perhaps for they tell the visitor at universities which admit both sexes that the young men and maidens do not fall in love with each other but are apt to seek their mates elsewhere the new science has a wider bearing and suggests that the brain is incomplete after all without the affections and so are the affections without the brain a certain professorship at harvard university which the rev dr francis g peabody now fills and which phillips brooks was once invited to fill was founded by a woman miss plummer and the name proposed by her for it was a professorship of the heart though they after all called it only a professorship of christian morals we need the heart in our colleges it seems even if we only get it under the ingenious title of cupidandpsychology selfsupporting wives for one i have never been fascinated by the style of domestic paradise that english novels depicthalf a dozen unmarried daughters round the family hearth all assiduously doing worstedwork and petting their papa i believe a sufficiency of employment to be the only normal and healthy condition for a human being and where there is not work enough to employ the full energies of all at home it seems as proper for young women as for young birds to leave the parental nest if this additional work is done for money very well it is the conscious dignity of selfsupport that removes the traditional curse from labor and woman has a right to claim her share in that dignified position yet i cannot agree on the other hand with those who maintain that the true woman should be selfsupporting even in marriage womans part of the family taskthe care of home and childrenis just as essential to building up the family fortunes as the very different toil of the outdoor partner for young married women to undertake any more direct aid to the family income is in most cases utterly undesirable and is asking of themselves a great deal too much and this is not because they are to be encouraged in indolence but because they already in a normal condition of things have their hands full as on this point i may differ from some of my readers let me explain precisely what i mean as i write there are at work in another part of the house two paperhangers a man and his wife each fortyfive or fiftyyears of age their children are grown up and some of them married they have a daughter at home who is old enough to do the housework and leave the mother free there is no way of organizing the labors of this household better than this the married pair toil together during the day and go home together to their evening rest a happier couple i never saw it is a delight to see them cheerily at work together cutting pasting hanging their life seems like a prolonged industrial picnic and if i had the illluck to own as many palaces as an english duke i should keep them permanently occupied in putting fresh papers on the walls but the merit of this employment for the woman is that it interferes with no other duty were she a young mother with little children and obliged by her paperhanging to neglect them or to leave them at a daynursery or to overwork herself by combining too many cares then the sight of her would be very sad so sacred a thing is motherhood so paramount and absorbing the duty of a mother to her child that in a true state of society i think she should be utterly free from all other dutieseven if possible from the ordinary cares of housekeeping if she has spare health and strength to do these other things as pleasures very well but she should be relieved from them as duties and as to the need of selfsupport i can hardly conceive of an instance where it can be to the mother of young children anything but a disaster as we all know this calamity often occurs i have seen it among the factory operatives at the north and among the negro women in the cottonfields at the south in both cases it is a tragedy and the bodies and brains of mother and children alike suffer that the mother should bear and tend and nurture while the father supports and protectsthis is the true division does this bear in any way upon suffrage not at all the mother can inform herself upon public questions in the intervals of her cares as the father among his and the baby in the cradle is a perpetual appeal to her as to him that the institutions under which that baby dwells may be kept pure one of the most devoted young mothers i ever knewthe younger sister of margaret fuller ossolimade it a rule no matter how much her children absorbed her to read books or newspapers for an hour every day in order she said that she should be more to them than a mere source of physical nurture and that her mind should be kept fresh and alive for them but to demand in addition that such a mother should earn money for them is to ask too much and there is many a tombstone in new england which if it told the truth would tell what comes of such an effort thorough the hopeless defect of women in all practical matters said a shrewd merchant the other day is that it is impossible to make them thorough it was a shallow remark and so i told him women are thorough in the things which they have been expected to regard as their spherein their housekeeping and their dress and their social observances there is nothing more thorough on earth than the way housework is done in a genuine new england household there is an exquisite thoroughness in the way a milliners or a dressmakers work is donea work such as clumsy man cannot rival and can hardly estimate no general plans his campaigns or marshals his armies better than some women of societythe late mrs paran stevens for instancemanage the circles of which they are the centre day and night winter and summer at city or wateringplace year in and year out such a woman keeps open house for her gay world she has a perpetual series of guests who must be fed luxuriously and amused profusely she talks to them in three or four languages at her entertainments she notes who is present and who absent as carefully as napoleon watched his soldiers her interchange of cards alone is a thing as complex as the army musterrolls thus she plans organizes conquers and governs people speak of her existence as that of a doll or a toy when she is the most untiring of campaigners grant that her aim is after all unworthy and that you pity the worn face which has to force so many smiles no matter the smiles are there and so is the success i often wish that the reformers would do their work as thoroughly as the women of society do theirs no there is no constitutional want of thoroughness in women the trouble is that into the new work upon which they are just entering they have not yet brought their thoroughness to bear they suffer and are defrauded and are reproached simply because they have not yet nerved themselves to do well the things which they have asserted their right to do a distinguished woman who earns one of the largest incomes ever honestly earned by any one of her sex off the stage told me the other day that she left all her business affairs to the management of others and did not even know how to draw a check on a bank what a melancholy selfexhibition was that of a clever american woman whom i knew the author of half a dozen successful books refusing to look her own accounts in the face until they had got into such a tangle that not even her own referees could disentangle them to suit her these things show not that women are constitutionally wanting in thoroughness but that it is hard to make them carry this quality into new fields i wish i could possibly convey to the young women who write for advice on literary projects something of the meaning of this word thorough as applied to literary work scarcely any of them seem to have a conception of it dash cleverness recklessness impatience of revision or of patient investigation these are the common traits to a person of experience no stupidity is so discouraging as a brilliancy that has no roots it brings nothing to pass whereas a slow stupidity if it takes time enough may conquer the world consider that for more than twenty years the path of literature has been quite as fully open for women as for men in america the payment the same the honor the same the obstacles no greatercollegiate education has until quite recently been denied them but how many men succeed as writers without that advantage yet how little how very little of permanent literary work has yet been done by american women young girls appear one after another each writes a single clever story or a single sweet poem and then disappears forever look at griswolds female poets of america and you are disposed to turn back to the titlepage and see if these utterly forgotten names do not really represent the female poets of some other nation they are forgotten as most of the more numerous female prose writers are forgotten because they had no root nobody doubts that women have cleverness enough and enough of power of expression if you could open the mails and take out the womens letters as somebody says they would prove far more graphic and entertaining than those of the men they would be written too in what macaulay callsspeaking of madame darblays early styletrue womans english clear natural and lively what they need in order to convert this epistolary brilliancy into literature is to be thorough you cannot separate womans rights and her responsibilities in all ages of the world she has had a certain limited work to do and has done that well all that is needed when new spheres are open is that she should carry the same fidelity into those if she will work as hard to shape the children of her brain as to rear her bodily offspring will do intellectual work as well as she does housework and will meet her moral responsibilities as she meets her social engagements then opposition will soon disappear the habit of thoroughness is the key to all high success whatever is worth doing is worth doing well only those who are faithful in a few things will rightfully be made rulers over many literary aspirants the brilliant lady ashburton used to say of herself that she had never written a book and knew nobody whose books she would like to have written this does not seem to be the ordinary state of mind among those who write letters of inquiry to authors if i may judge from these letters the yearning for a literary career is now almost greater among women than among men perhaps this is because of some literary successes lately achieved by women perhaps it is because they have fewer outlets for their energies perhaps they find more obstacles in literature than young men find and have therefore more need to write letters of inquiry about it it is certain that they write such letters quite often and ask questions that test severely the supposed omniscience of the authors brainquestions bearing on logic rhetoric grammar and orthography where to find a publisher and how to obtain a welldisciplined mind these letters may sometimes be too long or come too often for convenience nor is the consoling postagestamp always remembered but they are of great value as giving real glimpses of american social life and of the present tendencies of american women they sometimes reveal such intellectual ardor and imagination such modesty and such patience under difficulties as to do good to the reader whatever they may do to the writer they certainly suggest a few thoughts which may as well be expressed once for all in print behind almost all these letters there lies a laudable desire to achieve success would you have the goodness to tell us how success can be obtained how can this be answered my dear young lady when you leave it to the reader to guess what your definition of success may be for instance here is mr mansfield tracy walworth who was murdered the other day in new york he was at once mentioned in the newspapers as a celebrated author never in my life having heard of him i looked in a manual of american literature and there found that mr walworths novel of warwick had a sale of seventyfive thousand copies and his delaplaine of fortyfive thousand is it a success to have secured a sale like that for your books and then to die and have your brother penmen ask who was he yet certainly a sale of seventyfive thousand copies is not to be despised and i fear i know many youths and maidens who would willingly write novels much poorer than warwick for the sake of a circulation like that i do not think that hawthorne however would have accepted these conditions and he certainly did not have this style of success nor do i think he had any right to expect it he had made his choice and had reason to be satisfied the very first essential for literary success is to decide what success means if a young girl pines after the success of marion harland and mrs southworth let her seek it it is possible that she may obtain it or surpass it and though she might do better she might do far worse it is at any rate a laudable aim to be popular popularity may be a very creditable thing unless you pay too high a price for it it is a pleasant thing and has many contingent advantagesbalanced by this great danger that one is apt to mistake it for real success learning hath made the most said old fuller by those books on which the booksellers have lost if this be true of learning it is quite as true of genius and originality a book may be immediately popular and also immortal but the chances are the other way it is more often the case that a great writer gradually creates the taste by which he is enjoyed wordsworth in england and emerson in america were striking instances of this and authors of far less fame have yet the same choice which they had you can take the standard which the book market offers and train yourself for that this will in the present age be sure to educate certain qualities in youdirectness vividness animation dasheven if it leaves other qualities untrained or you can make a standard of your own and aim at that taking your chance of seeing the public agree with you very likely you may fail perhaps you may be wrong in your fancy after all and the public may be right if you fail you may find it hard to bear but on the other hand you may have the inward glory andjoy which nothing but fidelity to an ideal standard can give all this applies to all forms of work but it applies conspicuously to literature instead therefore of offering to young writers the usual comforting assurance that if they produce anything of real merit it will be sure to succeed i should caution them first to make their own definition of success and then act accordingly hawthorne succeeded in his way and mr mt walworth in his way and each of these would have been very unreasonable if he had expected to succeed in both ways there is always an opening for careful and conscientious literary work and by such work many persons obtain a modest support there are also some great prizes to be won but these are commonly though not always won by work of a more temporary and sensational kind make your choice and when you have got precisely what you asked for do not complain because you have missed what you would not take the career of letters a young girl of some talent once told me that she had devoted herself to the career of letters i found on inquiry that she had obtained a situation as writer of society gossip for a new york newspaper i can hardly imagine any life that leads more directly away from any really literary career or any life about which it is harder to give counsel the work of a newspaper correspondent especially in the society direction is so full of trials and temptations for one of either sex in our dear inquisitive gossiping america that one cannot help watching with especial solicitude all women who enter it their special gifts as women are a source of danger they are keener of observation from the very fact of their sex more active in curiosity more skilful in achieving their ends in a world of gossip they are the queens and men but their subjects hence their greater danger in newport new york washington it is the same thing the unbounded appetite for private information about public or semipublic people creates its own purveyors and these again learn to believe with unflinching heartiness in the work they do i have rarely encountered a successful correspondent of this description who had not become thoroughly convinced that the highest desire of every human being is to see his name in print no matter how unhappily there is a great deal to encourage this belief i have known men to express great indignation at an unexpected newspaperpuff and then to send ten dollars privately to the author this is just the calamity of the profession that it brings one in contact with this class of social hypocrites and the personal correspondent gradually loses faith that there is any other class to be found then there is the perilous temptation to pay off grudges in this way to revenge slights by the use of a power with which few people are safely to be trusted in many cases such a correspondent is simply a child playing with poisoned arrows he poisons others and it is no satisfaction to know that in time he may also poison himself and paralyze his own power for mischief there lies before me a letter written some years ago to a young lady anxious to enter on this particular career of lettersa letter from an experienced new york journalist he has employed he says hundreds of lady correspondents for little or no compensation and one of his few successful writers he thus describes she succeeds by pushing her way into society and extracting information from fashionable people and officials and their wives she flatters the vain and overawes the weak and gets by sheer impudence what other writers cannot i would not wish you to be like her or reduced to the necessity of doing what she does for any success journalism can possibly give and who can help echoing this opinion if this is one of the successful laborers where shall we place the unsuccessful or rather is success or failure the greater honor personal journalism has a prominence in this country with which nothing in any other country can be compared what is called publicity in england or france means the most peaceful seclusion compared with the glare of notoriety which an enterprising correspondent can flash out at any timeas if by opening the bullseye of a dark lanternupon the quietest of his contemporaries it is essentially an american institution and not one of those in which we have reason to feel most pride it is to be observed however that foreigners if in office take to it very readily and it is said that no people cultivate the reporters at washington more assiduously than the diplomatic corps who like to send home the personal notices of themselves in order to prove to their governments that they are highly esteemed in the land to which they are appointed but however it may be with them it is certain that many people still like to keep their public and private lives apart and shrink from even the inevitable eminence of fame one of the very most popular of american authors has said that he never to this day has overcome a slight feeling of repugnance on seeing his own name in print talking and taking every time a woman does anything original or remarkableinventing a rattrap let us say or carving thirtysix heads on a walnutshellall observers shout applause theres a woman for you indeed instead of talking about her rights she takes them thats the way to do it what a lesson to these declaimers upon the platform it does not seem to occur to these wise people that the right to talk is itself one of the chief rights in america and the way to reach all the others to talk is to make a beginning at any rate to catch people with your ideas is more than tocontrive a rattrap and isotta nogarola carving thirtysix empty heads was not working in so practical a fashion as mary livermore when she instructs thirtysix hundred full ones it shows the good sense of the womansuffrage agitators that they have decided to begin with talk in the first place talking is the most lucrative of all professions in america and therefore it is the duty of american women to secure their share of it mrs frances anne kemble used to say that she read shakespeare in public for her bread and when after melting all hearts by a course of farewell readings she decided to begin reading again she said she was doing it for her butter so long as women are often obliged to support themselves and their children and perhaps their husbands by their own labor they have no right to work cheaply unless driven to it anna dickinson had no right to make fifteen dollars a week by sewing if by stepping out of the ranks of needlewomen into the ranks of the talkers she could make a hundred dollars a day theorize as we may the fact is that there is no kind of work in america which brings such sure profits as public speaking if women are unfitted for it or if they know the value of peace and quietness as the handorgan man says and can afford to hold their tongues let them do so but if they have tongues and like to use them they certainly ought to make some money by the performance this is the utilitarian view and when we bring in higher objects it is plain that the way to get anything in america is to talk about it silence is golden no doubt and like other gold remains in the bankvaults and does not just now circulate very freely as currency even literature in america is utterly second to oratory as a means of immediate influence of all sway that of the orator is the most potent and most perishable and the student and the artist are apt to hold themselves aloof from it for this reason but it is the one means in america to accomplish immediate results and women who would take their rights must take them through talking it is the appointed way under a good oldfashioned monarchy if a woman wished to secure anything for her sex she must cajole a court or become the mistress of a monarch that epoch ended with the french revolution when bonaparte wished to silence madame de staël he said what does that woman want does she want the money the government owes to her father when madame de staël heard of it she said the question is not what i want but what i think henceforth women like men are to say what they think for all that flattery and seduction and sin we have substituted the simple weapon of talk if women wish education they must talk if better laws they must talk the one chief argument against woman suffrage with men is that so few women even talk about it as long as the human voice can effect anything it is the duty of women to use it and in america where it effects everything they should talk all the time when they have obtained as a class absolute equality of rights with men their appeals on this subject may cease and they may accept if they please that naughty masculine definition of a happy marriagethe union of a deaf man with a dumb woman how to speak in public there are other things that women wish to do it seems beside studying and voting there are a good manyif i may judge from letters that occasionally come to mewho are taking or wish to take their first lessons in public speaking not necessarily very much in public or before mixed audiences but perhaps merely to say to a roomful of ladies or before the committee of a christian union what they desire to say how shall i make myself heard how shall i learn to express myself how shall i keep my head clear is there any school for debate and so on my dear young lady it does not take much wisdom but only a little experience to answer some of these questions so i am not afraid to try the best school for debate is debating so far as mere confidence and comfort are concerned the great thing is to gain the habit of speech even if one speaks badly and the practice of an ordinary debating society has also this advantage that it teaches you to talk sense lest you be laughed at to speak with some animation lest your hearers go to sleep to think out some good arguments because you are trying to convince somebody and to guard against weak reasoning or unfounded assertion lest your opponent trip you up speaking in a debating society thus gives you the same advantage that a lawyer derives from the presence of an opposing counsel you learn to guard yourself at all points it is the absence of this check which is the great intellectual disadvantage of the pulpit when a lawyer says a foolish thing in an argument he is pretty sure to find it out but a clergyman may go on repeating his foolish thing for fifty years without discovering it for want of an opponent for the art of making your voice heard i must refer you to an elocutionist yet one thing at least you might acquire for yourselfa thing that lies at the foundation of all good speakingthe complete and thorough enunciation of every syllable so great is the delight to my ear at least of a perfectly distinct and clearcut utterance that i fear i should rather listen for an hour to the merest nonsense so uttered than to the very wisdom of angels if given in a confused or nasal or slovenly way if you wish to know what i mean by a clear and satisfactory utterance go to a womansuffrage convention and hear miss mary f eastmanas to your employment of language the great aim is to be simple and in a measure conversational and then let eloquence come of itself if most people talked as well in public as in private public meetings would be more interesting to acquire a conversational tone there is good sense in edward everett hales suggestion that every person who is called on to speaklet us say at a public dinnerinstead of standing up and talking about his surprise at being called on should simply make his last remark to his neighbor at the table the startingpoint for what he says to the whole company he will thus make sure of a perfectly natural key to begin with and can go on from this quiet as i was just saying to mr smith to discuss the gravest question of church or state it breaks the ice for him like the remark upon the weather by which we open our interview with the person whom we have longed for years to meet beginning in this way at the level of the earths surface we can join hands and rise to the clouds begin in the cloudsas some of my most esteemed friends are wont to do and you have to sit down before reaching the earth and to come last to what is first in importance i am taking it for granted that you have something to say and a strong desire to say it perhaps you can say it better for writing it out in full beforehand but whether you do this or not remember that the more simple and consecutive your thought the easier it will be both to keep it in mind and to utter it the more orderly your plan the less likely you will be to get bewildered or to lose the thread think it out so clearly that the successive parts lead to one another and then there will be little strain upon your memory for each point you make provide at least one good argument and one good illustration and you can after a little practice safely leave the rest to the suggestion of the moment but so much as this you must have to be secure methods of preparation of course vary extremely yet i suppose the secret of the composure of an experienced speaker to lie usually in this that he has made sure beforehand of a sufficient number of good points to carry him through even if nothing good should occur to him on the spot thus wise people in going on a fishing excursion take with them not merely their fishing tackle but a few fish and then if they are not sure of their luck they will be sure of their chowder these are some of the simple hints that might be given in answer to inquiring friends i can remember when they would have saved me some anguish of spirit and they may be of some use to others now i write then not to induce any one to talk for the sake of talkingheaven forbidbut that those who are longing to say something should not fancy the obstacles insurmountable when they are really slightvii principles of government that liberty or freedom consists in having an actual share in the appointment of those who frame the laws and who are to be the guardians of every mans life property and peace for the all of one man is as dear to him as the all of another and the poor man has an equal right but more need to have representatives in the legislature than the rich one that they who have no voice nor vote in the electing of representatives do not enjoy liberty but are absolutely enslaved to those who have votes and to their representatives for to be enslaved is to have governors whom other men have set over us and be subject to laws made by the representatives of others without having had representatives of our own to give consent in our behalfbenjamin franklin in sparkss franklin ii we the people i remember that when i went to school i used to look with wonder on the title of a now forgotten newspaper of those days which was then often in the hands of one of the older scholars i remember nothing else about the newspaper or about the boy except that the title of the sheet he used to unfold was we the people and that he derived from it his school nickname by a characteristic boyish parody and was usually mentioned as us the folks probably all that was taught in that school in regard to american history was not of so much value as the permanent fixing of this phrase in our memories it seemed very natural in later years to come upon my old friend us the folks reproduced in almost every charter of our national government as thuswe the people of the united states in order to form a more perfect union establish justice insure domestic tranquillity provide for the common defence promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity do ordain and establish this constitution for the united states of americaunited states constitution preamble we the people of maine do agree etcconstitution of maine all government of right originates from the people is founded in their consent and instituted for the general goodconstitution of new hampshire the body politic is formed by a voluntary association of individuals it is a social compact by which the whole people covenants with each citizen and each citizen with the whole people that all shall be governed by certain laws for the common goodconstitution of massachusetts we the people of the state of rhode island and providence plantations do ordain and establish this constitution of governmentconstitution of rhode island the people of connecticut do in order more effectually to define secure and perpetuate the liberties rights and privileges which they have derived from their ancestors hereby ordain and establish the following constitution and form of civil governmentconstitution of connecticut and so on through the constitutions of almost every state in the union our government is as lincoln said a government of the people by the people and for the people there is no escaping it to question this is to deny the foundations of the american government granted that those who framed these provisions may not have understood the full extent of the principles they announced no matter they gave us those principles and having them we must apply them now women may be voters or not citizens or not but that they are a part of the people no one has denied in christendomhowever it may be in japan where as mrs leonowens tells us the census of population takes in only men and the women and children are left to be inferred we the people then includes women be the superstructure what it may the foundation of the government clearly provides a place for them it is impossible to state the national theory in such a way that it shall not include them it is impossible to deny the natural right of women to vote except on grounds which exclude all natural right the fundamental charters are on our side there are certain statute limitations which may prove greater or less but these are temporary and trivial things always to be interpreted often to be modified by reference to the principles of the constitution for instance when a constitutional convention is to be held or new conditions of suffrage to be created the whole people should vote upon the matter including those not hitherto enfranchised this is the view insisted onmany years since by that eminent jurist william beach lawrence he maintained in a letter to charles sumner and in opposition to his own party that if the question of negro suffrage in the southern states of the union were put to vote the colored people themselves had a natural right to vote on the question the same is true of women it should never be forgotten by advocates of woman suffrage that the deeper their reasonings go the stronger foundation they find and that we have always a solid fulcrum for our lever in that phrase of our charters we the people the use of the declaration of independence when young people begin to study geometry they expect to begin with hard reasoning on the very first page to their surprise they find that the early pages are not occupied by reasoning but by a few simple easy and rather commonplace sentences called axioms which are really a set of pegs on which all the reasoning is hung pupils are not expected to go back in every demonstration and prove the axioms if almira jones happens to be doing a problem at the blackboard on examination day at the high school and remarks in the course of her demonstration that things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another and if a sharp questioner jumps up and says how do you know it she simply lays down her bit of chalk and says fearlessly that is an axiom and the teacher sustains her some things must be taken for granted the same service rendered by axioms in the geometry is supplied in america as to government by the simple principles of the declaration of independence right or wrong they are taken for granted inasmuch as all the legislation of the country is supposed to be based in themthey stating the theory of our government while the constitution itself only puts into organic shape the applicationwe must all begin with them it is a great advantage and saves great trouble in all reforms to the abolitionists for instance what an inestimable laborsaving machine was the declaration of independence let them have that and they asked no more even the brilliant lawyer rufus choate when confronted with its plain provisions could only sneer at them as glittering generalities which was equivalent to throwing down his brief and throwing up his case it was an admission that if you were so foolish as to insist on applying the first principles of the government it was all over with him now the whole doctrine of woman suffrage follows so directly from these same political axioms that they are especially convenient for women to have in the house when the declaration of independence enumerates as among selfevident truths the fact of governments deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed then that point may be considered as settled in this schoolexamination of maturer life in this grownup geometry class the student is not to be called upon by the committee to prove that she may rightfully lay down her demonstrating chalk and say that is an axiom you admit that yourselves it is a great convenience we cannot always be going back like a hindoo history to the foundations of the world some things may be taken for granted how this simple axiom sweeps away for instance the cobweb speculations as to whether voting is a natural right or a privilege delegated by society no matter which take it which way you please that is an abstract question but the practical question is a very simple one governments owe their just powers to the consent of the governed either that axiom is false or whenever women as a class refuse their consent to the present exclusively masculine government it can no longer claim just powers the remedy then may be rightly demanded which the declaration of independence goes on to state whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute a new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness this is the use of the declaration of independence women as a class may not be quite ready to use it it is the business of this book to help make them ready but so far as they are ready these plain provisions are the axioms of their political faith if the axioms mean anything for men they mean something for women if men deride the axioms it is a concession like that of rufus choate that these fundamental principles are very much in their way but so long as the sentences stand in that document they can be made useful if men try to get away from the arguments of women by saving but suppose we have nothing in our theory of government which requires us to grant your demand then women can answer as the straightforward traddles answered uriah heep but you have you know therefore if you please we wont suppose any such thing some oldfashioned principles there has been an effort lately to show that when our fathers said taxation without representation is tyranny they referred not to personal liberties but to the freedom of a state from foreign power it is fortunate that this criticism has been made for it has led to a more careful examination of passages and this has made it clear beyond dispute that the revolutionary patriots carried their statements more into detail than is generally supposed and affirmed their principles for individuals not merely for the state as a whole in that celebrated pamphlet by james otis for instance published as early as the rights of the coloniesvindicated he thus clearly lays down the rights of the individual as to taxationthe very act of taxing exercised over those who are not represented appears to me to be depriving them of one of their most essential rights as freemen and if continued seems to be in effect an entire disfranchisement of every civil right for what one civil right is worth a rush after a mans property is subject to be taken from him at pleasure without his consent if a man is not his own assessor in person or by deputy his liberty is gone or he is entirely at the mercy of others this fine statement has already done duty for liberty in another contest for it was quoted by mr sumner in his speech of march with this commentarystronger words for universal suffrage could not be employed his argument is that if men are taxed without being represented they are deprived of essential rights and the continuance of this deprivation despoils them of every civil right thus making the latter depend upon the right of suffrage which by a neologism of our day is known as a political right instead of a civil right then to give point to this argument the patriot insists that in determining taxation every man must be his own assessor in person or by deputy without which his liberty is entirely at the mercy of others here again in a different form is the original thunderbolt taxation without representation is tyranny and the claim is made not merely for communities but for every man in a similar way wrote benjamin franklin some six years after in that remarkable sheet found among his papers and called declaration of those rights of the commonalty of great britain without which they cannot be free the leading propositions were these threethat every man of the commonalty excepting infants insane persons and criminals is of common right and by the laws of god a freeman and entitled to the free enjoyment of liberty that liberty or freedom consists in having an actual share in the appointment of those who frame the laws and who are to be the guardians of every mans life property and peace for the all of one man is as dear to him as the all of another and the poor man has an equal right but more need to have representatives in the legislature than the rich one that they who have no voice nor vote in the electing of representatives do not enjoy liberty but are absolutely enslaved to those who have votes and to their representatives for to be enslaved is to have governors whom other men have set over us and be subject to laws made by the representatives of others without having had representatives of our own to give consent in our behalf in quoting these words of dr franklin one of his biographers feels moved to add these principles so familiar to us now and so obviously just were startling and incredible novelties in abhorrent to nearly all englishmen and to great numbers of americans their fair application is still abhorrent to a great many or else not willing quite to deny the theory they limit the application by some such device as virtual representation here again james otis is ready for them and charles sumner is ready to quote otis as thusno such phrase as virtual representation was ever known in law or constitution it is altogether a subtlety and illusion wholly unfounded and absurd we must not be cheated by any such phantom or any other fiction of law or politics or any monkish trick of deceit or blasphemy these are the sharp words used by the patriot otis speaking of those who were trying to convince american citizens that they were virtually represented in parliament sumner applied the same principle to the freedmen it is now applied to women taxation without representation is tyranny virtual representation is altogether a subtlety and illusion wholly unfounded and absurd no ingenuity no evasion can give any escape from these plain principles either you must revoke the maxims of the american revolution or you must enfranchise woman stuart mill well says in his autobiography the interest of woman is included in that of man exactly as much and no more as that of subjects in that of kings footnote otis rights of the colonies p footnote sparkss franklin ii founded on a rock if there is any one who is recognized as a fair exponent of our national principles it is our martyrpresident abraham lincoln whom lowell calls in his noble commemoration ode at cambridgenew birth of our new soil the first american what president lincolns political principle was we know on his journey to washington for his first inauguration he said i have never had a feeling that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the declaration of independence to findout what was his view of those sentiments we must go back several years earlier and consider that remarkable letter of his to the boston republicans who had invited him to join them in celebrating jeffersons birthday in april it was well called by charles sumner a gem in political literature and it seems to me almost as admirable in its way as the gettysburg address the principles of jefferson are the definitions and axioms of free society and yet they are denied and evaded with no small show of success one dashingly calls them glittering generalities another bluntly styles them selfevident lies and others insidiously argue that they apply only to superior races these expressions differing in form are identical in object and effect the subverting the principles of free government and restoring those of classification caste and legitimacy they would delight a convocation of crowned heads plotting against the people they are the vanguard the sappers and miners of returning despotism we must repulse them or they will subjugate us all honor to jeffersonthe man who in the concrete pressure of a struggle for national independence by a single people had the coolness forecast and capacity to introduce into a merely revolutionary document an abstract truth applicable to all men and all times and so to embalm it there that today and in all coming days it shall be a rebuke and a stumblingblock to the harbingers of reappearing tyranny and oppression the special abstract truth to which president lincoln thus attaches a value so great and which he pronounces applicable to all men and all times is evidently the assertion of the declaration that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed following the assertion that all men are born free and equal that is as some one has well interpreted it equally men i do not see how any person but a dreamy recluse can deny that the strength of our republic rests on these principles which are so thoroughly embedded in the average american mind that they take in it to some extent the place occupied in the average english mind by the emotion of personal loyalty to a certain reigning family but it is impossible to defend these principles logically as senator hoar has well pointed out without recognizing that they are as applicable to women as to men if this is the case the claim of women rests on a rightindeed upon the same right which is the foundation of all our institutions the encouraging fact in the present condition of the whole matter is not that we get more votes here or there for this or that form of woman suffragefor experience has shown that there are great ups and downs in that respect and states that at one time seemed nearest to woman suffrage as maine and kansas now seem quite apathetic but the real encouragement is that the logical ground is more and more conceded and the point now usually made is not that the jeffersonian maxim excludes women but that the consent of the governed is substantially given by the general consent of women that this argument has a certain plausibility may be conceded but it is equally clear that the minority of women those who do wish to vote includes on the whole the natural leaders those who are foremost in activity of mind in literature in art in good works of charity it is therefore pretty sure that they only predict the opinions of the rest who will follow them in time and even while waiting it is a fair question whether the governed have not the right to give their votes when they wish even if the majority of them prefer to stay away from the polls we do not repeal our naturalization laws although only the minority of our foreignborn inhabitants as yet take the pains to become naturalized the good of the governed in paris some years ago i was for a time a resident in a cultivated french family where the father was noncommittal in politics the mother and son were republicans and the daughter was a bonapartist asking the mother why the young lady thus held to a different creed from the rest i was told that she had made up her mind that the streets of paris were kept cleaner under the empire than since its disappearance hence her imperialism i have heard american men advocate the french empire at home and abroad without offering reasons so good as those of the lively french maiden but i always think of her remark when the question is seriously asked as mr parkman for instance once gravely put it in the north american reviewthe real issue is this is the object of government the good of the governed or is it not taken in a general sense there is probably no disposition to discuss this conundrum for the simple reason that nobody dissents from it but the important point is what does the good of the governed mean does it merely mean better street cleaning or something more essential there is nothing new in the distinction ever since de tocqueville wrote his democracy in america forty years ago this precise point has been under active discussion that acute writer himself recurs to it again and again every government he points out nominally seeks the good of the people and rests on their will at last but there is this difference a monarchy organizes better does its work better cleans the streets better nevertheless de tocqueville a monarchist sees this advantage in a republic that when all this is done by the people for themselves although the work done may be less perfect yet the people themselves are more enlightened better satisfied and in the end their good is better served thus in one place he quotes a writer of talent who complains of the want of administrative perfection inthe united states and says we are indebted to centralization that admirable invention of a great man for the uniform order and method which prevails alike in all the municipal budgets of france from the largest town to the humblest commune but says de tocquevillewhatever may be my admiration of this result when i see the communes municipalities of france with their excellent system of accounts plunged in the grossest ignorance of their true interests and abandoned to so incorrigible an apathy that they seem to vegetate rather than to live when on the other hand i observe the activity the information and the spirit of enterprise which keeps society in perpetual labor in these american townships whose budgets are drawn up with small method and with still less uniformityi am struck by the spectacle for to my mind the end of a good government is to insure the welfare of a people and not to establish order and regularity in the midst of its misery and its distress the italics are my own but it will be seen that he uses a phrase almost identical with mr parkmans and that he uses it to show that there is something to be looked at beyond good lawsnamely the beneficial effect of selfgovernment in another place he comes back to the subject againit is incontestable that the people frequently conducts public business very ill but it is impossible that the lower order should take a part in public business without extending the circle of their ideas and without quitting the ordinary routine of their mental acquirements the humblest individual who is called upon to cooperate in the government of society acquires a certain degree of selfrespect and as he possesses authority he can command the services of minds much more enlightened than his own he is canvassed by a multitude of applicants who seek to deceive him in a thousand different ways but who instruct him by their deceit democracy does not confer the most skilful kind of government upon the people but it produces that which the most skilful governments are frequently unable to awaken namely an allpervading and restless activity a superabundant force and an energy which is inseparable from it and which may under favorable circumstances beget the most amazing benefits these are the true advantages of democracy these passages and others like them are worth careful study they clearly point out the two different standards by which we may criticise all political systems one class of thinkers of whom froude is the most conspicuous holds that the good of the people means good laws and good administration and that if these are only provided it makes no sort of difference whether they themselves make the laws or whether some caesar or louis napoleon provides them all the traditions of the early and later federalists point this way but it has always seemed to me a theory of government essentially incompatible with american institutions if we could once get our people saturated with it they would soon be at the mercy of some louis napoleon of their own when president lincoln claimed following theodore parker that ours was not merely a government for the people but of the people and by the people as well he recognized the other side of the matterthat it is not only important what laws we have but who makes the laws and that the end of a good government is to insure the welfare of a people in this far wider sense that advantage which the french writer admits in democracy that it develops force energy and selfrespect is as essentially a part of the good of the governed as is any perfection in the details of government and it is precisely these advantages which we expect that women sooner or later are to share for them as for men the good of the governed is not genuine unless it is that kind of good which belongs to the selfgoverned footnote sparkss franklin ii footnote de tocqueville vol ii pp ruling at secondhand in the last century the bitter satirist charles churchill wrote a verse which will do something to keep alive his name it is as followswomen ruled all and ministers of state were at the doors of women forced to waitwomen who we oft as sovereigns graced the land but never governed well at secondhand he touches the very kernel of the matter and all history is on his side the salic law excluded women from the throne of francethe kingdom of france being too noble to be governed by a woman as it said accordingly the history of france shows one long line of royal mistresses ruling in secret for mischief while more liberal england points to the reigns of elizabeth and anne and victoria to show how usefully a woman may sit upon a throne it was one of the merits of margaret fuller ossoli that she always pointed out this distinction any woman can haveinfluence she said in some way she need only to be a good cook or a good scold to secure that woman should not merely have a share in the power of manfor of that omnipotent nature will not suffer her to be defraudedbut it should be a chartered power too fully recognized to be abused we have got to meet at any rate this fact of feminine influence in the world demosthenes said that the measures which a statesman had meditated for a year might be overturned in a day by a woman how infinitely more sensible then to train the woman herself in statesmanship and give her open responsibility as well as concealed power the same demoralizing principle of subordination runs through the whole position of women many a husband makes of his wife a doll dresses her in fine clothes gives or withholds money according to his whims and laughs or frowns if she asks any questions about his business if only a petted slave she naturally develops the vices of a slave and when she wants more money for more fine clothes and finds her husband out of humor she coaxes cheats and lies many a woman half ruins her husband by her extravagance simply because he has never told her frankly what his income is or treated her in money matters like a rational being bankruptcy perhaps brings both to their senses and thenceforward the husband discovers that his wife is a woman not a child but for want of this whole families and generations of women are trained to deception i knew an instance where a fashionable dressmaker in new york urged an economical young girl about to be married to buy of her a costly trousseau or wedding outfit but i have not the money said the maiden no matter said the complaisant tempter i will wait four years and send in the bill to your husband by degrees many ladies do it fancy the position of a pure young girl wishing innocently to make herself beautiful in the eyes of her husband and persuaded to go into his house with a trick like this upon her conscience yet it grows directly out of the whole theory of life which is preached to many womenthat all they seek must be won by indirect manoeuvres and not by straightforward living it is a mistaken system once recognize woman as born to be the equal not inferior of man and she accepts as a right her share of the family income of political power and of all else that is capable of distribution as it is we are in danger of forgetting that woman in mind as in body wasborn to be upright the women of charles readenever by any possibility moving in a straight line where it is possible to find a crooked oneare distorted women and nature is no more responsible for them than for the figures produced by tight lacing and by highheeled boots these physical deformities acquire a charm when the taste adjusts itself to them and so do those pretty tricks and those interminable lies but after all to make a noble woman you must give a noble training viii suffrage no such phrase as virtual representation was ever known in law or constitution it is altogether a subtlety and illusion wholly unfounded and absurd we must not be cheated by any such phantom or any other trick of law and politicsjames otis quoted by charles sumner in speech march drawing the line when in dickenss nicholas nickleby the coalheaver calls at the fashionable barbers to be shaved the barber declines that service the coalheaver pleads that he saw a baker being shaved there the day before but the barber points out to him that it is necessary to draw the line somewhere and he draws it at bakers it is doubtless an inconvenience in respect to woman suffrage that so many people have their own theories as to drawing the line and deciding who shall vote each has his hobby and as the opportunity for applying it to men has passed by each wishes to catch at the last remaining chance and apply it to women one believes in drawing an educational line another in a property qualification another in new restrictions on naturalization another in distinctions of race and each wishes to keep women for a time as the only remaining victims for his experiment fortunately the answer to all these objections on behalf of woman suffrage is very brief and simple it is no more the business of its advocates to decide upon the best abstract basis for suffrage than it is to decide upon the best system of education or of labor or of marriage its business is to equalize in all these directions nothing more when that is done there will be plenty still left to do without doubt but it will not involve the rights of women as such simply to strike out the word male from the statutethat is our present work what is sauce for the goosebut the proverb is somewhat musty these educational and property restrictions may be of value but wherever they are already removed from the men they must be removed from women also enfranchise them equally and then begin afresh if you please to legislate for the whole human race what we protest against is that you should have let down the bars for one sex and should at once become conscientiously convinced that they should be put up again for the otherwhen it was proposed to apply an educational qualification at the south after the war the southern white loyalists all objected to it if you make it universal they said it cuts off many of the whites if you apply it to the blacks alone it is manifestly unjust the case is the same with women in regard to men as woman needs the ballot primarily to protect herself it is manifestly unjust to restrict the suffrage for her when man has it without restriction if she needs protection then she needs it all the more from being poor or ignorant or irish or black if we do not see this the freedwomen of the south did there is nothing like personal wrong to teach people logic we hear a great deal said in dismay and sometimes even by old abolitionists about increasing the number of ignorant voters in massachusetts there is an educational restriction for men such as it is in rhode island a property qualification is required for voting on certain questions personally i believe with warrington that if ignorant voting be bad ignorant nonvoting is worse and that the enfranchised masses which have a legitimate outlet for their political opinions are far less dangerous than disfranchised masses which must rely on mobs and strikes i will go farther and say that i believe our republic is on the whole in less danger from its poor men who have got to stay in it and bring up their children than from its rich men who have always paris and london to fall back upon i do not see that even a polltax or registrytax is of any use as a safeguard for if men are to be bought the tax merely offers a more indirect and palatable form in which to pay the price many a man consents to have his polltax paid by his party or his candidate when he would reject the direct offer of a dollar bill but this is all private speculation and has nothing to do with the womansuffrage movement all that we can ask as advocates of this reform is that the inclusion or the exclusion should be the same for both sexes we cannot put off the equality of woman till that time a few centuries hence when the social science association shall have succeeded in agreeing on the true basis of scientific legislation it is as if we urged that wives should share their husbands dinners and were told that the physicians had not decided whether beefsteak were wholesome the answer is beefsteak or tripe yeast or saleratus which you please but meanwhile what is good enough for the wife is good enough for the husband for selfprotection i remember to have read many years ago the life of sir samuel romilly the english philanthropist he was the author of more beneficent legal reforms than any man of his day and there was in that very book a long list of the changes he still meant to bring about it struck me very much that among these proposed reforms not one of any importance referred to the laws about women it showswhat all experience has shownthat no class or race or sex can safely trust its protection in any hands but its own the laws of england in regard to woman were then so bad that lord brougham afterwards said they needed total reconstruction if they were to be touched at all yet it is only since woman suffrage began to be talked about that the work of lawreform has really taken firm hold in many cases in america the beneficent measures are directly to be traced to some appeal from feminine advocates even in canada as was once stated by dr cameron of toronto the bill protecting the property of married women was passed under the immediate pressure of lucy stones eloquence and even where this direct agency could not be traced the general fact that the atmosphere was full of the agitation had much to do with all the reforms that took place legislatures unwilling to give woman the ballot were shamed into giving her something the chairman of the judiciary committee in rhode island told me that until he heard women argue before the committee he had not reflected upon their legal disabilities or thought how unjust these were while the matter was left to the other sex only even men like sir samuel romilly forgot the wrongs of woman when she began to advocate her own cause men also waked up but now that they are awake they ask is not this sufficient not at all if an agent who has cheated you surrenders reluctantly one half your stolen goods you do not stop there and say it is enough your intention is honorable please continue my agent with increased pay on the contrary you say your admission of wrong is a plea of guilty give me the rest of what is mine there is no defence like selfdefence no protection like selfprotection all theories of chivalry and generosity and vicarious representation fall before the fact that woman has been grossly wronged by man that being the case the only modest and honest thing for man to do is to say henceforward have a voice in making your own laws till this is done she has no sure safeguard since otherwise the same men who made the old barbarous laws may at any time restore them it is common to say that woman suffrage will make no great difference that women will think very much as men do and it will simply double the vote without varying the result about many matters this may be true to be sure it is probable that on questions of conscience like slavery and temperance the womans vote would by no means coincide with mans but grant that it would the fact remainsand all history shows itthat on all that concerns her own protection a woman needs her own vote would a woman vote to give her husband the power of bequeathing her children to the control and guardianship of somebody else would a woman vote to sustain the law by which a massachusetts chief justice bade the police take those crying children from their mothers side in the boston courtroom a few years ago and hand themover to a comparative stranger because that mother had married again you might as well ask whether the colored vote would sustain the dred scott decision tariffs or banks may come or go the same whether the voters be white or black male or female but when the wrongs of an oppressed class or sex are to be righted the ballot is the only guaranty after they have gained a potential voice for themselves the sir samuel romillys will remember them womanly statesmanship the newspapers periodically express a desire to know whether women have given evidence on the whole of superior statesmanship to men there are constant requests that they will define their position as to the tariff and the fisheries and the civilservice question if they do not speak it is naturally assumed that they will forever after hold their peace let us see how that matter stands it is said that the greatest mechanical skill in america is to be found among professional burglars who come here from england suppose one of these men were in prison and we were to stand outside and taunt him through the window here is a locomotive engine why do you not mend or manage it here is a steam printingpress if you know anything set it up for me you a mechanic when you have not proved that you understand any of these things nonsense but jack sheppard if he condescended to answer us at all would coolly say wait a while till i have finished my present job being in prison my first business is to get out of prison wait till i have picked this lock and mined this wall wait till i have made a saw out of a watchspring and a ladder out of a pair of blankets let me do my first task and get out of limbo and then see if your little printingpresses and locomotives are too puzzling for my fingers politically speaking woman is in jail and her first act of skill must be in getting through the wall for her there is no tariff question no problem of the fisheries she will come to that by and by if you please but for the present her statesmanship must be employed nearer home the civilservice reform in which she is most concerned is a reform which shall bring her in contact with the civil service her political creed for the present is limited to that of sternes starling in the cagei cant get out if she is supposed to have any commonsense at all she will best show it by beginning at the point where she is instead of at the point where somebody else is she would indeed be as foolish as these editors think her if she now spent her brains upon the tariff question which she cannot reach instead of upon her own enfranchisement which she is gradually reaching the womansuffrage movement in america in all its stages and subdivisions has been the work of woman no doubt men have helped in it much of the talking has been done by them and they have furnished many of the printed documents but the energy the methods the unwearied purpose of the movement have come from women they have led in all councils they have established the newspapers got up the conventions addressed the legislatures and raised the money thirty years have shown with whatever temporary variations one vast wave of progress toward success both in this country and in europe now success is statesmanship i remember well the shouts of laughter that used to greet the antislavery orators when they claimed that the real statesmen of the country were not the clays and calhouns who spent their strength in trying to sustain slavery and failed but the garrisons who devoted their lives to its overthrow and were succeeding yet who now doubts this tried by the same standard the statesmanship of today does not lie in the men who can find no larger questions before them than those which concern the fisheries but in the women whose farreaching efforts will one day make every existing votinglist so much waste paper of course when the votinglists with the womens names are ready to be printed it will be interesting to speculate as to how these new monarchs of our destiny will use their power for myself a long course of observation in the antislavery and womansuffrage movements has satisfied me that women are not idiots and that on the whole when they give their minds to a question whether moral or practical they understand it quite as readily as men in the antislavery movement it is certain that a woman elizabeth heyrick gave the first impulse to its direct and simple solution in england and that another woman mrs stowe did more than any man except perhaps garrison and john brown to secure its right solution here there was never a moment i am confident when any great political question growing out of the antislavery struggle might not have been put to vote more safely among the women of new england than among the clergy or the lawyers or the college professors if they did so well in that great issue it is fair to assume that after they have a sufficient inducement to study out future issues they at least will not be very much behind the men but we cannot keep it too clearly in view that the whole question whether women would vote better or worse than men on general questions is a minor matter it was equally a minor matter in case of the negroes we gave the negroes the ballot simply because they needed it for their own protection and we shall by and by give it to women for the same reason tried by that test we shall find that their statesmanship will be genuine when they come into power drunken husbands will no longer control their wives earnings and a chief justice will no longer order a child to be removed from its mother amid its tears and outcries merely because that mother has married again and if as we are constantly assured womans first duty is to her home and her children she may count it a good beginning in statesmanship tosecure to herself the means of protecting both that once settled it will be time enough to interview her in respect to the proper rate of duty on pigiron too much prediction seek not to proticipate says mrs gamp the venerable nurse in martin chuzzlewitbut take em as they come and as they go i am persuaded that our womansuffrage arguments would be improved by this sage counsel and that at present we indulge in too many bold anticipations is there not altogether too much tendency to predict what women will do when they vote could that good time come tomorrow we should be startled to find to how many different opinions and causes the new voters were already pledged one speaker wishes that women should be emancipated because of the fidelity with which they are sure to support certain desirable measures as peace order freedom temperance righteousness and judgment to come then the next speaker has his or her schedule of political virtues and is equally confident that women if once enfranchised will guarantee clear majorities for them all the trouble is that we thus mortgage this new party of the future past relief beyond possibility of payment and incur the ridicule of the unsanctified by committing our cause to a great many contradictory pledges i know an able and highminded woman of foreign birth who courageously but as i think mistakenly calls herself an atheist and who has for years advocated woman suffrage as the only antidote to the rule of the clergy on the other hand an able speaker in a boston convention soon after advocated the same thing as the best way of defeating atheism and securing the positive assertion of religion by the community both cannot be correct neither is entitled to speak for woman that being the case would it not be better to keep clear of this dangerous ground of prediction and keep to the argument based on rights and needs if our theory of government be worth anything woman has the same right to the ballot that man has she certainly needs it as much for selfdefence how she will use it when she gets it is her own affair it may be that she will use it more wisely than her brothers but i am satisfied to believe that she will use it as well let us not attribute infallible wisdom and virtue even to women for as dear mrs poyser says in adam bede god almighty made some of em foolish to match the men it is common to assume for instance that all women by nature favor peace and that even if they do not always seem to promote it in their social walk and conversation they certainly will in their political when we consider how all the pleasing excitements achievements and glories of war such as they are accrue to men only and how large a part of the miseries are brought home to women it might seem that their vote on this matter at least would be a sure thing thus far the theory the fact being that we have been through a civil war which convulsed the nation and cost half a million lives and which was from the very beginning fomented stimulated and applauded at least on one side by the united voice of the women it will be generally admitted by those who know that but for the women of the seceding states the war of the rebellion would have been waged more feebly been sooner ended and far more easily forgotten nay i was told a few days since by an able southern lawyer who was long the mayor of one of the largest southern cities that in his opinion the practice of duellingwhich is an epitome of warowes its continued existence at the south to a sustaining public sentiment among the fair sex again where the sympathy of women is wholly on the side of right it is by no means safe to assume that their mode of enforcing that sentiment will be equally judicious take for instance the temperance cause it is quite common to assume that women are a unit on that question when we look at the two extremes of societythe fine lady pressing wine upon her visitors and the irishwoman laying in a family supply of whiskey to last over sundaythe assumption seems hasty but grant it is it equally sure that when woman takes hold of that most difficult of all legislation the license and prohibitory laws she will handle them more wisely than men have done will her more ardent zeal solve the problem on which so much zeal has already been lavished in vain in large cities for instance where there is already more law than is enforced will her additional ballots afford the means to enforce it it may be so but it seems wiser not to predict nor to anticipate but to wait and hope it is no reproach on woman to say that she is not infallible on particular questions there is much reason to suppose that in politics as in every other sphere the joint action of the sexes will be better and wiser than that of either singly it seems obvious that the experiment of republican government will be more fairly tried when one half the race is no longer disfranchised it is quite certain at any rate that no class can trust its rights to the mercy and chivalry of any other but that the weaker it is the more it needs all political aids and securities for selfprotection thus far we are on safe ground and here as it seems to me the claim for suffrage may securely rest to go farther in our assertions seems to me unsafe although many of our wisest and most eloquent may differ from me and the nearer we approach success the more important it is to look to our weapons it is a plausible and tempting argument to claim suffrage for woman on the ground that she is an angel but i think it will prove wiser in the end to claim it for her as being human firstclass carriagesin a hotly contested municipal election the other day an active political manager was telling me his tactics we have to send carriages for some of the voters he said firstclass carriages if we undertake to wait on em we must do it in good shape and not leave the best carriages to be hired by the other party i am not much given to predicting just what will happen when women vote but i confidently assert that they will be taken to the polls if they wish in firstclass carriages if the best horses are to be harnessed and the best cushions selected and every panel of the coach rubbed till you can see your face in it merely to accommodate some elderly man who lives two blocks away and could walk to the polls very easily then how much more will these luxuries be placed at the service of every woman young or old whose presence at the polls is made doubtful by mud or snow or the prospect of a shower but the carriage is only the beginning of the polite attentions that will soon appear when we see the transformation undergone by every ferryboat and every railway station so soon as it comes to be frequented by women who can doubt that votingplaces will experience the same change they will soon have at least in the ladies departmentelegance instead of discomfort beauty for ashes plenty of rockingchairs and no need of spittoons very possibly they may have all the modern conveniences and inconveniencesfurnace registers teakettles washington pies and a young lady to give checks for bundles who knows what elaborate comforts what queenly luxuries may be offered to women at votingplaces when the time has finally arrived to sue for their votes the common impression has always been quite different from this people look at the coarseness and dirt now visible at so many votingplaces and say would you expose women to all that but these places are not dirtier than a railway smokingcar and there is no more coarseness than in any ferryboat which is for whatever reason used by men only you do not look into those places and say with indignation never if i can help it shall my wife or my beloved greatgrandmother travel by steamboat or by rail you know that with these exemplary relatives will enter order and quiet carpets and curtains brooms and dusters why should it be otherwise with ward rooms and town halls there is not an atom more of intrinsic difficulty in providing a decorous ladies room for a votingplace than for a postoffice or a railway station and it is as simple a thing to vote a ticket as to buy one this being thus easily practicable all men will desire to provide it and the example of the firstclass carriages shows that the parties will vie with each other in these pleasing arrangements they will be driven to it whether they wish it or not the party which has most consistently and resolutely kept woman away from the ballotbox will be the very party compelled for the sake of selfpreservation to make her rights agreeable to her when once she gets them a few stupid or noisy men may indeed try to make the polls unattractive to her the very first time but the result of this little experiment will be so disastrous that the offenders will be sternly suppressed by their own party leaders before another election day comes it will soon become clear that of all possible ways of losing votes the surest lies in treating women rudely lucy stone tells a story of a good man in kansas who having done all he could to prevent women from being allowed to vote on school questions was finally comforted when that measure passed by the thought that he should at least secure his wifes vote for a pet schoolhouse of his own election day came and the newly enfranchised matron showed the most culpable indifference to her privileges she made breakfast as usual went about her housework and did on that perilous day precisely the things that her anxious husband had always predicted that women never would do under such circumstances his hints and advice found no response and nothing short of the best pair of horses and the best wagon finally sufficed to take the farmers wife to the polls i am not the least afraid that women will find voting a rude or disagreeable arrangement there is more danger of their being treated too well and being too much attacked and allured by these cheap cajoleries but women are pretty shrewd and can probably be trusted to go to the polls even in firstclass carriages education via suffrage i know a rich bachelor of large property who fatigues his friends by perpetual denunciations of everything american and especially of universal suffrage he rarely votes and i was much amazed when the popular vote was to be taken on building an expensive schoolhouse to see him go to the polls and vote in the affirmative on being asked his reason he explained that while we labored under the calamity of universal male suffrage he thought it best to mitigate its evils by educating the voters in short he wished as mr lowe said in england when the last reform bill passed to prevail upon our future masters to learn their alphabets these motives may not be generous but the schoolhouses when they are built are just as useful even girls get the benefit of them though the long delay in many places before girls got their share came in part from the want of this obvious stimulus it is universal male suffrage that guarantees schoolhouse and school the most selfish man understands that argument we must educate the masses if it is only to keep them from our throats but there is a wider way in which suffrage guarantees education at every election time political information is pouredupon the whole voting community till it is deluged presses run night and day to print newspaper extras clerks sit up all night to send out congressional speeches the most eloquent men in the community expound the most difficult matters to the ignorant of course each party affords only its own point of view but every man has a neighbor who is put under treatment by some other party and who is constantly attacking all who will listen to his provoking and pestilent counterstatements all the common school education of the united states does not equal the education of election day and as in some states elections are held very often this popular university seems to be kept in session almost the whole year round the consequence is a remarkable average popular knowledge of political affairsa training which american women now miss but which will come to them with the ballot and in still another way there will be an education coming to woman from the right of suffrage it will come from her own sex proceeding from highest to lowest we often hear it said that after enfranchisement the more educated women will not vote while the ignorant will but mrs howe admirably pointed out at a philadelphia convention that the moment women have the ballot it will become the pressing duty of the more educated women even in selfprotection to train the rest the very fact of the danger will be a stimulus to duty with women as it already is with men it has always seemed to me rather childish in a man of superior education or talent or wealth to complain that when election day comes he has no more votes than the man who plants his potatoes or puts in his coal the truth is that under the most thorough system of universal suffrage the man of wealth or talent or natural leadership has still a disproportionate influence still casts a hundred votes where the poor or ignorant or feeble man throws but one even the outrages of new york elections turned out to be caused by the fact that the leading rogues had used their brains and energy while the men of character had not when it came to the point it was found that a few caricatures by nast and a few columns of figures in the times were more than a match for all the repeaters of the ring it is always so andrew johnson with all the patronage of the nation had not the influence of nasby with his one newspaper the whole chinese question was perceptibly and instantly modified when harte wrote the heathen chinee these things being so it indicates feebleness or dyspepsia when an educated man is heard whining about election time with his fears of ignorant voting it is his business to enlighten and control that ignorance with a voice and a pen at his command with a town hall in every town for the one and a newspaper in every village for the other he has such advantages over his ignorant neighbors that the only doubt is whether his privileges are not greater than he deserves for one in writing for the press i am impressed by the undue greatness not by the littleness of the power i wield and what is true of men will be true of women if the educated women of america have not brains or energy enough to control in the long run the votes of the ignorant women around them they will deserve a severe lesson and will be sure like the men in new york to receive it and thenceforward they will educate and guide that ignorance instead of evading or cringing before it but i have no fear about the matter it is a libel on american women to say that they will not go anywhere or do anything which is for the good of their children and their husbands travel west on any of our great lines of railroad and see what women undergo in transporting their households to their new homes see the watching and the feeding and the endless answers to the endless questions and the toil to keep little sarah warm and little johnny cool and the baby comfortable what a hungry tired jaded forlorn mass of humanity it is as the sun rises on it each morning in the soiled and breathless railwaycar yet that household group is america in the making those are the future kings and queens the little princes and princesses of this land now is the mother who has undergone for the transportation of these children all this enormous labor to shrink at her journeys end from the slight additional labor of going to the polls to vote whether those little ones shall have schools or rumshops the thought is an absurdity a few fine ladies in cities will fear to spoil their silk dresses as a few foppish gentlemen now fear for their broadcloth but the mass of intelligent american women will vote as do the mass of men follow your leaders there go thirty thousand men shouted the portuguese as wellington with a few staffofficers rode along the mountainside the action of the leaders minds in any direction has a value out of all proportion to their numbers in a campaign there is a council of officersgrant and sherman and sheridan perhaps they are but a trifling minority yet what they plan the whole army will do and such is the faith in a real leader that were all the restraints of discipline for the moment relaxed the rank and file would still follow his judgment what a few general officers see to be the best today the sergeants and corporals and private soldiers will usually see to be best tomorrow in peace also there is a silent leadership only that in peace as there is more time to spare the leaders are expected to persuade the rank and file instead of commanding them yet it comes to the same thing in the end the movement begins with certain guides and if you wish to know the future keep your eye on them if you wish to know what is already decided ask the majority but if you wish to find out what is likely to be done next ask the leaders it is constantly said that the majority of women do not yet desire to vote and it is true but to find out whether they are likely to wish for it we must keep our eyes on the women who lead their sex the representative womenthose whonaturally stand for the rest those most eminent for knowledge and selfdevotionhow do they view the thing the rank and file do not yet demand the ballot you say but how is it with the general officers now it is a remarkable fact about which those who have watched this movement for twenty years can hardly be mistaken that almost any woman who reaches a certain point of intellectual or moral development will presently be found desiring the ballot for her sex if this be so it predicts the future it is the judgment of grant and sherman and sheridan as against that of the average private soldier of the two hundredth infantry set aside if you please the specialists of this particular agitationthose who were first known to the public through its advocacy there is no just reason why they should be set aside yet concede that for a moment the fact remains that the ablest women in the landthose who were recognized as ablest in other spheres before they took this particular duty upon themare extremely apt to assume this cross when they reach a certain stage of development when margaret fuller first came forward into literature she supposed that literature was all she wanted it was not till she came to write upon womans position that she discovered what woman needed clara barton driving her ambulance or her supply wagon at the battles edge did not foresee perhaps that she should make that touching appeal when the battle was over imploring her own enfranchisement from the soldiers she had befriended lydia maria child julia ward howe harriet beecher stowe louisa alcott came to the claim for the ballot earlier than a million others because they were the intellectual leaders of american womanhood they saw farthest because they were in the highest place they were the recognized representatives of their sex before they gave in their adhesion to the new demand their judgment is as the judgment of the council of officers while flora mcflimseys opinion is as the opinion of john smith unassigned recruit but if the generals make arrangements for a battle the chance is that john smith will have to take a hand in it or else run away it is a rare thing for the petition for suffrage from any town to comprise the majority of women in that town it makes no difference if there are few women in the town who want to vote there is as much propriety in their voting as if there were ten millions so long as the majority are equally protected in their right to stay at home but when the names of petitioners come to be weighed as well as counted the character the purity the intelligence the social and domestic value of the petitioners is seldom denied the women who wish to vote are not the idle the ignorant the narrowminded or the vicious they are not the dangerous classes they represent the best class in the community when tried by the highest standard they are the natural leaders what they now see to be right will also be perceived even by the foolish and the ignorant by and by in a poultryyard in spring when the first brood of ducklings goes toddling to the waterside no doubt all the younger or feebler broods just hatched out of similar eggs think these innovators dreadfully mistaken you are out of place they feebly pipe see how happy we are in our safe nests perhaps by and by when properly introduced into society we may run about a little on land but to swimnever meanwhile their elder kindred are splashing and diving in ecstasy and so surely as they are born ducklings all the rest will swim in their turn the instinct of the first duck solves the problem for all the rest it is a mere question of time sooner or later all the broods in the most conservative yard will follow their leaders how to make women understand politics an english member of parliament said in a speech some years ago that the stupidest man had a clearer understanding of political questions than the brightest woman he did not find it convenient to say what must be the condition of a nation which for many years has had a woman for its sovereign but he certainly said bluntly what many men feel it is not indeed very hard to find the source of this feeling it is not merely that women are inexperienced in questions of finance or administrative practice for many men are equally ignorant of these but it is undoubtedly true of a large class of more fundamental questionsas for instance of some now pending at washington which even many clearheaded women find it hard to understand while men of far less general training comprehend them entirely questions of the distribution of power for instance between the executive judicial and legislative branches of governmentor between the united states government and those of the separate statesbelong to the class i mean many women of great intelligence show a hazy indistinctness of views when the question arises whether it is the business of the general government to preserve order at the votingplaces at a congressional election for instance as the republicans hold or whether it should be left absolutely in the hands of the state officials as the democrats maintain most women would probably say that so long as order was preserved it made very little difference who did it yet if one goes into a shoeshop or a blacksmiths shop one may hear just these questions discussed in all their bearings by uneducated men and it will be seen that they involve a principle why is this difference does it show some constitutional inferiority in women as to this particular faculty the question is best solved by considering a case somewhat parallel the south carolina negroes were considered very stupid even by many who knew than and they certainly were densely ignorant on many subjects put face to face with a difficult point of finance legislation i think they would have been found to know even less about it than i do yet theabolition of slavery was held in those days by many great statesmen to be a subject so difficult that they shrank from discussing it and nevertheless i used to find that these ignorant men understood it quite clearly in all its bearings offer a bit of sophistry to them try to blind them with false logic on this subject and they would detect it as promptly and answer it as keenly as garrison or phillips would have done and indeed they would give very much the same answers what was the reason not that they were half wise and half stupid but that they were dull where their own interests had not trained them and they were sharp and keen where their own interests were concerned i have no doubt that it will be so with women when they vote about some things they will be slow to learn but about all that immediately concerns themselves they will know more at the very beginning than many wise men have learned since the world began how long it took for englishspeaking men to correct even partially the iniquities of the old common lawbut a parliament of women would have set aside at a single sitting the alleged right of the husband to correct his wife with a stick no bigger than his thumb it took the men of a certain state of this union a good many years to see that it was an outrage to confiscate to the state one half the property of a man who died childless leaving his widow only the other half but a legislature of women would have annihilated that enormity by a single days work i have never seen reason to believe that women on general questions would act more wisely or more conscientiously as a rule than men but selfpreservation is a wonderful quickener of the brain and in all questions bearing on their own rights and opportunities as women it is they who will prove shrewd and keen and men who will prove obtuse as indeed they have usually been another point that adds force to this is the fact that wherever women by their special position have more at stake than usual in public affairs even as now organized they are apt to be equal to the occasion when the men of south carolina were ready to go to war for the staterights doctrines of calhoun the women of that state had also those doctrines at their fingersends at washington where politics make the breath of life you will often find the wives of members of congress following the debates and noting every point gained or lost because these are matters in which they and their families are personally concerned and as for that army of women employed in the departments of the government they are politicians every one because their bread depends upon it the inference is that if women as a class are now unfitted for politics it is because they have not that pressure of personal interest and responsibility by which men are unconsciously trained give this and selfinterest will do the rest aided by that power of conscience and affection which is certainly not less in them than in men even if we claim no more a young lady of my acquaintance opposed woman suffrage in conversation on various grounds one of which was that it would if enacted compel her to read the newspapers which she greatly disliked i pleaded that this was not a fatal objection since many men voted early and often without reading them and in fact without knowing how to read at all she said in reply that this might do for men but that women were far more conscientious and if they were once compelled to vote they would wish to know what they were voting for this seemed to me to contain the whole philosophy of the matter and i respected the keenness of her suggestion though it led me to an opposite conclusion inferior to man and near to angels if it were anywhere the custom to disfranchise persons of superior virtue because of their virtue and to present others with the ballot simply because they had been in the state prisonthen the exclusion of women from political rights would be a high compliment no doubt but i can find no record in history of any such legislation unless so far as it is contained in the doubtful tradition of the tuscan city of pistoia where men are said to have been ennobled as a punishment for crime among us crime may often be a covert means of political prominence but it is not the ostensible ground nor are people habitually struck from the votinglists for performing some rare and eminent service such as saving human life or reading every word of a presidential message if a man has been president of the united states we do not disfranchise him thenceforward if he has been governor we do not declare him thenceforth ineligible to the office of united states senator on the contrary the supposed reward of high merit is to give higher civic privileges sometimes these are even forced on unwilling recipients as when plymouth colony in imposed a fine of twenty pounds on any one who should refuse the office of governor it is utterly contrary to all tradition and precedent therefore to suppose that women have been hitherto disfranchised because of any supposed superiority indeed the theory is selfannihilating and has always involved all supporters in hopeless inconsistency thus the southern slaveholders were wont to argue that a negro was only blest when a slave and there was no such inhumanity as to free him then if a slave happened to save his masters life he was rewarded by emancipation immediately amid general applause the act refuted the theory and so every time we have disfranchised a rebel or presented some eminent foreigner with the freedom of a city we have recognized that enfranchisement after all means honor and disfranchisement implies disgrace i do not see how any woman can avoid a thrill of indignation when she first opens her eyes to the fact that it is really contempt not reverence that has so long kept her sex from an equal share of legal political and educational rights in spite of the duty paid to individual women as mothers in spite of the reverence paid by the greeks and the germanic races to certain women as priestesses and sibyls the fact remains that this sex has been generally recognized in pastages of the human race as stamped by hopeless inferiority not by angelic superiority this is carried so far that a certain taint of actual inferiority is held to attach to women in barbarous nations among certain indian tribes the service of the gods is defiled if a woman but touches the implements of sacrifice and a turk apologizes to a christian physician for the mention of the women of his family in the very phrases used to soften the mention of any degrading creature mr leland tells us that among the english gypsies any object that a woman treads upon or sweeps with the skirts of her dress is destroyed or made away with in some way as unfit for use in reading the history of manners it is easy to trace the steps from this degradation up to the point now attained such as it is yet even the habit of physiological contempt is not gone and i do not see how any one can read history without seeing all around us in society education and politics the tradition of inferiority many laws and usages which in themselves might not strike all women as intrinsically worth striving foras the exclusion of women from colleges or from the ballotboxassume great importance to a womans selfrespect when she sees in these the plain survival of the same contempt that once took much grosser forms and it must be remembered that in civilized communities the cynics who still frankly express this utter contempt are better friends to women than the flatterers who conceal it in the drawingroom and only utter it freely in the lectureroom the club and the north american review contempt at least arouses pride and energy to be sure in the face of history the contemptuous tone in regard to women seems to me untrue unfair and dastardly but like any other extreme injustice it leads to reaction it helps to awaken women from that shallow dream of selfcomplacency into which flattery lulls them there is something tonic in the manly arrogance of fitzjames stephen who derides the thought that the marriage contract can be treated as in any sense a contract between equals but there is something that debilitates in the dulcet counsel given by an anonymous gentleman in an old volume of the ladies magazine that lies before meshe ought to present herself as a being made to please to love and to seek support a being inferior to man and near to angels ix objections to suffrage when you were weak and i was strong i toiled for you now you are strong and i am weak because of my work for you i ask your aid i ask the ballot for myself and my sex as i stood by you i pray you stand by me and mineclara barton appeal to the returned soldiers of the united states written from geneva switzerland by clara barton invalidated by long service in the hospitals and on the field daring the civil war the fact of sex it is constantly said that the advocates of woman suffrage ignore the fact of sex on the contrary they seem to me to be the only people who do not ignore it were there no such thing as sexual difference the wrong done to woman by disfranchisement would be far less it is precisely because her traits habits needs and probable demands are distinct from those of man that she is not never was never can and never will be justly represented by him it is not merely that a vast number of human individuals are disfranchised it is not even because in many of our states the disfranchisement extends to a majority that the evil is so great it is not merely that we disfranchise so many units and tens but we exclude a special element a peculiar power a distinct interest in a word a sex whether this sex is more or less wise more or less important than the other sex does not affect the argument it is a sex and being such is more absolutely distinct from the other than is any mere race from any other race the more you emphasize the fact of sex the more you strengthen our argument if the white man cannot justly represent the negroalthough the two races are now so amalgamated that not even the microscope can always decide to which race one belongshow impossible that one sex should stand in legislation for the other sex this is so clear that so soon as it is stated there is a shifting of the ground but consider the danger of introducing the sexual influence into legislation then we are sure to be confronted with the case of miss vinnie ream the sculptor see how that beguiling damsel cajoled all congress into buying poor statues they say if one woman could do so much how would it be with one hundred precisely the irishmans argument against the use of pillows he had put one feather on a rock and found it a very uncomfortable support grant for the sake of argument that miss ream gave us poor art but what gave her so much power plainly that she was but a single feather congress being composed exclusively of men the mere fact of her sex gave her an exceptional and dangerous influence fill a dozen of the seats in congress with women and that danger at least will be cancelled the taste in art may be no better but an artist will no more be selected for being a pretty girl than now for being a pretty boy so in all such cases here as everywhere it is theadvocate of woman suffrage who wishes to recognize the fact of sex and guard against its perils it is precisely so in education believing boys and girls to be unlike and yet seeing them to be placed by the creator on the same planet and in the same family we hold it safer to follow his method as they are born to interest each other to stimulate each other to excite each other it seems better to let this impulse work itself off in a natural wayto let in upon it the fresh air and the daylight instead of attempting to suppress and destroy it in a mixed school as in a family the fact of sex presents itself as an unconscious healthy mutual stimulus it is in the separate schools that the healthy relation vanishes and the thought of sex becomes a morbid and diseased thing this observation first occurred to me when a pupil and a teacher in boys boardingschools years ago there was such marked superiority as to sexual refinement in the dayscholars who saw their sisters and the friends of their sisters every day all later experience of our publicschool system has confirmed this opinion it is because i believe the distinction of sex to be momentous that i dread to see the sexes educated apart the truth of the whole matter is that nature will have her rights innocently if she can guiltily if she must and it is a little amusing that the writer of an ingenious paper on the other side called sex in politics in an able new york journal puts our case better than i can put it before he gets through only that he is then speaking of wealth not women anybody who considers seriously what is meant by the conflict between labor and capital of which we are only just witnessing the beginning and what is to be done to give money legitimately that influence on legislation which it now exercises illegitimately must acknowledge at once that the next generation will have a thorny path to travel the italics are my own precisely what this writer wishes to secure for money we claim for the disfranchised half of the human race open instead of secret influence the english tradition instead of the french women as rulers not as kings mistresses women as legislators not merely as lobbyists women employing in legitimate form that power which they will otherwise illegitimately wield this is all our demand how will it result it would be a great convenience my hearers said old parson withington of newbury if the moral of a fable could only be written at the beginning of it instead of the end but it never is commonly the only thing to be done is to get hold of a few general principles hold to those and trust that all will turn out well no matter how thoroughly a reform may have been discussednegro emancipation or freetrade for instanceit is a step in the dark at last and the detailed results never turn out to be precisely according to the programme an esteemed correspondent who has written some of the best things yet said in america in behalf of the enfranchisement of woman writes privately to express some solicitude since as she thinks we are not ready for it yet i am convinced she writes of the abstract right of women to vote but all i see of the conduct of the existing women into whose hands this change would throw the power inclines me to hope that this power will not be conceded till education shall have prepared a class of women fit to take the responsibilities gradual emancipation in shortfor fear of trusting truth and justice to take care of themselves who knew when the negroes were set free whether they would at first use their freedom well or ill would they work would they avoid crimes would they justify their freedom the theory of education and preparation seemed very plausible against that there was only the plain theory which elizabeth heyrick first announced to englandimmediate unconditional emancipation the best preparation for freedom is freedom what was true of the negroes then is true of women now the lovelier traits of womanhood writes earnestly our correspondent simplicity faith guilelessness unfit them to conduct public affairs where one must deal with quacks and charlatans we are not all at once as gods knowing good and evil and the very innocency of our lives and the habits of pure homes unfit us to manage a certain class who will flock to this standard but the basis of all republican government is in the assumption that good is ultimately stronger than evil if we once abandon this our theory has gone to pieces at any rate if we hold to it good women are no more helpless and useless than good men the argument that would here disfranchise women has been used before now to disfranchise clergymen i believe that in some states they are still disfranchised and if they are not it is partly because good is found to be as strong as evil after all and partly because clergymen are not found to be so angelically good as to be useless i am very confident that both these truths will be found to apply to women also whatever else happens we may be pretty sure that one thing will the first step towards the enfranchisement of women will blow to the winds the tradition of the angelic superiority of women just so surely as women vote we shall occasionally have women politicians women corruptionists and women demagogues conceding for the sake of courtesy that none such now exist they will be born as inevitably after enfranchisement as the frogs begin to pipe in the spring those who doubt it ignore human nature and if they are not prepared for this fact they had better consider it in season and take sides accordingly in these pages at least they have been warnedwhat then suppose women are not as gods knowing good and evil they are not to be emancipated as gods but as fallible human beings they are to come out of an ignorant innocence that may be only weakness into a wise innocence that will be strength it is too late to remand american women into a turkish or jewish tutelage they have emerged too far not to come farther in a certain sense no doubt the butterfly is safest in the chrysalis when the soft thing begins to emerge the world certainly seems a dangerous place and it is hard to say what will be the result of the emancipation but when she is once half out there is no safety for the pretty creature but to come the rest of the way and i have all the rights i want when dr johnson had published his english dictionary and was asked by a lady how he chanced to make a certain mistake that she pointed out he answered ignorance madam pure ignorance i always feel disposed to make the same comment on the assertion of any woman that she has all the rights she wants for every woman is or may be or might have been a mother and when she comes to know that even now in many parts of the union a married mother has no legal right to her child i should think her tongue would cleave to her mouth before she would utter those foolish words again all the things i ever heard or read against slavery did not fix in my soul such a hostility to it as a single scene in a missouri slavejail many years ago as i sat there a purchaser came in to buy a little girl to wait on his wife three little sisters were brought in from eight to twelve years old they were mulattoes with sweet gentle manners they had evidently been taken good care of and their pink calico frocks were clean and whole the gentleman chose one of them and then asked her goodnaturedly enough if she did not wish to go with him she burst into tears and said i want to stay with my mother but her tears were as powerless of course as so many salt drops from the ocean that was all but all the horrors of uncle toms cabin the stories told me by fugitive slaves the scarred backs i afterwards saw by dozens among colored recruits did not impress me as did that hour in the jail the whole probable career of that poor wronged motherless shrinking child passed before me in fancy it seemed to me that a man must be utterly lost to all manly instincts who would not give his life to overthrow such a system it seemed to me that the woman who could tolerate much less defend it could not herself be true could not be pure or must be fearfully and grossly ignorant you acquiesce fair lady you say it was horrible indeed but thank god it is past past is it so past if you please as to the law of slavery but as to the legal position of woman still a fearful reality it is not many years since a scene took place in a boston courtroom before chief justice chapman which was worse in this respect than that scene in st louis inasmuch as the mother was present when the child was taken away and the wrong was sanctioned by the highest judicial officer of the state two little girls who had been taken from their mother by their guardian their father being dead had taken refuge with her against his wishes and he brought them into court under a writ of habeas corpus and the court awarded them to him as against their mother the little ones were very much affected says the boston herald by the result of the decision which separated them from their mother and force was required to remove them from the courtroom the distress of the mother was also very evident there must have been some special reason you say for such a seeming outrage she was a bad woman no she was a lady of the highest respectability no charge was made against her but being left a widow she had married again and for that and that only so far as appears the court took from her the guardianship of her own childrenbone of her bone and flesh of her flesh the children for whom she had borne the deepest physical agony of womanhoodand awarded them to somebody else you say but her second husband might have misused the children might so the guardian might and that where they had no mother to protect them had the father been left a widower he might have made a halfdozen successive marriages have brought stepmother after stepmother to control these children and no court could have interfered the father is recognized before the law as the natural guardian of the children the mother even though she be left a widow is not the consequence is a series of outrages of which only a few scattered instances come before the public just as in slavery out of a hundred little girls sold away from their parents only one case might ever be mentioned in any newspaper this case led to an alteration of the law in massachusetts but the same thing might yet happen in some states of the union the possibility of a single such occurrence shows that there is still a fundamental wrong in the legal position of woman and the fact that most women do not know it only deepens the wrongas dr channing said of the contentment of the southern slaves the mass of men even of lawyers pass by such things as they formerly passed by the facts of slavery there is no lasting remedy for these wrongs except to give woman the political power to protect herself there never yet existed a race nor a class nor a sex which was noble enough to be trusted with political power over another sex or class or race it is for selfdefence that woman needs the ballot and in view of a single such occurrence as i have given i charge that woman who professes to have all the rights she wants either with a want of all feeling of motherhood or with ignorance madam pure ignorancesense enough to vote there is one special point on which men seem to me rather insincere toward women when they speak to women the objection made to their voting is usually that they are too angelic but when men talk to each other the general assumption is that women should not vote because they have not brains enough or as old theophilus parsons wrote a century ago have not a sufficient acquired discretion it is an important difference because if women are too angelic to vote they can only be fitted for it by becoming more wicked which is not desirable on the other hand if there is no objection but the want of brains then our public schools are equalizing that matter fast enough still there are plenty of people who have never got beyond this objection listen to the first discussion that you encounter among men on this subject wherever they may congregate does it turn upon the question of saintliness or of brains let us see i travelled the other day upon the boston and providence railroad with a party of mechanics mostly english and scotch they were discussing this very question and with the true english habit thought it was all a matter of property without it a woman certainly should not vote they said but they all favored to my surprise the enfranchisement of women of property as a general rule said the chief speaker a woman thats got property has got sense enough to vote there it was these foreigners who had found their own manhood by coming to a land which not only the pilgrim fathers but the pilgrim mothers had settled and subdued and freed for them were still ready to disfranchise most of the daughters of those mothers on the ground that they had not sense enough to vote i thanked them for their blunt truthfulness so much better than the flattery of most of the nativeborn my other instance shall be a conversation overheard in a railway station near boston between two intelligent citizens who had lately listened to anna dickinson the best of it was said one to see our minister introduce her wonder what the orthodox churches would have said to that ten years ago said the other never mind was the answer things have changed what i think is its all in the bringing up if women were brought up just as men are theyd have just as much brains brains again thats what beecher says boys are brought up to do business and take care of themselves thats where it is girls are brought up to dress and get married start em alike thats what beecher says start em alike and see if girls havent got just as much brains still harping on my daughter and on the condition of her brains it is on this that the whole question turns in the opinion of many men ask ten men their objections to woman suffrage one will plead that women are angels another fears discord in families another points out that women cannot fight he himself being very likely a noncombatant another quotes st paul for this purposenot being perhaps in the habit of consulting that authority on any other point but with the others very likely everything will turn on the question of brains they believe or think they believe that women have not sense enough to vote they may not say so to women but they habitually say it to men if you wish to meet the common point of view of masculine voters you must find it here it is fortunate that it is so of all points this is the easiest to settle for every intelligent woman even if she be opposed to woman suffrage helps to settle it every good lecture by a woman every good book written by one every successful business enterprise carried on helps to decide the question every class of girls that graduates from every good school helps to pile up the argument on this point and the vast army of women constituting nine out of ten of the teachers in our american schools may appeal as logically to their pupils and settle the argument based on brains if we had sense enough to educate you they may say to each graduating class of boys we have sense enough to vote beside you the ladies actively working to secure the cooperation of their sex in caucuses and citizens conventions are not actuated by love of notoriety and are not therefore to be classed with the absolute woman suffragistsboston daily transcript sept an infelicitous epithet when the eloquent colored abolitionist charles remond once said upon the platform that george washington having been a slaveholder was a villain wendell phillips remonstrated by saying charles the epithet is not felicitous reformers are apt to be pelted with epithets quite as illchosen how often has the charge figured in history that they were actuated by love of notoriety the early christians it was generally believed took a positive pleasure in being thrown to the lions under the influence of this motive and at a later period there was a firm conviction that the huguenots consented readily to being broken on the wheel or sawed in pieces between two boards and felt amply rewarded by the pleasure of being talked about during the whole antislavery movement while the abolitionists were mobbed fined and imprisonedwhile they were tabooed by good society depleted of their money kept out of employment by the mere fact of their abolitionismthere never was a moment when their motive was not considered bymany persons to be the love of notoriety why should the advocates of woman suffrage expect any different treatment now it is not necessary in order to dispose of this charge to claim that all reformers are heroes or saints even in the infancy of any reform it takes along with it some poor material and unpleasant traits are often developed by the incidents of the contest doubtless many reformers attain to a certain enjoyment of a fight at last it is one of the dangerous tendencies which those committed to this vocation must resist but so far as my observation goes those who engage in reform for the sake of notoriety generally hurt the reform so much that they render it their chief service when they leave it and this happy desertion usually comes pretty early in their career the besetting sin of reformers is not so far as i can judge the love of notoriety but the fate of power and of flattery within their own small circlea temptation quite different from the other both in its origin and its results notoriety comes so soon to a reformer that its charms whatever they may be soon pall upon the palate just as they do in case of a popular poet or orator who is so used to seeing himself in print that he hardly notices it i suppose there is no young person so modest that he does not on first seeing his name in a newspaper cut out the passage with a certain tender solicitude and perhaps purchase a few extra copies of the fortunate journal but when the same person has been battered by a score or two of years in successive unpopular reforms i suppose that he not only would leave the paper uncut or unpurchased but would hardly take the pains even to correct a misstatement were it asserted that he had inherited a fortune or murdered his grandmother the moral is that the love of notoriety is soon amply filled in a reformers experience and that he will not as a rule sacrifice home and comfort money and friends without some stronger inducement this is certainly true of most of the men who have interested themselves in this particular movement the weakminded men as the reporters with witty antithesis still describe them and it must be much the same with the strongminded women who share their base career and it is to be remembered above all that considered as an engine for obtaining notoriety the womansuffrage agitation is a great waste of energy the same net result could have been won with far less expenditure in other ways there is not a woman connected with it who could not have achieved far more real publicity as a manager of charity fairs or as a sensation letterwriter she could have done this too with far less trouble without the loss of a single genteel friend without forfeiting a single social attention without having a single illnatured thing said about herexcept perhaps that she bored people a charge to which the highest and lowest forms of prominence are equally open nay she might have done even more than this if notoriety was her sole aim for she might have become a variety minstrel or a female pedestrian she might have written a scandalous novel she might have got somebody to aim at her that harmless pistol which has helped the fame of so many a wandering actress while its bullet somehow never hits anything but the wall all this she might have done and obtained a notoriety beyond doubt instead of this she has preferred to prowl about picking up a precarious publicity by giving lectures to willing lyceums writing books for eager publishers organizing schools setting up hospitals and achieving for her sex something like equal rights before the law either she has shown herself as a seeker after notoriety to be a most foolish or illjudging person or else as was said of washingtons being a villain the epithet is not felicitous the rob roy theory the saturday review in an article which denounces all equality in marriage laws and all plans of woman suffrage admits frankly the practical obstacles in the way of the process of voting possibly the presence of women as voters would tend still further to promote order than has been done by the ballot it plants itself wholly on one objection which goes far deeper thusif men choose to say that women are not their equals women have nothing to do but to give in physical force the ultimate basis of all society and all government must be on the side of the men and those who have the key of the position will not consent permanently to abandon it it is a great pleasure when an opponent of justice is willing to fall back thus frankly upon the rob roy theorythe good old rule sufficeth him the simple plan that they should take who have the power and they should keep who can it is easy i think to show that the theory is utterly false and that the basis of civilized society is not physical force but on the contrary brains in the city where the saturday review is published there are three regiments of guards which are the boast of the english army and are believed by their officers to be the finest troops in the world they have deteriorated in size since the crimean war but i believe that the men of one regiment still average six feet two inches in height and i am sure thatnobody ever saw them in line without noticing the contrast between these magnificent men and the comparatively puny officers who command them these officers are from the highest social rank in england the governing classes and if it were the whole object of this military organization to give a visible proof of the utter absurdity of the saturday reviews theory it could not be better done there is no country in europe i suppose where the hereditary aristocracy is physically equal to that of england or where the intellectual class has so good a physique but set either the house of lords or the saturday review contributors upon a handtohand fight against an equal number of navvies or costermongers and the patricians would have about as much chance as a crew of vassar girls in a boatrace with yale or harvard take the men of england alone and it is hardly too much to say that physical force instead of being the basis of political power in any class is apt to be found in inverse ratio to it in case of revolution the strength of the governing class in any country is not in its physical but in its mental power rank and money and the power to influence and organize and command are merely different modifications of mental training brought to bear by somebody in our country without class distinctions the same truth can be easily shown physical power lies mainly in the hands of the masses wherever a class or profession possesses more than its numerical share of power it has usually less than its proportion of physical vigor this is easily shown from the vast body of evidence collected during our civil war in the volume containing the medical statistics of the provost marshal generals bureau we have the tabulated reports of about persons subject to draft and of about recruits substitutes and drafted men showing the precise physical condition of more than a million men it appears that out of the whole number examined rather more than in each were found unfit for military service it is curious to see how generally the physical power among these men is in inverse ratio to the social and political prominence of the class they represent out of unskilled laborers for instance only are physically disqualified among tanners only among ironworkers on the other hand among lawyers out of are disqualified among journalists among clergymen grave divines are horrified at the thought of admitting women to vote since they cannot fight though not one in twenty of their own number is fit for military duty if he volunteered of the editors who denounce woman suffrage only about one in four could himself carry a musket while of the lawyers who fill congress the majority could not be defenders of their country but could only be defended if we were to distribute political power with reference to the physical basis which the saturday review talks about it would be a wholly new distribution and would put things more hopelessly upside down than did the worst phase of the french commune if then a political theory so utterly breaks down when applied to men why should we insist on resuscitating it in order to apply it to women the truth is that as civilization advances the world is governed more and more unequivocally by brains and whether those brains are deposited in a strong body or a weak one becomes a matter of less and less importance but it is only in the very first stage of barbarism that mere physical strength makes mastery and the long head has controlled the long arm since the beginning of recorded time and it must be remembered that even these statistics very imperfectly represent the case they do not apply to the whole male sex but actually to the picked portion only to the men presumed to be of military age excluding the very old and the very young were these included the proportion unfit for military duty would of course be far greater moreover it takes no account of courage or cowardice patriotism or zeal how much all these considerations tell upon the actual proportion may be seen from the fact that in the town where i am writing for instance out of some twelve thousand inhabitants and about three thousand voters there are only some three hundred who actually served in the civil wara number too small to exert a perceptible influence on any local election when we see the community yielding up its voting power into the hands of those who have actually done military service it will be time enough to exclude women for not doing such service if the alleged physical basis operates as an exclusion of all noncombatants it should surely give a monopoly to the actual combatants the votes of noncombatants the tendency of modern society is not to concentrate power in the hands of the few but to give a greater and greater share to the many read froissarts chronicles and scotts novels of chivalry and you will see how thoroughly the difference between patrician and plebeian was then a difference of physical strength the knight being better nourished and better trained was apt to be the bodily superior of the peasant to begin with and this strength was reinforced by armor weapons horse castle and all the resources of feudal warfare with this greater strength went naturally the assumption of greater political power to the heroes of ivanhoe or the fair maid of perth it would have seemed as absurd that yeomen and lackeys should have any share in the government as it would seem to the members in an american legislature that women should have any such share in a contest of mailed knights any number of unarmed men were but so many women as sir philip sidney said the wolf asketh not how many the sheep may be but time and advancing civilization have tended steadily in one direction he giveth power to the weak and to them who have no might he increaseth strength every step in the extension of political rights has consisted in opening them to a class hitherto humbler from kings to nobles from nobles to burghers from burghers to yeomen in short from strong to weak from high to low from rich to poor all this is but the unconscious following out of one sure principlethatlegislation is mainly for the protection of the weak against the strong and that for this purpose the weak must be directly represented the strong are already protected by their strength it is the weak who need all the vantageground that votes and legislatures can give them the feudal chiefs were stronger without laws than with them take care of yourselves in sutherland was the anxious message of the old highlander the law has come as far as tain it was the peaceful citizen who needed the guaranty of law against brute force but can laws be executed without brute force not without a certain amount of it but that amount under civilization grows less and less just in proportion as the masses are enfranchised statutes execute themselves without crossing bayonets in a republic said de tocqueville if laws are not always respectable they are always respected if every step in freedom has brought about a more peaceable state of society why should that process stop at this precise point besides there is no possibility in nature of a political division in which all the men shall be on one side and all the women on the other the mutual influence of the sexes forbids it the very persons who hint at such a fear refute themselves at other times by arguing that women will always be sufficiently represented by men or that every woman will vote as her husband thinks and it will merely double the numbers as a matter of fact the law will prevail in all englishspeaking nations a few men fighting for it will be stronger than many fighting against it and if those few have both the law and the women on their side there will be no trouble the truth is that in this age cedant arma togae it is the civilian who rules on the throne or behind it and who makes the fightingmen his mere agents yonder policeman at the corner looks big and formidable he protects the women and overawes the boys but away in some corner of the city hill there is some quiet man out of uniform perhaps a consumptive or a dyspeptic or a cripple who can overawe the burliest policeman by his authority as city marshal or as mayor so an army is but a larger police and its official head is that plain man at the white house who makes or unmakes not merely brevetbrigadiers but majorgenerals in commandwho can by the stroke of the pen convert the most powerful man of the army into the most powerless take away the occupant of the position and put in a woman and will she become impotent because her name is elizabeth or maria theresa it is brains that more and more govern the world and whether those brains be on the throne or at the ballotbox they will soon make the owners sex a subordinate affair if woman is also strong in the affections so much the better win the hearts of your subjects said lord burleigh to queen elizabeth and you will have their hands and purses war is the last appeal and happily in these days the rarest appeal of statesmanship in the multifarious other duties that make up statesmanship we cannot spare the brains the selfdevotion and the enthusiasm of woman one of the most important treaties of modern history the peace of cambray in was negotiated after previous attempts had failed by two womenmargaret aunt of charles v and louisa mother of francis i voltaire said that christina of sweden was the only sovereign of her time who maintained the dignity of the throne against mazarin and richelieu frederick the great said that the seven years war was waged against three womenelizabeth of russia maria theresa and mme pompadour there is nothing impotent in the statesmanship of women when they are admitted to exercise it they are only powerless for good when they are obliged to obtain by wheedling and flattery a sway that should be recognized responsible and limited manners repeal laws there is in boswells life of johnson a correspondence which is well worth reading by both advocates and opponents of woman suffrage boswell who was of an old scotch family had a difference of opinion with his father about an entailed estate which had descended to them boswell wished the title so adjusted as to cut off all possibility of female heirship his father on the other hand wished to recognize such a contingency boswell wrote to johnson in for advice urging a series of objections physiological and moral to the inheritance of a family estate by a woman though as he magnanimously admits they should be treated with great affection and tenderness and always participate of the prosperity of the family dr johnson for a wonder took the other side defended female heirship and finally summed up thus it cannot but occur that women have natural and equitable claims as well as men and these claims are not to be capriciously or lightly superseded or infringed when fiefs inspired military service it is easily discerned why females could not inherit them but the reason is at an end as manners make laws so manners likewise repeal them this admirable statement should be carefully pondered by those who hold that suffrage should be only coextensive with military duty the position that woman cannot properly vote because she cannot fight for her vote efficiently is precisely like the position of feudalism and of boswell that she could not properly hold real estate because she could not fight for it each position may have had some plausibility in its day but the same current of events has made each obsolete those who in these days believe in giving woman the ballot argue precisely as dr johnson did in times have changed manners have softened education has advanced public opinion now acts more forcibly and the reference to physical force though still implied is implied more and more remotely the political event of the age the overthrow of american slavery would not have been accomplished without the secular arm of grant and sherman let us agree but neither would it have been accomplished without the moral power of garrison the nonresistant and harriet beecherstowe the woman when the work is done it is unfair to disfranchise any of the participants dr johnson was right when fiefs or votes implied military service it is easily discerned why women should not inherit or possess them but the reason is at an end as manners make laws so manners likewise repeal them under the feudal system it would have been absurd that women should hold real estate for the next armed warrior could dispossess her by gail hamiltons reasoning it is equally absurd now one man is stronger than one woman and ten men are stronger than ten women and the nineteen millions of men in this country will subdue capture and execute or expel the nineteen millions of women just as soon as they set about it very well why then do not all the landless men in a town unite and take away the landed property of all the women simply because we now live in civilized society and under a reign of law because those mens respect for law is greater than their appetite for property or if you prefer because even those landless men know that their own interest lies in the longrun on the side of law it will be precisely the same with voting when any community is civilized up to the point of enfranchising women it will be civilized up to the point of sustaining their vote as it now sustains their property rights by the whole material force of the community when the thing is once established it will no more occur to anybody that a womans vote is powerless because she cannot fight than it now occurs to anybody that her title to real estate is invalidated by the same circumstance woman is in the world she cannot be got rid of she must be a serf or an equal there is no middle ground we have outgrown the theory of serfdom in a thousand ways and may as well abandon the whole women have now a place in society their influence will be exerted at any rate in war and in peace legally or illegally and it had better be exerted in direct legitimate and responsible methods than in ways that are dark and by tricks that have not even the merit of being plain dangerous voters one of the few plausible objections brought against womens voting is this that it would demoralize the suffrage by letting in very dangerous voters that virtuous women would not vote and vicious women would it is a very unfounded alarm for in the first place our institutions restif they have any basis at allon this principle that good is stronger than evil that the majority of men really wish to vote rightly and that only time and patience are needed to get the worst abuses righted how any one can doubt this who watches the course of our politics i do not see in spite of the great disadvantage of having masses of ignorant foreign voters to deal withand of native black voters who have been purposely kept in ignorancewe certainly see wrongs gradually righted and the truth by degrees prevail even the one great exceptional case of new york city has been reached at last and the very extent of the evil has brought its own cure now why should this triumph of good over evil be practicable among men and not apply to women also it must be either because women as a class are worse than menwhich will hardly be assertedor because for some special reason bad women have an advantage over good women such as has no parallel in the other sex but i do not see how this can be let us consider it is certain that good women are not less faithful and conscientious than good men it is generally admitted that those most opposed to suffrage will very soon on being fully enfranchised feel it their duty to vote they may at first misuse the right through ignorance but they certainly will not shirk it it is this conscientious habit on which i rely without fear never yet when public duty required have american women failed to meet the emergency and i am not afraid of it now moreover when they are once enfranchised and their votes are needed all the men who now oppose or ridicule the demand for suffrage will begin to help them to exercise it when the wives are once enfranchised you may be sure that the husbands will not neglect those of their own household they will provide them with ballots vehicles and policemen and will contrive to make the votingplaces pleasanter than many parlors and quieter than some churches on the other hand it seems altogether probable that the very worst women so far from being ostentatious in their wickedness upon election day will on the contrary so disguise and conceal themselves as to deceive the very elect and if it were possible the very policemen for whatever party they may vote they will contribute to make the votingplaces as orderly as railway stations these covert ways are the very habit of their lives at least by daylight and the women who have of late done the most conspicuous and open mischief in our community have done it not in their true character as evil but on the contrary under a mask of elevated purpose that women when they vote will commit their full share of errors i have always maintained but that they will collectively misuse their power seems to me out of the question and that the good women are going to stay at home and let bad women do the voting appears quite as incredible in fact if they do thus it is a fair question whether the epithets good and bad ought not politically speaking to change places for it naturally occurs to every one on election day that the man who votes even if he votes wrong is really a better man so far as political duties go than the very loftiest saint who stays at home and prays that other people may vote right and it is hard to see why it should be otherwise with womenhow women will legislate it is often said that when women vote their votes will make no difference in the count became they will merely duplicate the votes of their husbands and brothers then these same objectors go on and predict all sorts of evil things for which women will vote quite apart from their husbands and brothers moreover the evils thus predicted are apt to be diametrically opposite thus goldwin smith predicts that women will be governed by priests and then goes on to predict that women will vote to abolish marriage not seeing that these two predictions destroy each other on the other hand i think that the advocates of woman suffrage often err by claiming too muchas that all women will vote for peace for total abstinence against slavery and the rest it seems better to rest the argument on general principles and not to seek to prophesy too closely the only thing which i feel safe in predicting is that woman suffrage will be used as it should be for the protection of woman selfrespect and selfprotectionthese are as has been already said the two great things for which woman needs the ballot it is not in the nature of things i take it that a class politically subject can obtain justice from the governing class not the least of the benefits gained by political equality for the colored people of the south is that the laws now generally make no difference of color in penalties for crime in slavery times there were dozens of crimes which were punished more severely by the statute if committed by a slave or a free negro than if done by a white i feel very sure that under the reign of impartial suffrage we should see fewer such announcements as this which i cut from a late new york evening expresslast night capt lowery of the twentyseventh precinct made a descent upon the dancehouse in the basement of greenwich street and arrested fiftytwo men and eight women the entire batch was brought before justice flammer at the tombs police court this morning louise maud the proprietoress was held in five hundred dollars bail to answer at the court of general sessions the fiftytwo men were fined three dollars each all but twelve paying at once and the eight women were fined ten dollars each and sent to the island for one month the italics are my own when we reflect that this dancehouse whatever it was was unquestionably sustained for the gratification of men rather than of women when we consider that every one of these fiftytwo men came there in all probability by his own free will and to spend money not to earn it and that probably a majority of the women were driven there by necessity or betrayal or force or despairit would seem that even an equal punishment would have been cruel injustice to the women but when we observe how trifling a penalty was three dollars each to these men whose money was likely to go for riotous living in some form and forty of whom had the amount of the fine in their pockets and how hopelessly large an amount was ten dollars each to women who did not probably own even the clothes they wore and who were to be sent to prison for a month in additionwe see a kind of injustice which would stand a fair chance of being righted i suspect if women came into power not that they would punish their own sex less severely probably they would not but they would put men more on a level as to the penalty it may be said that no such justice is to be expected from women because women in what is called society condemn women for mere imprudence and excuse men for guilt but it must be remembered that in society guilt is rarely a matter of open proof and conviction in case of men it is usually a matter of surmise and it is easy for either love or ambition to set the surmise aside and to assume that the worst reprobate is only a little wild in fact as margaret fuller pointed out years ago how little conception has a virtuous woman as to what a dissipated young man really is but let that same woman be a portia in the judgmentseat or even a legislator or a voter and let her have the unmistakable and actual offender before her and i do not believe that she will excuse him for a paltry fine and give the less guilty woman a penalty more than quadruple women will also be sure to bring special sympathy and intelligent attention to the wrongs of children who can read without shame and indignation this report from the new york herald the childselling case peter hallock committed on a charge of abducting lena dinser a young girl thirteen years old whom it was alleged her father george dinser had sold to hallock for purposes of prostitution was again brought yesterday before judge westbrook in the supreme court chambers on the writ of habeas corpus previously obtained by mr william f howe the prisoners counsel mr howe claimed that hallock could not be held on either section of the statute for abduction under the first section the complaint he insisted should set forth that the child was taken contrary to the wish and against the consent of her parents on the contrary the evidence he urged showed that the father was a willing party under the second section it was contended that the prisoner could not be held as there was no averment that the girl was of previous chaste character judge westbrook a brief counter argument having been made by mr dana held that the points of mr howe were well taken and ordered the prisoners dischargehere was a father who as the newspapers allege had previously sold two other daughters body and soul and against whom the evidence seemed to be in this case clear yet through the defectiveness of the statute or the remissness of the prosecuting attorney he goes free without even a trial to carry on his infamous traffic for other children grant that the points were technically well taken and irresistiblethough this is by no means certainit is very sure that there should be laws that should reach such atrocities with punishment whether the father does or does not consent to his childs ruin and that public sentiment should compel prosecuting officers to be as careful in framing their indictments where human souls are at stake as where the question is of dollars only it is upon such matters that the influence of women will make itself felt in legislation individuals vs classes as the older arguments against woman suffrage are abandoned we hear more and more of the final objection that the majority of women have not yet expressed themselves on the subject it is common for such reasoners to make the remark that if they knew a given number of womensay fifty or a hundred or five hundredwho honestly wished to vote they would favor it produce that number of unimpeachable names and they say that they have reconsidered the matter and must demand moreperhaps ten thousand bring ten thousand and the demand again rises prove that the majority of women wish to vote and they shall vote precisely we say give us a chance to prove it by taking a vote and they answer by no means and in a certain sense they are right it ought not to be settled that wayby dealing with woman as a class and taking the vote the agitators do not merely claim the right of suffrage for her as a class they claim it for each individual woman without reference to any other if there is only one woman in the nation who claims the right to vote she ought to have it in oriental countries all legislation is for classes and in england it is still mainly so a man is expected to remain in the station in which he is born or if he leaves it it is by a distinct process and he comes under the influence in various ways of different laws if the iniquities of the contagious diseases act in england for instance had not been confined in their legal application to the lower social grades the act would never have passed it was easy for men of the higher classes to legislate away the modesty of women of the lower classes but if the daughter of an earl could have been arrested and submitted to a surgical examination at the will of any policeman as the daughter of a mechanic might be the law would not have stood a day so through all our slave states there was class legislation for every person of negro blood the laws of crime of punishment of testimony were all adapted to classes not individuals emancipation swept this all away in most cases classes ceased to exist before the law so far as men at least were concerned there were only individuals the more progress the less class in legislation we claim the application of this principle as rapidly as possible to women our community does not refuse permission for women to go unveiled till it is proved that the majority of women desire it it does not even ask that question if one woman wishes to show her face it is allowed if a woman wishes to travel alone to walk the streets alone the police protects her in that liberty she is not thrust back into her house with the reproof my dear madam at this particular moment the overwhelming majority of women are indoors prove that they all wish to come out and you shall come on the contrary she comes forth at her own sweet will the policeman helps her tenderly across the street and waves back with imperial gesture the obtrusive coalcart some of us claim for each individual woman in the same way not merely the right to go shopping but to go voting not merely to show her face but to show her hand there will always be many women as there are many men who are indifferent to voting for a time perhaps always there will be a larger percentage of this indifference among women but the natural right to a share in the government under which one lives and to a voice in making the laws under which one may be hangedthis belongs to each woman as an individual and she is quite right to claim it as she needs it even though the majority of her sex still prefer to take their chance of the penalty without perplexing themselves about the law the demand of every enlightened woman who asks for the ballotlike the demand of every enlightened slave for freedomis an individual demand and the question whether they represent the majority of their class has nothing to do with it for a republic like ours does not profess to deal with classes but with individuals since the whole people covenants with each citizen and each citizen with the whole people for the common good as the constitution of massachusetts says and fortunately there is such power in an individual demand that it appeals to thousands whom no abstract right touches five minutes with frederick douglass settled the question for any thoughtful person of that mans right to freedom let any woman of position desire to enter what is called the lecturefield to support herself and her children and at once all abstract objections to womens speaking in public disappear her friends may be never so hostile to the cause but they espouse her individual cause the most conservative clergyman subscribes for tickets but begs that his name may not be mentioned they do not admit that women as a class should speaknot they but for this individual woman they throng the hall mrs dahlgren abhors politics a woman in congress a woman in the committeeroomwhat can be more objectionable but i observe that when mrs dahlgren wishes to obtain more profit by her husbands inventions all objections vanish she can appeal to congressmen she can address committees she can i hope prevailthe individual ranks first in our sympathy we do not wait to take the census of the class make way for the individual whether it be mrs dahlgren pleading for the rights of property or lucy stone pleading for the rights of the mother to her child defeats before victories after one of the early defeats in the war of the rebellion the commander of a massachusetts regiment wrote home to his father i wish people would not write us so many letters of condolence our defeat seemed to trouble them much more than it troubles us did people suppose there were to be no ups and downs we expect to lose plenty of battles but we have enlisted for the war it is just so with every successful reform while enemies and halffriends are proclaiming its defeats those who advocate it are rejoicing that they have at last got an army into the field to be defeated unless this war is to be an exception to all others even the fact of having joined battle is a great deal it is the first step defeat first a good many defeats if you please victory by and by william wilberforce writing to a friend in the year said i continue faithful to the measure of parliamentary reform brought forward by mr pitt i am firmly persuaded that at present a prodigious majority of the people of this country are adverse to the measure in my view so far from being an objection to the discussion this is rather a recommendation in the reform bill was passed in the first parliamentary debate on the slave trade colonel tarleton who boasted to have killed more men than any one in england pointing to wilberforce and others said the inspiration began on that side of the house then turning round the revolution has reached to this also and reached to the height of fanaticism and frenzy the first vote in the house of commons in after arguments in the affirmative by wilberforce pitt fox and burke stood ayes noes majority against the measure in the slave trade was abolished and in slavery in the british colonies followed and even on the very night when the latter bill passed the abolitionists were taunted by gladstone the great demerara slaveholder with having toiled for forty years and done nothing the roman catholic relief bill establishing freedom of thought in england had the same experience it passed in by a majority of a hundred and three in the house of lords which had nine months before refused by a majority of fortyfive to take up the question at all the english corn laws went down a quarter of a century ago after a similar career of failures in there were hundreds of thousands in england who thought that to attack the corn laws was to attack the very foundations of society lord melbourne the prime minister said in parliament that he had heard of many mad things in his life but before god the idea of repealing the corn laws was the very maddest thing of which he had ever heard lord john russell counselled the house to refuse to hear evidence on the operation of the corn laws six years after in they were abolished forever how wendell phillips in the antislavery meetings used to lash proslavery men with such formidable facts as theseand to quote how clay and calhoun and webster and everett had pledged themselves that slavery should never be discussed or had proposed that those who discussed it should be imprisoned while in spite of them all the great reform was moving on and the abolitionists were forcing politicians and people to talk like sternes starling nothing but slavery we who were trained in the light of these great agitations have learned their lesson we expect to march through a series of defeats to victory the first thing is as in the antislavery movement so to arouse the public mind as to make this the central question given this prominence and it is enough for this year or for many years to come wellington said that there was no such tragedy as a victory except a defeat on the other hand the next best thing to a victory is a defeat for it shows that the armies are in the field without the unsuccessful attempt of today no success tomorrow when mrs frances anne kemble came to this country she was amazed to find americans celebrating the battle of bunker hill which she had always heard claimed as a victory for king george such it was doubtless called but what we celebrated was the fact that the americans there threw up breastworks stood their ground fired away their ammunitionand were defeated thus the reformer too looking at his failures often sees in them such a step forward that they are the bunker hill of a new revolution give us plenty of such defeats and we can afford to wait a score of years for the victories they will come
