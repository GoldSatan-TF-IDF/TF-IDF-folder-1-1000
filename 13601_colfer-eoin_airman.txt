eoin colfer airman copyright eoin colfer for declan dempsey prologue conor broekhart was born to fly or more accurately he was born flying though broekharts legend is littered with fantastical stories the tale of his first flight in the summer of would be the most difficult to believe had there not been thousands of witnesses in fact an account of his birth in a hotair balloon can be read in the archives of the french newspaper le petit journal available to all for a small fee at the librairie nationale above the article there is a faded blackandwhite photograph it is remarkably sharp for the period and was taken by a newspaperman who happened to be in the trocadéro gardens at the time with his camera captain declan broekhart is easily recognizable in the picture as is his wife catherine he handsome in his crimsonandgold saltee island sharpshooters uniform she shaken but smiling and there protected in the crook of his fathers elbow lies baby conor already with a head of blond broekhart hair and his mothers wide intelligent brow no more than ten minutes old and through some trick of the light or photographic mishap it seems as though conors eyes are focused impossible of course but imagine if somehow they had been then baby conors first sight would have been a cloudless french sky flashing by little wonder he became what he became paris summer of the world fair was to be the most spectacular ever seen with over exhibitors from every corner of the world captain declan broekhart had travelled to france from the saltee islands at his kings insistence catherine had accompanied him at her own request as she was the scientist in the family and longed to see for herself the much heralded galerie des machines which showcased inventions promising to make the future a better one king nicholas had sent them to paris to investigate the possibility of a balloon division for the saltee wall on the third day of their trip the pair took a buggy along the avenue de lopéra to observe the aeronautical departments balloon demonstration in the trocadéro gardens do you feel that asked catherine she took her husbands hand and placed it on her stomach our son is kicking to be free he longs to witness these miracles for himself declan laughed he or she will have to wait the world will still be here in six weeks when the broekharts arrived at the trocadéro gardens they found the aeronautical squadron in the shadow of the statue of liberty or rather that of her head the statue would be presented to the united states when completed but for now lady libertys head alone was being showcased the copper structure dwarfed most of the fairs other exhibits and it was amazing to imagine how colossal the assembled statue would be when it finally stood guard over new york citys harbour the aeronautical squadron had inflated a dirigible balloon on a patch of lawn and was politely holding the crowd back with a velvet rope declan broekhart approached the soldier on sentry duty and handed him his sealed letter of introduction from the french ambassador to the saltee islands within minutes they were joined by the squadrons captain victor vigny vigny was lithe and tanned with a crooked nose and a crown of jetblack hair that stood erect on his scalp like the head of a yard brush bonjour captain broekhart he said removing one white glove and shaking the saltee island officers hand warmly we have been expecting you the frenchman bowed deeply and this must be madame broekhart vigny checked the letter in mock confusion but madame nowhere here does it say how beautiful you are the frenchmans smile was so charming that the broekharts could not take offence well captain said vigny sweeping back his arm dramatically to introduce his balloon i give you le soleil the sun what do you think of her the dirigible was undeniably magnificent an elongated golden envelope swaying gently over its leatherbound basket but declan broekhart was not interested in decoration he was interested in specification a bit more pointed than others lve seen he noted aérodynamiqué corrected vigny she glides across the sky like her namesake catherine unhooked herself from her husbands arm a cottonsilk blend she said craning her head back to squint at the balloon and twin screws on the basket a neat piece of work how fast does she travel vigny was surprised to hear such technical observations from a female but he disguised his shock with a few rapid blinks then smoothly delivered his answer ten miles an hour with the help of god and a fair wind catherine peeled back a corner of leather revealing the woven basket underneath wicker and willow she said makes a nice cushion vigny was enchanted yes absolument this basket will last for five hundred hours in the sky french baskets are the best in the world très bien said catherine she hoisted her petticoats and climbed the wooden steps to the basket displaying remarkable agility for a woman eight months pregnant both men stepped forward to object but catherine did not give them time to speak i dare say i know more about the science of aeronautics than both of you and i really dont think i have crossed the celtic sea to stand in a glorified field while my husband experiences one of the wonders of the world catherine was perfectly calm as she made this statement but only a dullard could have missed the steel in her voice declan sighed very well catherine if captain vigny permits it vignys only answer was a gallic shrug that said permit it i pity the man who tries to stand in this womans way catherine smiled very well it is settled shall we cast off le soleil loosed its anchors shortly before three that afternoon quickly climbing to a height of a few hundred feet we are in heaven sighed catherine clutching her husbands hand tightly the young couple looked upwards into the belly of the balloon itself the silk was set shimmering by the breeze and sparkling by the sun golden waves billowed across its surface rumbling like distant thunder below them the trocadéro gardens were emerald lakes with lady libertys head breaching the surface like a titan of legend vigny fed a small steam engine sending power to the twin propellers fortunately the prevailing wind snatched the smoke away from the basket impressive non shouted the frenchman above the engines racket how many are you thinking of ordering declan pretended not to be impressed perhaps none i dont know if those little propellers would have any effect against an ocean wind vigny was about to argue the merits of his steampowered dirigible when a sharp flat crack echoed across the skies it was a noise familiar to both soldiers gunshot said vigny peering towards the ground rifle said declan broekhart grimly as captain of the saltee sharpshooters he knew the sound well long range maybe a sharps see there a plume of greyblue smoke rose into the sky from the western border of the gardens gun smoke noted vigny one cannot help wondering who the target might be no need to wonder monsieur said catherine her voice shaking look above you the balloon both men searched the golden envelope for a puncture both found one the bullet had entered through the lower starboard quadrant and exited through the upper port section why are we not dead wondered declan the bullet was not enough to ignite the hydrogen explained vigny an incendiary shell would have done so catherine was badly shaken for the first time in her short life mortality was at hand and not just her own by stepping into the balloons basket she had put her childs life at risk she folded her arms across her stomach we must descend quickly before the envelope rips in the fraught minutes that were to follow vigny proved his skill as an aeronaut he perched on the baskets lip gripping a stanchion in one hand and the gasrelease line in the other with a tap of his boot he pushed the tiller wide le soleil swung in a gentle arc vigny intended to set her down inside the velvet rope declan broekhart stayed at his wifes side strong and stubborn as catherine was the gunshot had shocked her system this had the effect of bringing forward her childs due time the body realized that it was in mortal danger so the best chance for the baby was in the wide world a spasm of pain buckled catherines knees she collapsed backwards cradling her stomach our son is coming she gasped he refuses to wait vigny almost fell off his perch mon dieu but madame this is impossible i cannot allow it on my ship i do not even know if this is good luck or bad luck i will have to check the aeronauts manual it would not surprise me if we had to sacrifice an albatross it was vignys habit to chatter wittily when anxious wit in times of danger was in his opinion very cavalier this did not stop him performing his duties he guided the dirigible expertly towards the chosen landing spot compensating for the leaks with expert tugs on the gas line on the baskets cramped floor catherine struggled to deliver her child her leg shot out involuntarily as the pain hit the stroke was a lucky one catching her husband on the shin and snapping him out of his near panic what can i do catherine he asked keeping his voice steady his tone light as though giving birth in a falling balloon was the most natural thing in the world hold me steady replied catherine through gritted teeth and give me your weight to push against declan did as he was told calling over his shoulder to vigny steady keep her steady man talk to the almighty retorted vigny he is sending the gusts of wind not i they were in reasonably good order the envelope was damaged but holding her integrity the broekharts huddled on the floor engrossed in the business of bringing life to the world they would have made it vigny was already imagining the first sip of the champagne he planned to order the moment his feet touched solid ground when the air was split with a brace of gunshots both bullets pierced the balloon and this time their effect was more severe one passed straight through as its predecessor had but the second clipped a seam sending a rip racing to the crown of the balloon air and gas screamed from the distressed dirigible like a company of banshees vigny pitched forward into the basket bouncing off declan broekharts broad back they were in gods hands now with the envelope so grievously ruptured the frenchman could not claim a single degree of control over the balloons path they dropped rapidly the deflating envelope flapping above them catherine and declan ignored their own fates concentrating on their childs i see the baby said declan shouting into the wind almost there my darling catherine broekhart held back the despair clamouring in her mind and pushed her baby into the world he arrived without a cry reaching out to grip his fathers finger a boy he said my strong son catherine gave herself not a minute to recover from her brief labour she leaned forward and grasped her husbands lapel you cannot let him die sir it was an order plain and simple vigny swaddled the newborn in his blue aeronautical squadron jacket we can but pray he said declan broekhart climbed to his feet taking in the literal gravity of their situation at a glance the basket was in virtual freefall now slicing east directly towards lady libertys head any considerable impact would surely result in the babys death and he had been forbidden to allow that but how to avoid it fortune saved them at least temporarily the envelope spent its last breath then impaled itself on the third and fourth rays of libertys crown the material ripped bunched and jammed between the rays halting the baskets murderous descent providence breathed captain broekhart we are spared the basket swung like a pendulum grazing the lower curve of lady libertys cheek with each pass the copper bust rang attracting gawkers like church worshippers catherine held on to her baby son absorbing the impact as best she could the envelopes threads popped with cracks like gunfire the balloon will not hold said vigny we are still twenty feet up declan nodded we need to lash her to the statue he grabbed le soleils anchors tossing one to vigny a case of the finest red wine if you make the shot vigny tested the anchors weight champagne if you dont mind both men threw their anchors high between the last two rays of lady libertys crown their aim was true and the anchors bumped the statues ringlets then slid back down raising sparks as the metal surfaces cracked together the anchors bit on both sides of the crown and stuck fast declan and vigny quickly pulled a loop of rope through the baskets bow and stern rings cinching them tight not a moment too soon with the screech of a seabird the balloon material ripped itself free of the statues crown dropping the basket a further stomachlurching yard until the anchor ropes took the strain the ropes groaned stretched and held my basket is now a cradle for your baby panted vigny and then champagne a case the sooner the better declan squatted below the baskets rim tugging the frenchmans cuff until he too bent low your hunter may have more bullets to spend he said true agreed victor vigny but i think he will have fled we no longer present such an enormous target and by now the gendarmes will be on his trail i imagine it was an anarchist they have been making threats in the trocadéro gardens the entire crowd had pooled below the basket they had come to the world fair expecting spectacle but here was high adventure the aeronautical squadron leaned long ladders against the wicker basket to rescue le soleils stranded passengers catherine climbed down first aided by the gallant captain vigny then came the proud father cradling the miraculous baby in his arms people gasped and surged forward a child there had been no child in the basket when it took flight it was as if the world had never before seen a baby born in the sky imagine it a child of wonder ladies and gentlemen elbowed each other shamelessly longing for a glimpse of his cherubic face look the eyes are open his hair is almost white perhaps the altitude someone popped the cork on a bottle of champagne and an italian count passed around cuban cigars it was as if the entire assembly were celebrating the babys survival vigny snagged the bottle quaffing deeply perfect he sighed passing it to declan broekhart he is a charmed boy what will you call him broekhart grinned deliriously happy i thought perhaps engel he came from the skies after all and our family name is flemish no declan said catherine stroking her sons whiteblond hair though he is an angel he has my fathers brow conor is his name conor said declan in mock protest irish from your family flemish from mine the boy is a mongrel vigny lit two cigars passing one to the proud father now is not the time to argue mon ami declan nodded it never is conor he shall be called a strong name vigny bonged a knuckle on lady libertys chin whatever he is called this boy is indebted to liberty this was the second omen of the day conor broekhart would eventually pay his debt to liberty the first omen was of course the airborne birth perhaps he would have been a sky pilot even without le soleil or perhaps something was awakened in him that day an obsession with the sky that would consume conor broekharts life and the lives of everyone around him and so a few days after conors famous birth captain declan broekhart and his family sailed from france back to the tiny sovereign state of the saltee islands off the irish coast the saltee islands had been ruled by the trudeau family since when englands king henry ii had given them to raymond trudeau a powerful and ambitious knight it was a cruel joke as the saltee islands were little more than gullinfested rocks by placing trudeau in charge of the saltee islands henry fulfilled his contract of granting his knight an irish estate but also made it clear what happened to overly ambitious knights when raymond trudeau objected to the kings grant henry delivered the oftenquoted trudeau admonishment you disagree with an appointee of god himself henry is recorded as saying perhaps monsieur trudeau considers himself above his king perhaps monsieur trudeau considers himself fit for royal office so be it you shall take the saltee islands with my blessing but not as baron you are their king king raymond the first i will demand neither tithe nor tribute from you or your descendants in perpetuity and as an added reward you may wear your crown to my court whatever you may find on those most bountiful isles is yours to keep trudeau could do nothing but bow and stammer his thanks bitter though the words were this was a terrible insult as there was nothing to be found on the saltee islands but sea birds and their droppings and little grew there thanks to the showers of sea spray that coated both islands during rough tides giving nothing to the saltees but their name but raymond trudeaus fortune was not as bleak as it seemed following his effective banishment to the saltee islands a strange glowing cave was discovered by one of his men who was burning gulls from their perches the cave was a glacial deposit of diamonds the largest mine ever discovered and the only mine in europe henry had ordained raymond trudeau king of the most valuable estate in the world seven hundred years later and the trudeau family were still in power in spite of over a dozen invasion attempts from english irish and even pirate armies the famous saltee walls held fast against cannon shot and ram and the celebrated saltee sharpshooters were trained to shave the whiskers off a pirate a mile away there were only two industries on the saltees diamonds and defence the saltee prison was packed to bursting with the foulest dregs of murdering humanity that ireland and great britain had to offer they worked the diamond mine until they had served their time or died most died a sentence on little saltee was a death sentence nobody really cared the saltees had been making many people rich for centuries and none of those many people wanted the status quo to change nevertheless change was afoot now there was a new king on the saltee throne an american king nicholas the first or good king nick as he was known in an increasing number of households barely six months in power and already king nicholas had drastically improved the quality of life for his subjects abolishing taxes and building a modern drainage system that ran through the town of promontory fort on great saltees northern tip when the royal yacht razorbill pulled into saltee harbour at dawn after a threeday voyage from france king nicholas himself was there to meet her truth be told he did not much look like the other kings of the day a youthful thirtyseven dressed in stout hunting leathers and a flat cap his sideburns were trimmed back and hair cut military style close to the skull his face was tanned with a tictactoe pattern of faded scars on his forehead from a close call with a landmine a stranger might assume nicholas to be the kings gamekeeper but never the king there was no pomp or circumstance about the man and he lived as plainly as one could in a stately palace nicholas had served as a skirmisher and a balloonist during the american civil war and it was said that he slept on the window seat in his royal chamber because the bed was too soft nicholas was a new breed of european king one who was determined to use whatever power he had to improve the quality of life for as many people as possible good king nick declan broekhart loved him like a brother declan hitched the yachts bowline then leaped on to the jetty to greet his monarch your majesty he said bowing slightly king nicholas returned the bow then punched his friend on the shoulder declan what kept you i read about your miraculous airborne baby before i see him i can only pray that he has inherited his mothers features while the men shared a chuckle catherine stepped on to the gangplank holding her precious bundle wrapped in a blanket catherine said nicholas taking her arm shouldnt you be resting i had my fill of rest onboard catherine pulled little conors blanket down past his chin now your newest subject would like to meet his king nicholas peered into the swaddling clothes finding a babys face in the shadows he was a little disconcerted to find the childs eyes focused and seemingly taking his measure ah he said rearing back slightly so alert yes said catherine proudly he has his fathers sharpshooter eyes but king nicholas saw more perhaps but he has the broekhart chin too stubborn to a fault your brow though catherine a scientist perhaps like his mother he tickled baby conors chin we need scientists theres a new world coming our way from america and europe too the saltees wont stay independent unless we have something to offer the world and the diamond mine on little saltee wont last forever scientists thats what we need here king nicholas tugged on riding gloves teach him well catherine i will your majesty and take him up to the palace introduce him to isabella ill take him up after breakfast promised catherine nicholas smiled sadly isabellas mother would have had a gift ready and wrapped the perfect gift the king stood silently for a moment remembering his wife then roused himself and now declan sorry to drag you away but apparently some opium smugglers have dug themselves into lady walkers cave right under our noses ill take care of it majesty perhaps you would escort catherine to our quarters nice try captain grinned nicholas clapping his hands hoping to keep me out of harms way the king was excited again the old soldier in him relishing the chase unlike most old soldiers he did not relish the kill these smugglers would be sent to work the diamond mine on the prison island of little saltee but not harmed unless it was unavoidable come now we have dawn light and low tide criminals do not like to get up early so we should catch them napping the king touched his cap to catherine then strode off down the jetty towards a small company of saltee cavalry on horseback it was in fact the entire saltee army mounted division a dozen expert horsemen on irish stallions two of the horses were without riders declan was anxious to stay with his wife but more anxious to be about his work i must go catherine the king will injure himself swinging into those caves you go declan keep him safe the islands need good king nick captain broekhart kissed his wife and baby then followed king nicholas to where the cavalry waited horses carving spiralled shavings from the jetty planks with their hooves your father the hero catherine told baby conor waving his tiny hand towards declan now lets go home and make ready to meet a little princess would you like to meet a princess my stubborn scientist conor gurgled it seemed as though he would part broekhart chapter the princess and the pirate conor broekhart was a remarkable boy a fact that became evident very early in his idyllic childhood nature is usually grudging with her gifts dispensing them sparingly but she favoured conor with everything she had to offer it seemed as though all the talents of his ancestors had been bestowed upon him intelligence strong features and grace conor was fortunate in his situation too he was born into an affluent community where the values of equality and justice were actually being applied on the surface at least he grew up with a strong belief in right and wrong which was not muddied by poverty or violence it was straightforward for the young boy right was great saltee wrong was little saltee it is an easy matter now to pluck some events from conors early years and say there it is the boy who became the man we should have seen it but hindsight is an unreliable science and in truth there was perhaps a single incident during conors early days at the palace that hinted at his potential the incident in question occurred when conor was nine years old and roaming the serving corridors that snaked behind the walls of the castle chapel and main building his partner on these excursions was the princess isabella one year his senior and always the more adventurous of the two isabella and conor were rarely seen without each other and often so daubed with mud blood and nothing good that the boy was barely distinguishable from the princess on this particular summer afternoon they had exhausted the fun to be had tracking an unused chimney to its source and had decided to launch a surprise pirate attack on the kings apartment you can be captain crow said little conor licking some soot from round his mouth and i can be the cabin boy that stuck an axe in his head isabella was a pretty thing with elfin face and round brown eyes but at that moment she looked more like a sweeps urchin than a princess no conor you are captain crow and i am the princess hostage there is no princess hostage declared conor firmly worried that isabella was once again about to mould the legend to suit herself in previous games she had included a unicorn and a fairy that were definitely not part of the original story of course there is said isabella belligerently there is because i say there is and i am an actual princess whereas you were born in a balloon isabella intended this as an insult but to conor being born in a balloon was about the finest place to be born thank you he said grinning thats not a good thing squealed isabella doctor john says that your lungs were probably crushed by the altitood my lungsre better than yours see and conor hooted at the sky to show just how healthy his lungs were very well said isabella impressed but i am still the princess hostage and you should remember that i can have you executed if you displease me conor was not unduly concerned about isabella having him executed as she ordered him hung at least a dozen times a day and it hadnt happened yet he was more worried that isabella was not turning out to be as good a playmate as he had hoped basically he wanted someone who would play the games he fancied playing which generally involved flying paper gliders or eating insects but lately isabella had been veering towards dressingup and kissing and she would only explore chimneys if conor agreed to pretend they were the legendary lovers diarmuid and gràinne escaping from fionns castle needless to say conor had no wish to be a legendary lover legendary lovers rarely flew anywhere and hardly ever ate insects very well he moaned you are the princess hostage excellent captain isabella said sweetly now you may drag me to my fathers chamber and demand ransom drag said conor hopefully play drag not real drag or i shall have you hung conor thought with remarkable wit for a nineyearold that if he had actually been hung every time isabella ordered it his neck would be longer than a serengeti giraffes play drag then can i kill anyone we meet absolutely anyone not papa though until after i see how sad he is absolutely anyone thats something thought conor swishing his wooden sword thinking how it cut the air like a gulls wing just like a wing the pair proceeded across the barbican she oohing and he arring drawing fond but also wary looks from those they passed the palaces only resident children were well liked not at all spoilt and mannerly enough when their parents were nearby but they were also lightfingered and would pilfer whatever they fancied on their daily quests a certain italian goldleaf artisan had recently turned from the cherub he was coating one afternoon to find his brush and tray of gold wafers missing the gold turned up later coated on the wings of a weekdead seagull that someone had tried to fly from the wall battlements they crossed the bridge into the main keep which housed the kings residence office and meeting rooms and this would generally have been where the pair would be met with a goodnatured challenge from the sentry but the king himself had just leaned out of the window and sent the fellow running to catch the wexford boat and put ten shillings on a horse he fancied in the curracloe beach races the palace had a telephone system but there were no wires to the shore as yet and the booking agents on the mainland refused to take bets over the semaphore for two minutes only much to the princesss and the pirates delight the main keep was unguarded they strode in as though they owned the castle of course in real life i do own the castle confided isabella never missing a chance to remind conor of her exalted position arrrr said conor and meant it the spiral staircase passed three floors all packed with cleaning staff lawyers scientists and civil servants but through a combination of low infant cunning and luck the pair managed to pass the lower floors to the kings own entrance impressive oak double doors with half of the saltee flag and motto carved into each one vallo parietis read the words defend the wall the flag was a crest bisected vertically into crimson and gold sections with a white blocked tower stamped in the centre the door was slightly ajar its open said conor its open hostage princess isabella reminded him sorry hostage princess lets see what treasure lies inside im not supposed to conor pirate captain crow said conor slipping through the gap in the door as usual nicholass apartment was littered with the remains of a dozen experiments there was a cannibalized dynamo on the hearthrug copperwiring strands protruding from its belly thats a sea creature and those are its guts said conor with relish oh you foul pirate said isabella stop your smiling then if im a foul pirate hostages are supposed to weep and wail in the fireplace itself were jars of mercury and experimental fuels nicholas refused to allow his staff to move them downstairs too volatile he explained anyway the fire would only go up the chimney conor pointed to the jars bottles of poison squeezed from a dragons bum one sniff and you vaporate this sounded very possible and isabella wasnt sure whether to believe it or not on the chaise longue were buckets of fertilizer a couple gently steaming also from a dragons bum intoned conor wisely isabella tried to keep her scream behind her lips so it shot out of her nose instead its fert lizer said conor taking pity on her for making plants grow on the island isabella scowled at him youre being hanged at sundown thats a princesss promise the apartment was a land of twinklings and shinings for a couple of unsupervised children a starsandstripes banner was draped round the shoulders of a stuffed black bear in the corner a collection of prisms and lenses glinted from a wooden box closed with a cap at one end and books old and new were piled high like the columns of a ruined temple conor wandered between these columns of knowledge almost touching everything but holding back knowing somehow that another mans dreams should not be disturbed suddenly he froze there was something he should do the chance may never come again i must capture the flag he breathed thats what a pirate captain is supposed to do go to the roof so i can capture the flag and gloat capture the flag and goat gloat isabella stood hands on hips its pronounced goooaaat idiot youre supposed to be a princess insulting your subjects is not very princessy isabella was unrepentant princesses do what they want anyway we dont have a goat on the roof conor did not waste his time arguing there was no winning an argument with someone who could have you executed he ran to the roof door swishing his sword at imaginary troops this door too was open incredible good fortune on the hundred previous occasions he and isabella had ambushed king nicholas every door in the palace had been locked and they had been warned by sternfaced parents never to venture on to the roof alone it was a long way down conor thought about it parents flag parents flag some pirate you are sniffed isabella standing around there scratching yourself with a toy sword flag then arrr i go for the flag hostage princess and then in his own voice dont touch any of the experiments isabella specially the bottles papa says that one day the king is going to blow the lot of us to hell and back with his concoctions so they must be dangerous conor went up the stairs fast before his nerve could fail him it wasnt far perhaps a dozen steps to the open air he emerged from the confines of the turret stairwell on to a stone rooftop from dark to light in half a second the effect was breathtaking azure sky with clouds close enough to touch i was born in a place like this thought conor you are a special child his mother told him at least once a day you were born in the sky and there will always be a place for you there conor believed that this was true he had always felt happiest in high places where others feared to go conor climbed on top of the parapet holding tight to the flagpole the world twirled round him orange sun hanging over kilmore quay like a beacon sea glittering below him more silver than blue and the sky calling to him as though he actually were a bird for a moment he was bewitched by the scene then the corner of the flag crept into his vision arrr he thought yon be the flag pride of the saltees the flag stood perfectly rectangular crimson and gold with its tower so white it glowed held rigid by a bamboo frame so that the islands emblem would stand proud no matter what the weather it struck conor that he was actually standing on top of the very tower depicted by the flag this may have caused a tug of patriotic pride in an older islander but to a nineyearold all it meant was that his picture should be included on the flag i will draw myself on after i steal the flag he decided isabella emerged on to the rooftop blinking against the sudden light come down from the parapet conor were playing pirates not bird boy conor was aghast and leave the flag dont you understand i will be a famous pirate more famous than barbarossa himself that wall is old conor pirate captain crow remember that wall is old conor it could fall down remember the slates came off the chapel during the storm last year what about the flag forget the flag and forget the goat im hungry so come down before i have you hanged conor stamped down off the wall sulking now he was about to challenge isabella say that she could go ahead and have him hanged for all he cared and she was a rotten hostage whoever heard of a hostage giving the orders she should learn to weep and wail properly instead of threatening to execute him a hundred times a day he was about to say all of this when there came a dull thump from below that shook the blocks beneath their feet a cloud of purple smoke oomphed through the doorway as though someone had cleared a tuba conor had a suspicion bordering on certainty did you touch something he asked isabella isabella was haughty even in the face of disaster i am the princess of this palace so i am quite entitled to touch whatever i wish the tower shook again this time the smoke was green and it was accompanied by a foul smell what did you touch isabella the princess of the palace turned as green as the smoke i may have removed the cap from the wooden box the one with the pretty lenses oh said conor that could be trouble king nicholas had explained the lens box to conor once delighted to find that the boys passion for learning equalled his own the lenses are arranged in a very specific order he had said squatting low so that his own eye appeared monstrous through the first lens so when i remove the cap and light comes in one end its concentrated by successive lenses until it can set paper alight at the other with this little gadget it might be possible to start a fire from a distance the ultimate safe fuse conor remembered thinking at the time that you could leave the box by the window and have it light the fire for you each morning a chore that he was none too fond of and now isabella had removed the cap did you move the box mind your tone commoner commoner isabella must really be terrified isabella i possibly placed it on the table by the window to see the colours passing through obviously the device had caught the afternoon light releasing the power of the lenses into the kings laboratory filled with the fertilizer jugs of fuel and various explosive materials the concentrated light had obviously landed on something combustible we have to go said conor all thoughts of captain crow forgotten he was no stranger to the power of explosives his father was in charge of the wall defence and had brought conor along on a trip to collapse a smugglers cave it was a birthday treat but also a lesson to stay away from anything that went boom the cave wall had collapsed like toy bricks swatted by a toddler the tower shook again several floor blocks rattled in their housings then dropped into the apartment below orange and blue flames surged through the holes and the snap and grind of breaking glass and twisting metal frightened the two children up on the wall said conor urgently the floor is falling for once isabella did not argue she accepted conors hand and followed him to the lip of the parapet the floor is a foot thick he explained shouting over the roar of the flames the parapet is four feet thick it wont break the explosions went off below like cannon fire each one issuing different odours different colour smoke the fumes were noxious and conor presumed his own face was as green as isabellas it doesnt matter if the parapet holds he realized the flames will get us long before then to isabella and conor it felt as though the entire world shook the stairwell spewed forth flame and smoke as though a dragon lurked below and from the courtyard came the screams of islanders as chunks of the tower crashed down from above i need to get us out of this place thought conor no one else can save us not even father there was no way to walk down not through the inferno below there was only one way down and that was to fly king nicholas was down the corridor in the privy when his daughter blew up his apartment he was admiring the new royal doulton washout toilet he had recently had plumbed into his own bathroom nicholas had considered installing them throughout the palace but there were rumours of a new flush toilet on the horizon and it would be a pity to be one step behind progress we must embrace progress be at the forefront of it or the saltees will be drowned by a tidal wave of innovation when the first explosion rattled the tower nicholas briefly thought that his own personal plumbing could be responsible for the din but realized that not even the bottle of homebrewed ale that he had consumed with declan broekhart the previous evening could result in such a disturbance they were under attack then unlikely unless a ship had managed to approach undetected on a clear summers afternoon a thought struck him could he have left the cap off the lens box if so much as a spark took flight in that room king nicholas finished his royal business and yanked the door open quickly closing it again as a roiling cloud of smoke and flame invaded the bathroom searing his lungs his apartment was destroyed no doubt about it luckily there was no one in his rooms or above them so the towers other occupants should easily escape not the king though king nicholas the stupid is trapped by his own mouldering experiments there was a window of course nicholas was a great believer in the benefits of good ventilation he was a devotee of meditation too but this was hardly the time for it the king stuffed a towel under the door to stop a draught inviting the fire in and flung the window wide glass and brickwork tumbled past his open window and the entire structure shuddered as another explosion shook the tower nicholas poked his head out for a sideways peek just in time to see a plume of multicoloured smoke expelled from his lounge there go the fuel jars below the courtyard was in chaos the fire division to their credit had already hauled the pump wagon to the base of the tower and were cranking up some water pressure if there was one thing they had plenty of on the saltees it was water on any other day the salt sea spray would have doused the fire but today in spite of a stiff breeze the sea was as flat as a polished mirror one man stood near the base of the tower he cut a jaunty figure in his french aviators jacket and feathered cap at his feet lay a large leather valise and he seemed quite amused by the entire exploding tower situation nicholas recognized him immediately and called down victor vigny you came the man beamed a startlingly white smile from the centre of his tanned face i came he shouted in the french accent you would expect from one in such attire and a good thing i did nick it seems like you still havent learned to keep a safe laboratory another explosion blue smoke and a shudder that rattled the tower to its foundations the king ducked out of sight then reappeared in the window very well victor banter over and done time to get me down from here any of that famous vigny ingenuity make it across the atlantic victor vigny grunted then cast an eye around the courtyard the fire wagon had a ladder hooked on its flank a rope too neither was long enough to reach the king who designed this thing he muttered hefting the coiled rope on to his shoulder tall towers and short ladders just goes to show there are idiots everywhere what are you doing asked a member of the fire brigade who said you could take that vigny jerked a thumb skywards him the fireman frowned god the frenchman winced idiots everywhere not quite so lofty mon ami the fireman glanced upwards catching sight of the king in the window do what he says roared nicholas that man has saved my life in the past and i trust him to do it again yes your majesty i am at your at his service victor pointed at the ladder lean that against the wall below the window it wont reach said the fireman eager to say something intelligent just do it monsieur your king is getting a little hot under the collar the fireman grabbed a comrade and together they propped the ladder against the tower victor vigny was halfway up before the stiles hit the wall the tower transmitted its vibrations into the rungs and victor knew that it wouldnt be long before it blew its top like a plugged cannon the kings apartment and everything above it would soon be no more than dust and memories he quickly reached the top of the ladder and threading his legs through the rungs he slid the rope off his shoulder and down his arm nimble aint he commented the fireman to his partner but as i intelligently said that there ladder dont reach the debris was showering down now lumps shards and entire granite blocks there was no avoiding it for the three men working at the ladder they bore the blows with hunched shoulders and grunts lean it back victor called down sweat dripping from his face he tore his feathered cap off as it caught fire revealing the shock of spiked hair that had earned him the nickname la brosse you owe me a hat nicholas ive had that one since new orleans the firemen took the weight of ladder and parisian pulling him three feet back from the tower wall victor vigny took half a dozen coils in his hand and sent them spinning upwards he had judged the coils accurately landing the spliced end directly in king nicholass hand tie her off strong now and be quick about it victor cinched the rope to the top rung and then slid down the stiles as fast as he could without stripping the skin from his palms ladder dont reach the fireman pointed out while victor plunged his hands into the nearest fire bucket i know that monsieur but the ladder reaches the rope and the rope reaches the king ah said the fireman now stand back if i know your king that tower has more explosives in it than a similarly sized cannon i believe we may be about to shoot down the moon the fire brigade gave up they couldnt pump enough pressure to reach the blaze and even if they could that fire was all sorts of colours and pouring water on it could just make it angry so they stood back out of the spitting castles range waiting to see if the last male trudeau in the line could save himself from death by fire or fall inside the bathroom king nicholas put his royal doulton toilet through its most rigorous test true the toilet had been constructed to bear the weight of a hefty adult but possibly not one swinging from a rope tied to its piping with a dripping towel draped over his forehead the king put four loops around the evacuation pipe and a few hitches on the end i really hope that pipe does not burst being burned alive is bad enough without being found covered in waste the bathrooms stout wooden door was cracking with heat as though soldiers battered from without the steel bands buckled sending rivets pinging around the room like ricocheting bullets nicholas struggled on wiping his eyes with the towel inching towards the dim yellow triangle that must be the window there was no thinning of the smoke just a faint glow in its centre just follow the rope he told himself its not difficult move forward and dont let go of the rope nicholas tumbled through the window remembering to hold on to the rope he juddered to a halt at the end of its slack like a condemned man on a gibbet quit your dossing nick hollered victor vigny get yourself down one hand after the other even a simpleton like this fireman here could manage it i could indeed shouted the fireman deciding he would worry about the insult later if at all below the plume of smoke king nicholas could breath again each successive gasp of fresh air drove the toxins from his system and returned strength to his limbs come down man i didnt travel from new york city to watch you swing nicholas grinned his teeth a flash of white i almost died victor some sympathy would be nice these simple sentences were a considerable effort and each phrase was punctuated by a fit of coughing thats it now said vigny the old nick down you come the king came down slowly his journey interrupted by several explosions once his feet had found purchase on the top rung nicholas descended quickly there were other lives at stake here after all and if he got victor killed because of his own monumental carelessness the frenchman would plague him from the afterlife victor had him by the elbows before his boots touched the cobbles whisking the king away to the relative safety of the keep they watched from behind an open gorge tower as the kings ladder was seared and blackened what the devil was in there asked victor the kings throat whistled with each laboured breath some gunpowder fireworks a couple of jars of experimental fuel swedish blasting oil fuse tape we have been using the old grain store beneath as a temporary armoury and of course fertilizer fertilizer fertilizer is important on the saltees victor its the future he remembered something isabella i must show her that i am unharmed she must see for herself he cast his gaze around the courtyard i dont see her i dont of course someone has taken her to safety she is safe isnt she victor victor vigny did not meet his friends gaze his eyes were directed instead over the kings shoulder at the towers parapet wall there were two somethings in the midst of the smoke and flame two someones a boy and a girl perhaps nine or ten years of age mon dieu breathed the frenchman mon dieu the turret roof was completely gone now apart from ragged blocks round the walls as though the dragon had grown and now occupied the entire tower through swathes of smoke and flame conor could see crumbling masonry and falling beams a thick column of smoke coughed from the tower which had effectively become a chimney drawing air from below to feed the fire the smoke rose like a giant gnarled tree black against the summer sky isabella was not in the least hysterical instead an eerie calm had descended over her and she stood on the parapet eyes glazed as though she were half asleep and uncertain of the reality of the situation the only way down is to fly thought conor it had long been his dream to fly once more but these were not the perfect conditions he had almost flown on his fifth birthday when the broekharts had gone on a day trip to hook head in ireland to see the famous lighthouse conors present had been a large kite in the saltee colours they set it loose on a windswept seaside pasture and a sudden gust had lifted conor to the tips of his toes and would have dragged him out to sea had his father not grabbed his elbow kite saltee colours the flag on the parapet conor pounced on the flagpole pulling at the knots holding the bamboo frame the knots twisted in his hands pulled by the wind that flapped the flag in its frame help me isabella he cried we must untie the flag forget the flag captain crow said isabella dully leave the goat too i dont like goats sneaky little beards conor struggled on with the knots the ropes were thicker than his slim fingers but they were brittle from the heat and fell apart quickly with one momentous wrench he pulled the flapping flag out of the wind wrestling it to the parapet it bucked and cracked under him like a magic carpet but conor kept it secure with his own body he could barely see isabella now she was like a ghost in the smoke he tried to call her but smoke went down his throat faster than words could come up he retched and arrked like a seal flapping his arms at the princess she ignored him deciding instead to lie down on the parapet and wait for her father conor fumbled with his belt buckle pulling the leather strip out from the loops of his trousers waistband then he rolled on to his back and passed the belt behind the flags bamboo diagonals this is an insane plan you are not a pirate on some fantastic adventure this wasnt a plan there was no time for plans this was a desperate act in the melee of smoke explosions and jets of flame conor struggled to his feet keeping the flags tip low hiding it from the wind not yet not yet he almost stumbled over isabella she seemed to be asleep there was no reaction when his fingers pulled at her face dead is she dead the nineyearold boy felt tears flow over his cheeks and was ashamed he needed to be strong for the princess be a hero like his papa what would captain declan broekhart do conor imagined his fathers face in front of him try something conor use that big brain your mother is always talking about build your flying machine not a machine papa there is no mechanism this is a kite flame was climbing the parapet wall blackening the stone with its fiery licks crossbeams carpets files and furniture tumbled into the hungry fire feeding it conor lifted the princess dragging his friend upright what she said grumpily then the smoke filled her windpipe and any words dissolved into a coughing fit conor stood straight feeling the massive flag flap and crackle in the wind its like a big kite isabella he rasped words like glass in his throat i will hold you round the waist like this and then we move to conor never finished his instructions because a further explosion funnelled by the tower caused a massive updraught plucking the two children from the parapet and sending the flag spinning into open air like a giant autumn leaf the circumstances were unique had they jumped as was conors plan they would not have had enough height for the flag to slow their descent but the updraught caught in their makeshift kite and spun them up another hundred feet and took them out over the sea they hung there in the sky at the plateau of the air tunnel weightless sky above and sea below i am flying thought conor broekhart i remember this then the flying finished and the falling started and though it was drastically slowed by the flag it seemed devilishly swift sights dissolved into a kaleidoscope of fractured blues and silvers the flag caught a low breeze and flipped conor watched the clouds swirl above him stretching to creamy streams and all the time he held on to isabella so tightly his fingers ached he was crying and laughing and he knew it would be painful when they hit the water they crashed into the ocean it was painful when he saw his daughter on the parapet king nicholas had tried to scramble up the tower like a dog climbing out of a well in seconds his nails were torn and fingers bloody victor vigny had dragged him away from the wall wait nick this is not over yet wait the boy hes nicholass eyes were wild and anguished what hes what you have to see it come now we need a boat in case the wind takes them a boat a boat what are you saying come nick come nicholas howled and dropped to his knees as his daughter flew into the air victor watched amazed this boy he was special whoever he was maybe nine no more than ten what ingenuity the explosion took them high victor watched their trajectory and then set off for the pier at a run dragging the king behind him the flag could drown them he puffed the frame will collapse and the flag will wrap around them both the king had recovered himself and soon outstripped the others through a traders gate and down to the jetty there were already half a dozen boats on their way to the fallen flag the first to reach them was a small quay punt sculled across the wave tops by two muscled fishermen a line of slower vessels trailed behind them to the pier alive nicholas roared but the distance was too great are they alive the flag was pulled from the sea and wet bundles rolled from it victor caught the king and gripped his shoulder tight the little punt spun in a tight circle and the fishermen pulled for shore their oars kicking spume from the water the news travelled faster than they could passed from one boat to the next the words inaudible at first became clearer with each fresh call alive alive both of them nicholas sank to his knees and thanked god victor smiled first and then began to clap with delight i came to teach the princess he shouted to no one in particular but i will teach that boy too or perhaps he will teach me chapter la brosse conor broekhart was quite the hero for a time it seemed as though everyone on the island visited him at the castle infirmary to listen to the tale of his improvised glider and to knock for luck on the gypsum cast on his broken leg isabella came every day and often brought her father king nicholas on one of these visits he brought his sword i didnt want to jump off the tower conor objected i couldnt think of another way no no said nicholas this is the trudeau ceremonial sword i am making you a peer you are making me appear said conor doubtfully is this a magical trick nicholas smiled in a way one touch of this sword and you become sir conor broekhart your father then becomes lord broekhart of course your mother will become lady broekhart conor was still a little worried about the crusaders blade five inches from his nose i dont have to kiss that do i no just touch the blade even one finger will do we will have a proper ceremony when you are well conor ran a finger along the shining blade it sang under his touch nicholas put the sword aside arise sir conor not straight away of course take your time when you are well i have a new teacher for you a very special man who worked with me when i flew balloons i think that you of all people will really like him balloons as far as conor was concerned the king could keep his peerage so long as he could fly balloons i am feeling much better your majesty perhaps i could meet this man today steady on sir conor laughed the king i will ask him to drop by tomorrow he has a few drawings you might like to look at something about heavierthanair flying machines thank you your majesty i look forward to it the king chuckled ruffling conors hair you saved my daughter conor you saved her from my carelessness and her own tinkering fingers i will never forget that never he winked and neither will she the king left leaving his daughter behind she had not spoken for the entire meeting indeed she had not said much to conor since the accident but today some of the old light was back in her brown eyes sirrrrr conor she said rolling the title around in her mouth like a hard sweet its going to be more difficult to have you hanged now thank you isabella the princess leaned in to knock on his cast no sir conor broekhart thank you someone else came to see conor that day late in the evening when the nurse had shooed his mother home the infirmary was deserted save for the night nurse who sat at her station at the end of the corridor she drew a curtain round conors bed and left a light on so that he could read his book conor leafed through george cayleys on ariel navigation which theorized that a fixedwing aircraft with some form of engine and a ruddered tail could possibly carry a man through the air heavy reading for a nineyearold in truth conor skipped more words than he knew but with each pass he understood more engine and tail he thought better than a flying flag at any rate and fell asleep dreaming of a shining sword wrapped in a flag sinking in saint georges channel he awoke to the sound of a boot heel scraping on stone and the heavy sigh of a large man a sigh so guttural that it was almost a growl this was a sound to make a boy decide to pretend that he was still asleep conor opened his eyes the merest slit careful to keep his breathing deep and regular there was a man in his bedside chair his massive frame swathed in shadows by the red cross on his breast he saw it was one of the holy cross guard marshall bonvilain himself conors breath hitched and he covered it with a small moan as though plagued by night terrors what could bonvilain want here at this hour sir hugo was the direct descendant of percy bonvilain who had served under the first trudeau king seven centuries before historically the bonvilains were high commanders of the saltee army and were also given leave to assemble their own holy cross guard which at one time was used to conduct raids to the mainland or hired out to european kings as professional soldiers the current bonvilain was the last in the line and the most powerful in fact sir hugo would have been declared prime minister some years earlier when king hector died had not a genealogist discovered nicholas trudeau eking out a living as an aeronaut in the united states sir hugo was an unusual combination of warrior and wit he had the bulk of a lifelong soldier but also the ability to present devastating argument in a surprisingly mellow voice if that saltee fellow dont cut you one way he does it tother benjamin disraeli reportedly said of the marshall conor had once heard his father say that bonvilains only weakness was his burning distrust of other nations especially france the marshall had once heard a rumour of the existence of a french army of spies la légion noire whose mission was to gather intelligence on saltee defences bonvilain spent thousands of guineas hunting members of the fictitious group bonvilains breath was deep and regular as though he were resting only a gloved finger tapping his knee betrayed that he was awake asleep boy he said suddenly his voice all honey and menace or maybe awake feigning sleep conor held his silence shutting his eyes tight suddenly without reason terrified bonvilain hunched forward on his chair i never really took notice of you before now little broekhart the first time you were a baby but this time this time it could fairly be said that you saved someone who should be dead broekharts always broekharts conor heard leather stretch and creak as hugo bonvilain clenched a gloved fist so i wanted to see you i like to know the faces of my of my kings friends conor could smell the marshalls cologne feel his breath but i have said too much already boy you need peace and quiet to recuperate from your miraculous escape truly miraculous but remember that i am watching you very closely the knights are watching you bonvilain stood in a rustle of the holy cross sheath he wore over his suit very well young broekhart time for me to go perhaps i was never here perhaps you are dreaming it might be better for you if you were the curtain round his bed swished as the marshall took his leave conor dared to open his eyes after a moment to find bonvilains face an inch from his own ah awake after all capital i forgot to knock the cast i could certainly benefit from some of your luck conor lay rigid and silent as the marshall hoisted his broken leg uncomfortably high then administered two sharp raps on the gypsum cast let us hope you dont give away all of that wondrous luck young broekhart you might be needing it bonvilain winked and was gone the curtain rippling behind him like a ghost perhaps it was a dream after all just a nightmare but the dull pain from bonvilains hoisting still throbbed in his leg conor broekhart slept little for the rest of the night of the billion and a half of people on earth there were perhaps five hundred that could have helped conor achieve his potential as a pilot of the skies one of these was king nicholas trudeau and another was victor vigny that these three should be brought together at such a time of industrious invention was little short of miraculous the race for flight is littered with such fortuitous groupings william samuel henson and john stringfellow joseph louis gaylussac and jean baptiste biot and of course charles green and the astronomer spencer rush the wright brothers can hardly be included in this category as it was almost inevitable that they would meet sleeping as they did in the same bed chamber conor had long known of king nicholass interest in ballooning after all it had been his livelihood for many years conor and isabella had spent many nights by the fireside in nicholass apartment enthralled by the kings dramatic tellings of his airborne adventures victor vigny was a familiar figure in these stories he was generally presented as small in stature broad of accent timid and inevitably in need of rescue by king nicholas the victor vigny that conor met on his first day of instruction did not tally with king nicholass description he was neither tiny nor timid and according to castle talk it was victor vigny who had rescued the king the day after his release from the infirmary conor limped into victors quarters on the second storey of the main building this particular apartment had always been set aside for visiting royalty but now the parisian seemed firmly ensconced the walls were covered with charts and celestial models hung from the ceiling a skeleton in the corner wore a scorched feathered cap and a scimitar was clutched in his bony grip there were more swords in a rack arranged from light to heavy foil sabre broadsword the man himself was on the balcony stripped to the waist performing some kind of exercise he was a tall muscled man and seemed by his movements not in the least timid conor thought he would watch a while before interrupting the parisians movements were slow and precise fluid and controlled conor had the impression that this particular discipline was more difficult than it looked its not polite to spy said victor without turning his accent not so broad but definitely french you are not a spy are you i am not spying said conor i am learning vigny straightened then adopted a new position knees bent arms stretched to the side that is a very good answer he said grinning come out here conor limped to the balcony this is called tai chi practised since the fourteenth century in china i learned it from a juggler on the fair circuit that man claimed to be a hundred and twenty years old a regimen for mind and body it will be our first lesson every day followed by okinawan karate and then fencing after breakfast we open the books science mathematics history and fiction mostly in the area of aeronautics which happens to be my passion jeune homme yours too ill wager judging by your kiteflying exploits karate and aeronautics these did not sound like traditional occupations for a princess will isabella be coming not until eleven she has needlepoint etiquette and heraldry until then though she may occasionally join us for fencing so for four hours every day we can learn how to fight and how to fly conor smiled fighting and flying his last teacher had started the day with latin and poetry sometimes latin poetry fighting and flying sounded much more enjoyable now how does the leg feel asked victor pulling on a shirt broken said conor ah not only a flyer but a joker no doubt youll be spouting witticisms as your glider plunges into the side of a mountain glider thought conor i am to have a glider and something about a mountain victor took a step back folded his arms and took measure of his pupil you have potential he said at last a slim build the best for an airman most people dont realize that flying a balloon takes a degree of athleticism quick reactions and so forth i imagine piloting an enginedriven heavierthanair flying machine will take much more conors heart thumped in his chest a flying machine and you have brains your tower rescue proved that more brains than that king of yours stocking a laboratory with explosives hes been doing that for years you know it was only a matter of time as for your personality princess isabella says that you are not the most odious person in the castle and coming from a female that is high praise indeed sir conor conor winced his title still sounded outrageous to him if it were never used again he would be happier though he had noticed today that cook gave him a toffee apple for no particular reason and curtsied too curtsied this was the same cook who had battered his backside with a floury rolling pin not two weeks before so are you ready to learn lad conor nodded yes sir more than ready eager good said victor excellent now hobble this way i have some unguents that should help that leg of yours on its way to soundness and exercises too for the toes all of this sounded farfetched but no more so than an enginedriven heavierthanair flying machine it was the age of discovery and conor was prepared to believe anything victor pulled a ceramic jar from a high shelf the lid was waxed canvas tied on with reeds when the cover came off the smell was like nothing or nowhere conor had ever smelled or been an african man from the sahara had a camel act taught me how to make this he took a dollop on two fingers and smeared it where the cast met conors leg below the knee let it seep down under the cast smells like beelzebubs backside but when the gypsum comes off the bad leg will be better than the good one the unguent sent conors skin tingling hot and cold at the same time if we are scientists he said keeping his tone respectful why do we need to fight victor vigny sealed the pot thinking about his answer i fully expect conor broekhart that between the two of us we will learn to fly and when that day comes when we reveal our wondrous machine someone will come to steal it from us it has happened to me before i built a glider from willow and silk beautiful she made the air sing when she passed i flew a monkey over a hundred feet for six weeks i was the toast of the fair tent full every night conor could see the glider in his mind a monkey fabulous what happened there was a russian knife thrower he came around to my wagon one night with half a dozen friends they burned my glider to ashes and gave me a few licks to send me on my way threatened you see by progress when the choices are a flying monkey or a knife thrower who would pick the knife thrower the knife throwers mother perhaps victor ran his fingers through his black hair to ensure it was appropriately erect maybe funny jeune homme but then again the females love a nice monkey manys the mother would ignore her own kin for the chance to gawk at an airborne simian the point being that when the knife throwers come you must be prepared conor thought about marshall bonvilains visit let us hope you dont give away all of that wondrous luck young broekhart you might be needing it where do we start he asked victor plucked a slim blade from the rack we start at the heart of swordplay he said slicing the air till it whistled with the foil and so work began in later darker times when conor broekhart alone and disheartened remembered the life that was his the handful of years with victor vigny always stood out as the happiest they studied martial arts pugilism and weapons the first true fencing master to leave us an actual method of arms was achille marozzo victor told his pupil his opera nova is now your bible read it until it becomes a part of you when that one is ragged then we move back in time to filippo vadi they spent hours on training mats putting the masters theories into practice first you learn to hold a sword think of it as a conductors baton used properly there is not an untrained man in the world who can stand against you with buttoned swords conor learned to thrust parry feint double and riposte he lost pints of liquid each morning in sweat then replaced them with a jug of victors foultasting oriental tea his first weapon was a short foil but as his wrists grew stronger he progressed to épée sabre and rapier victor sawed the cast off conors leg a month early but forced him to wear a soaked bandage instead that turned his leg yellow along with all his bed linen more circus tricks conor had asked no replied the frenchman an american friend of mine is a miracle worker with poultices and pots actually nick has sent for him i will tell you more when he has finished his work and would say no more on the subject victor had little time for anything heavier than a cutlass no broadsword unless you plan to go on a crusade and even then look what happened to the crusaders while they were hefting their broadswords saladin was sticking his scimitar into their armpits the frenchman introduced conor to escapology scientists are the enemies of tradition he said dumping a box of assorted handcuffs on the table and tradition owns all the prisons and so more hours were spent picking locks and chewing knots conor found the tai chi most valuable when he was tied to a chair with a tantalizing apple shining at him from the table he was now able to reach parts of his own body that previously he could not have located with a backscratcher and mirror victor was a great believer in the right man for the job you need to talk to your father about guns he told conor nick tells me that declan broekhart is the finest shot he has ever seen and we spent a summer with wild bill hickok in abilene so thats high praise declan was delighted to help with his sons education and began taking conor on wall patrol and down to the shooting range with a duffel bag of arms he shot colts remingtons vetterlivitalis spencers winchesters and a dozen other models conor was a quick study and a natural marksman for your fourteenth birthday you shall have your own sharps his father promised him by then we should know what would suit your shoulder i would give you one for your next but your mother says ten is too young the only weapon victor did give conor a few pointers on was his prized colt peacemaker which wild bill himself had given him he invited me to come to deadwood with him he told conor but it was not the right career choice for an aeronaut prospectors tend to shoot down balloons also i am too handsome for a prospecting town all of these physical lessons were fine but what conor really yearned for was a mental challenge victor had promised him that they would build a flying machine and the frenchman did not disappoint the ability to defend oneself was a necessity but the race for flight was an obsession and it is a race jeune homme he told conor one morning as they stretched silk over a balsa wing frame the wood had been part of a special shipment from peru many of the worlds greatest inventors and adventurers have turned their attention to this problem man will fly it is inevitable more than twenty years ago cayleys triplane glider carried a passenger wenham and browning have built a wind tunnel to study drag alphonse pénaud was so certain of his designs that he drew up plans for retractable landing gear retractable the race is on conor make no mistake and we must be first past the finishing line fortunately the king supports our efforts so we will not want for funds nicholas knows what the power of flight would mean to the saltees the islands would no longer be cut off from the world diamonds could be transported without threat from bandits medicines could be flown in from europe flown in conor conor did think about this he thought of nothing else any free minutes he had were taken up with sketching plans or building models he forgot all about pirate games and insect eating sometimes his father despaired wouldnt you like to make a friend perhaps play in the mud get yourself dirty but conors mother was delighted that their son had inherited her own love of science our boy is a scientist declan she would say as she helped him to cover a wing or carve a propeller the race for flight will hardly be won in the mud conor made a lampshade for the light in his room a paper screen painstakingly decorated with depictions of da vincis flappingwing device a montgolfier balloon and kaufmans theoretical flying steam engine heat from the bulb rotated the shade at night and conor would lie in bed watching projections of these fabulous machines drift across his ceiling one day he would think dreamily one day chapter isabella conor was fourteen by the time the teacher and pupil were convinced that manned flight was within their grasp they had built a hundred models and several lifesize gliders all of which had ended up stamped to pieces and piled on to the bonfire their efforts fuelled not only the fire but the island tavern conversation there was general agreement that the frenchman was a lunatic and it seemed as though the broekhart boy was going the same way still it was a nice diversion of an evening to go watch a grown man jump off a high wall flapping his paper wings and still the king footed the bill bringing in experimental engines from germany special wood from south america magic wood sniggered the tavern wits brimmin with fairy dust not that the saltee islanders complained overmuch about how good king nick spent his diamonds even if he wasted the odd pouch on a french birdman life on the saltees was better than it had been for generations there was work for all who wanted it and schooling too with scholarships to dublin and london for the bright sparks who didnt fancy working for a living the infirmary was well stocked with instruments to poke and prod at a persons organs if you can scream then yer alive as the saying goes the sewage pipes were working carrying all the waste out to sea which meant sickness was down rats were a thing of the past on great saltee at least and bonvilains holy cross knights were held on a tighter leash there was no more of the random beating or imprisonment without trial that the marshall god bless him was so fond of there were grants available for home improvements and plans for telephone wires between great saltee little saltee and even mainland ireland so no one was too upset if the king wished to indulge himself in a little scientific tomfoolery it wasnt as if the frenchman was ever going to fly a man in a bird suit is still a man weight and wingspan were conor and victors main problems how can something float on air if it is heavier than air by forcing air over the wings quickly enough to generate lift which negates the force of gravity to generate lift you need big wings which are heavy if you use small wings they must be flapped with a machine which is heavy every solution presents a dozen problems in spite of more than three years of failures victor believed their method was correct we must learn control before we fly with an engine gliding is the first step lilienthal is our model the german aviator otto lilienthal had flown over twentyfive yards in his glider the derwitzer he was victor and conors latest hero la brosse never lost hope for more than five minutes these minutes were usually spent stamping on the latest failed prototype after that it was back to the schoolroom and more plans finally conor built a model that his teacher approved of the student held his breath while the master studied his work you know that this can never fly of course said conor the airman is an essential part of the ship his movement steers it he pushes the horizontal rudder left the ship banks right so we cant test your model no not unless you know an extremely intelligent monkey victor smiled i seem to remember talking about flying monkeys once before at any rate monkeys are intelligent enough stay on the earth where they belong what does that make us wondered conor victor picked up the model swishing it through the air feeling the crafts urge to fly it makes us visionaries jeune homme a monkey glances up and sees a banana and thats as far as he looks a visionary looks up and sees the moon conor smirked which resembles a big banana oho said victor you would mock me your teacher for such impudence you must pay the frenchman tossed the model on to a cushion and made a run for the sword rack conor was there before him drawing out his favourite foil which also happened to be victors favourite oh black card monsieur said victor selecting a slightly shorter épée for himself taking a mans blade how long will you hold on to it i wonder conor backed over to the training mat never taking his eyes from his teacher en garde shouted victor and attacked in the early years when the sport was new to conor the frenchman would call instructions as they fenced thrust parry riposte footwork move your feet you leadfooted islander again here comes my thrust so parry feet conor feet no instructions any more now the frenchman struggled to stay in the fight there were no pulled thrusts or forgiving slaps with the side of a blade this was as war they battled the length and breath of the chamber even moving out to the balcony he is a veritable devil thought victor not a bead of sweat on his brow only fourteen and already he outstrips me but the old dog has a few tricks in him yet that is the best model you have built panted victor riposte and counter riposte conor did not reply never lose concentration if your opponent makes jokes about your mother bat them aside as you would a clumsy lunge insults will only make you bleed if you allow them into your heart i think you should name this one commented the frenchman parry on the foible backwards glide and riposte victors swipe knocked a bonsai tree from his terrace below a donkey snorted his complaint victor is desperate thought conor i have him finally he leaped from his leading foot attempting a fleche attack which the frenchman barely managed to parry victor fell back on his left foot but kept the tip of his blade centred i think you should call her the isabella he said the name distracted conor for barely a second but this was ample time for victor to breach his defence the teacher quickly dropped low thrusting his sword upwards for an easy passatasotto had not the blades been buttoned conors heart would have been pierced from below the ribs touché said victor gratefully resting for a moment on one knee groaning he hoisted himself erect then returned to the cool shade of his chamber conor followed dully moments later sliding the foil into its leather sleeve on the rail why would you say that he asked quietly victor shrugged does it matter you dropped your guard our friend the flying monkey could have defeated you conor did not appreciate the humour if anything he seemed irritated by it it was a low trick victor i am still alive so it was a good trick you on the other hand have a ruptured heart conor retrieved his model from its nesting place plucking lint from the tail oh dont sulk please begged victor with much melodrama you are allowed to love a princess it is every young mans duty to fall head over heels with a princess you are lucky enough to actually have one to hand love a princess spluttered conor what i really dont know victor poured himself a glass of water what an effective denial jeune homme but dont feel bad i regularly reduce people to unintelligible stammers its a gallic gift the italians have it also his student was so nonplussed that eventually the frenchman showed some mercy i am sorry conor jeune homme i knew you had the glad eye but i didnt realize how glad arrow in the heart is it conors only reply was a small nod the barest dip of his chin he sat on the divan straightening his models rudder blowing gently on the wings victor sat beside him why then do you wear the expression of a man on the gallows steps you love a princess and she doesnt openly despise you celebrate jeune homme live your life young love is common but that doesnt mean it isnt precious conor longed to talk on this subject it was something he had been playing close to his chest for quite a while now if it had not been for the gliders he would have gone insane thinking about it victor read his pupils mood and kept silent he noticed not for the first time that conor was more man than boy now physically he was tall for his age and strong his countenance was generally serious and his coordination was excellent thanks to the fencing combined these traits gave him the appearance of an older youth emotionally though conor was very much a boy he was a well of feelings full to the brim ready to spill over isabella is my oldest friend conor began slowly i have only three friends my own age and she is the oldest mother says i met her before i was even a week old thats young vraiment said victor i remember the hour of your birth well we all had a lucky escape have you seen the photograph from the french newspaper i look like an old man searching for his teeth i hate to be the bearer of bad news jeune homme but your looks have not improved much the banter relaxed conor and he continued to air thoughts that he had never shared before i dont know if she is beautiful or not i suppose she is i like her face thats all i know sometimes i dont need to see her i just hear her behind me and i forget every thought in my head for gods sake victor i am fourteen now not twelve i have no time for babbling foolishness dont be so hasty said victor theres always time for babbling it happened at her last birthday so i gave her a present as usual and when she unwrapped it i could see she was disappointed she had hoped for something different what did you give the princess i dont recall a springloaded glider you remember the singlewing design ah yes just what every princess hopes for conor was desolate i know she hated it no doubt she flew it straight into saint georges channel i began to think about it about isabella and what could be wrong i realized that a glider was not a good present for a young lady isabella has become a young lady and i cannot stop thinking about her victor stretched until his shoulders cracked you are lucky jeune homme to have me here this day for i am an expert in all areas of instruction including the women folk conor was doubtful which explains why you are a bachelor in his forties i choose to be a bachelor said the frenchman wagging a finger there are plenty of ladies who would gladly tether victor vigny to their gatepost given the chance if i had a drop of champagne for every heart ive broken i would have had a full magnum before now can you then offer any sincere advice with no mention of a flying monkey very well conor broekhart listen and be amazed victor leaned forward elbows on knees as though about to present a great academic treatise the reason i suspect why isabella was disappointed with the glider was that she expected something special is that the best you can do said conor she expected something special from you continued victor unabated because you have become a young man and she a young woman conor did not understand what exactly was being said this is all biology victor i know this no imbecile she noticed you as a young man before you noticed her as a young lady she had hoped for your enlightenment in time for her birthday the glider said otherwise and so she thought isabella thought that you still saw her as a childhood friend but i dont not any more she doesnt know that how would she know it through mental projection conor cradled his head this is so confusing flying machines are easier welcome to the rest of your life jeune homme this is how things are but let me conclude my lecture on an optimistic note if isabella had not wanted something special from you specifically you she would not have been disappointed do you see confusion was writ large on conors features no its as clear as mud i myself gave her a very dull book and she was delighted but from you she wanted more than a present she wanted a token mud mud barrels of mud victor slapped his own forehead the boy is a dunderhead she wished a token of affection from you because she has affection for you a smile spread across conors face do you think so good god i see ivory the first today where is the royal photographer the smile winked out like a capped lamp youre right i think it makes sense so if it makes sense why once more the face of doom the original reason which i had forgotten for a moment prince christian of denmark has requested tea with isabella it is the first stage of a royal courtship isabella has agreed to receive him today this very afternoon oh not to worry i doubt this prince christian can overturn fourteen years of friendship in an afternoon yes but he is a prince and you sir are a sir anyway nicholas is a thoroughly modern king isabella will marry the man or flying monkey that she loves do you really think so i do it is like the old fairy tale the boy saves the princess they fall in love he invents a flying machine along with his dashing teacher of course they get married and name their firstborn after the aforementioned dashing teacher conor frowned i dont recall that fairy tale from nursery trust me its a classic let isabella have her tea i doubt very much that an engagement will be announced next week we begin work on a plan of action perhaps its time for shakespeare conor thumped his knee this was progress damn next week we can work now i could have a sonnet ready by this evening victor stood pacing the length of his study which also served as a lounge and classroom first mind your language you are fourteen and inside the walls of a palace not to mention in the company of a genius second i have work to do this afternoon important work there is a man i must visit and tomorrow morning i have some imports to check in our new laboratory conor transferred his thoughts from one obsession to another imports in our new laboratory you spend almost every evening in this laboratory when can i see it victor tell me the frenchman raised a warning hand wait the gesture said and be quiet he closed the doors to the balcony then checked that no one listened behind the door let me ask you something he said to his intrigued student these romantic feelings youve been having why havent you talked to your father conor frowned i would we are close but this past year he has been preoccupied the knights of the holy cross grow stronger there have been several incidents of violence against citizens and visitors the knights openly flout the kings wishes father worries for the kings safety he is right to worry confided victor bonvilains men grown bolder by the day the marshall was almost prime minister and believes there may still be a chance of obtaining that exalted office the king has plans for a parliament but not one that will be presided over by the knights serious political machinations are afoot on both sides it is a time for caution and secrecy is this tied to the man you must meet and the new laboratory yes to both the man risks his life to send news of bonvilains hold over the prison authorities and the laboratory victor knelt before conor gripping his shoulders it is almost ready conor finally the renovation is finished not that you would know from the outside and the equipment has arrived to build our flying machine conors heart thumped against his ribs everything yes everything we asked for and more nicholas doubled the order and asked for anything else he could think of a veritable aladdins cave of wonders for two airmen like us six engines five crates of balsa silk and cotton by the roll cable pneumatic rubber tyres conor expensive but worth it two pairs of dashing goggles the latest precision tools everything we need to build a workshop like nowhere on earth and thanks to a generous grant from nick we have an old martello tower outside kilmore in which to build it a place where bonvilain wont be looking over our shoulders we shall have our own wind tunnel jeune homme think of it flying machines were already taking off in conors mind when can i see it soon victor promised soon only two people on the islands know about our equipment three now including you to others it is simply a hugely expensive collection of mismatches an idiots shopping list locked inside a ruin but why the secrecy you do not yet understand the magnitude of what we attempt when we succeed the saltee islands will be the toast of the civilized world and king nicholas will be the man who taught the world to fly his position secure for as long as he lives until then he is a crackpot king selfishly emptying the saltee coffers we are a stick to beat him with this consignment is huge it must be kept secret until we are ready until then we can pretend that our trips are educational conor understood but his excitement made him reckless curse bonvilain he holds back science not for long said victor soothingly very well i will sneak you across on the ferry next weekend you can peruse our new engines next weekend good we can read some shakespeare on the boat conors face was blank shakespeare i then he remembered and jumped to his feet oh isabella will be at tea now i must talk to her directly afterwards what time is it the frenchman ignored the carriage clock on his mantle consulting instead the sundial on his balcony i would say perhaps a quarter past five how could you know that asked conor in disbelief you cant see the sun today not through all those clouds victor winked other men may not see the sun jeune homme but i am a visionary conors head buzzed with new information as he crossed the keep towards the broekhart apartments the day was grey with dull light falling on the granite walls rendering them close to black there was nothing to distract him from his thoughts of invention and romance victor was right isabella sat beside him every day for latin french mathematics and now shakespeare he would have his chance and what better way to impress a girl than by building a flying machine for her a real aeroplane not a toy he would name it the isabella if victor agreed and how could a dashing romantic such as the famous la brosse stand in the way of young love conor crossed the inner courtyard the intensity of his thoughts hurrying him along he ignored neighbours and failed to notice friends but rather than think him rude these people smiled look at young broekhart with his head in the skies no surprise there was he not born in the clouds a pig crossed his path and conor bumped into its filthy flank sorry princess blurted conor his thoughts mixing with reality the drover scratched his chin who are you calling princess me or the pig conor apologized twice once to the pig and again to its owner before hurriedly continuing across the yard this time with his eyes focused on the here and now porkchop says shes free on wednesday the drover called after him much to the amusement of anyone within earshot conor took himself and his burning cheeks round the nearest corner which was not the way he wished to go but at least he was out of the drovers sight he rested against the wall for a moment until his scarlet embarrassment faded ignoring the passing traffic of militia civil servants and merchants a couple of bonvilains knights stumbled by obviously drunk plucking whatever they wished from the market stalls no payment was offered and none asked for conor heard an unfamiliar singsong accent waft through an open scullery window so very handsome the voice said gretchen you know that little german princess with those ears and the estates she would kill kill to have afternoon tea with prince christian but he is with the choosing your isabella she should be honoured if you to ask me he will making all the talking today he will not the coming back christian does not like the boating with the big waves and sick making christian would do all his talking today conor came close to panicking in the street he felt sure that the struggle to keep such powerful emotions under control must surely have resulted in some disfigurement of his forehead i must talk to isabella now he would go to the princess tell her that the springloaded glider had been a bad idea he would gather some flowers and wrap them in paper and on the paper a poem pathetic that sounds pathetic even to me and it was my idea i am no poet if isabella likes me it is not for my poetry he would go to her and be himself just remind her of his existence before prince christian charmed her off to denmark maybe tell a joke one of victors whats happening to me he asked himself conor had always thought that the most powerful emotion he would ever experience was the thrill of scientific discovery to do something that no one in the history of the world had done what could compare to that but then he began to see isabella through different eyes he noticed how she brightened the classroom with her jokes and attitude and even her constant insults and threats of torture seemed somehow endearing he realized that her brown eyes could make everything else in a room disappear he wished the mornings away until she appeared in the classroom i must talk with her even my flying machines will not get me to denmark the princesss rooms were below the kings in the rebuilt main tower there was a sentry on the wall above the tower door conor knew him as one of his fathers favourites in spite of his relaxed attitude to authority that bates will be the death of me and himself declan often complained i dont know which is sharper his aim or his tongue conor saluted him corporal bates nice evening really not if youre up on a wall with an ocean breeze blowing up your trouser leg it isnt i suppose i was just making conversation im really here to see isabella as usual you have that big lovestruck gombeen head on you again go on up there before the denmarkian fellow steals her away on his hobby horse if conor had been really listening the hobby horse comment might have made him pause its danish and do you think he can steal her away have you heard anything bates stared at conor as though he were mad then smiled slowly oh i think he has a good chance strapping lad like him and the way he eats up all his dinner very commendable id get up there if i were you should i wait here while you announce me no no said bates you go on up im sure the princess would love to see you not exactly procedure but batess cavalier disregard for protocol was legend very well i will go thank you corporal bates bates saluted merrily you are so welcome young broekhart but dont thank me now just make sure i get an invitation to the wedding conor hurried up the staircase and he was panting by the time he reached the princesss floor the stairway opened to an arched vestibule with four glowing electric globes a spectacular norman medieval tapestry and a cherub fountain which generated more noise from its two pumps than it did water the vestibule was deserted apart from conor who steadied himself against the wall wishing he wasnt sweating and covered in mud of all the days to be wrestling pigs and running up stairs from behind isabellas door came peals of delighted laughter conor knew that laugh well isabella saved that particular laugh for special occasions birthdays christenings may day pleasant surprises i have to go in there to hell with the consequences conor drew himself up pasted his hair down with a licked hand and barged into the private apartment of a royal princess isabella was kneeling at her small gilded reception table hands dripping red isabella shouted conor youre bleeding its just paint said isabella calmly conor what are you doing here there was a little welldressed boy at the table this funny man is smelling of the poo poo said the boy pointing a finger dripping in green paint conor suddenly felt ill oh my god little child paint eats all his dinner isabellas face was stern yes funny man explain the poo poo smell to prince christian this is prince christian yes he is painting a masterpiece for me using only his fingers and also the paint the prince pointed out isabella nodded thank you christian you are so clever now conor explain the odd smell there was a pig in the courtyard said conor weakly porkchop i think her name was we bumped into each other christian clapped his hands in delight splattering paint over himself the funny man does not have money for the horse so he is riding the pig conor did not rise to the jibe he deserved it and more i must look like a halfwit he thought straight from fencing and pig wrestling isabella cleared her throat ahem sir conor could you in the minute left of your life before i have you executed explain what you are doing here now that he was here conor was not sure what to say but he did know that it should be something true something meaningful firstly your highnesses apologies for the intrusion isabella i had something i have something i need to say to you isabella had not heard that tone from conor before not once in fourteen years yes conor she said the mischievous twinkle absent now about your birthday my birthday is not for a while yet not this birthday last birthday what about my last birthday there was a stillness then silence even below in the courtyard as if the entire world was waiting for conors answer that springloaded glider you dont want it back do you because the window was open and i no no i dont want it back i just felt i should tell you that it was the wrong gift to give you i hope you were expecting something different special a springloaded glider is very very special said prince christian seriously if the princess is not the wanting it isabella held conors gaze for a few seconds seemingly dazed then blinked twice very well prince christian i think teatime is over i hope you enjoyed your tea and cakes and the lemonade prince christian was not eager to leave yes the lemonade was pleasing i was wondering may i have the vodka no christian said isabella brightly you are only seven years old a brandy then absolutely not yes but in my country it is the custom oh really lets ask your nanny shall we isabella pulled a bell cord on the wall and seconds later a danish nanny arrived gliding into the room like a carriage on rails the lady was not smiling and looked as though she rarely did she took one look at prince christian and rolled up her sleeves i am the baby prince washing now she said grabbing christian by the forearm let go of me servant squealed christian struggling vainly i am your master the nanny scowled thats quite enough of the master servant talk christian be a good little prince and nanny will make you wienerbrød for supper immediately mollified the little prince was led from the apartment trailing blobs of paint behind him isabella wordlessly disappeared into her washroom and conor heard water being poured shes washing off the paint he thought should i stay now or should i go when she left the room was that a dismissal things had suddenly changed they had always been equal before now he was worrying about her every feeling her every footstep i should go we can talk later no stay definitely stay victor would not run away if i go now we will be back to confusion tomorrow who are you talking to conor conor was about to protest that he had not been talking when he noticed that his lips were already moving oh i was just thinking aloud when i am nervous i sometimes isabella smiled kindly you really are a scatterfool arent you sir conor conor relaxed she was teasing him familiar ground i am sorry princess will you have me garrotted i prefer hanging as you well know conor took a deep breath and bared his soul he did it quickly like jumping into the ocean to get the pain over with i came because you told me this tea was part of a royal courtship isabella had the grace to blush i may have said so i was teasing i see that now too late to save me from embarrassment christians father has business here i am doing my royal duty thats all no courtship none conors shoulders slumped at least now he did not feel like a participant in some kind of race so you built up your courage and came charging up here to declare your love well i do not panic do not panic something like that isabella moved to the balcony and stood leaning on the carved balustrade dark hair flowing down her back white fingers on the stone beyond and below the wall lights were popping on like a regiment of orderly fireflies i should speak now while she is turned away it will be easier without her eyes on me isabella things are things are changing for us between us and thats good thats as it should be natural its only natural that things change conor groaned inwardly this was not going very well say what you want to say what i want to say is that perhaps our days of climbing chimneys are over although i like climbing chimneys but perhaps there are new things to do to share without the company of danish princes isabella turned to him and her mocking smile was not as steady as it usually was conor you are such a scientist is there not a shorter more concise way to say all of this conor frowned perhaps there is i would have to do a few experiments i am new to this and i feel clumsy isabella made a show of pouring some lemonade from a jug i am the same conor sometimes i feel as though we have made our own world here and i have no wish to leave everything is perfect now it is perfect conor smiled tentatively coming back to himself so i am not to be executed not today sir conor the princess said handing him the glass after all you rescued the princess from the tower there is only one way for that fairy tale to end conor choked on a mouthful of lemonade spraying his pigdungstained trousers an interesting combination of smells commented isabella pardon me princess said conor i am amazed by your friendly reception i imagined myself trussed up by danish guards by now isabella turned her brown eyes full on him conor i could search the world for another swashbuckling scientist but i doubt if i would find one like you the princess realized that she had said a little too much and felt compelled to add even if you are a lankylimbed overbrained oaf conor accepted the first half of the compliment with a smile and the second half with a grimace i feel exactly the same he said apart from the scientist lankyoaf part you know what i am trying to say yes sir conor said isabella teasing him with his title again i do chapter treason and plot conor did not return home after his meeting with isabella he was too elated he felt as though his heart were half its previous mass somehow against all the laws of science just sharing his thoughts with the princess seemed to make him lighter so even though he was already late conor decided to preserve the feeling by passing an hour alone in his favourite hideaway somewhere he had not been for several months more times than he could remember conors parents had forbidden him to climb the keep turret in general he respected their wishes but every boy has some secret transgression that he cannot surrender for conor it was his perch high in the eaves below the northeast turret this was the place where he felt closest to his nature where he felt that the race for flight could actually be won by a boy and his teacher but this evening he was not thinking about heavierthanair flying machines as he squeezed out through a medieval murder hole and clambered along the ivy to the wooden trestles that had been put in after the chemical fire in nicholass apartment tonight he was thinking about isabella nothing specific just contented warm thoughts as soon as his back rested on the towers familiar mouldings conor felt a familiar peace settle over him he was surprised to find the spot a tight squeeze soon he would outgrow this hiding place and he would have to find another high spot to dream of flight conor sat watching the sun set over the ocean sharing the view with the dozen or so gulls that hoped against hope that someone would leave an open barrel of fish inside the curtain wall across the bay he could see a large fire somewhere in kilmore and the beam from the hook head lighthouse already cast its cone of light across saint georges channel it was a beautiful early summer night and presently the narrow patch of water between the saltees glimmered with moonshine as though bridged directly below his feet a team of guards were running a cannon drill and on the great saltee wall conor was sure he could see his father striding between watch posts dark cloak flapping behind him he was not tempted to call out better to delay his next punishment for this offence as long as possible conor i could search the world for another swashbuckling scientist but i doubt if i would find one like you he smiled at the echo of the words in his mind conors thoughts were interrupted by a regular scraping along the stone inside the tower feet on the steps in all his climbs to this lofty spot the only footsteps conor had ever heard on those steps besides his own were his fathers coming to fetch him down declan broekhart was fifty feet below on the wall and so it could not be him conor twisted slightly in his cramped position so that he could hang back on a creeper and peep in through the murder holes leaded glass the wind caught his hair as he leaned from shelter and he had a sudden powerful recollection of how he used to adopt this same position as a younger boy i would pretend to fly i remember that conor smiled at the memory soon there will be no need to pretend victor and i will design the machine and i will fly it past isabellas window a figure moved inside the turret conor saw a shadow first made jumpy by a jarred lamp then the dark shape of the lantern held low to light the steps only shards of light flickered across the deep folds of cloth and face the colour red sprang to life under the light a red cross then a heavy brow and glittering eyes bonvilain conor stayed still as a gargoyle bonvilain had almost inhuman perception he could spot a seals head in stormy seas the marshall would have good reason not to approve of conors loitering so close to the kings offices and could justifiably shoot him as a traitor i will sit without breathing or stirring until the marshall is well gone then home quickly the sight of bonvilains sharply shadowed features had quite sucked the joy from the evening that would have been the end of the days adventures had not something else gleamed in the lamplight something that conor knew well a longbarrelled revolver with a band of pearl grip poking from below bonvilains fingers it was without the shadow of a doubt victors colt peacemaker this was extremely curious why would marshall bonvilain be prowling the serving passages of the castle with victors pistol youre making a mistake that cant be victors gun but it was conors keen eye had picked out enough detail to know he was not mistaken he had studied the gun countless times breath fogging the glass case there must be a thousand explanations for this just because you do not know the reason doesnt mean there isnt one it was true and sensible but conor was a boy and a scientist the most curious breed of human alive and he could no more turn away from this than a convict could ignore an open door if bonvilain had victors gun then his teacher should know about it and know why his teacher had long suspected that the marshall was not to be trusted and here could be the proof conor waited several moments until the last light of bonvilains lantern danced past and darkness had closed behind the marshall then swung himself monkeylike to the sill built into the murder hole an action that would have had his parents clutching their hearts in shock had the window creaked on his way to the murder hole he couldnt remember as it hadnt been of vital importance at the time conor tested it with a gentle prod no creaking just a slight rasp of dust in the hinges safe enough surely he slipped inside arms first walking along the floor with his hands until his feet dropped to the floor behind him conor crouched on the uneven granite listening the sound of his own breath hitting the stone seemed enormous bonvilain would hear it surely but no the marshalls footsteps continued at their previous pace and conor could see faint flickers from the lamp ahead he turned his face to the light and followed bonvilain up the spiral staircase on all fours feeling his way staying low this passage led to the serving door in king nicholass own apartment which was bolted shut and guarded whenever the king was in residence but when conor slid his head round the corner the door was unguarded and wide open no guard meant no king and if king nicholas was not in his apartments why would bonvilain be skulking around up here armed with another mans pistol a myriad reasons there are things that you do not know for example king nicholas may have asked for the gun so that he could have a replica made for victor to complete the set a birthday present unlikely but possible conor crept through the doorway quiet as the curious breed of tailless manx cat that had taken hold on the island the light ahead was dim but steady bonvilain was still had he heard something or was he listening to something waiting or spying conors stomach twinged he should go back now really interfering in the marshalls business was a serious business bonvilain was never reluctant to cry traitor and good men had been gaoled for less but the revolver victors revolver half a dozen steps more conor promised his prudent half i will peek round the next bend then retire little or no risk not exactly true but conor proceeded nonetheless searching out every step with probing fingers before mounting it he hugged the floor and wall seeking the darkest shadows and inched his face around the final twist in the stairs bonvilain was half a dozen steps above the lantern rested at his feet casting sharp triangles of light upwards his face appeared demonic in this light but it was just the angle surely suddenly bonvilains head turned towards conors position and he had to fight every instinct not to stand up and flee he was invisible cloaked by the dark after a long breathless moment conor realized that the marshalls main intention was not to cast his eyes down the stairway but to move his ear closer to the wall he was listening to something or more likely someone and another detail in his left hand a dark lump light glinted on a chiselled edge and conor saw that bonvilain held a brick he had removed a small brick from the wall and was eavesdropping on whoever was in the kings apartment words floated down the stairwell and because of the turrets acoustics they were as clear to conor as they doubtless were to bonvilain himself the kings voice and victors so the marshall spied on his own king conor closed his eyes and strained his ears trying to make sense of what he heard when what he should have been doing was running just as fast as his young legs would carry him running to fetch his father inside the kings apartment victor vigny was seated in one of a pair of louis xv armchairs by the fireplace the main door crashed open and in bounded king nicholas balancing two frosted tankards on a tray with great pomp and much bowing nicholas i presented victor with a cold glass of beer that is fantastic said victor after a deep swig colder than the backside of a polar bear the refrigerator is working well i see nicholas sat and took a drink from his own glass perfectly though the ammonia is a little dangerous those germans need to find a new gas someone will said victor wiping away a foam moustache thats progress can you imagine the benefits of reliable refrigeration you mean beyond cold beer joked victor nicholas rose to pace the floor the subject of progress never failing to excite him we can trade with the united states fresh produce and we can export too diamonds dont need freezing quipped victor other things the plantago and we can freeze produce out of season in a giant warehouse strawberries and salmon all year victor was suddenly serious you my good friend have bigger fish to worry about what have you heard asked nicholas sitting once more victor sighed it is as bad as you feared and worse my man on little saltee tells me that bonvilain works the prisoners to death as far as he can tell many of the inmates are guilty of nothing more than vagrancy we cant prove it yet but by my count at least half of the diamonds go missing between the mine and the treasury dammit swore nicholas hurling his glass into the fireplace bonvilain is a plague a blight on the saltees he treats the islands as his personal property i must be rid of him victor nodded towards the fireplace a fine beginning crystal in the grate should have the marshall quaking in his boots the kings eyes flashed fire for a moment but then he settled and looked towards the grate perhaps regretting the loss of a cold beer how long have we been together victor if i answer this will a speech be next oh i am missing my beer now victor relented twenty years nick every fair in the blessed united states and now the top of this fine castle all that time and what have we achieved victor we can help people here not just a few shillings to the needy actually help make things better forever its all in the machines we can build them look at young conor broekhart have you ever seen a mind like that i know it said victor with a touch of pride isabella knows it too nicholas smiled poor conor i think poor conor has no idea of the hoops isabella will trot him through the king could not stay happy long damn him damn bonvilain he is a tyrant i am the king am i not i will be rid of him careful nicholas sir hugo has the army on his side declan broekhart is the only one who could sway them the men look up to him we should invite him to one of our talks the king nodded very well tonight i cannot wait another day i will see bonvilain in prison before the month is out the future will only wait for so long this island is trapped in the middle ages because of that man his guards are murderous thugs and his justice is selfserving and vicious after seven hundred years the alliance between the trudeau and bonvilain families is about to come to an end ill drink to that said victor tipping back the rest of his beer bonvilain came through the serving door with the colt already extended walking with confident measured strides there was no overblown villains preamble sir hugo had been in too many lifeordeath situations for that he allowed himself one sentence only victor vigny you have killed the king both frenchman and monarch reacted quickly neither bothering with protestations or pleadings there was murder in bonvilains eyes not a single doubt about that victor hurled his body across the room to shield his friend while nicholass right hand dropped to the smith and wesson revolver that he always wore slung low on his hip in the american style victor the younger man almost achieved his goal but no matter how quick the man the gun is quicker bonvilain fired and the bullet clipped the webbing between the frenchmans outstretched thumb and index finger which deflected the bullet slightly but not enough to save the king nicholas fell back in his chair and was dead before the smith and wesson dropped from his fingers bonvilain grunted satisfied then picked up the kings gun and turned it on victor vigny who lay on the hearth rug blood streaming from his hand you almost made the distance said bonvilain admiringly commendable effort victor looked into the marshalls eyes and knew his own life was over so i am the murderer he said yes you shot the king with your own gun there is a test they are developing in scotland yard that can match the bullet to the gun i shall have an expert shipped over i have also employed a dutch handwriting expert to forge letters from you to the french government detailing the saltee defences i ask you do these sound like the actions of a man who has trapped the islands in the middle ages nobody will believe that i killed the king protested victor he was like a brother to me bonvilain shrugged not many knew that you were his secret spy remember spying on me now to business i am sure you have a dirk in your boot or a derringer in your beard or some other spy trickery so fare thee well victor vigny tell your master that the alliance between the trudeau and bonvilain families continues a while longer you will never stop us all cried victor valiantly jumping to his feet a dirk in his hand pulled from some fold of clothing bonvilain tutted shooting victor four times in the chest a little excessive perhaps but he was understandably upset after all the king had been murdered a thought struck him stop us all what had vigny meant by that were there more spies on the islands or were you toying with me frenchman he asked squatting down and curling victors fingers around the grip of his own colt peacemaker leaving a few doubts behind to prey on my mind the main door opened and a sentry entered am i supposed to come in yet he asked yes yes said bonvilain irritated that it had been necessary to involve a sentry he would have to be disposed of at the earliest opportunity you see what has happened here you heard the gunshots and came in they shot each other simple as that you dont need to offer any opinions you say what you saw the sentry nodded slowly though this was not the first time hed heard these simple instructions i say what i saw yes marshall and you wont kill me of course not muldoon you wear the red cross i dont kill my own guards muldoon was obviously relieved good news for me thank you marshall i appreciate being allowed to continue with my worthless life bonvilain was struggling not to end muldoons worthless life immediately you should probably go and raise the alarm muldoon bobbed his head yes marshall absolutely but who is that boy behind you sir bonvilain blinked excuse me conor was a sharp young man and it hadnt taken him long to realize what was happening apparently victor was not just the royal tutor he was also a spy for king nicholas bonvilain must have listened to this conspiracy blossom from his spot behind the wall and intended to put an end to it before it put an end to him but why victors gun his teachers own voice chided him for goodness sake boy is it not obvious conor paled in the darkness of course victors weapon victors crime when bonvilain went through the door conor had already formulated a rudimentary plan he would rush through two paces behind shouting a warning victor should react quickly and disarm bonvilain without undue difficulty he was on his feet and halfway up the stretch of stairs when the first shot rang out so quickly so quickly who had taken the bullet perhaps king nicholas had fired first and all was well only one shot after all one shot for one man conor kept moving but carefully now he did not want to be shot for a traitor by his king or teacher they would be nervous on the lookout for bonvilains men and there was no need for a warning now it was too late one way or the other the boy eased into the doorway squinting against the sudden lamplight his eyes adjusted in time for him to witness victor shot down as he rushed bonvilain he froze speechless as his eyes took in the tableau of horror before him the king dead victor too horribly and bonvilain grinning and talking to himself like a madman now he was placing victors gun in the parisians hand these events were nightmarish too brisk to be true they skimmed the surface of reality like skipped stones on a flat sea a knock on the door and in comes a sentry conor recognized him from his corridorroaming with isabella a dullard in the watch because of some relation but a subject nonetheless and so should be warned conor was a breath from shouting when the sentry began to converse with bonvilain the man was a part of things bonvilain would escape completely the king would be dead and victors memory blackened it was unbearable this plot must be stopped bonvilain could not be allowed close to isabella conor stooped low creeping to victors side using the furniture as cover the parisian lay on his side as though comfortably asleep his eyes were wide with surprise and blood bubbled on his lips dead dead conor fought the tears what would victor have him do what would his father have him do stop this conspiracy he had training aplenty to do it and there was a loaded gun inches from his fingers then victors eyes blinked and found focus the frenchman lived for a stolen moment dont do it boy he whispered showing a remarkable grasp of the situation the martello tower in kilmore find it and burn it bonvilain must never learn our secrets the eagle has the key go now go conor nodded the tears coming freely dripping from his nose and chin martello tower kilmore burn it go now he might have left then and avoided years of heartache had not the parisian rattled out his final breath dead again conor was stunned to lose his friend and mentor twice in as many minutes they would never fly together now they would never fly the broekhart in him took over pushing down the scientist victor had been trying to protect him but there was no need conor was trained in all the weapons of combat including oriental and indian had they been available conor prised the colt from victors hands the pearl handle against his palm brought both confidence and sadness this was a gun he had twirled a thousand times while victor chided him for a showoff he twirled it again to settle himself then popped out the cylinder checking the load five shots left plenty for some wounding conor came to his feet the tears on his face drying quickly the sentry saw him first but who is that boy behind you sir he said dully bonvilain turned slowly already pulling a sad face ah young broekhart he said as though conor was expected a terrible tragedy conor aimed the colt at bonvilains chest a large enough target i heard everything marshall i saw you shoot victor bonvilain dropped the act his face was once again its sharp self angles and shadows no one will believe you some will said conor my father will the marshall considered this you know i think you might be right i suppose that means i must kill you too unless you kill me i could do it and that oaf too said conor cocking the colt i am sure you could theoretically but the time for theory is over this is not the practice field conor we are at war now stand where you are marshall someone heard the shots they will be coming not through these walls no one is coming it was true and conor knew it victor had told him that one night he and nicholas were testing fireworks in the grate and not a soul in the palace had heard you soldier put down your rifle and sit on the chair the sentry did not appreciate being ordered about by a fourteenyearold boy but then again the boy seemed very familiar with the weapon in his fist this chair theres blood on it no idiot that chair by the wall the sentry laid his weapon on the stone floor shuffling across to a stool by the wall this is a stool he mumbled you said chair bonvilain took a sneaky step forward hoping that conor was distracted by the sentrys inanities not so dont move traitor murderer bonvilain smiled his teeth were glossy like yellow pearls now conor i will explain to you what i am about to do i intend and this is a promise to take a leisurely walk across the space between us and then choke the life from your body the only way you can stop this coming to pass is to shoot me remember this is war no school today stay where you are shouted conor but the marshall was already on his way five steps divided them four now take your shot boy soon i will be too close and it will be difficult to get a bullet past my hands i chose badly conor realized i should have fled down the passage and fetched my father he had never shot a person never wanted to i want to build a flying machine with victor but victor was dead murdered by bonvilain i am upon you said the marshall conor shot him twice under his outstretched arms in the upper chest i had to do it he gave me no choice bonvilains steps faltered slightly but he kept coming he was purple in the forehead but the light in his eyes never wavered and now he said batting the gun from conors fingers to choke the life from your body as promised conor was lifted from the floor his arms and legs flapping battering ineffectively against the marshalls flanks which seemed to jingle when struck i am a templar boy said bonvilain have you never heard of us we like to wear chain mail going into war chain mail i have a vest on at the moment just in case things did not play out as i planned prudence is never wasted as we see here today this revelation did not matter much to conor now all he knew was that bonvilain still lived he had been shot but lived you hold him marshall said the sentry reclaiming his rifle hold him still and i will shoot him no shouted the marshall imagining the indignity of an epitaph that included the phrase accidentally shot while strangling a youth you prefer to do it yourself said the sentry sulking slightly bonvilain thought as he strangled he held in his hands literally the solution to his captain broekhart difficulty victor vigny had been right declan broekhart was his only real opposition in the saltee army surely there was a way to win the captains loyalty from this situation and if it required a little manipulation was that not his speciality an idea poked from the depths of bonvilains brain like the head of a sly serpent from a swamp what if the rebel victor vigny had not acted alone what if he had an accomplice the sentry for example the sentry was certainly expendable bonvilain felt a shiver run up his spine he was on the verge of brilliance he could feel it for bonvilain it was moments like these that made life tolerable moments that presented him with a challenge worthy of his specific talents you there idiot he said to the sentry open the window that one said the sentry though there was but one window in the apartment yes said bonvilain innocently the one overlooking the cliffs conor awoke from near strangulation in a damp windowless cell where he languished for hours his solitude was interrupted periodically by a brace of guards who stomped with considerable gusto on his slim frame on their final visit the pair stripped him of his clothing and bundled him into a saltee army uniform as yer own clothes stink of blood and fear conor wondered about this briefly through his pain why a soldiers uniform before his addled brain could reach any conclusion the beatings recommenced backhanded blows across the face one eye closed and he felt the blood flow down his nose the guards propped something soft on his head a towel perhaps to staunch the flow of blood maybe it seemed unusually compassionate there were more confusing meddlings with his person one swabbed his cheeks with what smelled like gunpowder the other scratched on his arm with an ink pen it went on for what seemed like hours when the guards were satisfied with their arrangements the fatter of the pair clamped a set of manacles on conors wrists and a lunatic box over his head pulling the head cages leather mouth strap tight until it forced conors teeth apart ratcheting back between his jaws the only noises he could make now were groans and grunts the cell itself was a tenfoot block of hell and conor could not credit that such a place existed on great saltee the walls and floor were granite hewn from the island itself no bricks or mortar just solid rock there was no escape from here water trickled through grooves worn by centuries of erosion conor did not waste a second thirsting for it the combination of lunatic box and manacles meant that he could not pass anything through the metal grille to his mouth in any case the grooves themselves were flaked by salt sea water they left him for an age wallowing in his misery the king was dead isabellas father murdered by bonvilain victor was gone too in the blink of an eye his mentor and friend cruelly killed and what was to become of conor himself surely bonvilain would not leave breath in the body of a witness conor felt the weight of the cage upon his head the gall of manacles chafing his wrists and the threat of his impending murder heavy on his heart the metal slab of door swung dragging on the hinges a tallow yellow light filled the room with a sickly glow and in that glow stood the unmistakable silhouette of sir hugo bonvilain the kings marshall and murderer because of this man isabella was an orphan rage took hold of conors body filling his limbs with strength he lurched to his feet arms outstretched towards bonvilain the sight cheered bonvilain tremendously the man actually whistled as he grasped the lunatic boxs grille stuffing his thick fingers between the bars he stepped to the side and casually swung conor into the wall wincing at the clang and clatter i used your own momentum against you he said as though school were in session basic training basic if one of my men made that mistake id have him flogged didnt that french dandy teach you anything bonvilain squatted propping conor against the rough damp wall a great day isnt it historic the king is gone apparently assassinated by rebels do you know what that means conor could not reply even if he wanted to if it had not been for the pain this would all seem like a cruel dream a night terror bonvilain rattled the lunatic box to make sure he had conors attention hello young broekhart still with us conor tried to spit at his captor but all he could do was gag good alive for now anyway about the king being dead let me tell you what it means it means an end to these ridiculous reforms money for the people the people unwashed uneducated rabble no more money for the people you can bet the blood in your veins on that everything king nicholas has done will be undone thought conor dully all for nothing isabella becomes queen a puppet queen but a queen nonetheless and can you guess what her obsession will become of course it was so obvious that a boy could see it even in conors dazed state i see by your eyes that you can guess she will dedicate her life to stamping out the rebels it will consume her i will make sure of it there will be no end to the number of rebels i will unearth any merchant who refuses to pay my tax any youth with a grudge all rebels all hanged i am closer now to being king than any bonvilain has ever been this statement hung between them heavy with centuries of treason creak of manacle chains and drip of water bonvilain yanked conors head as close as the bars would allow and unhooked the boxs mouth strap before he died your teacher said that i would never stop them all was victor vigny working with the french aeronauts or la légion noire the black legion conors lip was swollen from one punch or another and his jaws were shot with pain but he managed to speak there is no black legion you will destroy the saltees fighting an imaginary enemy let me tell you something little man snarled the marshall if it werent for the bonvilains these islands would be nothing more than rocks in the ocean nothing but salt and bird droppings we have nursemaided the trudeaus for centuries but no more these islands are mine now i will milk them dry and queen isabella stays alive so long as she does not interfere with that plan bonvilain rattled conors cage i am interested to hear what you think of this plan young broekhart why tell me murderer i am not your priest bonvilain shook the lunatic box as though it were a mystery gift not my priest very good i will miss our exchanges i tell you little broekhart because these are the very moments that make life worth living i am at my best in the thick of action stabbing shooting and plotting i enjoy it i exult in it for centuries the bonvilains have been behind the throne steering it with their machinations but never anything like this bonvilain was almost dazed by happiness everything he had planned for was now within reach and you my little meddler have transformed a good plan into a perfect one its your father you see he is a great soldier i can admit it a wonderful soldier he inspires great loyalty among the men i was planning to remove him and weather the storm but now the rebel victor vigny and you his indoctrinated student have killed the king your father is honour bound to protect the new queen with every breath in his body and because i will promise to keep his sons name out of the investigation declan broekhart will owe me his reputation and so you have made him loyal to me for that i thank you bonvilain leaned closer his face stretched in pantomime sadness but i have to tell you that he hates you now and so will isabella when i tell her my version of tonights events your father i would go so far as to say would kill you himself if i would allow it but thats family business and none of mine i should let him tell you himself and with that bonvilain hooked up the lunatic boxs bridle and threaded the manacle chain through a ring on the wall he stood his knees cracking his huge frame filling the cell his broad scarred brow suddenly thoughtful you would think i suffer with all the people i have killed the hundreds of lives i have destroyed should demons not visit me at night should i not be tormented by guilt sometimes i lie still in my bed and wait for judgement but it never arrives bonvilain shrugged then again why should it perhaps i am a good man after all socrates said there is only one good knowledge and one evil ignorance so as i am not ignorant i must be good he winked do you think that argument will fool saint peter conor realized at that moment that bonvilain was in a very dangerous way completely mad bonvilain came back to the moment anyway let us continue the philosophical discussion some other time why dont i fetch your father i fancy he has a few words for his errant son bonvilain strode jauntily from the cell whistling a strauss waltz conducting with an index finger conor was left on the floor neck aching from the weight of his cage but in spite of the pain there was now a spark of hope his father would see through this charade surely declan broekhart was nobodys fool and would not leave his son to wallow in a filthy cell in minutes conor felt certain he would be free to expose bonvilain as a murderer bonvilain had not even bothered to close the cell door a moment later he shepherded declan broekhart into the room conor had never seen his father so distressed declans back usually ramrod straight was hunched and shuddering and he held on to bonvilain like an old man leaning on his nurse the face was the worst thing it was dragged down by grief eyes mouth and wrinkles running like candle wax here he is said bonvilain softly with great compassion this is he just a few seconds conor inched along the wall straightening himself father he tried to say father help me but all that emerged from between his swollen hampered lips were thin groans declan broekhart loomed over him tears dripping from his chin because of you he whispered because of you then he lunged at conor reaching not to embrace but to kill bonvilain was ready for it he restrained declan broekhart with strong arms now declan be strong for catherine and for young isabella we all need you the saltees need you as he said this hugo bonvilain peered over broekharts shoulder and winked merrily this combination of grief and lunacy were like physical blows to young conor he recoiled from his father drawing his knees to his chin what was happening was the world mad declan broekhart gathered himself dragging a sleeve across his brow very well hugo he said haltingly i am composed now you were right that wretch is nothing to me nothing his death would not restore anything little saltee can deal with him let us leave here my wife needs me wretch his father was calling him a wretch of course captain broekhart declan of course and so bonvilain led him out two soldiers together comrades in grief what what is this declan little saltee conor used the last of his strength to moan around his mouth strap calling his father back and his father did turn back if only for a moment if only to deliver a few final withering remarks he vented these words with his eyes closed as if to even look at his son was more than he could bear your foul actions have taken my king from me he said and worse much worse because of what you have done this day i have no son my son is gone and this declan broekhart paused to struggle with his rage eventually calming himself my son is gone and you remain a word of warning traitor if i ever see you again it will be on the day i kill you these were words that no man should hear from another but from father to son they were indescribably harsh conor broekhart felt as though he was indeed brokenhearted as his name suggested he could do nothing but raise his manacled hands to the lunatic boxs grille and tug repeatedly jerking his injured head until the pain drove those hateful words from his head insane said bonvilain sadly leading declan broekhart from the cell but then he would have to be to do what he did as they left the cell bonvilain could barely maintain his show of grief the waiting guards were ready to draw cutlasses but bonvilain shook his head slightly his manipulation had worked so declan broekhart would live for now take the captain back to his carriage he instructed the guards i will watch the prisoner myself declan grasped bonvilains wrist you have been a friend today hugo we have had our fiery moments in the past but that is behind us i will not forget your speedy apprehension of the traitor and i trust he will pay for his part in the kings murder and for what he did to conor my son broekharts face cracked in grief once more how weak the man is thought bonvilain there is no need for such hysterics of course declan he shall pay you can count on it they parted with a handshake and broekhart half walked half stumbled along the length of the stone corridor bonvilain returned to conors cell to where the wretched boy lay unconscious a tiny fly in the master spiders web bonvilain knelt beside him he found himself feeling a touch sorry for young conor its natural not weakness he told himself i am human after all it was incredible really how easily the entire thing had been accomplished allow the king to set up his meeting with victor then blame the parisian for nicholass murder conor broekhart had been a delightful bonus a way to keep the father loyal admittedly he had toyed with them both a little but that was the skill of it his godgiven talent to manipulate people the final part of the plan had only occurred to him after conor had surprised him in the kings apartment following his near strangulation the boys face had been so swollen that he was barely recognizable even his own mother wouldnt know him bonvilain had ordered the youth to be dressed as a soldier a ratty old ball wig arranged on his head and his chin coated with gunpowder stubble the final trick was to have one of his sergeants a gifted man with pen and ink to draw a quick copy of the regimental tattoo on conors forearm a small touch but enough to make an impression with the blood shadows wig and uniform it was unlikely that broekhart would know his own son especially if he had just been informed that his son had been wrestled out of the kings window trying to defend nicholas and that this prisoner was one of the traitorous soldiers involved in the plan a sentrys corpse had already been found at the base of the wall conors dead body must have been swept south by the currents of course if declan broekhart had recognized his son then bonvilain himself would have immediately slit his throat conor could have taken the blame for that too a busy day for the boy regicide in the afternoon patricide in the evening but now thanks to bonvilains little games declan broekhart thought his son was dead and conor thought his father despised him for being a traitor sir hugo had utter control over the broekhart family and should declan ever turn against him then conor could be resurrected and used to blackmail his father unswerving loyalty in return for his sons life bonvilain knew that toying with conor was unnecessary and cruel but that was the fun of it his own brazen audacity thrilled him bonvilain clapped his hands gently three times bravo maestro bravo i love this thought bonvilain i exult in it part finn chapter little saltee the following evening conor broekhart was roughly bundled into a shallowdraught steamboat and shipped off to little saltee he was the only prisoner on deck and was forced to share the aft cage with two pigs and a goat there were two guards on the grubby steamboat and the most senior was eager to share his own importance with conor i dont normally ferry prisoners explained the man an irishman aiming a kick at the cage door to make sure conor was listening only the warden insisted i ship your bones personally myself as it were the order came direct from marshall bonvilain so whats a body to do turn down bonvilain i doubt it sonny not unless you want to spend the afternoon shaking hands with your maker conor was not interested in chatter he was as lost in this day as a chick wet from the egg on the surface things were the same he recognized little saltees shape to the north but it seemed a dreadful place now even at a distance yesterday he had looked upon the island as the seat of justice only yesterday could it be how much had happened in one day the ferrys broad hull hammered the waves raising a salty mist that the boat steamed through the spray unfurled across the gunwales drenching the cages occupants not one of them flinched for a moment conor felt only blessedly cool then the salt sank into his wounds causing him to cry out his cry seemed to please his escort ah still alive are we mister conor finn mister conor finn conor wasnt surprised bonvilain would not wish his prisoners real name known so he was to be conor finn conor finn continued the guard friend to smugglers and firstclass lunatic turf head scatterfool you wont be enjoying it in our mad wing not in the slightest conor finn smuggler and lunatic bonvilain was taking no chances even if there were someone to talk with who would believe a smuggler and a lunatic no little saltee is not a place for mirth no maypoles nor circus antics especially not for conor finn bonvilain says to take special care of you in the mad wing and if bonvilain says it then arthur billtoe does it conor squinted through puffy eyelids taking a serious look at this guard the man was not unlike a lithograph victor had once shown him of the pongo abelii or sumatran orangutan his pugnacious features were ringed with a thick fringe of dirty brown and grey hair the same hair that ran in rivulets into the neck of his ruffled pirates shirt he wore thigh boots on squat powerful legs and silver rings adorned his fingers at another time conor might have poked fun at this mans swashbuckling rig but now his appearance was frightening how could someone so removed from reality be trusted to perform a guards duties still there existed somewhere a spark of the old conor the conor from yesterday nice boots captain he mumbled billtoe was not angry not a bit of it he smiled revealing half a dozen plugstained teeth oh we shall have some sport with you my lad you have no idea i dress how i fancy and i do what i fancy in my corner of little saltee arthur billtoe is king the king is dead thought conor leaning back against the animals in his cage i saw him dead the animals were bony and shivering and almost as miserable as conor himself the steamer swung round the tip of galgee rock and on to a crescent beach below little saltees turreted gate the sun was setting between gun ports and cast a red light across the sand crabs scuttled in rock pools fighting for scraps and a funnel of gulls inland marked the gaols kitchen just as surely as any flag billtoe opened the cage carelessly hauling conor out by his manacles chain while his partner secured the bowline here we are mister conor finn i should warn you men dont much like soldiers on little saltee be you soldier or be you not youre wearing the trousers for the first time conor regretted his height he could easily pass for enlisting age though there was no beard on his chin i wish i could fly he thought gazing longingly into the morning sky leave this nightmare behind fly home to but he could never fly home no more lessons with victor no more models of gliders and airships no more fencing with isabella and his father had sworn to kill him on sight a promise was infinitely more painful than the act itself would be a large part of conor wished his father had made good on his promise immediately billtoe tumbled conor over the gunwale on to a low wooden jetty into the restraining arms of the second guard lets get the fleas off him mister pike he said feed him some slop and get him ready for the mine arthur billtoe dug a plug of chewing tobacco from his pocket stuffing it between bottom teeth and lip were soldier boys family now so lets send him off to work with a little saltee kiss a nice long one the guards urged conor along the slipway with prods from their rifle butts as they passed into the prison proper conor noticed that the curtain wall was at least twelve feet thick and built of solid granite hundreds of years ago raymond trudeau had ordered the prison built from the rock dug from the island itself as the walls went up the prison went down there were caveins and floods and prisoners died but prisoners dying had never been enough to stop the mining until king nicholas took the throne now that bonvilain was in charge inmate safety would hardly be high on the agenda the guards bustled him beneath a portcullis its black iron teeth clanking with every wave shudder they emerged into a wide courtyard overlooked by saltblasted crenellations and at least a dozen sharpshooters in one corner of the courtyard was a sunken pool which had been roughly walled the pool was six feet by six the depth was made unclear by the clouds of algae and slime lurking below the surface the water stank of stagnation and rot in you pop said billtoe cheerily a second before heaving conor over the lip with a forearm kill anything those mites will conor heard him say in the fraction of a moment before the murky water closed over him and his manacles dragged him to the spongy bed conor tensed every sinew and muscle expecting more saltwater pain but instead the water soothed his cuts fresh water something else too natural anaesthetic in the weeds perhaps before conor could appreciate this unforeseen bliss the clouds in the pool moved towards him purposefully they were alive conor was on the point of opening his mouth to yell out when his good sense prevailed he was underwater opening his mouth would mean inviting these microscopic characters into his gut he sucked his lips between his teeth sealing them tight and fought the manacles weight so that he could pinch his nostrils closed his ears would have to fend for themselves the mites went to work on conors person scraping his skin with their infinitesimal teeth to conor this seemed like macabre torture but to his person these mites were a boon plant spores agitated by the mites disinfected his wounds which the mites cleaned by eating all traces of infection they chipped off blood and scab diving deep into gashes chewing back to the bare wound they ate loose hair and dirt even gnawing the fake regimental tattoo on the boys forearm the only things they ignored were the dots of gunpowder on conors jowls but those were sluiced off by the currents created by his own thrashings conor didnt believe the guards would let him drown bonvilain would not deliver him to this place so that he could be murdered in the courtyard nevertheless the nibbling mites pushed him to the brink of despair and had the guards not gaffed his chain and lugged him from the pool he would have opened his mouth and accepted flooded lungs rather than endure another second of mites scouring his skin conor lay gasping on the rough flagstones their ridges hard against his forehead there were mites on him still he could feel their vibrations on his eyebrows and in his ears their buzzing on his skin get them off he begged his captors hating himself for doing it please the guards did so chuckling with buckets of salt water lined up for the purpose the salt sting traced burning lines along his body like sections of the barbed wire king nicholas had imported from texas but even this sting was preferable to a million mites teeth billtoe swiped the seat of conors trousers with his boot up you get conor finn move now if you want a bed otherwise its sleep in the open makes no difference to me but theyre cranking the bell in the pipe tomorrow and you need all your energy for the bell this talk of pipes and bells was gibberish to conor a church orchestra perhaps conor doubted that there would be anything as spiritually uplifting as church music in this place he stood slowly head to one side dislodging the last of the mites what were those creatures he asked his voice strange in his own clogged ears feeder mites answered billtoe freshwater parasites it takes real care to breed those little beauties this is the only pool of em outside of australia thanks to wandering heck we heat it special conor minded this little lesson closely victor had told him never to disregard information information was what saved lives not ignorant heroics and yet all the information inside victors head hadnt managed to save his own life wandering hecks proper title was king hector ii the king of the saltees before nicholas king hector had been far more interested in exploring other continents than running his own country a fact that must have suited marshall bonvilain conor stood allowing his arms to sag low so the ground could bear the weight of his chain something hissed near his left eye a heated hiss conor was too beaten down by the day to react otherwise he could have delayed the inevitable until a few more guards were summoned as it was a single guard was more than sufficient to hold him against the wall arthur billtoe pinned his left hand to the stone with a redhot cattle brand a little saltee kiss said billtoe hope you enjoy it conor stared at it incredulously for a moment watching the water boil off smelling the scorched reek of his own flesh there was no pain but it was coming and there was no way on earth to avoid it i want to fly away from this place thought conor i need to fly away the pain arrived and conor broekhart flew away but only in his tired mind chapter in the middle of wynter morning arrived early on little saltee heralded by a single cannon shot aimed towards the mainland the shot was a saltee tradition that had been missed only twice in the six hundred years since king raymond ii had inaugurated the custom once in ad when an outbreak of plague wiped out half the population in less than a month and then again in the middle ages when eusebius crows pirate fleet had all but overrun great saltee the single cannon shot served both to awaken the prisoners and to remind irish smugglers brigands or even government forces that the saltee forces were vigilant and ready to repel all attackers conor broekhart awoke on a wooden pallet to the sound of cannon echo he had slept deeply in spite of all that had happened his body needed time without interruption to repair itself and so had granted him a night of dreamless sleep numerous pains assaulted his senses but the most urgent sang from his left hand a little saltee kiss so it was all real then the kings assassination the orphaning of dear isabella and his own fathers threats of murder all real wincing conor raised his hand to inspect the wound and was surprised to find it covered with a neat bandage green fluid oozed through the materials border do you like that dressing boy said a voice the green muck is plantago lanceolata i put some on your face too cost me my last plug of tobacco from one of the guards conor squinted across the cells gloom a pair of long thin legs poked from the shadows a skinny wrist was draped over one knee long fingers tapping imaginary piano keys you did this asked conor the dressing i have i had a friend who was good with medicines as a young man i rode with the missouri ruffians for a year during the civil war continued the man his accent american i learned a little about medicine of course when they learned that i was a yankee spy jesse james himself took a poker to my skull i suppose he thought id seen enough thank you sir i was not expecting kindness in this place and you wont see much granted the yankee but what you do see shines like a diamond in a bucket of coal naturally we lunatics are the kindest of the bunch conor was momentarily puzzled we lunatics then he remembered that bonvilain had declared him insane a turf head scatterfool the american was still talking of course technically i am an invalid not a lunatic but we are all lumped together here on little saltee lunatics invalids violent cases he stood slowly extending a hand allow me to introduce myself my name is linus wynter with a y in the middle of wynter you understand you will be seeing a lot of me but i wont be seeing much of you im afraid wynter emerged from the shadows like a stack of brooms falling from a closet a tall gangle of a man over fifty clothed in the ragged remnants of a oncefine evening suit like conor he wore a bandage but his was tied across the sockets where his eyes had been jesse james had done a thorough job with his poker the scars of which ran in purple welts across wynters high brow wynter tugged on the bandage i used to wear an opera mask when i played very melodramatic very dickens conor shook linus wynters hand as firmly as he could manage conor finn that is my name now wynter nodded his prominent nose and adams apple sending angular shadows dancing across his face and neck good a new name in little saltee it is better to become a different person the old conor is dead and gone a man needs a new sensibility to survive here even a very young man conor flexed his fingers pain scraped his tendons but everything functioned as it should he examined his prison cell without enthusiasm it was as rough and ready as his previous cell with one small barred and glassed window and a couple of wooden pallets something wynter had said struck him belatedly even a very young man conor waved his hand before wynters eyes how can you tell my age have your other senses compensated yes they have so if you could lower your hand but i know all about you young conor broekhart or conor finn because you were fevered in the night and kept me awake with your babblings the king he is truly dead then tears welled on conors eyelids hearing a stranger say the words aloud had the effect of planting bonvilains deed in the real world yes i saw him dead wynter sighed long and mournfully running his fingers through fine greying hair that is indeed grave news more than you know bonvilain will drag these islands back to the dark ages you know bonvilain i know a lot about the affairs of the saltees wynter seemed about to elaborate his mouth open for the next word when he paused cocking his head to one side in the manner of a deer that senses nearby hunters time for histories this evening over dinner perhaps he leaned forward fingers scrabbling through the air like spiders until they settled on conors shoulders now listen to me conor finn he said with some urgency the guard approaches they will try to break you today watch carefully for trouble a sly blade a plank across the shins come through this day intact and tonight i shall teach you how to survive this hell there is an end to it and we shall see it believe me break me said conor why it is the way here a broken man or even boy is not likely to upset production and on little saltee production is the real king not arthur billtoe conor pictured the monkey pirate who had ferried him to the prison it was unlikely that billtoe would lift a bejewelled finger to protect conor what can i do work hard replied wynter and trust neither man nor beast especially a sheep before linus wynter could explain this unexpected remark the doors heavy bolt scraped through its rings with an almost musical sound top c said wynter dreamily every morning wonderful this was a noise that conor would yearn for over the months to come a noise he heard in his dreams the latchs release signified liberation from his dank cell but also served as a reminder that the liberation was temporary social diarists record that survivors of little saltee often suffered from insomnia unless their bedchamber doors were fitted with rusted bolts arthur billtoe peeped round the door wearing the cheery expression of a kindly uncle waking his nephew for a plunge in the swimming hole his hair was slicked back with a smear of grease and thick stubble poked through his skin like nails driven from the inside ready for the pipe are you conor finn he said jingling a set of handcuffs wynters fingers gripped tight like coal tongs mouth shut work hard mind the sheep and dont cross mister billtoe billtoe entered the cell clapping the cuffs round conors wrists oh yes never cross me little soldier you lay one finger on me and you will be strapped to a low ring at high tide and as for the sheep wise words from the blind man sheep are not for stewing here on little saltee all this talk of sheep was strange and ominous conor guessed that he had a surprise coming and not the jolly kind traditionally in hostelries and even in prisons around the globe breakfast is served before a shovel is lifted not so on little saltee here the morning meal was used as an incentive to work harder no diamonds no bread it was a straightforward equation that had proved effective for centuries conor had expected a detour to a mess hall but instead was led directly to the diamond mine or the pipe as the prisons occupants called it billtoe explained little saltees routine on the way salts with a tum full of grub are inclined to be satisfied and dopey he said chewing on a hank of bread which he stored in his pocket between bites to conor who hadnt tasted a morsel in twentyfour hours this was yet another form of torture his hunger pangs were soon subdued by billtoes revolting habit of half swallowing each mouthful then regurgitating it to relish the taste once more each regurgitation was accompanied by a convulsion that ran along billtoes spine like a flicked rope though conor was repulsed he knew his hunger would soon return gnawing on the lining of his stomach as if his body had turned on itself in desperation he was distracted from his hunger by the peal of a church bell in the distance this was something of a mystery in such a godforsaken place billtoe seemed cheered by the sound say your prayers boy he cackled the guard jabbed his rifle butt into conors spine pushing him along a cobbled passageway lit by torches and dawn glow from roof portholes the surf crashed against the granite wall on their left which was halfnatural halfhewn as though the island was growing through the structure each wave crash shook the entire corridor and set a hundred rivulets pulsing through mortar as crumbly as cheese below sea level we are explained billtoe as though conor needed telling a while back the prison and the mine were two separate things but the trudeaus greed and the inmates labour drew them together the prison basement was heading that way and eventually the two met up just a matter of bashing through a wall it was fortunate for us guards in the mad wing now theres no need for us to venture out in the elements we let the lunatics work the pipe half the time they dont even know its dangerous and most of them will work until their hands bleed if you tell em thats what mummy would want this exposition was delivered in a cheery tone that belied billtoes cruel nature if it had not been for the gun butt in his back and the burning saltee kiss on his hand conor might have believed the guard a decent man they passed along a maze of corridors dotted with strong doors and collapsing arches the entire prison basement seemed in danger of imminent cavein looks like the whole place is coming down dont it said billtoe reading conors expression its been looking like that since i got here doubtless this pit will outlive you though you being a salt thats not much of a boast salt conor had heard the term before this was what little saltee inmates were called forever branded as such by the s on their hands he was a salt now they emerged from the corridor into an open area which may have been a pantry in previous centuries the walls were smeared with faded spice marks and flour swabs the central flags had been excavated and ladders thrown down to the area below roughly a score more guards stood around tooled with standard rifles but also more personal weapons conor spotted indian blades whips dirks cutlasses american sixshooters blackjacks and even one samurai sword the saltee tradition of hiring mercenaries had left its mark on local weaponry the guards lounged about smoking chewing and spitting they feigned easiness but conor noted that every last man of them had a fist on some weapon or other this was a dangerous place to be and it didnt do to forget it the ladders dropped down to open water deep black and ridged with whatever light could find it more guards were ranged about the cave walls below keeping their boots above the water line several convicts wrestled with a scaffolding rig taking the weight of a huge brass bell which swung pendulously in the confined space knocking stone splinters from the cave wall where it struck and sending huge cathedral bongs booming through the upper level welcome to the pipe said billtoe spitting breadcrumbs conor knew something of the islands geology from victors teachings and quickly realized what was happening here the saltee diamond pipe was brewed in the gullet of a volcano on the other side of the world sliced off by a glacier and deposited off the irish coast this meant that someday the diamond supply would run out especially considering the constant and eager mining by the trudeau family this was not the first time underwater mining had been used to bolster diamond supplies but king nicholas had banned the practice within six months of his coronation this brass bell was a diving bell from the belly of which prisoners could chip rough diamonds from the underwater section of the pipe king nicholass decrees were being overturned before his body was cold bonvilain had clearly been plotting for long bitter years that bell is ancient conor said almost to himself it must be a hundred years old billtoe shrugged theatrically then unlocked conors handcuffs that fact doesnt bother me being that im not the one going down in it thank god a man could get hurt and worse as you will find out this fine morning down you go another shove from billtoes rifle butt sent conor stumbling towards a broad ladder poking from the caves shadows the ladder beams jabbed him in the chest preventing a tumble into the hole and the end of a very short mining career one coming down billtoe shouted the senior guard scowled up through the gloom conor recognized him as billtoes partner of the previous evening his main distinguishing features were a seeming lack of any hair and a pinched stance which made him seem almost hunchbacked we dont need another arthur he cried full complement we have even if a few croak it in the bell billtoe took conor by the scruff urging him on to the ladder thats enough out of you pike this is marshall bonvilains special boy remember he needs to be looked after pikes expression changed from wheedling to leering ah the special boy the little prince send him down i have a few rams waiting to bump horns with him sheep again what could it mean billtoe stepped on conors fingers forcing him down a rung down you go conor finn dont make me break your fingers these are good boots and salt blood would ruin em on me there was a curious expectant silence as conor climbed down into the pit he could feel the temperature drop with every rung until the cold of the water crept from its surface like an invisible cowl draping itself heavily on conors shoulders he was really scared during those moments almost too petrified to move but gravity tugged at his bones helping him on his way the madwing convicts were a motley lot favouring the stonystare slackjawed demeanour they glared at conor with loathing and fear and the threat of harm hung heavy in the salty air for long moments the only sounds were the creaking ladder and the gentle slap of water on rock finally conor arrived on the surface feeling like an enemy flag under the hammering gaze of so many hostiles billtoe stepped down behind him and pointed at the diving bell that there is flora you know what she is salt conor mumbled his reply shes a diving bell no turf head shes a billtoe was frustrated to have his information stolen he poked conor in the chest with a rigid finger yes she is a diving bell and because you know all about it you can be first into her flora has been out of service for several years but im sure all is well with her fittings conor forced himself to study the bell though all he wanted to do was clasp his knees in a quiet corner and cry for the bad luck that had cursed him the bell seemed sound enough though deeply gouged by stone in several places she was suspended by a network of chains that hitched to an iron hoop dangling over its prow the hoop in turn fed half a dozen more chains to the scaffolding above the chains seemed as ancient as the bell with several rustdappled links shedding flakes as they swung a cracked rubber hose poked from the top of the bell snaking upwards to a handcranked bellows affair which conor presumed to be an ancient air pump the pump was being cranked by two inmates one was racked with consumptive coughing fits and the other paused regularly to spit tobacco phlegm on to the rocks not the ideal pair for the job conor would not rely on either to supply enough oxygen to fuel the lungs of a small dog billtoe stepped well back and called out his command to a guard above lower her down do not break the hose or the warden will tan all our hides the diving bell descended in fits according to the strength of the inmates bearing the strain and the clumsy coiling of chains on the previous use some of the links had fused in tangled knots and now popped free sending the diving bell lurching and swinging the cavern walls resounded with irregular clangs and bongs causing anyone with free hands to cover their ears hells bells man billtoe called up to his comrade it sounds like drunk day in saint christophers in here saint christopher had been adopted by the trudeaus as the saltees patron saint the church on great saltee bore his name it aint my fault billtoe retorted the guard shes coming aint she mind i dont land her on your head it was said only in jest but billtoe stepped aside smartish just the same flora swung lower like a skittish baby monkey on a rope until eventually she splashed into the black water sending wave rings rushing to the rocks every day sighed billtoe mopping his brow with a kerchief we have to go through this blasted rigmarole every day from this out he turned his attention and annoyance to the prisoners at the pumps crank you aprontugging turnipbrained scatterfools yes boss they mumbled and set to pumping the bellows sending air through the rubber hose and into the bell itself the hose wriggled and flipped as the air inflated it slightly the bell sank slowly into the sea emitting a curious shivering hum as the water caressed its surface billtoe elbowed conor you hear that soldier boy we call that the sirens song because its the last sound many of you salts hear lord i had forgotten how soothing it was a band of glass with rubber seals was set into the diving bells dome the window was covered with a scree of algae and filth that made it impossible to see through billtoe followed conors gaze yes pity about that port filthy as a beggars britches we wont be seeing much of what goes on in there today i do hope and pray there are no unfortunate accidents conor had little doubt that whatever was coming would be unfortunate for him but it would be no accident billtoe meant to break him in the bell this whole affair was becoming nightmarish he recoiled from the guard as he would from a brandished torch what are you twitching for boy asked billtoe crazed so soon youd best be keeping your wits about you in the bell surprisingly these were bordering on words of wisdom from the prison guard they were meant as a warning and conor took them as one whatever his problems hed best forget them until he was safe in his cell linus wynter would help him to survive this hellhole but only if he lived long enough to see him again while conor did not believe that the traitor bonvilain wished him dead perhaps there was a kind of sheep that did not follow orders so well what do i need to do he asked billtoe best to be as prepared as possible billtoe was happy to deliver a lecture we lower flora on to the pipe then you goes down with your partner and chip off diamonds simple as bread pudding he barked at an inmate loitering at the waterline you fish bait give him your belt the man placed a protective hand on his belt but boss i been polishing these tools for years got em from my dad billtoe tapped his head as though there was water lodged in his ears whats this chattering i hear the chattering of a dead man must be leaking through his punctured neck two seconds later the leather belt was in conors hands billtoe ran through the tools you got your pick hammer for breaking down the rock hammer the rock then pick out the diamonds which will resembled nothing more than glassy marbles dont worry about breaking the diamonds you wont be able to because theyre the hardest substance in nature said conor automatically hardest substance in nature continued billtoe then scowled he reached over and cuffed conor on the temple dont be supplying me with information that i am supplying to you that is a very annoying trait which i would relish beating out of you conor nodded ignoring the pain in his head just as he was ignoring the other pains this here said billtoe proudly pointing to a little trident tool is a devils fork invented on this very island by one arthur billtoe over twenty years ago got me a job for life this little beauty did plus marshall bonvilain himself granted me a house on great saltee its tele tele telescopic said conor thinking that if billtoe could not even pronounce the word telescopic it was unlikely that he had invented a telescopic tool more likely he had stolen the idea from an inmate exactly telescopic on the tip of me tongue it was billtoe slipped the fork from its holder and twisted a few rings extending the tool from eight inches to three feet now yer can wriggle this little beauty into cracks and spear any stones what has fallen down there amazing eh conor knew enough to nod though an extendable fork was hardly amazing in anyones book it was practical though and canny and proved that bonvilain knew a good idea when he saw one so all you have to do salt is swim down there into the bell and dig out as many diamonds as you can until your swing is over stash them in your net and bring them back up simple as bread pudding naturally we search all the divers and if we find any stones outside of that net then i find the biggest bull of a guard on the island and have him flog the thievery out of you straight enough for you little soldier conor nodded wondering how close the pipe was to open sea once more billtoe displayed a disturbing ability to anticipate conors very thoughts of course you may decide to swim for it the lure of freedom may be too strong for you feel free to give it your best you may even make it mind you youd be the first and bigger men than you have tried we still get bodies washing up in the cave decades after they went in and do you know something they all look the same way dead conor cinched the belt round his waist drawing it tight to the last hole he could figure no escape from this task in greek mythology when the heroes were faced with daunting trials they went about them with stoic determination and emerged victorious conor could not muster an ounce of determination for this trial all he felt was a weight of exhaustion and even if he did emerge victorious his only reward would be more of the same tomorrow and the day after that billtoe encouraged him with a friendly wink and a jaunty tapping of his fingers upon the pistol stock at his waist conor set foot in the water and the cold gripped him in its icy fist squeezing the life from his toes an involuntary gasp escaped his lips causing much laughter from the assembled men conor took a moment to become used to the water temperature casting a quick eye around the cave wondering if there were a single person who would come to his aid every gaze he crossed was hostile these were rugged men in evil surroundings with little time to waste on sympathy conor realized that were it not for their uniforms it would be impossible to separate the guards from the inmates he was alone in this endeavour fourteen and alone this was one of the few occasions in conors life when his father was not there to provide guidance and if declan broekhart had been there perhaps he would have laughed along with the rest of them it was an unbearable thought though he was without doubt on his own there was something in conor broekhart that would not allow him to give in his mothers brain and his fathers spirit were strong in his heart he would endure somehow and survive if conor could return to his cell still breathing then the american linus wynter could teach him a lesson or two about little saltee push it all from your mind he told himself forget your family the king isabella forget them all just live to think on them another day this was easier conceived than achieved but conor did the best he could concentrating on the scene before him shutting away his torment he stepped off the rocky ledge sinking fast into the cold dark waters of little saltee for a moment the cold was absolute and it seemed as though nothing could ever be any colder conor thrashed his limbs not from fear but to generate some heat he had often swum on the saltee beaches before but the waters he was in now had never been blessed with sun there was nothing to raise the temperature a few degrees conor opened his eyes peering through the liquid gloom below him he spied a blob of orange like a fading sun in the grip of black space the bell it is not so far down he told himself a chap would have to be a pretty poor swimmer not to make that distance ten kicks at most conor duck dived cupping his hands to better scoop the water he had always been a good swimmer and immediately the orange blob assumed its proper bell shape and he could make out the texture of its surface this tiny success comforted him somewhat i am not helpless i can still do things the bell swung gently two feet above the cave bed air bubbles leaked like pearl strings from a dozen tiny breaches conor hooked his fingers under its curved rim and wriggled inside his efforts were rewarded by air not by any means sweet or fresh but air nonetheless conor filled his lungs to capacity ignoring the rubbery smell and the oily film that instantly coated his nose and throat the water rose six inches into the bell and the surface below conors feet was uneven slick and treacherous this was not an ideal working environment the bell itself had a diameter of barely ten feet and swung in irregular arcs with the current butting conor in the shoulder and elbow he hunched his shoulders as far as possible protecting his head the light was murky and wavering conor peered upwards through the porthole but could make out nothing more distinct than vague wavering silhouettes perhaps men perhaps rocks it was impossible to tell but then one of the silhouettes detached itself from the group conor watched with a dread colder than sea water as the figure leaped into the ocean shattering its surface into a jigsaw of silver crescents the sound of the splash carried through the bells air hole another sound carried too laughter wafting through the pipe like ghost mirth dark vicious threatening laughter conor choked down absolute terror survive you can do things survive then something flashed past a pale limb thick and muscled swatting at the water and on the forearm drawn with bold punctures visible even through a sheen of scum a tattoo of a horned ram a sheep thought conor sheep are not for stewing here on little saltee the figure disappeared from view pulling itself down the bell curve hands slapped at the brass setting off a cacophony of shuddering clangs inside the bells skirt the clangs reverberated around the diving bell until conor prayed for silence surely his ears were bleeding then four thick fingers curled under the bells rim shimmering white in the water each finger was tattooed with a single letter even upside down it didnt take a scholar to read what the letters promised p a i n conor didnt doubt it for a second a huge man dragged himself along the seabed mindless of the sharp rocks scraping his flesh when he stood inside the bell a dozen red rivulets ran down his torso it suddenly seemed to conor that there was not enough air left to breath he backed away until the diving bells cold metal moulded the curve of his spine the mans size was doubtless exaggerated by the confined space but still he seemed a giant to conor he spread his arms wide tinkling his fingers on the brass bell as though it were a grand piano the sweet sound was hardly appropriate for the situation whatever this man intended to do he seemed to be in no hurry to complete his mission he stretched this way and that cracking neck and knuckles all the while wearing an expression of serene contentment conor read many things into that half smile a confidence in his brutish abilities the memories of past violence and the anticipation of the job at hand the man smiled a yellow tobacco grimace but then his expression drooped as he realized conors age hells bells youre nothing but a boy what did you do lie about your age to get a ticket for the army are you that desperate to patrol a wall there aint even a war on youre a sheep said conor numbly sheep are not for stewing here on little saltee the man stroked his tattoo fondly there are those that call us sheep but our name proper is the battering rams that being our favourite method of doing the big job conor understood the sheep references now the battering rams were a notorious gang of london irish who were involved in smuggling in ports from london to boston and whose other main source of income was from hiring out thugs it would seem that this particular ram had been gainfully employed ah well continued the man ive been paid now and i dont like to disappoint my employers so youll have to take your licks boy or not are you going to kill me asked conor the mans smell filled the bell clogging the confined space sweat blood tobacco and stale breath the man rolled his shirt open revealing a list tattooed on his chest i could kill you and my employer would still be in credit because he paid me three pounds conor read the words on the mans pale flesh punching shillings both eyes blacked shillings nose and jaw broke shillings jacked out knocked out with a black jack shillings ear chewed off same as previous leg or arm broke shillings shot in leg shillings stab same as previous doing the big job pounds and up the man buttoned his shirt he paid me the full three pounds but said i was to spread it out keep punching on a daily basis until he was out of credit thats a fair whack of punching but you being such a slip of a whelp i reckon one belt a day should do it maybe if the task is becoming tiresome after a few weeks i may chew your ear off just to finish it conor was finding it difficult to believe what he was hearing the man had such a professional manner as though he were a roofer quoting for a slate job what will you do if your prices go up the man frowned you mean the tattoo i never thought of that i suppose ill have to have it writ over theres a little galway geezer what is good with the needles anyway see yer tomorrow what said conor but before his teeth had closed over the final consonant the mans huge fist had already begun its arc swinging towards conors head like a cannonball the last things conor saw were the letters p a i n but he remained conscious for long enough to hear the battering ram sing this savage ditty we stabs em we fights em cripples em bites em no rules for our mayhem you pay us we slays em if youre in a corner with welshers or scams pay us a visit the battering rams and then the whole world was wet and conor gladly allowed himself to be tugged away by the currents maybe this time i wont wake up he thought i need never wake up again but wake up he did many hours later with linus wynter bending over him green paste dripping from his fingers more plantago i fear he explained this is becoming a habit conor closed his eyes again fearful that he would cry he kept himself still for long minutes breathing quiet breaths through his nose he could feel the cold muck on his temple where the giant had struck him and more on his hand where the brand still scalded there must be an end to this how long could a mind endure such torture and stay whole you have been asleep for nearly twelve hours i saved your rations for you have some water at least water the very word had the power to awaken conor fully his throat felt flaked with thirst mans primary instinct is to survive victor had once told him and he will endure almost anything to follow his instincts water croaked the boy raising his head until the plantago juice ran down his forehead wynter held a rough earthenware cup to conors lips dribbling water down his throat to conor the drink tasted like life itself and soon he felt strong enough to hold the cup he sat slowly sighing gratefully for the simple pleasure of slaking his thirst and now you should eat said wynter keep your body strong a fever in here could kill you conor laughed a feeble shuddering as though fever would ever have the chance to kill him the battering ram had almost three pounds worth of beatings to dole out and it was hardly likely that conor could survive those wynter pressed a shallow bowl into conors hand whatever happened to you and whatever is going to happen you will not have a prayer without strength in your limbs conor relented picking a chunk of cold meat from the bowl of stew even when hot conor doubted that the meal could ever have been called appetizing the meat was tough with a wide band of fat and hard burn ridges along each side but meat was strength and strength was what he would need to go back in the bell with a mad ram now said wynter tell me what happened today they brought you back here on a plank for a moment i couldnt even find a heartbeat conor chewed on a lump of meat the fat was slick and rubbery between his teeth they put me in a diving bell with one of those battering rams describe him instructed wynter big man enormous tattoos all over p a i n on his knuckles and a price list on his chest completed conors cellmate thats otto malarkey the top ram that animal has beaten more men than he can count and he can count well enough especially when theres coin involved hes been paid coin aplenty to keep handing out daily beatings this is how they will break me a simple but effective plan admitted wynter set the big man beating the little man that tactic worked on everyone even napoleon conor took a drink of water now that his senses were returning he could taste the saltpetre in it there must be something i can do wynter thought on it fixing the bandage across his eyes with long pianists fingers this problem is more important than all the daily vexations i had planned to educate you on this evening malarkey must be dealt with if you are to survive young conor yes but how you need to rest lie flat and think on your strengths draw on everything you have ever been taught tease out every violent daydream you have ever nursed in your darkest hours you must have talents you are a tall boy and strong and if i do have talents what then insisted conor another simple plan whispered wynter older even than the first when you see malarkey next you must immediately kill him kill him i cant i could never wynter smiled kindly you are a good lad conor kind killing is hateful to you and the thought that you could ever take a life is a terrible one yes i am not the kind of wynter raised a conductors finger we are all that kind of person survival is the most basic instinct but you are sensitive i can tell so i will help you along the road to murder since my eyes were taken from me i have become adept at recreating images in my head i can see the concert halls of my youth time and concentration fill the spaces until the picture is complete every velvetcovered chair every footlight every gilded cherub for a long moment wynter was lost in his own colourful past then the sounds and smells of little saltee shattered his mental image what i need you to do is close your eyes and picture the man who sent you here use your hatred of him to awaken the killer instinct conor did not need to concentrate for long bonvilains face sprang into his minds eye complete with hateful eyes and derisory sneer and now conor tell me do you think you can kill conor considered everything bonvilain had done to the broekhart family yes he said i can kill linus wynter smiled sadly we all can he said god save our souls chapter the devils fork in the door opposite conor broekharts bunk there was a small rectangular window perhaps three times in every hour a guard passed by bearing a torch flickering orange light poured into the gloom of their cell casting a vague dancing flame on conors hand when he raised it to examine his saltee kiss there already crusted in scab a cursive s he was branded now forever a criminal a kind of peace had descended on conor events were simply so monumental that he could not deal with them and that brought a kind of freedom there was nothing to do but concentrate on otto malarkey the deadly battering ram who so cheerfully swatted his prey around the diving bell must he be killed is there no other way there was not he concluded sadly it was either otto malarkey or himself and though conor had never been puffed by selfimportance he sincerely believed that he had more to offer the human race than the murderous malarkey at the very least he would try to avoid killing any more of his fellow man but how to kill malarkey how what skills had he learned from victor the foil of course had always been his greatest success he had the strength of a fencing master in his wrists and the agility of a youth in his limbs but how to combine the two i dont even have a foil or anything like one but then conor remembered the tool belt that had been cinched about his waist perhaps that was not strictly true perhaps arthur billtoe had unwittingly come to his rescue the following days routine was the same as the previous ones shortly after the single cannonshot salute billtoe appeared at the cell door a fresh slab of grease taming his locks that morning he appeared to have shaved sections of his face leaving the rest sprouting black silver and ginger bristle ready for round two with malarkey he asked rifle held before him in case conor should prove resistant to the idea of being hammered around a diving bell by a battering ram conor stood painfully the stiffness of various mistreatments binding his bones i am not ready mister billtoe but i dont suppose that makes a shadow of difference billtoe chortled fishing the handcuffs from his belt you are right lad you have hit the badger on the nut not one shade of difference lets be having you and why not order a big pot of plantago stew from mister wynter if he could see his way clear to mixing it up linus did not react to the goading just held his face in a grim aspect conor took this as a reminder of what had to be done today he became a killer or else a corpse the route to the pipe was the same but on this morning there was a commotion behind the cell doors inmates roared taunts and slapped the wood with the flats of their hands moon madness explained billtoe she was hanging in the sky last night like a silver shilling always gets the lunatics riled up a nugget of information popped into conors mind thats what the word means moonstruck from the latin lunaticus billtoe propelled conor along the corridor with a boot in the small of his back dont keep giving me information it makes me feel stupid and feeling stupid irritates me a familiar feeling ill bet muttered conor billtoe could not be certain whether or not he was being insulted he tapped conor with his boot again just to be on the safe side talk clever to malarkey he loves a lippy mark just adds to his enthusiasm malarkeys name doused conors wit and his despair was clear on his face thats right cackled billtoe stick that in one of your lesson books go on write it down not so generous with the information now are you the diving bell was already below water when they arrived at the pipe its tip poking through the surface the blurred shapes of two inmates were visible through the porthole hacking agitatedly at the rock below their feet guards chose pumpers from a gang of prisoners corralled into a wooden pen on the storeroom level changing them often to keep the air flowing the pipe never sleeps said billtoe not now that good king nick is gone all day every day pulling angel tears out of the earth and do we see a penny we do not conor noted the guards bitterness it could prove to be useful information if he remained on this earth long enough to make use of it there are compensations though sport like this for example said billtoe unlocking conors handcuffs not that we can see whats going on between prisoners inside flora not clearly you understand so that was it nobody knew anything because nobody could see anything billtoe called to pike the gang boss here switch them up time for malarkey to earn his few shillings he handed conor a tool belt in case you are conscious for long enough to find a few stones pike pulled the cork bung from the bells air tube and hollered the order down moments later two drenched convicts popped from the choppy water to be briskly elbowed aside and frisked for concealed diamonds it was a thorough searching that would have uncovered anything larger than a single blood drop conor climbed down the ladder eyeing the cave for malarkey the battering ram was easily spotted reclining on a clump of rocks that bluntly resembled a throne he threw a mock punch conors way no doubt expecting todays performance to be a repeat of yesterdays not this time sheep thought conor this is the final show the curtain comes down this morning conor set both feet on the rock and headed directly for the shoreline he did not wait for instruction from pike conversation was the last thing he wanted now words would simply be a distraction before diving into the salty water he patted the belt at his waist to make sure the devils fork was in its holder without this simple tool he would have little chance of overcoming malarkey the water closed around him and conors fingers sought out handholds on the diving bell pulling himself along its curve until he found the rim once inside the bells terrible confined space nearly quashed his will and conor was forced to draw several deep breaths before he could even force himself to stand follow your instinct he told himself allow it to consume you from the air hole he heard a splash followed by whoops and cheers malarkey was on the way the battering rams spurred on their champion though none were expecting much of a contest displaced water waves shook the bell sending up a rich hum within its curves i must act quickly be ready conor glanced upwards malarkey had paused at the porthole to further torture his victim he knocked the glass grinning broadly though his yellow teeth were lost in the portholes scum sheen the instant malarkeys face disappeared from view conor set to work he quickly extended the mining tripod to its full length tightening the rings so that the tool would not easily collapse the tripod was roughly the same as a youths practice foil but terribly balanced with the weight entirely towards the tip still a makeshift foil was infinitely better than nothing conor filled his left hand with the wet diamond pouch from his belt and scrunched it into a soggy sphere he was as prepared now as he could be and yet this entire sequence of events had a tinge of unreality about it unbelievable things were happening at a terrific rate like many boys his age conor had often imagined going into combat this was nothing like his daydreams in conors fantasies heroic soldiers faced off against each other on windswept battlefields to the sounds of drums and bugles there was nothing heroic about this reality a cramped space the stink of oil sweat and fear and the sickness in the pit of his gullet at the thought of having to kill another human however vile the man might be it was as his father had always said war was never noble a pale waterwavering slab of arm crept under the bell rim the temptation was strong to stab it with the trident but that would be foolish he would sacrifice the element of surprise for a gain of only a tiny wound malarkey would retreat gather himself then return with grim determination conor held back bending his knees getting ready to spring malarkey lurched under the rim appearing in spurts face up his long strands of fine hair fanning about his head like seaweed he was smiling still streams of air bubbles leaking between his teeth once his feet had cleared the rim malarkey flipped carelessly on to all fours and breached the water like a walrus conors breath came fast strike now or the moment was past and he had his two shillings worth coming malarkey began to rise and while he was still bent almost double conor used the knobs of the big mans spine as a step ladder and climbed on to his shoulders it was a precarious position and could last barely a moment a moment was ample to stuff his wadded diamond pouch squarely into the air duct stoppering it malarkey shrugged him off still smiling he was bemused in fact what yer trying to accomplish soldier boy flight even an eagle would be bested by a ram in here i blocked the air said conor coldly we have two minutes to escape this last fact was a barefaced lie but not one that would be weighing on conors conscience there was air enough in here for half an hour at least but with any luck malarkey would not know that for once luck ran conors way and the jaunty expression slid from malarkeys face like greased steak from a pan as he noticed the pipes blockage you blasted numbskull he shouted the bell vibrating sympathetically with his words do yer want to kill us both conor held the makeshift foil behind his back no not both of us malarkeys expression changed to the peeve of a kindly schoolmaster who has finally been exasperated beyond the limits of his patience i did you quick yesterday soldier boy a single punch and thats a talent today im going to be taking my sweet time and not minding so much about bruises or bones thats right sheep said conor keep talking waste the air malarkey reached out grabbing conor by the throat now you pop yourself back up on my shoulders and pull out that plug and i might strike you once but charge for two it was obvious from his tone that malarkey thought this a great kindness conor pulled out the trident so quickly it whistled the plug is staying in he said thrusting the tiny fork heads into malarkeys leg the battering ram dropped conor yelping like a kicked mutt he reared back striking his head a sound bong against the bell the impact crossed his eyes and set his ears ringing conor used the moment to settle his stance knees bent makeshift foil extended and left arm cocked behind him attack now his good sense urged no time for sportsmanship but this was not sportsmanship conor wanted malarkey to realize what was happening to him the hired thug must never be able to convince himself that conor had triumphed through luck and so he waited until malarkeys vision cleared then spoke two words only en garde malarkey growled you think those words scare me you think i havent heard them from a score of prissy officer types what are now no more than bones in their uniforms malarkey spread his arms wide advancing through the water en garde it is then soldier boy conor could almost hear victors voice wait for the move wait for him to commit the wait was not a long one malarkey swung in with the same haymaker that he had landed the day before conor found that it was not so lightning fast when you were waiting for it conor used a simple attaque au fer which sets up an offensive by deflecting the opponents blade though in truth he was deflecting himself more so than malarkeys arm which he was addressing as a militarytype broadsword now facing malarkeys flank he slashed down three times the fork blurred with speed like a golden fan three red stripes appeared on the band of flesh between malarkeys shirt and trousers band these strikes were for pain malarkey yelped once more then howled lustily as the pain settled to a steady burn conor threw his shoulder into the mans buttocks not the most pleasant place to be even for a second but it did have the effect of clanging malarkey into the bell curve his forehead collided with the brass setting the bell ringing once more now to the rear conor thrust deeply through the water and above malarkeys heel feeling the tines puncture the tough flesh that strike was for immobility malarkey collapsed like a wall under cannon shot filling the bell with spray the battering ram continued to howl demented with pain and anger conor felt his resolve falter kill you sobbed malarkey i will skin the flesh from your frame conors resolve was firm once more he laid several flat strikes around malarkeys back and shoulders forcing him deeper into the sea with his free hand he shoved straightfingered jabs into the mans kidneys causing him to reflexively inhale half a gallon of water a trick adapted from karate malarkey was effectively helpless wallowing in the shallow water blinded by pain and salt an infant with a mean disposition could kill him conor leaned back against the bell curve panting his hatred for malarkey had disappeared as quickly as it had flared up and yet this issue of a bounty must be solved today was linus wynter right must he kill this man malarkey rolled on to his back and lay there sobbing his face inches above the surface wavelets from his own thrashings slopping water down his gullet conor placed a soldiers boot on the mans neck contemptuously knocking aside malarkeys weak grabs you see now what i can do he hissed surprised at the venom in his own voice malarkey could not answer even if there had not been a boot at his throat he was beyond words stop talking kill him conor jammed the trident deep into the folds of flesh beneath malarkeys chin one more push and the tines would pierce the skin and sever an artery this is no lucky accident i can kill you easy as a sunday chicken malarkeys eyes suddenly focused the thought of visiting the afterlife helps to concentrate the mind do you understand that mister battering ram i could kill you do it stop your jabbering conor tightened his grip on the fork the muscles along his arm tensed three drops of blood pooled round the trident heads one last push and his tormentor would torment him no more please said malarkey the word gurgling in his throat a bead of sweat trickled into conors eye water lapped at the bell curve humming gently please spare me said the mighty battering ram i cant do it i have no wish to kill this man conor realized that he was not a killer and this filled him with warm relief because it showed that he had not lost himself entirely in spite of all he had endured he hadnt been raised to gain the upper hand through murder not if there were other avenues there must be another way a more intelligent way conor chewed on his problem without relieving the forks pressure on malarkeys neck the battering ram must be made an ally this struggle could not go on day after day he quickly cobbled together a possible way out for both of them listen to me sheep said conor twisting the trident i am going to float out of this bell just like yesterday otto malarkeys brow creased but i quiet shouted conor with an authority he hadnt known he possessed listen to me now we are hatching a plan you and i we will come down here every day and you will supposedly give me my two shillings worth that way you can still be king of the sheep the big ram in reality we will have ourselves a quiet talk and you can help me to survive in here concentration was not easy for malarkey in his distressed state but he did think of something what about my foot i cant walk a problem true water dripped from the bell curve spattering them both with indoor rain conor wracked his brain for a solution after i leave wait an hour perhaps two then make a great commotion on climbing out of the bell thrash around underwater and say the bell trapped you blame your ankle injury on flora it is a painful wound but not serious i missed the achilles tendon luckily for you strap it tight and stay off it for a few hours you will be solid as an oak tomorrow malarkey was growing brave again conor could see it in the squint of his eye he had his breath now and fancied his chances any moment he would make a lunge for his young tormentor then conor would be forced to kill him this newfound courage must be nipped in the bud conor lashed him once on each forearm temporarily deadening the nerves is it more stripes you want are you too muttonheaded for life accept my proposition sheep and you can live with your honour intact if not you can suffer defeat at the hands of a boy it seemed as though the prospect of defeat was worse than that of death malarkey gritted his teeth nodding unable to meet conors eye i have your word victor had once told him that the city gang members had developed a curious sense of honour almost echoing that of the samurai bushido code yes blast you my word on it conor grinned coldly a mechanism he would come to rely on in desperate situations i will trust you on it no need for a handshake it was a cruel joke malarkeys arms were dead at his side like two slabs of butchered beef very well then sheep we have an agreement be warned if you try trickery tomorrow i will not be so merciful or silent conor twisted the rings on his trident collapsing it no need to get up ill see myself out conor was surprised at his own comment a second malicious joke in as many minutes it was not like him to sneer at someone whatever the circumstances but perhaps little saltee was moulding him into a different person the kind that might possibly survive conor filled his lungs to slide under the rim before salt water clouded his vision he saw a final frustration dropped upon malarkey the wadded diamond pouch fell from the air hole plopping directly on to the mans face malarkey cursed long and filthily but his words were muffled by the sopping bag a bag that he was unable to reach up and brush away chapter conor finn billtoe and pike carried conor back to his cell on a plank and they were careless in their work conor endured several bumps and jolts which almost made up for malarkeys neglected two shillings worth thinking him unconscious they chattered on about the state of the islands bonvilain will strip this place of anything within a million years of becoming a diamond said pike id feel a tot of pity for the salts if they werent lower than barnacles barnacles agreed billtoe but at least barnacles dont give you lip and you dont put yourself in for a visit to the wardens office if you happen to stamp on a barnacle they twostepped the plank round an awkward corner scraping conors elbow along the wall id say you could stamp on all the prisoners you like now that good king nick is knocking at the pearlies bonvilain never minded before true for you pikey billtoe laughed following it with a regurgitating hurk good times are here that is until isabella comes of age possibly shes one for the people like her father i hear worrying good things about her ah yes princess isabella said pike i wouldnt be concerning yourself on that score she wont wear the crown till her seventeenth birthday and thats two years away i would bet my sunday boots that something tragic will happen to our little princess after that if she starts queering things for the marshall it took all conors resolve not to grab billtoes weapon and make a bid for freedom right then but conor finn dying on a cold prison floor would do little to help isabella he needed to bide his time and wait for an opportunity the guards reached conors cell and simply raised one end of the plank sliding him through the doorway he tumbled to the wall and lay there limbs splayed and moaning the moans were real pike and billtoe stood framed by the doorway you know something pikey said billtoe scratching an itch on his collarbone maybe im getting old and soft but ive taken a liking to young conor finn pike was more than surprised liking prisoners was not billtoes form really no said billtoe shutting the cell door not really conor lay still until the guards footsteps faded first to echoes then silence another minute for safety then he crawled upon his bunk hiding his face with a forearm though he was alone in the cell the shaking began suddenly racking his entire body from toe to crown as though he had grasped a wire of the electric like a labourer he had seen working in coronation square all those years ago on another island in another life there was simply too much to think about father mother king nicholas isabella his own plight in this prison bonvilain the battering rams billtoe and pike images of these friends and foes passed through his mind branding him with more pain than a little saltee kiss mother and father taking him to hook head to fly his paper kite king nicholass stories of the american civil war and why he fought in it bonvilains face features set in a permanent sneer otto malarkey fear of death in his dark eyes too much too much conor gritted his teeth and imagined himself flying until the shaking stopped pike booted linus wynter back into the cell some hours later just as conor was finishing his first meal of the day i put yours on the flat stone by the window he said to the gangly american its the warmest spot in here you sit ill get it wynter tutted heading straight for the flat stone no need i know where the griddle is i have been here almost a year young conor he bent down and tinkled the air with two fingers until he found the bowl but thank you that was very thoughtful wynter perched on his bed selecting a lump of gristle dripping with grease oh lord its hardly the savoy is it i spent a night there in eightynine fabulous full electric lighting a bath in every suite and the water closets i dream of the water closets weve had electric lighting since eightyseven on great saltee said conor king nicholas says that we have to embrace change conors face fell king nicholas said that wynter did not comment chewing the fatty lump in his mouth thoroughly lest it choke him on the way down so young finn are we going to swap watercloset stories all evening or are you going to tell me of your adventures in the bell i let malarkey live said conor but i thrashed him soundly and he knows i can do it again next time i wont keep quiet about it and well see how long he survives as head ram after that wynter froze a dripping gobbet of meat halfway to his mouth hells bells boy if i could look at you admiringly i would nick was right about you nick king nicholas you knew the king we met in missouri he was in the balloon corps actually he was the balloon corps he towed two raggedy hotair rigs around to various battle sites our paths crossed at petersburg in sixtyfive i wasnt much use to anyone back then having had my eyes poked out by the teenage jesse james and nick was just about tolerated by the generals so we struck up a friendship he taught me how to tie knots and fill ballast bags even took me up a few times i had no idea that he was royalty of course neither did he conor had always been a fast thinker it cant be coincidence that youre here wynter cocked his head to one side listening carefully no conor its no coincidence nick sent me here to spy for him youre a spy you shouldnt tell me this i could be anyone another spy sent in to find you out you could be but youre not i have heard of you before from victor vigny he visited me here days ago and took my news to the king the pretext was that i had stolen from him such cloak and dagger wynter reached out long fingers until he found conors shoulder king nicholas thought of you as a son victor said you were his greatest hope for the future youre no spy conor felt a twinge of sadness he had thought of the king almost as a second father an awful truth struck him but now mister wynter you are truly imprisoned here with the rest of us wynter sighed it would seem so i can hardly tell mister billtoe that i am actually a professional spy posing as a vagrant musician i suppose not conor agreed who were you spying on again linus wynter listened before replying marshall bonvilain nicholas had come to suspect bonvilain of treason in many areas but especially on little saltee bonvilain was running it like his own personal slave camp prison reforms were implemented only when nicholas or his envoys came to visit the king needed a man on the inside and who better to spy on a musicloving warden than a blind musician nobody would suspect a man who cannot spy anything of being a spy i see said conor wynter grinned do you really whats it like conor smiled his first in days the smile was a twinkle in the gloom and did not last long i dont think i can make it through this mister wynter i am not strong enough nonsense snapped wynter you showed courage today and ingenuity anyone who can thrash that brute malarkey can certainly find the strength to survive little saltee conor nodded there were people in worse straits than him at least he had youth and strength on his side tell me mister wynter how do you go about your business what business is that said wynter innocently the business of being a spy of course wynter pulled a convincing horrified face spying me but you foolish boy i am blind which is the same as brainless and only slightly better than dead why you could plant me at the piano in the wardens office and he would go about his business exactly as though i wasnt even there but now there is no one to report to precisely a while back nicholas requested my temporary release to play in his orchestra i gave him my first report then there was another due tomorrow i would surmise that i shant be delivering that report or any more conor felt a sudden kinship for this tall american we are together then until one of us is released and when i say released i mean it in the little saltee sense occasionally an inmate disappears and the guards tell us he has been released dead then i would guess murder is the most expeditious way to prevent overcrowding i pray that we fortunate two are never released conor was surprised fortunate a curious choice of words wynter wagged a reedlike knuckleknobbed finger not at all we are two likeminded civilized men just think who we might have drawn as cellmates conors memory flashed on malarkeys features shaped by the violence of his life you are right mister wynter we are indeed fortunate wynter raised an imaginary glass of champagne your health he said your health rejoined conor and then clink the cell itself was a study in the spartan not much more than a hole in the island there was one window high in the wall of letterbox size the light admitted by this portal was weak and watery without the strength to cut through more than a few feet of shadow the walls themselves were expertly hewn with barely a need for mortar which was just as well as the surface mortar had long since crumbled allowing various fungi to spread themselves across the joins conor estimated the dimensions to be twelve feet by fourteen hardly enough for two tall men to spend their confinement in comfort then again comfort was hardly the issue as he lay on his hard cot that evening conor dreamed of his family eventually his thoughts grew so painful that a small pathetic cry crept through his lips linus wynter did not comment he merely shifted in his bed to show that he had heard and was awake for conversation if needed you said that you would instruct me whispered conor tell me how to survive in this place wynter turned on his back clasped his hands on his chest and sighed what you must do what we both must do now is so terribly difficult that it is close to impossible only the most determined can achieve it conor felt that he could indeed do the close to impossible if it meant that he would survive little saltee what mister wynter tell me i need some relief very well conor there are two parts to this scheme the first has the sound of an easy task but believe me it is not you must forget your old life it is dead and gone dreaming of family and friends will plunge you into a dark hell of despair so build a wall round your memories and become a new person i dont know if i can began conor you are conor finn now hissed wynter you must believe it you are conor finn seventeenyearold army corporal smuggler and swordsman conor finn will survive little saltee conor broekharts body may survive but his spirit will be crushed as surely as though bonvilain clamped it in a vice conor finn said conor haltingly i am conor finn you are a killer you are young and slim true but ruthless with your blade arm as strong as a steel band you prefer your own company and will brook no insult not so much as a dirty look you have killed before your first when you were fifteen a grog head who dipped your pocket this is all the truth its true murmured conor all true you have no family continued wynter no one to love or to love you no one said conor but the words were hard to utter no one loves me wynter paused tilting his head hearing conors distress this is the way it must be in here love will rot your brain i know this to be true i had a wife once lovely aishwarya dreams of her fuelled my days during my five years in a bengal prison this was enough to sustain me for a while but then my love turned to suspicion and finally to hate when i heard that she had died of typhoid the guilt nearly killed me i would have died if they hadnt kicked me out wynter was quiet for as long as it took him to relive those horrible times love must die in here conor it is the only way once you open your heart love must die said conor storing images of his parents in a padlocked chest at the back of his mind but something must take its place said wynter in a stronger voice an obsession to fire your enthusiasm a reason to live if you like i myself have music i keep an opera on the broiler inside my head and in other places amadeus himself would weep my music is never far from my thoughts it is my fondest wish to have it performed in salzburg one day young conor one day my opera keeps me alive you see wynter slipped two fingers under his eye bandage massaging his ruined sockets i see music like you see colours each instrument is a stroke of the brush the gold of the strings the deep blue of the bassoon even as i trot out pompous marches for the warden on his rickety piano that sound board is not even spruce i am dreaming of my opera wynters lips murmured across the phrases of his beloved music and what about you conor he asked after several bars do you have a dream something that fills your mind with hope but never pain the answer came quickly to conor i want to fly yes he said i have a dream the night arrived though it made little difference to the light in conors cell there was a slight thickening of the dirty darkness but that was all they were trapped in a limbo of gloom with only food and work to instruct them as to the time of day conor lay on his cot wrestling with thoughts of his family which he was not supposed to be thinking shrugging off ones old self was not as simple as discarding a dirty shirt memories popped up unbidden clamouring to be examined mister wynter was right this was the most difficult thing he had ever had to do conor could feel the sweat coating his face like a wet flannel and the voice of his mother seemed as real to him as the cell walls how could you do it my son how could you betray us all conor bit his knuckle until the voice faded he needed distraction and proof that this newlife strategy was effective mister wynter he whispered are you asleep cloth rustled on the other cot then linus answered no conor finn i am awake sometimes i think that i never truly sleep one eye on the real world so to speak the legacy of a lifetimes spying are you having trouble burying conor broekhart conor laughed bitterly trouble it is impossible mister wynter no not impossible but devilish hard it took me months to forget my real self to become this rakish devilmaycare playboy even talking to you about this is opening a chink in the door to my previous self sorry said conor tell me of your dream then the opera wynter sat up really you would like to hear my music yes perhaps your music will give me enthusiasm for my own project wynter was suddenly stuttering vvery well conor but you are the first person ever that is we are hardly in the correct environment the acoustics in here are of the worst kind even the human voice will be mangled by these close quarters conor smiled in the dark i am a kind audience mister wynter my only request is that your music be to a higher standard than your spying ahh said wynter beating his breast with a fist a critic of all the cellmates i could have chosen but the joke had calmed him and he began his performance in confident tones our story is entitled the soldiers return imagine if you will the great state of new york the civil war has ended and the men of the one hundred and thirtyseventh infantry have returned to their homes in binghamton it is a time of mixed emotions great joy and deep sorrow for these men and their families nothing can ever be the same again and following this sparsest of introductions linus wynter launched into his overture it was a grand number but not pretentious switching between moods from delirious joy and relief to unfathomable sorrow it could have been comical a blind man playing all the parts of an orchestra for a frightened boy but somehow it was not conor felt himself lost in the music and the story sprang up around him as he listened it was a sad yet triumphant tale with fine arias and soaring marches and conor clung to it for a while but by and by the story faded leaving the music alone but music must have pictures to go with it and in conors mind the pictures were of a flying machine heavier than air yet soaring among the clouds with conor himself guiding the rudder it could be done and he would be the one to do it i will do it he thought i will fly and conor finn will survive little saltee the third day billtoe arrived after the cannon looking as though he had been dragged to work through the sewers this conor was beginning to realize was his standard appearance wynter sniffed the air on hearing the hinges ah guard billtoe right on time billtoe flicked a chicken bone he had been sucking at the blind prisoner here wynter boil yourself some soup and you conor finn look lively the pipe waits maybe today well get some work out of you if youre not too occupied with the unconscious floating conor sat in his bed feeling the itch of salt and dirt on his back on my way mister billtoe he trudged to the door searching his heart for a spark of enthusiasm for anything linus wynter provided it with a farewell and a tilt of the head that served as a wink until this evening then conor finn conor could not help but smile being part of a secret is a great source of strength until this evening when the soldier returns wynters face broke into a broad smile wrinkles stretching the scars that ringed each eye like rays from the sun i await the soldiers return then billtoe scowled uncomfortable with anything more than abject depression from the convicts quit with the conversation and out the door with you finn conor finn left the dank cell leaving conor broekhart further behind with every step malarkey was already in the bell when conor swam under the huge convict was squeezing water from his long hair like a washerwoman wringing towels salt makes the hair brittle he explained glancing at conor under the crook of a raised elbow if a man favours the long styles he has to get as much out as he can sometimes i think its wasted work as no one on this blinking rock gives my hair a second glance conor was not sure how to react to this genial gent who had replaced yesterdays hired brute ah my mother recommends oil for brittle hair malarkey sighed yes oil where to get it though theres the puzzle i have wrestled with for a decade the man was serious conor realized this was important to him billtoe seems to have a ready supply the mans head is as greased as a wrestling pole billtoe spat malarkey that snake i wouldnt please him with a plea conor had a thought well then i have noticed that our daily stew is loaded with some form of cooking oil a small pool collects in the bowl i dare say it would do you more good on your head than in your stomach malarkey was thunderstruck god almighty you are correct soldier boy there it was every day three times a day staring me in the mush and me looking for oil thats good advice and free conor added though you may smell like stew what matter said malarkey my hair will shine bright enough for a piccadilly stroll conor shook the water from his own hair he must he thought with the shaking and the caked dirt bear more than a passing resemblance to a vagabond mutt it was time to look to his appearance perhaps otto malarkey was the man to quiz on hygiene malarkey finished with his hair and threw his head back now he said in a more serious tone we have unfinished business conor tensed was it time for another row some students needed more than one pass at a lesson before the information took hold he placed a hand on the butt of the devils fork in his belt what business is that more paid beatings no soldier boy no said malarkey hurriedly your solution to that affair is a sound one we fake the entire thing for a fortnight you keep mum and that is that saves my knuckles and your head best all round a pity i didnt think of it before now i could have saved myself the pain of arthritis between the aching joints and brittle hair this place will be the death of me conor relaxed somewhat but left his hand on the fork i knew a cook on great saltee who suffered from arthritis she always swore that willow bark is good for joint pain if you can get it malarkey nodded willow bark grind it into your stew or simply suck on a piece though it is hard on the stomach no worries on that score i could digest a live bear with barely a twinge conor frowned so then what is this business i talked to pike said malarkey hiking a thumb at the bell porthole we decided that it would be best to do a little work before i knock you senseless so i thought we might dig around a bit find a few stones then take our ease for a while following that i drag you on out of here and no one is any the wiser how does that sound for a plan conor was about to agree but then thought on his new identity conor finn was a young devil and would not be satisfied without profit its a passable plan most of the elements are there but what of the three pounds you were paid to beat me malarkey was ready for this line one for you two for me i prefer the other way around i have a proposition said malarkey we go straight down the middle if you teach me how to use that fork the way you do proper fencing is a powerful tool i could earn some real money nail me a few officers it was clear in malarkeys face that he was eager for this arrangement and can you keep the battering rams from slipping a blade between my ribs asked conor otto malarkey shrugged back his long hair theres only one way to guarantee that he rolled up his sleeve revealing the hornedram tattoo you must take the ink only members of the brotherhood are safe ill stand for you if you teach me fencing i could say you took the beatings and have irish blood in you though your accent is wellbred saltee a kilmore mum maybe i think that youre below army age but that dont matter to the battering rams if youre big enough to hold a pistol youre big enough to fire one joining the rams was a sticking point conor broekhart would never take up with a criminal gang but then again conor finn would ill take your ink but i wont pay any dues nor swear an oath malarkey laughed oath the only oaths we have in the rams are foul ones as for dues the fencing lessons will do enough conor rubbed his bicep where the tattoo would sit very well otto malarkey we have an agreement i expect the money tomorrow not tomorrow said malarkey from now on you will be searched every day wait until you carry the ram on your arm then certain guards have hazy allegiances their search will be less thorough for the right price of course already malarkey was proving useful it could well be that the mans idle chatter would be a fair trade for a few fencing lessons very well malarkey after the tattoo is dry until then we fence and dig first fencing while the mind is sharp conor extended his trident flicking his left arm up behind him malarkey mimicked the stance so conor finn youll teach me everything you know not everything said conor smiling tightly if i did that then you could kill me billtoe waited until conor supposedly regained consciousness before leading him back to his cell through the subterranean hallways of little saltee for the first time since his arrival conor took careful account of his surroundings counting each step noting each door and window this section of the prison had a bowed look as if the entire wing had dropped a floor since its construction walls leaned in overhead and the floor sank like a drain stone arches had lost their soffits or keystones and stood crookedly like the efforts of a childs building blocks the walls were dotted with pitch patches where water had wormed its way through the cracks dozens more rivulets had yet to be filled a gurgling saltwater stream ran down the centre of the collapsed floor pretty aint it said billtoe taking note of conors roving eye this place could flood at any second they say of course they have been saying that since long before i put on the uniform if i was you id try to escape this hellhole thats always good for a giggle you should see what desperate men are willing to try jumping off the wall is a favourite the crabs never go hungry on little saltee tunnelling is another one tunnelling i ask you where does these turf heads think they are the middle of a meadow we got barely a spoonful of clay on this island and yet we have these gaolcrazed prisoners spending every waking minute sniffing out a vein i tell you straight little soldier if you do find some earth on little saltee then you should plant yourself some vegetables conor knew not to interrupt after all in a previous existence he had learned that information saved lives and there was a wealth of information to be gathered about this place luckily guard billtoe seemed eager to dish it just as fast as he could get it out of his flapping mouth he pushed conor down a corridor a full step lower than the rest the floor ran off at a gentle gradient water actually flowing under some of the doors home again fiddle dee dee sang billtoe the lunatic wing we got all sorts here deaf dumb blind one legged one armed fellas what have got a bump on the noggin every class of lunatic you care to mention we got one fellow who doesnt do words just numbers all blooming day numbers tens and hundreds thousands even like a blooming banker he is dont even know his name so we call him numbers clever eh conor stored that nugget a numbers man could be useful if his counting meant something there were calculations in any plan they arrived at conors cell door conor noticed the steel hinges and heavy locks billtoe turned a key in the lock big door aint it these doors are about the only thing we keep repaired around here he winked at conor couldnt have you simpletons running around during the night spooking each other with your crying for mummy and counting and such i like it better when you stay in your cell and howl billtoe wiped an imaginary tear from his cheek it sounds like a choir of angels helps me sleep during my time on the island the man was an animal base and foul in a just world he would be the prisoner and conor a free man the door swung open helped along by the slant of the wall in you go salt enjoy being on your lonesome conor was halfway down the ramped floor before the words registered he turned but the door was already closing on my lonesome where is mister wynter billtoe spoke through a shrinking slice of light between door and frame wynter that cheeky blind beggar why hes been released solitary for you from here on out the marshalls orders conor felt his weight pulling him to the floor and was on his knees before he could stop himself murder is the most expeditious way to prevent overcrowding linus had said i pray that we fortunate two are never released youve killed him breathed conor but he was talking to a closed door chapter light at the end this latest disaster had conor huddled at the back of the cell sobbing like a baby he was alone now friendship could have brightened time spent even here but now there was no one he crawled as far back as he could into the room and was dully surprised to find the room extended deeper into the rock than he had believed behind wynters cot was a deep alcove with roughly the dimensions of four stacked coffins this he could tell by touch alone as not a glimmer of light extended to the black hole he lay there for hours feeling his determination sliding away like weed sluiced from a slipway the new identity he had created for himself dissolved bringing poor desperate conor broekhart to the surface so he stayed wrapped in nothing but selfpity wallowing in dreams of family all night long useless futile dreams conor could well have perished in the next few days dead from a broken heart if not for one little ray of light in the early hours conor woke to see a red line flickering on the opposite wall for a long sleepy moment this line puzzled him resembling nothing more than a ghostly number one wavering gently was this a message of some kind could his cell be haunted then he awakened fully and realized that the line was of course a shaft of sunlight but from where for distractions sake conor decided to investigate it took no more than a moment for him to find that a narrow fissure along the seam between two blocks of the alcove extended to the outside world and was allowing weakened light to filter through conor tapped the left block with a fingernail and was surprised to find that it budged scraping against its neighbours he prodded more forcefully and the block wobbled on its base dislodging caked muck the block itself cracked for it was not a true block merely a husk of dried mud conor wiggled one finger along the side of the false block and popped it from its hole a wedge of sunlight blasted him in the eyes blinding him for several seconds not that it was light of any great brightness but it was the first direct light conor had seen in many hours conor closed his eyes but did not turn away the heat on his face was wonderful like a gift straight from the hand of god he thumped at adjoining blocks checking for more counterfeits but there were none the rest of the wall was solid as a mountain one hole only the size of his two fists he squatted there for a while feeling the light warm his skin watching it trace the veins in his eyelids until at last he felt prepared enough to open his eyes he was not disappointed with what he saw because he had not allowed himself to feel any hope this hole was a devilish small one and deep too encased by four feet of solid rock with barely a napkins worth of sky at its end only a rat could escape through this tunnel perhaps a largish one would struggle and even if by some miracle he managed to mimic doctor redmond the famous escape artist and wiggle through this narrow pipe where would he go the ocean would swallow him up quicker than a whale swallowing a minnow if he managed to steal a boat the sharpshooters on the walls would pick him off for sport no one had ever escaped from little saltee not one single person in hundreds of years so accept this light as a small secret gift and nothing more conor told himself allow it to heat your face and wipe your mind clean of pain if even for a moment conor sagged back against the compartment wall relishing the meagre warmth who had made this fake block he wondered and what had caused the hole there were any number of answers to both questions and no way of confirming one of them the prison walls possibly sagged an inch concentrating vectors of force at this point pulverizing the block or perhaps successive generations of inmates scraped away with primitive tools saltwater erosion or rainwater though that was unlikely in less than a millennium a combination of all these factors most likely and a dozen more besides conor studied the clay block which had hidden this treasure of light it was chipped but intact it would certainly serve to hide the hole for his tenancy but he would not hide the opening just yet billtoe would not arrive for a short time until then he would enjoy the dawn like scores of convicts before him the devil take his troubles water a mug of water would be nice conor closed his eyes again but images of his parents tormented him so he opened them again and for a long moment thought he was dreaming or insane what was happening should not could not be happening the wall of this hidden alcove was aglow and not just with sunlight with a strange ghostly green glow not the entire wall just lines and dots familiar characters conor realized that he was staring at music the walls and roof of this tiny alcove were covered in music mister wynter had said i keep an opera on the broiler inside my head and in other places the other place was back here in a secret alcove he would have shared that fact had they not killed him conor ran his fingers along a series of notes up and down they went like a mountain range what was this glow how was it possible victors ghost tormented him come on dimwit we studied this basic geology and you call yourself a man for the new century of course it was luminous coral it only grew in certain specific conditions which must have been freakishly mimicked by this damp close environment conor scraped away a thin layer of mud to reveal the rough plates of luminous coral below this part of the cell was living coral fed by the constant drip of salt water it must have grown up through the rock over the centuries and was activated by the sunlight what a marvel he had not expected to find marvels here there were other marks too fainter than the musical notes in older hands and quainter language conor found the diary of zachary cord a confessed poisoner and also a rambling curse scratched by one tom burly damning the seventeenthcentury warden for a hater of justice conor had no trouble accepting that as truth so this was how linus had kept himself sane during his hours of solitude he had recorded his music on the only surface available to him a mudcovered crypt without ever knowing his parchment was luminous it brought tears to conors eyes when he reached the final notes and the word fin engraved with considerable flourish linus wynter had managed to finish his lifes work before being released it was a noble tradition this recording and one that conor suddenly knew he intended to continue he would commit his own ideas to the walls of this tiny alcove in fact the mere notion set his heart beating faster to have a canvas on which to diagram his designs was more than he had hoped for he scrabbled around linus wynters bunk until he found what he had known must be there his most recent stylus it was hidden under a leg of his cot the chicken bone billtoe had tossed earlier one end ground to a point perfect conor scrambled into the alcove lying flat on his back he would begin on the ceiling and he would sketch only until the cannon fired with confident strokes conor finn etched his first model into the damp mud allowing the luminous green coral to shine through a moment later it was something he had been working on with victor a glider with a rudder and adjustable wings for lateral balance on the wall the diagram was static but it conors mind it soared like a bird a free bird chapter unlucky fourteenth two years later arthur billtoe took one last chew on a wad of tobacco then spat a mouthful of juice towards the hole in the floor the stringy wad missed its target landing square on the toe of his own boot sorry said the guard then realizing he apologized only to himself cast an eye around in the hope that no one had overheard or they might think him simple and lock him away with the scatterfools no one had overheard except pike and that hardly mattered as pike was only half a step removed from idiocy himself in any case billtoe decided to cover up his blurted apology sorry he repeated but louder this time its sorry i am for the poor lunatic salts inside flora this night the prison guards stood in the subterranean pantry overlooking the dive hole below them flora was submerged ten fathoms in dark saltee waters the seas outside were rough and the tunnel to open water had become something of a blowhole rattling the diving bell with each bellow of bubbles from its spout with every impact a flurry of peals rose through the chamber sorry indeed continued billtoe theyd best move sharpish or flora will remove a limb or two pike did not believe for a second that billtoe was actually concerned for a prisoner any more than he would be concerned for a blade of grass but it didnt do to contradict arthur billtoe if you were further down the prison ladder than he was or he would set you working christmas eve on the mad wing dont you waste your legendary compassion arthur said pike rubbing his hairless head billtoe glanced sharply at his comrade was that wit no surely not from a man who thought that electricity was a gift from the fairies no worry not its finn and malarkey on the night shift billtoe nodded finn and malarkey those two were the best pair of miners ever to work the bell young finn was the brains of the pair no doubt but whatever he pointed to malarkey would dig up with the strength of a giant and to think two years ago when conor finn arrived on little saltee hed been little more than a scrap of a boy destined for a stitchedup canvas bag and a burial at sea now he was a force in the battering rams and one of the main sources of income for billtoe himself billtoe cleared his throat ill be searching finn and malarkey myself pike pike winked slyly as is your habit arthur billtoe ignored the insolence it wouldnt do to get into an argument about private diamond stashes but he silently resolved to mark pike down for supervision of the sewage works it was bad enough that pikes comments were bordering on insolent but billtoe had also heard whispers that pike was selling information to the kilmore arm of the battering rams without cutting in his old friend arthur billtoe billtoe leaned over the edge peering down into the lamplit abyss the bell glowed and shimmered in the dark waters humming with every stroke of the current through the filthy porthole he could see vague movements and shadows finn and malarkey mining he presumed best of luck salts bring back a goose egg for uncle arthur billtoe spat a second wad of chewed tobacco and this time it sailed into the hole landing on the bells rubber air hose hmmm he grunted proudly winking at pike then he strode to the ladder trying to project an air of incorruptibility he wanted to be on the rocks when finn and malarkey surfaced here arthur pike called after him youre walking funny was it that herring billtoe scowled he would have to do something about pike no you hunchbacked hairless son of a circus oddity i am being incorruptible that would have been my second guess said pike who like many dullards had a streak of sharp wit in him conor finn and otto malarkey fought like demons inside the diving bell their makeshift swords sang as they cut the air and sparked along each others shafts both men perspired freely breathing so deeply that the water level rose at their feet they were sucking in air faster than the pump could supply it your balestra is clumsy panted conor more grace otto you are not a hog in a pen malarkey smiled tightly hogs are dangerous animals conor if you are not careful they can run you through and with that he abandoned the rules of fencing dropping his blade and charging his opponent arms spread conor reacted quickly dropping to his stomach and rolling underwater knocking malarkeys legs from under him the big man went down heavily clanging his temple against the bell curve on his way down by the time he recovered his bearings conor had his trident jammed under his chins your hair looks well said conor a healthy shine malarkey preened youre not the only one to notice ive been eating the oily fish as you suggested its costing me a fortune in bribes and i hate the stuff but with results like this i will suffer the taste conor helped malarkey to his feet you need to practise the balestra it is a dancers leap not a drunken stumble but apart from that your progress is good malarkey rubbed his head yours too that was a neat little roll just then the king of the tinkers couldnt have done it sweeter i have never seen a fighter like you conor theres the sword which is mostly spanish but with some french then the proper pugilism that i would class as english but theres the chopping and kicking too which i have a notion is oriental i saw a fellow once in the west end gave a demonstration of that chopping and kicking broke a plank with his foot at the time i thought it was trickery but now i am glad i didnt call him on it an image of victor flashed behind conors eyes he snuffed it out brutally i have picked up a few things in my travels he said malarkey huffed typical conor finn most people in here are desperate for someone to listen to their story telling it to the walls they are not conor finn two years youve been instructing me and i have learned no more than a dozen useless facts about you in that time the most obvious being that your beard is multicoloured conor bent at the knees examining his burgeoning beard in the water as far as he could tell there were strands of blond red and even a few greys in the sparse growth surely grey was unusual in the beard of a sixteenyearold boy no matter it gave him the appearance of someone perhaps five years older he had changed utterly in the past two years gone was the gangly skinny youth who sobbed his way through his first night of imprisonment and in his place was a tall muscled flinty young man who commanded respect from inmates and guards alike people may not like him or seek his company but neither would they toss insults his way or interfere with his business you should shave that beard commented malarkey all your lovely hair then that ratty beard people only notice the beard you know conor straightened his blond hair was pulled back with a thong so that it did not interfere with his work it had darkened a few shades since he last walked in the sunlight i am not as concerned with grooming as you otto i am concerned with business tell me how is our hoard it grows said malarkey seven bags buried we have now all in the salsa beds conor smiled satisfied billtoe had ordered the suaeda salsa beds planted on conors own advice the plants grew like weeds were saline resistant and provided cheap meals for the convicts this meant a few pounds a month for billtoe to steal from the food funds of course prisoners had to be allowed to tend the beds which was when malarkey and his rams buried their stolen diamonds not that they do us much good in the earth continued malarkey unless a diamond bush sprouts and even then billtoe would strip it bare trust me otto said conor i dont intend being here forever somehow i will get our stones and send your share to your brother zeb i promise you that my friend otto clasped his shoulders the rams have certain funds but with riches on that scale my brother could bribe my way out of here i could be a free man i could stroll through hyde park with my magnificent hair i will succeed my friend or die in the attempt if you are not free in a year it is because i am dead malarkey did not waste his breath asking conor for details of his plan conor finn laid out his cards sparingly another subject then badger byrne has not paid his due yet he said hows about i issue a few taps no more violence remember anyway badger has been laid up with shingles i hear let him rest a while otto malarkey pursed his lips in frustration rest conor rest always the same response with you i havent dished out a beating since you took the ink conor rubbed the battering ram tattoo on his upper arm thats hardly true otto you near drove mackenna into open water true admitted malarkey grinning but hes a guard and english too all great strategists know when to use force and when to use reason alexander of macedonia napoleon malarkey laughed outright oh aye little boney was a great one for the reason just ask anyone that was at waterloo the point is that we have seven bags now where we had none before seven bags a tidy fortune it might as well be seven bags of clay scoffed malarkey until your plan succeeds i dont know how youre going to do it even the guards have not managed to smuggle diamonds from little saltee a man would need wings conor glanced sharply at malarkey could he know something no he thought just a turn of phrase yes he said a man would indeed need wings billtoe was waiting for them at the shoreline up to his ankles in water just in case another guard would beat him to the search right you two lemonsucking scurvy dodgers stand away from each other and raise your arms conor fought the urge to strike this pathetic grafter to assault billtoe would surely satisfy him briefly but it would just as surely lead to a beating that would leave him near dead and incapacitated he could not afford to be incapacitated now not when things were going so well with the design not with the coronation so close billtoe began his search making a great show of being thorough youll get nothing past me finn not so much as a bubble of seaweed no sir arthur billtoe knows all your tricks the man was as good as advertising his intentions protesting too much presently he happened across the small stone in the leg of conors much repaired army breeches without a word he flicked the diamond up his own sleeve this was his payment for a lax search any news conor asked while billtoe moved on to malarkey billtoe laughed you salts are devils for news arent you the most mudboring happening is like a golden nugget to you more like a diamond said conor billtoes hands froze on malarkeys shoulders is that insolence soldier boy did i hear insolence conor hung his head no sir mister billtoe i was trying to be humorous friendly like i misjudged the moment i think now i think that too said billtoe frowning but his expression improved when he came across the stone in ottos shirt pocket then again nothing wrong with a bit of humour were all men after all wouldnt want you to think that we guards didnt have hearts in our chests yes mister billtoe i will work on my delivery perhaps you do that said billtoe now let me deliver some news he paused did you see that you said delivery then i repeated it in my sentence now thats delivery pay attention finn you could learn something only in prison thought conor could such a bore be tolerated i shall keep my ears open and my mouth closed mister billtoe good man finn youre learning if slowly a year ago billtoe would have punctuated this lesson with a dig from his rifle butt but he hesitated these days before striking finn it did not do to unnecessarily antagonize the battering rams and conor finn himself was not a young man you wanted snapping on you he cut a fearsome figure except for the beard which could do with some foliage anyway my nugget of news queen victoria of great britain has declared a wish to attend princess isabellas coronation she will not come on the fourteenth because she believes the number to be unlucky having lost a grandson on that date so the coronation has been moved forward two weeks to the first of the month though isabella will be still sixteen we will see your balloons then or should i say my balloon conors practised composure almost slipped away from him to reveal internal turmoil the first he was not ready everything was not in place the first he blurted the first you say mister billtoe billtoe cackled and spat yes the first finn did you not receive your invitation i keep mine with me at all times tucked into my velvet cummerbund billtoes tasteless chuckles died in his throat as he noticed conors expression fearsome was the best word to describe it and while the prisoner made no aggressive move billtoe decided that it was best not to prod him any more he made a silent decision that conor finn would have to spend a few days in his cell alone to learn some humility ram or no ram the guard relieved conor and malarkey of their diamond nets ushering them towards the ladder he thrust his fingers among the dozen or so wet stones in each net the rough diamonds were like glazed eyes slipping and clanking billtoe could tell it was mostly dross the best was in his sleeve traps shut now both of you climb on out and thank god that i didnt decide to shoot you for no good reason you are alive today because of billtoe never forget that malarkey rolled his eyes yes mister billtoe we thank god for it they climbed from the pit and into the pantry the entire room was in constant vibration from tidal shock and scores of water jets spurted and drooped with each pulse of water every day for the past two years it had seemed to conor as though the subterranean mine must surely collapse every day he had longed to work above sea level with the socalled normal inmates but his requests were refused orders from the palace billtoe had told him if bonvilain wants you underground then thats where you stay in all his time on the island conor had only been allowed outside once to supervise the planting of the salsa garden on that day the saltblasted surface of little saltee had seemed like a paradise conor winked a farewell to otto malarkey as pike took the battering ram to his cell billtoe led him away from the main building to the mad wings main door as with all the wings there were no keys to this door just a heavy vertical bolt which was winched from the next floor up billtoe rang the bell then doffed his hat and showed his face to the guard above the right place for you billtoe called the guard though the spy hole then hoisted the bolt every day muttered billtoe flinging the door wide every blooming day the same comment conor waited until they were deep into the mad wings slowly collapsing corridor before speaking his arrangements with billtoe must be kept secret have my sheets arrived this cheered billtoe immediately he had forgotten the sheets ah yes his majestys extra sheets today or tomorrow i am not sure whats your hurry conor strove to look shamefaced i cannot sleep mister billtoe my mind has convinced my body that if i had sheets as though i were a boy in my mothers house then maybe a days rest would be mine billtoe nodded at one of the chimney flues dotting the wall maybe we should stuff you up the chimney the ghosts could sing you a lullaby the flues ran in complicated routes behind the prison walls once a network of hot air now sealed tight by stone and mortar but still salts scrambled up given the chance only to lose themselves in the twists and turns one stone corner looking much like another anyway sheets is against regulations billtoe said holding out his empty hand though he had already been paid conor clasped the hand passing on the rough diamond he had been keeping for himself i know mister billtoe youre a saint with a few hours sleep behind me i will work doubly hard for you billtoe squinted craftily more than double treble conor bowed his head treble then and i need more ideas pressed billtoe like the salsa and the balloons i will set my brain on it with some sleep i feel certain the blood will flow more freely i have a notion for a twelveshot revolver i dont know about that said billtoe frowning its one thing to allow prisoners to dig in a garden or draw a balloon but playacting with firearms conor shrugged think on it mister billtoe theres a lot of coin in arms we could be partners upon my release greed shone in billtoes eyes like yellow fever partners not likely if finns twelveshot revolver worked then it would be arthur billtoes notion bed sheets were a small price to pay partners it is ill get those sheets down to you next shift silk conor reminded him they must be silk i had silk as a child billtoe balked then checked himself a twelveshot revolver his name would go down in history with colt and remington very well finn but i warn you these balloons of yours better work on the day if they do not you will suffer if my balloons dont work i will do more than suffer thought conor i will die during his internment on little saltee conor had managed to barter for a few basic comforts a bucket of mortar sat on a stone and was used to patch the weeping walls a sewing kit to repair his worn uniform was wrapped in leather and hung from a peg he had even managed to secure a straw mattress for his bed linus wynters cot had been converted to a table where he could study the few texts that billtoe had deemed harmless and work on the plans for his approved schemes such as the salsa garden and the coronation balloons in fact the salsa garden had not been conors idea victor had talked of it during one of their horticultural lessons the parisian had even written to king nicholas about introducing the vegetable to the saltees the advantages of such a plot were threefold he explained it would allow the prisoners outdoors for some exercise it would teach them a valuable skill and the salsa itself would add a much needed vegetable to prison meals it was a harmless idea presented by conor to gain billtoes trust there were no disadvantages and no possibility of escape or injury no one had ever died from vegetable assault coronation balloons were conors next suggestion billtoe had seized eagerly on the idea puffed with the success of the salsa garden in billtoes mind the coronation balloons were his ticket to promotion in fact they were conor finns ticket to freedom there were several major obstacles standing between conor and escape to the mainland there were locks of course and the doors around them and the walls in which the doors were embedded and the guards on duty outside these walls but the main difficulty was the island itself even if an inmate could pass through the prison walls like a spectre there were still over two miles of ocean between him and the irish village of kilmore quay this particular stretch of ocean was notoriously unsafe with riptides and currents that lurked beneath the surface like malignant agents of poseidon so many vessels had been lost in this patch of saint georges channel that the british navy painted it red on their charts and even if the seas did not do for an escapee the famous saltee sharpshooters would put a few air holes in the back of his head so swimming for the shore was not a realistic option no the only way to escape little saltee was to fly and that was where conors coronation balloons came in it would be a spectacular addition to the coronation celebrations he had told billtoe one night on their walk to the pipe if the saltee sharpshooters could pick hotair balloons from the night sky what a display of marksmanship billtoe was not convinced shooting balloons he sniffed a childs trick conor was expecting this response but what if the balloons were loaded with chinese fireworks he said and when struck would light up the night sky with a string of spectacular explosions billtoe stopped sniffing spectacular explosions eh this is a brandnew invention conor continued this has never been seen before marshall bonvilain would be extremely impressed impressing the marshall is a good thing mused billtoe billtoes balloons people will call them by next year they will be launching them in london paris the next world fair the guards eyes glazed over lost in dreams of his own fame and fortune then he snapped back it would never be allowed prisoners working with gunpowder impossible i dont need to work with gunpowder said conor soothingly all i need is paper and ink to design the balloons have them made up on great saltee if you like but make sure they are tied to our walls for an impressive shot billtoe nodded slowly all you need is paper and ink and perhaps a day above ground as a reward one day a week thats all i ask now billtoe felt as though the upper hand was his ah so thats it you would have me defy marshall bonvilain himself one day a nighttime stroll even i need to breathe the air mister billtoe these balloons could make you rich you will be famous billtoe tucked a chew of tobacco under his lip taking several moments to mull it over i will give you the paper and ink and i will have a single balloon manufactured on great saltee at my expense if a test is successful then you shall have your day outside after the coronation if not then i will strip your cell of anything resembling a comfort and the next time sunlight falls on your eyes you will be too dead to appreciate it the test had been successful spectacularly so and bonvilain immediately approved the manufacture of several fireworks balloons in a small workshop on great saltee the marshall was always eager to demonstrate the islands sophistication to visiting dignitaries and fireworks balloons would serve both as a delightful show of innovation and a chilling reminder of the sharpshooters prowess the marshall jovially assured guard billtoe that the balloons would indeed bear his name if they exploded successfully on the night not only that but he would receive a commendation and a generous pension for his efforts in truth billtoe had never seen the marshall so happy he even hinted that billtoe could well be sent to various foreign capitals for balloon demonstrations billtoe came away from this audience glowing and well disposed towards conor finn the exploding balloons were clever contraptions and bonvilain did not believe for a second that the idea was billtoes but the test was such a dazzling success that he did not care who his guard had cut the notion from it worked and neither the british nor the french had it each pyrotechnical balloon was a simple sealed hydrogen balloon coated with phosphorous paint inside the balloon there was a pack of fireworks and a short fuse all the marksman had to do was nail the centre of the glowing balloon with a nitroglycerine bullet and the hydrogen would ignite setting off the fuse to the fireworks pack for queen victorias entertainment bonvilains sharpshooters would pop these balloons from a distance of almost a mile it would be a spectacular finale to the coronation celebrations conor had not shared this idea with billtoe out of a patriotic desire to excite the coronation audience if everything proceeded according to his plan then one of the balloons would bear an extra cargo a human cargo but now because of queen victorias superstition the coronation was being moved forward and he was not ready the vital silk sheets were still in a linen closet on great saltee his plans were incomplete to be thwarted now having plotted for months would be a cruel blow conor crawled to the niche behind what he still thought of as wynters bed popping out the false brick crimson sun rays flooded the space sinking into the coral which drank the light in and converted it to green energy he had long ago traded his day job for the night shift to allow him more daylight with his plans in less than a minute the entire cell glowed with a thousand calculations schematics and blueprints a treasure trove of science brought to life by nature the walls bore dozens of sketches of balloons gliders and heavierthanair flying machines these scratched pictures represented two years of obsessive study all previous diaries had been written over except the final four bars of linus wynters opera and the word fin for the first few months dreams of the machines themselves had been enough to fuel conor through the long lonely hours but a man cannot stay in the air forever even in his dreams and so a purpose for his flying machines was needed a place to land conor broekhart would have flown to his parents to isabella but in two years they hadnt once questioned bonvilains version of events if they had surely he would have received a visit or a message isabella could have saved him she could have waved a royal finger and had him pardoned or banished if their young love had meant a thing to her obviously it had not he was deserted and despised young conor felt these things as certainly as he felt the cold rock under his feet and so his heart hardened and selflessness was suborned by selfishness conor finn took over and conor broekhart was displaced and where broekhart had nobility finn had selfinterest he would make himself rich by stealing from the people who had stolen his life the saltee islands would pay for the past two years a diamond per day and once he had money enough he would buy ottos freedom then book passage to america and begin his life anew this was his plan and it kept him alive just as surely as his heartbeat and so how to escape by land sea or air there was no land the sea was treacherous so that left the air he must fly out of here or if not fly then at least fall slowly an idea was born but one that was to take more than a year of planning and manipulation suddenly the coronation was shifted and his schemes shattered like broken mirrors and there were only days to put the pieces together conor lay on the uneven ground salt water darkening his clothes studying his plans he must memorize the designs now and then destroy them these plans would be valuable to any army in the world but especially to bonvilain and the greatest torment that conor could ever endure was the notion that he had somehow aided marshall hugo bonvilain he traced each line with his forefinger every plane every twist of propeller each line and rudder the arrows that denoted airflow even the fanciful clouds that his artistic side had almost unconsciously etched as soon as a glider balloon or aeroplane was committed to memory he smeared mud across the design patting it into every groove by sunset these amazing plans existed only inside the head of conor finn billtoe arrived thirty minutes late that evening swathed from head to toe in silken sheets catch a goo at me he warbled im the emperor of rome i am arthur billtoe caesar conor was waiting by the door and was dismayed to see billtoes boot heel catching on the hem of one sheet he had enough stitching to do without repairing rips too my sheets he said in strangled tones billtoe stopped his tomfoolery inmate finn had that look on his face again the fearsome one here you are he said suddenly eager to be out of this tiny room and while youre sleeping on em dream about that twelveshot revolver partner partner thought conor doubtfully as if arthur billtoe would ever accept a prisoner as partner conor caught the thrown sheets laying them carefully on his bed thank you mister billtoe these mean the world to me these and my walks on the outside billtoe wagged a finger after the coronation soldier boy after of course said conor contritely after he took a timid step forward i was hoping to have the revolver designs ready for the coronation perhaps if i didnt have to work for the next few nights billtoe backed out of the cell dont even ask soldier boy this is starting to sound like a relationship as though we do things for each other favours and such well it aint a relationship not of the friendly type at any rate you do whatever you can to stop me slitting your throat in the night thats all there is to it conor knew better than to wheedle once billtoe was set in his path trying to change his course would only send him trundling along it faster i am sorry mister billtoe of course you are absolutely correct theres work that needs doing conor thrust out his hands for the handcuffs as he had every day for the past two years and just as he had been doing for the past two years arthur billtoe ratcheted them on tight enough to pinch other guards stopped cuffing their charges after the first while but not billtoe care only took seconds but it could keep a person alive for years billtoe had no intention of ending his days with his head stove in by some fisheyesucking inmate who had lost the will to live and replaced it with the desire to commit murder thats right salt those diamonds arent going to just pop out of the ground and jump into the royal treasury themselves now are they conor winced as the steel bit into his flesh two more days he thought to himself doing his utmost to hide his hatred of billtoe behind a mask of compliance two more days then i can begin to collect my diamonds billtoe was thinking too this one is not broke he stands broke but his eyes are burning i will have to keep an eye on mister conor finn conor finn was important to billtoe and it was not just for the clever notions and the calm he seemed to have generated in the ranks of the battering rams he was important because every so often marshall bonvilain enquired after the young mans health there was a story somewhere in soldier boys past but billtoe had no desire to find out the specifics it wasnt healthy to have the marshall wondering how good a man was at keeping his mouth shut he might decide that the man in question would hold his silence better on the bottom of the ocean with only the crabs to know the contents of his brain billtoe shuddered sometimes his mind conjured the most gruesome images perhaps they were memories seeping from little saltees walls look lively salt theres moren you to be seen to and only billtoe to see to em with a last regretful glance at the precious sheets on his bed conor followed billtoe through the doorway and into the flooded corridor there was a spring tide that day and salt water ran along grooves eroded into the mortar conor swore he saw an eel wriggling through the tiny torrent this entire wing was a death trap and had been for centuries when he had first arrived there were signs of king nicholass planned renovations scaffolds ladders and such but these had all disappeared within days of the kings death no not simply death thought conor murder his life was stolen as mine was stolen from me but soon he would steal it back the following days were a blur of feverish toil by night conor mined the pipe sucking down the bells greasy air almost as fast as the pump team could send it through the vent by day he worked on his sheets stitching with lengths of thread he had bartered for and cutting with a sharp stone whetted on the cell walls there were twelve panels to be cut hemmed and stitched the silk was not as tightly woven as he would have liked but there was nothing to be done about that now it would have to do the work was flawed conor knew that but how could he be exact with poor light improvised materials and no experience he was most likely stitching a shroud for himself but even the idea of a quick death held more comfort than a lifetime in this cell on the evening before the coronation conor almost gave himself away run ragged by stitching and mining he began to behave like the lunatic he was supposed to be when billtoe collected him for his shift conors face hung from his skull like a wet cloth and his lips flapped in a dull mumble he is breaking thought billtoe satisfied it was the sheets that did it sometimes reminders of home are too potent to bear the work will go quickly now he will be desperate to please me the guard clapped on the handcuffs and led the way down the flooded corridor he enquired on conors progress regarding the revolver but all he heard in reply was a burble of counting billtoe stopped suddenly wavelets scurrying from his boot heels whats that youre saying numbers is it a count of some sort conor barely managed to avoid shunting his keeper he had been making a count a vital and secret one he realized that one slip of the lip could be disastrous to his plan a nursery rhyme mister billtoe he mumbled flushed nothing more billtoe looked him square in the face youre red as a boiled lobster soldier boy are you up to some scheming some numbers plan conor hung his head just embarrassed those sheets set me thinking of my mother of the rhymes she used to recite for me billtoe laughed perhaps conor finn was not as fearsome as supposed then again he had seen bigger men than him with mummys handkerchief clutched in one hand and a bloody dagger in the other come to your senses he advised the prisoner a diving bell is no place for daydreamers youre away with the birds nearly thought conor very nearly the final day whirled past for months time had mocked him prolonging itself elastically each second a yawning chasm but now there was not time enough to squeeze in the days work to conor it seemed to take an age simply to thread a needle his fine mind was fuzzy with fear twice he sewed sections of his contraption upside down and was forced to pick out the stitches sweat dripped constantly from his brow speckling the silk sheets this is ridiculous i am a scientist look upon this as an experiment it was no use he could not calm himself the spectre of failure tapped his shoulder in time with the water dripping from the ceiling there would be other plans certainly he already had the bones of half a dozen some more convoluted some less so he had designed a diving helmet like a miniature bell which should contain enough air to get him to open water after that he could manually inflate a pigs bladder and swim to shore by night to amass the materials for that plan would take five years at the very least five more years unbearable conor redoubled his efforts blinking the fog from his eyes pressing his fingertips together until the shake subsided the coronation was tonight he must be ready chapter to the queen her crown the saltee islanders were preparing for celebration the british royal yacht hmy victoria and albert ii a foot paddle steamer lolled regally in fulmar bay with the waves of saint georges channel tipping her gently like the fingers of a child on a rubber balloon the queen herself was happily ensconced in one of the palaces sumptuous apartments her diary records that i find the air of industry in this miniature kingdom wonderfully exhilarating looking down from my balcony window at the commerce far below one almost feels as though one has arrived in swifts lilliput almost every patch of great saltees acres had been appropriated for the celebrations the south summit was festooned with clusters of pikes decorated with crimson and gold flags the streets of promontory fort were painted in the same coloured stripes every man with a hammer was banging in nails and every man without one was hanging bunting from those nails even the weather gods were proving benevolent on the day pouring down sunshine on the little principality setting the waves dancing with sparkles the southern cliffs lost some of their gloom fringed in beards of white spume it seemed to the gentlemen of the worlds press as though the kingdom of the saltees was an oasis of calm amid the political consternation of europe they sat in seaside taverns in fulmar bay boiling up their gullets with traditional spicy gull pancakes and cooling them off again with tankards of irish stout no journalists were permitted on little saltee and none had been invited who might press the matter on the surface happiness and contentment abounded but as in many things the surface gave a treacherous reading many were unhappy in the kingdom taxes had been reintroduced and heavy tithes on imports public services were so skimped on that they were almost nonexistent and residency had been granted to an assorted bunch of motley characters who were then spivved up and handed commissions in the saltee army the best barracks too common scarred veterans most of them landing on the port with clanking sacks of weapons bonvilain was filling his ranks with mercenaries and turning away raw recruits building his own private army many said though the marshall claimed that he was merely protecting the princess from revolutionaries captain declan broekhart would once upon a time have objected vehemently to bonvilains politics but now he was too besieged by his own demons catherine broekhart too was haunted by sadness though she concealed it for the sake of their eighteenmonthold baby son sean declan was consumed and ravaged by grief he wore it like a coat it was more a part of him now than his eyes and ears it took his hunger and his strength it ate away his girth and his stature declan broekhart had grown old before his time often catherine would encourage him to fight his way clear of his dark mood we have another son now declan young sean needs his father his answer was always a variation on the following i am no father conor died at my post doing my duty my life is gone spent i am a dead man still breathing declan broekhart shunned close contact eager for punishment he grew tightlipped and shortfused he returned to his duties at the palace but his manner had changed where before he had inspired devotion now men obeyed him through fear declan worked his men hard chastising honest soldiers who had been at his side for years no dereliction of duty was left unpunished however slight declan prowled the great saltee wall at night clothed entirely in black searching for an inattentive sentry he demoted soldiers docked their pay and on one occasion had a watchman dismissed for nodding off in the guard hut this last was three days before the coronation when declan was at his most tense when the news trickled through to him that the punished watchman was worn out with newborn twins and a wife still in her bed catherine believed her husband might come to his senses but instead declan broekhart turned a degree colder little sean cried from the bedroom his midday sleep disturbed catherine wiped her eyes so the baby would see her happy do you think conor would want this she said making one last attempt do you think he looks down from a heros heaven and rejoices at what his father has become declan cracked but he did not break and what have i become catherine am i not still a man who fulfils his duties to the best of his abilities catherines eyes blazed through the last of her tears those of captain broekhart certainly but declan broekhart husband and father as you say yourself those duties have been neglected for some time now with these harsh words catherine left her husband to his brooding when he was certain that she could no longer see him declan broekhart clasped his hands on either side of his head as though he could squeeze out the pain declan had never recovered from conors supposed death and perhaps he never would have had two events not occurred one after the other on the day of isabellas coronation alone these events might not have been enough to raise him from his stupor but together they complemented one another shaking the lethargy from declan broekharts bones the first was a simple thing common and quick the kind of family happening that would not usually qualify as an event but for declan something in those few seconds warmed his heart and set him on the road to recovery later he would often wonder whether catherine had engineered this little incident or for that matter the second one too he questioned her often but she would neither admit nor deny anything what happened was this little sean came waddling from his room unsteady on chubby legs when conor had been that age declan called his legs fat sausages and they rolled on the rug like a dog and its pup but he hardly noticed sean leaving the rearing to catherine papa said the infant slightly disappointed that his mother was not to be seen papa ignored him papa was not a source of food or entertainment and so little sean toddled on towards the open bay window the balcony was beyond and then a low wroughtiron railing hardly enough to contain an inquisitive boy catherine called declan but his wife did not appear sean skirted a chair teetering briefly to starboard then on towards the window catherine the boy hes near the window still no sign of or reply from catherine and now little sean was at the sill itself a pudgy foot raised to step over declan had no choice but to act with a grunt of annoyance he took the two strides necessary to reach the child not such a momentous undertaking unless you consider that this was perhaps the fifth time that declan broekhart had set hands on his son and at that exact moment the boy turned pivoting on the ball of his heel the way only the very young can and declans fingers grazed seans cheek their eyes met and the boy reached up tugging declans bottom lip the contact was magical declan felt a jolt run through his heart as for the first time he saw sean as himself and not a shadow of his dead brother oh my son he said hoisting him up and drawing him close you must keep away from the window it is dangerous stay here with me declan was halfway back to life perhaps he would have continued the journey in fits and jumps an occasional shared smile the odd bedtime story but then there came a knocking on the front door a series of raps actually regal raps before declan had the chance to register the sounds the door burst open and one of his own men stepped across the threshold holding the door wide for princess isabella declan was caught tenderly embracing his son a most unbroekhartlike action he frowned twice once for the soldier a warning to keep this sight to himself a second frown for princess isabella who was clothed in full coronation robes a vision in gold and crimson silk and satin more beautiful than even her father could have dreamed what could she be doing here on this of all days isabella opened her mouth to speak the princess had her entreaty prepared declan had requested wall duty for the ceremony but she had needed him at her side today of all days she missed conor and her father more than ever and the only way she could get through the ceremony was if the man who she considered a second father was restored to her and not simply in body but in spirit today declan broekhart must remember the man he had been quite a fine speech obviously the girl would make a fine queen however no one heard the words for the moment isabella laid eyes on declan cradling his son her posture slumped from queen to girl and she flung herself at his chest weeping declan broekhart had little option but to wrap his free arm around the weeping princess there there he said uncertainly now now i need you sobbed isabella by my side always declan felt tears gather on his own eyelids of course majesty isabella thumped his broad chest with her delicate fist i need you declan you yes isabella said declan gruffly by your side always catherine broekhart stepped in from the balcony where she had been waiting and joined the embrace the guard at the door was tempted but decided against it the coronation was a wordy affair with clergy and velvet and enough latin chanting to keep a monastery going for a few decades it was all a bit of a blur to declan broekhart who installed himself behind his queen on the altar so he could be there to smile encouragingly when she looked for him which she did often shortly after the papal nuncio lowered the crown declan noticed his wifes dress a new dress he whispered i thought we werent coming catherine smiled archly yes you did think that didnt you declan felt a glow in his chest that he recognized as cautious happiness it was a bittersweet emotion without conor there at his shoulder they rode in the royal coach back from saint christophers towards promontory fort though in truth the town now covered almost every square foot of the island as the population increased houses grew up instead of out and were shoehorned into any available space the higgledypiggledy town reminded declan of the giants causeway a chaotic honeycomb of basalt columns in the north of ireland though these columns were marked by doors and windows and striped by the traditional bold house colours of the saltee islands as for the islanders it seemed they were all on the street along with half of ireland cheering themselves hoarse for the beautiful young queen the coach was shared with marshall bonvilain in full ceremonial uniform including a knights of the holy cross toga worn loosely over it all the saltee templars were the only branch to have survived pope clement vs fourteenthcentury purge even the vatican had been unwilling to risk disrupting the diamond supply bonvilain took advantage of the new queens distraction to lean across and whisper to declan how are you declan im surprised to see you here as am i hugo replied declan i hadnt planned to come but i am happy to find my plans changed bonvilain smiled i am happy too it does the men good to see your face keeps them alert nice work dismissing that sentry by the way sleeping sentries is just the opening the rebels need one chink in the wall and theyre in and i neednt tell you the heartache they can cause declan nodded tightly but in truth bonvilains speech seemed a little hollow on this day there had been little rebel activity for many months and some of the marshalls arrests had been made on the flimsiest of evidence bonvilain noticed the captains expression you disagree declan surely not after all the broekharts have endured declan felt his wifes fingers close around his he gazed past isabellas shining face through the window over the heads of a hundred islanders and into the blue haze of sea and sky i dont disagree marshall i just need to think about something else today my wife and my queen they need me for today at least of course said bonvilain his tone gracious but his eyes were hard and his teeth were gritted behind his lips broekhart recovers he thought his scruples are already returning how long before the dog bites his master hugo bonvilain waved a gloved hand at the cheering citizens on the roadside better not to take the chance perhaps it is time for a little blackmail declan broekhart could not bear to lose his elder son a second time little saltee conor was ready for flight his sewing was done a double seam would have been better but there was not a strand of thread left the device was as sound as it would ever be the sounds of revelries drifted across from the great saltee wall singing cheering stamping of feet a great coming together a thousand faces flushed in the glow of the wall lamps conor imagined the crowds lined a dozen deep waiting for the great show of fireworks it seemed as though the very prison walls shook though a stretch of ocean separated prisoners from the party the buzz of coronation excitement had communicated itself through the prison and many of the prisoners hooted through their windows or dragged tin cups across their barred windows surprisingly perhaps most of the inmates showed monarchist leanings in spite of their incarceration at her majestys pleasure a ragged chorus of defend the wall the saltee national anthem bounced off the walls and under conors cell door he found himself humming along it was strange to hear the words king nicholas already replaced by queen isabella how could you believe bonvilains lies why did you not send for me isabella confusion bred heat in his forehead and conor felt the strength of it cloud his brain his senses piled on top of one another sight touch smell grime in the wrinkles of his forehead the cell door seemed to shake in its housing sweat damp and worse from his cell he closed his eyes breathing deeply through his nose one of victors tricks brought back from the orient breathe in cold air clear the mind conor pushed thoughts of isabella aside time now to concentrate billtoes steps were on the flagstones outside one last time through the checklist mud on his back yes he could feel it crusting inside his collar at last a use for the damp wall there is always a use for everything victor had told him even pain the device secured conor reached round under his loose jacket tugging at the rectangular pack concealed on his chest the ropes groaned at his pull but they were homemade and imperfect woven from raggy ends and cutoffs spliced together and daubed with candle wax the cuff peg concealed in his palm a jagged ivory cone measured by pressing the cuffs ratchet hard into his palm when billtoe was removing them the cuff peg was an old escapologists trick and would only work on a set of singlelock cuffs with some play in the bolts but billtoes cuffs were old enough to have belonged to moses and conor had been yanking at the bolts for half a year now there was enough play when billtoe slapped the cuffs on conor would quickly plug the hole with the ivory peg the ratchet would be deflected while appearing to close mud devices pegs this plan was lunacy and as such could never be anticipated conor stepped on his uncertainty with a harsh boot there was not the time now his plan would liberate him or kill him and both were preferable to more long years in this hell pit billtoes key clanked into the ancient lock turning with some effort the guard shouldered the door open complaining as usual but with one cautious hand on his pistol an angel is what i am sticking it out with you clods when a man like me would be welcomed into any discerning society in the world i could be a prince you know finn an emperor darn it but here i stays so that you can tell me my twelveshot revolver is not ready yet it is ready blurted conor playing the excited eagertoplease prisoner i have the plan here billtoe was canny enough to be suspicious lesser brains would have lost the run of themselves and the price of their distraction would be a stovein skull but arthur billtoes prime instinct was selfpreservation where exactly now would that plan be i wont be doing any bending over or fumbling in shadows no lying on the table shall i hand it to you billtoe cogitated coughing up a lump of recently swallowed rations for a rechew no soldier boy hows about i cuff you as per usual then have a little looksee at the plan myself conor extended his hands happy to comply do i get my walks mister billtoe you promised i would billtoe smiled as he clamped on the cuffs one eye on the table its your beard that has me grinning a pathetic shrub it aint ready for growing yet you ought to trim it back thicken it up the rams aint going to be ordered to by some runt with a bare gorse on his chin and well talk about walks after i have a good study of this drawing billtoe plucked the page from the table with two grubby fineboned fingers you know ive been talking to a few mates apparently theres a german makes twelveshot revolvers he spat a stream of tobacco juice on the flags to show his displeasure but small calibre argued conor to accommodate the bullets with this design the cylinder is actually a screw so the bullets can be as big as you wish and the weight is spread out more efficiently so it will work for rifles too the design was preposterous and utterly unworkable but looked pretty on paper i dont know grumbled billtoe a screw you say have one made like the balloons do a test billtoe folded the page roughly stuffing it into a pocket that i will master finn and if this turns out to be a scatterfools daydream the next time you see daylight will be on the day i toss you from the south wall conor nodded glumly hoping his excitement did not shine from his forehead like the hook head lighthouse billtoe had made a mistake in his eagerness to see the revolver plan he hadnt noticed conors sleight of hand plugging the bell and bolton handcuffs diverting the ratchet to one side his hands were free but it was not yet time to make use of this this is no daydream mister billtoe this is our future you can register the patent then perhaps pay a few bribes to get me out of here billtoe feigned great indignance bribes bribes you say i am deeply offended conor swallowed a man holding his nerve lets speak plain mister billtoe i am in this hole for life unless you can pull me out of it im not expecting freedom right away billtoe chuckled i am relieved to hear it the pressure is on says i to meself immediate freedom or no deal but youre not expecting freedom so theres a worry lifted but i would dearly love a cell on the surface or near it maybe a mate to share with malarkey would be suitable i think i bet he would lovely and cosy all rams together no wheedling now finn first i have the model made and when it doesnt explode in my face then we parley but mister billtoe held up a flat hand no not a word more soldier boy your balloons have not taken flight yet i may be coming for you in the morning with a fenian pike conor hung his head in defeat in reality hoping he had not overplayed his role the entire revolver notion was merely misdirection any magicians meat and potatoes fill billtoes mind with notions so that he would be less attuned to what was unfolding in front of his eyes now lets be off to work well work for you im off topside to supervise your my coronation balloons conor sidled past billtoe through the doorway careful to keep his mudcaked back on the guards blind side his plan was a house of cards a citadel of cards one unlucky glance could bring the entire structure down no time for that now begin your count his count another largely theoretical card in the citadel conor had long since discovered that there was a blind spot in the corridor between his cell door and the divingbell wing one of the mad wings occupants had been in front of him six months previously on the walk to the wardens weekly speech the man was tiny with a disproportionately large head especially the forehead which sat atop his eyebrows like a porcelain slug it was the man billtoe had called numbers because inside his strange head everything was reduced to mathematics the purest science he would spout long streams of digits and then laugh as though he were watching cabaret in paris on that morning half a year ago conor had watched the man lope down the line before him muttering his numbers measuring his steps fourteen was the last in his list then numbers took a sideways hop and disappeared no not disappeared but certainly not as visible there in sudden black shadows shaking with mirth at his own joke a joke that could see him hanged numbers held his position until pike noticed him missing then hopped from his hiding place fourteen he exclaimed in a screeching shriek fourteen eightyfive one half pike did not get the joke proceeding to cuff numbers round the ear hole several times there were no more demonstrations from numbers but conor learned quickly he had seen the trick once and set about dissecting it how do you unravel a magicians secret start at the reveal and work backwards there was a natural blind spot in the corridor something magicians and escapologists created artificially on stage with lights drapes or mirrors a tiny spot of isolated darkness surrounded by stimuli that drew the eye a patch of near invisibility it would not stand up to any scrutiny but for a second in frenzied circumstances it would do for the next few weeks conor watched the space and analysed the numbers fourteen eightyfive one half it was no deep code numbers had taken fourteen steps from his cell door along the path then hopped half a step eightyfive degrees to the right into the belly of the blind spot conor simply added the five steps necessary to find the spot for himself once there he was amazed by how obvious it was overlapping layers of shadow untouched by torchlight further shaded by a slipped cornice stone with a spume of spilled crimson paint on the flagstones a foot to the left a cylinder of blackness that would take no more than a heartbeat to pass through but once inside it formed a cloak of near invisibility that could be enhanced by further misdirection billtoe walked beside him muttering about his lack of respect for his superiors twelve and the warden dont talk to me about the warden that man makes decisions that boggle the mind too much time in the indian sun if you ask me blooming calcutta fried his mind fifteen the money the man wastes the cash money it makes my heart sick i fair feel ill just talking about it even to a salt nineteen billtoe clicked his fingers at conor meaning stop where you are now comes the vital moment all strands converge live or die on this instant billtoe stepped to the wing door tinging the bell with his fingernail no response for a long moment then a familiar mocking voice from the spy hole above ah billtoe is it out you want from the mad wing are you certain sure thats the right direction billtoes posture stiffened a dozen times a day he had to endure this ribbing can you not simply open a bolt murphy turn the wheel and lift the bolt that is all i require from you sure i know its all you require arthur the rest is free a little daily gift i am the funny fairy dropping little lumps of humour on your head six feet up the wheel was turned and bolt lifted the door to the mad wing swung open if i could put in words how much i hate that man muttered billtoe turning then shakespeare himself could kiss my the final word of billtoes sentence turned to dust in his dry throat because his prisoner had disappeared vanished into the air not my prisoner thought arthur billtoe marshall bonvilains i am a dead man while billtoe stood glaring skywards into the spy hole conor found himself rooted to the spot he had imagined this moment so often that it seemed unreal to him now as though it could never really materialize in his minds eye he saw himself confidently putting his plan into action but the fleshandbone conor finn stayed where he was one and a half steps to the left of the corridors blind spot then billtoe began his turn and conors life to come flashed before him five more decades under night and water until his skin was leeched of all colour and his eyes were those of a tunnel rat act he told himself it is a good plan and so he acted in an exhaustively practised series of movements conor took a pace and a half to his right spun round so his muddied back faced billtoe and tossed his open handcuffs into the grate of the nearest sealed chimney the rattle drew billtoes eyes away from the blind spot stupid boy he groaned hes gone up the spouts the guard hurried past conor who huddled camouflaged in his hiding place his brown jacket blending effectively with the corridor walls billtoe kicked the grate angrily then bent low to holler up the chimney come down from there halfwit they are sealed all of em the only thing youll find up the spouts are the mouldering remains of other scatterfools there was no response but billtoe imagined he heard a rustle aha he shouted your clumsiness betrays you down now finn or i will discharge my weapon do not doubt it conor moved like a prowling cat stealing sideways to the open wing door he must not reveal himself this plan would only succeed if nobody worked out that he was gone to be spotted now would mean a brief chase and a long time recovering from whatever beating the guards decided to dish out he edged beneath the spy hole searching for a face there was none just the tip of a boot and the lower curve of a cauldron stomach conor slipped across the door saddle and the closeness of freedom sent him lightheaded he almost bolted for the outer door almost but one stumble now could kill him it was so close tantalizing only a dark wedge of stained wood separated him from the outside world the door opened and two guards strolled through sharing a snide sniggering joke i will have to kill them decided conor it will be easily done snag the firsts dagger and gut them both i can make a run for the balloons he flexed his fingers slowly getting ready for the lunge but it wasnt necessary the guards simply did not see him they turned towards the mining wing without once pointing an eyeball his way i could have murdered them realized conor i was ready to strike even this thought could not delay him for long little saltee guards were not to be seen as normal people they were cruel gaolers who would gladly toss him from the highest turret into the maws of the sharks that patrolled the waste pipes conor moved quickly feeling that his store of good fortune was depleting rapidly and slipped through the outer doorway as soon as the guards had rounded the corner he found himself at the foot of a narrow stairway with a rectangular patch of starred night at its end twelve steps from open air this was the blurred section of his plan from here to the balloons was unknown territory he had some memory of his admission to the prison and malarkey had educated him in the setup as much as he could but prisoners did not climb these stairs neither did they patrol the wall he must trust to his wits and whatever luck was left in the bottom of the barrel i will surely fail if i stay here he thought mounting the steps two at a time salty air washed over him as he emerged into the darkness and its tang almost made him cry of course there had been air in his cell but this was pure and fresh untainted by the smell of offal and sweat i had forgotten how sweet the sea air is bonvilain took this from me he was two steps below ground level now a low stone wall shielding him from the main courtyard it seemed smaller than he remembered barely more than a walled yard two aproned butchers worked on a hanging pig carcass on the diagonal corner they sliced fatty strips of meat from the haunches rinsing them thoroughly in a water bucket pushing their thumbs into the folds of flesh rivulets of blood dripping from their elbows conor found himself lost in the image a sight that he had missed without knowing it honest labour life and death an explosion boomed overhead and swathes of multicoloured sparks rained from the sky conor ducked low then saw that the explosion was of his own design they were igniting the coronation balloons too early too early it is not yet fully dark one of the butchers swore from shock then caught himself made a joke of it good thing that pig is dead the fright would have done for him the second a smaller man pulled the kerchief from across his nose to hell with this tom im going up on the walls i dont care what the warden says the other butcher tom pulled down his own kerchief you know what youre right the lass is our queen too let the warden eat half an hour past due its not as if he hasnt got enough lard stored away to be getting on with the butchers shared a laugh and hung their aprons on a fence post a second balloon exploded releasing a swarm of dancing golden sparks oh the saltee sharpshooters are earning their pay tonight look lively now the butchers left their work skipping sharply up steep stone steps to the crenellated battlements above leaving the courtyard deserted apart from the prisoner concealing himself in the stairwell a third balloon exploded casting stark shadows from the wall lighting night like a photographers phosphorous flash three gone thought conor three already too early he scrambled up into the courtyard improvising a plan as he went all the months of plotting fell apart in front of his eyes timing was everything and it was all wrong he skirted the walls casting furtive glances to the battlements there were a few soldiers but most would be on the far side enjoying the spectacle and the lee of the wall was made all the darker by the shocks of light from the fireworks anyone who had looked directly at them would be without night vision for several moments this is all wrong thought conor snatching a butchers apron from the fence post i am supposed to have at least an hour to figure out how the balloons are tied billtoe thinks i have bolted up the chimney so no one will be searching for me out of doors i should not be harried in this way but harried he was and there was little point wasting seconds rebelling against it every second wasted could see another nitroglycerine bullet on the way to its target conor found a bloody kerchief in the aprons pocket and tied it across his nose then took another second to thrust his hands and forearms into the pigs belly greasing them with blood and gore a butcher now to his fingertips the nearest stairwell was the one recently mounted by the butchers so conor ignored it boldly crossing to the western wall he ambled slowly imitating butcher toms bowlegged gait he was not challenged nobody saw or nobody knew there was a wooden gate at the foot of the stairway but it was fastened with a simple latch more to stop it flapping than with a mind for security conor pushed through and up the stairs with him boots crunching on sand and salt a guard stood above his heels half moons on the top step rocking gently with the brass music drifting across from great saltee conor had no choice but to disturb him edging past with muttered apologies god youre dripping blood tom said the guard this is a coronation not a battlefield dont let the warden smell you on the upper level stinking like that he has a delicate stomach though you wouldnt know it from the size of him conor faked a convincing enough chuckle then threaded his way through the throng of guards and staff piled on to the battlements there were women here too dressed in coronation finery all the fashions of the day conor supposed outrageous bodices and legofmutton sleeves there are too many people the warden was throwing a party best seats in the islands this was not a part of my calculations the wall should be clear for safety reasons i told billtoe i told him the little saltee parapet walkway was ten feet wide with a chesthigh open gorge wall on the ocean side and a sheer drop to the main bailey on the other a rope had been strung along between posts to stop the drunken gentry from stumbling to their deaths conor recognized several guards serving drinks dressed as prisoners in immaculate blue serge overalls obviously the warden was hoping to discredit the rumours of unchristian treatment of the inmates these prisoners were so well treated that they could be trusted to pass out champagne and plates of hors doeuvres there was not a nook or gap without a clay brazier stuck in it baking skewers of shrimp and lobster for the guests to pluck at nowhere for an escaping prisoner to crouch and catch his breath conor wiped the fine mist of salt spray from his face the mist he had forgotten that too how could an islander forget the mist one more thing on bonvilains account worth a few diamonds surely if conor had the luck of the devil and managed to cast himself off from this cursed island another balloon exploded followed a second later by a dozen interlaced swirls of crimson and gold sparks the saltee colours very amusing for the watching crowd the sparks flitted to earth in showers casting their light on the waters below some held their energy until a wave folded over them like a child catching a star a few sparks had the audacity to land on the wall singeing expensive silk dresses a great tragedy indeed i told him thought conor not unhappy with this development it is not safe here a genteel panic spread through the audience champagne glasses were tossed into the sea along with seafood platters as moneyed folk hurried to the various stairways preferring not to be set afire by lowflying fireworks pandemonium good conor moved against the tide towards the next balloon reaching for the stout rope fastening it to a brass ring on the battlements across the sound great saltee was a riot of lights and music brassband tunes thumped across the water echoing on itself arriving in waves there were so many torches and lanterns that the entire island seemed to be ablaze his fingers grazed the rope and a second later felt it slacken as the balloon exploded conor swore and quickened his pace only six balloons left he barged through the assembly caring nothing for angry looks if any of these gentlemen wished to fight a duel over a rough shouldering he would have to oblige them another time shouts and protests followed him down the path he was attracting attention but there was no helping it it was a race now conor versus the saltee sharpshooters he could only hope that his own father was not holding a rifle as declan broekhart rarely missed the next balloon detonated the concussion seeming to shake the very island overloaded that one surely there were four balloons aloft now and a fifth anchored on the quay wall under a tarpaulin the moving target the flying balloons glowed bright like the moons of some distant planet they bobbed in the wind difficult shots not difficult enough two more exploded in quick succession conor could hear the applause from great saltee a grand affair indeed he made a decision no time to rein in the flying balloons he must go for the earthbound it would be watched by a guard but that must be risked it was his last chance in this night of botched plans his way was clear now so conor ran butchers apron flapping around his legs the smell of pig blood hot in his nostrils a guard blocked his way not intentionally he was simply there on duty conor thought to barge him from the wall but at the last second changed his mind and ran him into the battlements instead a sore head was preferable to a crushed skull the wall was more or less deserted high society can move at a pretty pace when their fine garments are under attack all that stood between conor and the last balloon was a courtesy rope and another guard who was actually sucking on a lit pipe a lit pipe beside a hydrogen balloon hello called conor you there guard the guard stood eyes round with a natural doziness sir yessir what can i who do you be conor leaped the rope with no slowing of his pace his boots clicked on the uneven cobbles as he hurried towards the guard the quay wall ran a hundred yards into saint georges channel acting as a breakwater and a semaphore station you are smoking man shouted conor in a voice of authority there is hydrogen in that balloon the guard paled and then yelped as another balloon burst into multicoloured flames the rope sagged slowly to earth like a beheaded snake i i didnt know he stammered tossing his pipe away as though it would bite him i never thought conor cuffed the man roughly knocking off his hat idiot buffoon i smell a leak and you have put sparks on the ground more stammering from the guard but not one protest that hydrogen was an odourless gas i must i must run away he said tossing his rifle aside so that the bayonet raked the cobbles throwing up more sparks dolt said conor i didnt even want the bayonet whined the guard its ceremonial we must cut the balloon loose said conor you do it i will commend you for a medal and with that the guard launched himself into space legs running through the air until they found purchase on a group of rich gawkers in the keep below the lot of them went down in a pile like skittles conor was alone with the balloon for the moment but already there were more astute guards mounting the steps perhaps wondering why a butcher was handing out orders conor twisted the bayonet from the rifle no time to struggle with knots now he pulled back the greasy tarpaulin to find a glowing balloon encased in a fishing net and tethered to several lobster pots conor held the balloon with his left hand sawing at the ropes with his right careful not to puncture the balloon itself tom called a voice to his rear what are you playing at tom thats the entire shows climax that is shes ruptured shouted conor and the fuse has caught a spark i can hear it buzzing stand back so like prudent guards who were paid less than your average street hawker they stood back for a few moments but then nothing much happened except a butcher hacking at ropes eh tom theres a twosecond fuse on those yokes you shouldnt be much more than a smear of butchercoloured mush on the walls by now oh my god shouted conor over his shoulder seeking to spread alarm god help us all pike was one of the guards and he was all too aware that billtoe would lump him with responsibility for the balloon and so forged past the others up the steps stop what youre doing butcher he called in a voice quavering with fear and forced courage cease or i will spill your innards on the stones he hoped the word cease would lend him more authority than he possessed the last strand of the last rope pinged and the balloon lurched towards the heavens almost yanking conors left arm from his socket he would have let go had he not tangled the arm in the netting up to the elbow help me he shouted knowing they could never reach him in time save me please pike thought about shooting the balloon down but decided against it for two reasons if his bullet did ignite the fireworks he could kill himself and the several daring minor european royals who had wanted a closer view of the spectacle death by whizzbang was not a pleasant way to go and even if he survived the fireworks billtoe would use his head for a boot polisher better to take a shot and miss completely he hoisted his rifle taking careless aim youve had your warning butcher he yelled pulling the trigger unfortunately pike was a terrible shot and his deliberate miss took the heel from conors boot halfwit shouted conor then a gust of easterly wind caught the balloon and snatched him away the guards watched him go slackjawed and befuddled it was obvious what had happened but how exactly and why did the man steal the balloon or did the balloon make off with the man pike was struck by the strange beauty of the scene look at that he sighed just like the fairy wot caught hold of the moon and then on remembering billtoe stupid butcher great saltee the saltee islanders were genuinely happy now that good king nicks girl had taken her place on the throne things could go back to the way they had been queen isabella would set matters straight she was a good girl a kind girl had she not demonstrated it a hundred times shipping supplies to the irish poor sending the palace masons into town to work on village houses that girl remembered the name of everyone she met and would often visit the hospital to welcome new babies to the island it was true that isabella had faded since her fathers assassination losing conor broekhart had compounded her pain no father and no shoulder to cry on but now her grieving was done and captain declan broekhart was by her side proud as punch for the entire island to see this was a day for celebration no doubt about it the only one wearing a sour expression was that old goat bonvilain but he hadnt smiled in public since chancellor bismarck tripped over the church steps on a state visit in the late seventies isabella was queen now and captain broekhart was himself again soon there would be no more taxes and no more innocents hauled off to little saltee on trumpedup charges no more mercenaries landing on the docks with their rattling haversacks and cruel eyes the coronation ceremony had proceeded without a hitch isabellas insistence that the dinner seating be rearranged to accommodate the broekharts had ruffled a few noble feathers but the young monarch would not be put off declan and catherine had sat on her left for the entire day with queen victoria on the right marshall bonvilain had been forced to shuffle down two seats at the first table and was not best pleased not that he cared a jot where he sat but catherine broekhart had been whispering into isabellas ear for the entire day and he had never liked that woman too political for her own good bonvilain sulked through the meal complaining that the wine was tepid and the soup too salty the lobster shell he declared was far too brittle even sultan arif a turkish mercenary who had been with bonvilain for more than fifteen years and risen to the position of captain raised an eyebrow at this a templar concerned for the state of his lobster he said you have been at court too long marshall bonvilain calmed himself sultan was the closest thing he had to a friend though he would have him murdered without remorse if it ever became necessary arif was the only man in the kingdom brave enough to speak plainly its not just the lobster he said nodding towards declan broekhart ah yes the lapdog remembers that he is actually a guard dog exactly said bonvilain happy with sultans imagery sultan tossed a stripped chicken bone on to his plate in turkey if a guard dog turns on its master then we simply slit the beasts stomach bonvilain smiled at the idea you can always cheer me up captain but this particular dog is very popular as is his mistress we must consider this problem carefully sultan nodded but dont rule out my solution bonvilain stood as a toast was proposed to the new queen no he whispered to sultan arif i never rule out stomach slitting sultan smiled but his eyes were cold every season he promised himself that he would leave this madman and return to ushak in fact bonvilain was barely a man any more he was the devil and sooner or later the devil destroyed everything in his reach it was his nature after the coronation dinner the official celebrations began though for the saltee islanders and more than visitors the celebrations had been in full swing since the moment the papal nuncio laid the erminetrimmed crown on isabellas head there was a strong army presence on the street no one below the rank of lieutenant had been given leave to enjoy the coronation in fact bonvilain had borrowed a company from the english general eustace fitzmorris stationed in dublin and paid handsomely for the privilege an extra troops with instructions not to tolerate verbal abuse or public drunkenness and to keep a special eye out for frenchmen acting suspiciously there was a carnival atmosphere as queens isabella and victoria mounted the dais outside the palace at promontory fort the citizens congregated in promontory square and listened raptly as the new queen delivered her first royal address bonvilain could not fail to notice that she squeezed catherine broekharts hand for courage throughout sultan leaned in to comment a fine speech he said i especially liked the phrases tax revision and political amnesty bonvilain made no reply he was beginning to wonder if he had miscalculated by allowing isabella to live he had supposed she would be easily manipulated and until now she had been also he needed an undisputed heir on the throne it would be most inconvenient if a dozen or so golddigging pretenders landed at saltee harbour with a family tree rolled up under their arms and their own agenda for the saltee diamonds great britain and of course france would be delighted to see political uncertainty in the saltees it could be just the excuse they needed to step in and support a new order this was bonvilains kingdom but he needed a figurehead to keep him in power no hugo bonvilain decided isabella needed to live at least until she provided an heir to rule after her then there would be an unfortunate accident in the royal yacht perhaps sultan spoke again ah youre smiling in public too thinking pleasant thoughts said bonvilain waving a jolly wave down the line at declan broekhart declan broekhart was on the verge of enjoying himself though every time a smile tugged at his lips it was accompanied by a twinge of guilt as he remembered his dead son what were you doing in the palace conor how could i have put you in that mans care it was still difficult to believe how easily victor vigny had fooled them all catherine had refused to believe that vigny was a spy and assassin until a search of his quarters revealed a trunk of weapons and poisons detailed plans of the saltee defences and a letter from an unnamed author threatening to kill vignys family unless he obeyed his orders catherine saw her husbands eyes cloud over and realized she was losing him to memories isnt this fabulous declan she said stroking her husbands hand isabella is queen a great day for the islands hmm said declan those english soldiers are a disgrace ruffians every last one of them i wouldnt be surprised if fitzmorris cleaned out his prisons look at them unshaven slouching neerdowells your sharpshooters look well enough yes they do said declan proud in spite of himself a dozen of his men stood on the great saltee wall across the square level with the top step of the dais they were buffed brushed and smart in their dress uniforms gold epaulettes winking in the lamplight they seemed almost like identical toy soldiers but for one thing each carried his own distinctive rifle most were sharps but there were a couple of remingtons an enfield and even some modified guns the sharpshooters were the best marksmen on the islands and it had always been army custom to allow these elite soldiers the weapon of their choice one of isabellas aides passed a folded note to declan he read it quickly then sighed relieved that there was no emergency queen victoria is tired he explained to his wife but she would like to see the balloons before she retires to the royal yacht catherine smiled everyone wants to see these balloons declan fireworks balloons what an ingenious idea nitroglycerine bullets i imagine you are right as usual said declan thinking conor would have adored this its just the kind of harebrained scheme he would have come up with himself its a little early for the full effect not yet fully dark catherine pinched his shoulder away with you to your men husband this is not a day for disappointing queens or wives for that matter said declan with a rare smile declan moved easily across the square even the biggest braggarts and drunkards stepped smartly out of his path it did not do to trifle with an officer of the wall with a saltee sharphooters badge on his shoulder especially declan broekhart who didnt have much use for life since a rebel took his son his men were waiting on the wall faces sweating above stiff collars and below hard hats not long to go boys said declan digging deep inside himself to find the spring of camaraderie that once flowed freely a pint of guinness for every man who finds the target he peered across the sound at the glowing balloons straining on their leashes nearly a mile away in half darkness make that two pints of guinness now youre talking muttered one brave lieutenant a skinny kilmore man whose father had served on the wall before him captain broekhart grunted shes all yours bates bates leaned a modified winchester on the battlements flicking up his sights your own barrel asked his captain yessir said the sharpshooter had it bored special and added three inches to the length keeps the bullet on the straight for another hundred yards or so declan was impressed a neat trick lieutenant where did you pick that up you sir said bates and pulled the trigger it was a long shot long enough that they heard the gunshot before the bullet hit its mark the glowing globe exploded in a riotous ball of chinese sparks two pints to me said bates grinning declan groaned ruefully i shall be a poor man before the night is out he turned to wave across the square at catherine she was on her feet applauding as was everyone on the dais including the normally stern queen victoria isabella who had not yet got the hang of royal decorum was hooting with delight declan turned to his men it looks like you boyos are to be the heroes of the night so who will be the next to take beer from me a dozen rifles were instantly cocked conor flew up so fast it felt as though he were falling down none of his calculations could have prepared him for the sheer chaos of his flight hed entertained notions of a brisk elevation but calm and steady with time to collect his thoughts and observe his surroundings in short master of the situation but this was a waking nightmare of all the elements in this equation conor had least control there was wind in his face blasting across his eyeballs stuffing into his ears he was deafened and almost blind his arm was strained to the limits of muscle and bone and finally with a violent gust of wind nature casually dislocated conors shoulder the pain was a whitehot hammer blow that spread across his upper chest i have failed i cannot escape alive just let me lose consciousness and wake in paradise this class of fatalistic thought was not normal for conor but these were extraordinary circumstances it seemed as though his arm would be ripped away utterly and when this did not happen his keen senses sliced through the fog of pain and pandemonium which enveloped him the balloon was gaining height but its acceleration had slowed and the air currents were calmer at this particular altitude conor knew he had to make any observations he could during this lull altitude perhaps fifteen hundred feet drifting towards great saltee the islands shone below him like diamonds in the foreboding sea hundreds of lamps bobbed on the decks of visiting crafts anchored off saltee harbour stars above and below he must separate from the balloon now he was lower than he would like but the wind was taking him out to sea faster than hed calculated and with his injured shoulder conor would be pressed to keep himself afloat for any length of time it was vital that conor disentangle his arm from the netting but he found that even a simple act such as finding one hand with the other was almost impossible in this situation pain disorientation and wind shear would make normal motor functions a challenge for a man at peak physical condition not to mention an injured and exhausted convict he had no control over joints or fingers and the pain now seemed to come from his heart conor had dropped the bayonet and was forced to tug at the netting with fumbling fingers it was impossible his arm was wrapped up snugger than a turkey in an ice box conor finn was ocean bound his only hope was that the balloon was badly made and would pop its seams in the next minute below him the second from last balloon exploded turning a black sky gold and red for a moment before the darkness reclaimed the night perfect thought conor smiling numbly it worked perfectly highclass fireworks holding their light for several seconds what a pity i am not suspended below that balloon instead of stranded in the night sky in his original plan he would be suspended far below one of the balloons when the sharpshooters shot it down the balloon would lift him free from the prison then a bullet would bring him back to earth he wondered absently if he was the first person to see fireworks from above probably not no doubt some intrepid aeronaut had sent up a balloon on an anchor a thought struck conor i am flying as no man has flown before no basket no ballast just a man and his balloon and somehow this thought gave him some comfort in spite of his dire situation he was alone in the skies the only man here breathing rarefied air blueblack expanse on all sides no walls no prison door where will they find me wales france or if the wind changes ireland what will they make of the device on my chest my innovations conor felt a measure of triumph too i have defeated you bonvilain you will not use me or torture me at your leisure i am free there was also regret mother father never an opportunity to explain but even in this mortal danger conor harboured a touch of bitterness how could you believe bonvilain father why havent you saved me the coronation balloons were a tremendous success drawing huge applause with every successful pop the sharpshooters were putting on a great show with only keevers missing his mark and even then only because his nitroglycerine bullet exploded in the barrel buckling his weapon like a ryegrass drinking straw those firework boys were clever blighters declan had to admit each balloon was a bigger bang than the last all carefully sequenced the last one had shaken the very wall itself if queen isabella wasnt careful she might lose her crown catherine looked beautiful tonight up there beside her queen she looked beautiful every night but he hadnt noticed for a while for two years in fact conor would want his mother to be happy perhaps his father too excuse me sir it was bates no doubt looking for his guinness a minute bates im having a moment here thinking about my wife you should try it instead of harassing a superior officer for beer no sir its not the guinness though i havent forgotten it what then said declan trying to hold on to his good mood the moving target the big finale sir theyve let er up too early not my fault is all im saying no one could hit that target must be over a mile and the sea breeze has got her declan gazed across the square at catherine glowing she was and he knew why maybe her husband was coming home at last she needed a sign he held out his hand to bates give me your weapon sharpshooter as soon as declans fingers wrapped around the stock he knew he would make the shot it was fate tonight was the night is she ready yes sir one in the saddle ready for the off little jerky on the recoil hope your shoulder hasnt gone soft you being a captain and so forth declan grunted bates had a mouth on him and no denying it any other night and the young lieutenant would be slopping out the latrines target big glowing ball in the sky sir your sense of selfpreservation should be all atingle right now bates bates coughed yessir i mean target eleven oclock high and right sir captain sir declan caught the balloon in his sights it was barely more than a speck now a pale moon in a sea of stars holy god he thought i hope this is a straightshooting rifle but he knew bates and the only thing sharper than his mouth was his aim declan pulled the rifles nose up a few inches to allow for the drop off then a few to the left to compensate for the cross breeze marksmanship could be learned up to a point but after that it was all natural talent balloons and guns thought declan just like paris the day you were born conor but that time you came down with the balloon declan felt his eyes blur and he blinked them clear this was not the time for tears conor my son your mother and brother need me now but i will never forget you and what you did for the saltees look down and see this as a sign declan took a breath held it then caressed the trigger leaning into his right foot to absorb the recoil the nitroglycerine bullet sped from the extended barrel towards its target thats for you conor he thought and the final coronation balloon exploded brightly enough to be visible from heaven behind him the entire island roared in appreciation except for bonvilain who seemed lost in thought which was never good for the one being thought of declan tossed the rifle to bates nice weapon you have there lieutenant nearly as dangerous as your mouth even bates was awed by this impossible shot yes sir thank you sir that was a historic hit captain where do we stand on the beer now but declan was not listening he was staring across the square over the heads of the cheering mob catherine met his gaze across the distance her hands covered her nose and mouth all he could see of that beautiful face were her dark eyes in the orange glow of electric orbs declan could see that his wife was crying her husband has come home the balloon exploded flames igniting the fireworks pack before the fuse ever had the chance the concussion perforated one of conors eardrums and a riot of sparks peppered his skin like a million bee stings he was engulfed in a cocoon of raging flame which ate his clothing and crisped the hairs on his arms and legs singeing his beard back to the jawline as serious as these injuries were conor had expected much worse then gravity took hold yanking him back to earth with invisible threads down he went too shocked to cry out this had never been the plan there was supposed to be ten fathoms of rope between him and the balloon dangerous certainly but a lot healthier than riding the balloon itself there was something he was supposed to do the plan had a next stage surely of course the device conor forced his good hand down against the airflow pulling aside the smouldering remnants of his jacket my god there were sparks on the device the device was of course a parachute aeronauts had been jumping out of balloons for almost a century with varying success in america dropping animals from balloons had become popular after the civil war but jumps had only been performed as entertainment in perfect weather conditions rarely at night hardly ever from an altitude under feet and positively never with a flaming parachute conor located the release cord and pulled hed been forced to pack his chute carefully into a flour bag then strap it across his chest he could only pray that the lines would come out untangled or else the parachute would not even open as it was at this low altitude it was quite possible that the parachute would not have time to spread at all and would merely provide him with a shroud for his watery grave the release cord was sewn to the tip of a tiny parachute much like those victor and conor had often used to sail wooden mannequins from the palace turrets in theory the drag on this parachute would be enough to pull out the larger one this was one of the many new ideas conor had scrawled in the mud at the back of his cell he had hoped at the time that all of his inventions would not have to be tested in such outrageous circumstances though conor did not see it happen his small parachute performed perfectly slipping from its niche like a baby marsupial from the pouch it shivered in the wind for a moment then popped its mouth open catching the air its fall was instantly slowed while conors was not the resulting tension dragged the larger parachute into the night air the silk rustled past conors face bouncing the wind in its folds no tangled lines no snagged folds please god his prayers were answered and the white silk of the parachute sprang open to its limits cleanly with a noise like cannon shot the severity of the deceleration caused the harness straps to snap hard against conors back leaving an xshaped rope burn that he would carry for the rest of his life conor was largely beyond rational thought now and could only wonder why the moon seemed to be following him not only that but it appeared to be on fire angry orange sparks chewed away large sections so that he could see the stars through the holes not the moon my parachute it seemed to conor then that he was still in his cell in the planning stages and his imagination was throwing up possible problems if sparks from the balloon catch on the parachute silk that will indeed be a dire development because it will mean that someone has shot the balloon in spite of me loosing it from the wall if this happens i can only hope that my velocity has decreased sufficiently to make a water landing survivable conors descent was steady enough now that he could distinguish sea from sky below him the islands were rushing up fast he could see isabellas palace and of course the great saltee wall with its rows of electric lamps that had been described by the new york times as the first wonder of the industrial world if i could steer conor thought the lights would guide me in the boats spun below him in a maelstrom of light quickly the largest of the boats filled his vision and he realized that he would land there there was no avoiding the craft it loomed from the black depths like one of darwins bioelectric jellyfish conor felt no particular sadness more the disappointment of a scientist whose experiment has failed ten feet left and i might have survived he thought science is indeed a slave to nature but chance had one more freakish card to play on this night of unlikely extremes a heartbeat after his parachute dissolved into blackened embers conor crashed into the royal yacht victoria and albert ii at a speed of some forty miles an hour he hit the third starboard lifeboat slicing a clean rent in the blue tarpaulin which would not be noticed for two days below the tarpaulin was a bed of cork lifejackets temporarily stored there until hooks could be hung to hold them two days earlier and the recently requisitioned jackets would not have been onboard three days later and they would have been distributed about the yacht despite the parachute and tarpaulin conors bulk and speed drove him through the cork to the deck his dislocated shoulder punched through to the floorboards where he bounced once then came to rest the bilges must be spotless he thought dimly nothing to smell but wood and paint and then i do believe the impact righted my shoulder what are the odds astronomical this was his final thought before oblivion claimed him conor broekhart did not move a muscle for the rest of the night he dreamed vividly but in two colours only crimson and gold part airman chapter angel or devil little saltee on the night arthur billtoe met the devil he was indulging himself in one of his favourite pastimes the prison guard was on the skive in a comfy spot near the cliffs on the islands seaward side billtoe had half a dozen such spots all over the island places he could set down his head when prison life did for his nerves dossing off was not a simple thing on a walled island with a fort perched on the southeastern wedge and a dozen lookout towers along the wall itself stupid electric lighting billtoe often thought hows a man supposed to grab a kip this particular comfy spot was billtoes favourite a shallow little dugout near the salsa garden fifteen paces from the base of the wall the floor was an ancient tarp the ferry boys were flinging and the roof was one of the old doors from wandering hecks days frame and all still on the hinges the entire thing was near invisible from the outside covered as it was with mud grass and scrub that had crept down over the door billtoe felt a swell of pride every time he sneaked himself into its pungent welcoming darkness of all his doss spots this was his favourite dry as a bone come hell or high water and he could uncork the spyhole and use it as a chimney which saved him revealing his embers to the watch one more smoke thought billtoe one more and then back on the job arthur billtoe had been spending more and more time in his hideyholes in the six months since conor finn had disappeared he wasnt nursing a tender spot for the soldier boy but he was fearful that marshall bonvilain had a plan for that young man and him being dead was not part of that plan on the night of finns disappearance billtoe had stood in the chimney stack roaring for hours when that had proved fruitless he had fetched a twelveyearold cockney boy who was doing a dozen or so years for robbing toffs and sent him up the stacks with a promise of a few years off his sentence the boy came down emptyhanded after half a day and billtoe sent him right back up again at gunpoint fortyeight more hours in the labyrinth and the boy came back down with bloody knees and no news it was no use conor finn was not up there somehow arthur billtoe had been duped then he began to wonder about the butcher who had become entangled in one of the coronation balloons could that have been finn could soldier boy have got above ground somehow billtoe could never know for certain and this itched him like a beetle crawling under his skin maybe finn was desiccated in the chimneys or perhaps he had a lungful of brine in saint georges channel dead was dead and bones was bones but that wouldnt be the end of it sooner or later bonvilain would come looking for his special prisoner and then all hell would be brought down on arthur billtoes head unless unless unless the marshall would be fooled by his deception billtoe had considered upping sticks and hopping a steamer to new york when finn disappeared one of his possible fathers was in new york if he were still alive even if he werent then there could be some form of estate but that was all eating rat and calling it turkey he hadnt the money for the atlantic nor would he have with a year of saving it was frustrating to have a fortune in stolen diamonds that he could not convert into hard cash anyway things were rosy on the island at the present moment he was bonvilains boy what with his coronation balloons being such a success pretty soon he might find himself at one end of a promotions handshake maybe then arthur billtoe might be in a position to smuggle some of his diamonds off the island and then maybe he could travel first class on that steamer to new york until then he would have to pray to whatever god would have him that marshall bonvilain did not look too closely at the bearded youth he had slung into conor finns cell the boy was roughly the same age build and colouring after a few beatings he had the same haunted eyes and lopsided looks it could be the same young man if you didnt look too hard billtoe hoped that conor finn was a simple hostage job and not someone with facts in his skull because if it was information that the marshall was after then hed best be looking up high and down low because he wouldnt be finding it in conor finns cell billtoe had a sudden idea i should cut out the ringers tongue say it happened in a fight with malarkey the marshall couldnt hold me responsible for that as it was he who ordered me to set malarkey on the boy that as far as billtoe was concerned was a capital idea far better than salsa gardens or coronation balloons or twelveshot revolvers for that matter which had turned out to be a pile of fools gold a kilmore gunsmith friend of billtoes had nearly lost a finger trying to build that particular weapon i will slice that boys tongue out as soon as i get back thought billtoe tapping his boot to make sure his good knife was nestled there against his shin mightily pleased with this notion billtoe blew a final flute of smoke through the peephole then stubbed out his cigarette on a clamshell he kept in the hideyhole for that purpose he toed the door open a crack to release any lingering smoke or smells then clambered up into the darkness like a corpse rising from its grave not only will cutting that ringers tongue out serve a purpose visàvis my plan but it will also improve my mood billtoes general routine was to hug the wall until he reached a stairwell then trot up as if he were simply taking the air no one would challenge him especially since the coronation he was a big shot now was arthur billtoe thats mister billtoe to you pike as he had become fond of saying lately the night was overcast with barely a star winking through the clouds the wall crenellations had an orange haze drawn above their blocks by the electric lighting billtoe used the orange line as a marker easy to navigate by he nipped across the springy rock grass under cover of darkness a little sharpish as it turned out because his boot heel slipped on a pat of moss and he went down on his back the wind went out of him like dust from a beaten rug billtoe lay there on his back wheezing and gasping when suddenly the clouds parted letting a silver guinea moon shine through when billtoe recovered his wind his lips spread in a plugstained smile because finally after so many years he could make out the man in the moon that everyone prattled on about must be the angle because before this moment he had never seen anything but smudges i can see the face now for the first time and i get to cut out a prisoners tongue happy day then through the gap in the clouds came some kind of figure a man with wings flying this kind of event was so strange so impossible that billtoe was not even surprised initially a man with the wings of a bird an angel in black the angel banked sharp starboard so as not to overshoot the island then descended in a tight curl spiralling down until billtoe could hear the craft as well as see it it creaked flapped and fluttered and the humanlooking creature fought it as though he were being borne away by a great eagle i know what is happening here billtoe realized arthur billtoe had in his life read two books londons most gruesome murders by sy cocillée which he found most educational and the noble indian by captain george toolee which he had hoped would concern itself with settler massacres and scalping but which actually turned out to be an indepth study of the indians culture billtoe had almost tossed the book into the fire but it had cost him a few shillings so he persevered one chapter described a tent known as the sweat lodge where the indians got themselves good and smoked up until their spirit guide appeared my hideyhole is like a sweat lodge now my spirit guide has appeared and its a swearing birdman the birdman contraption came down fast wings cracking as the air filled their sails it seemed as though the creature would break itself against the rocks like a sparrow against the window which billtoe always found amusing when at the last possible second the angel creature pulled up his nose gliding in for a smooth landing his speed took him running for a dozen steps until he managed to halt himself billtoe gazed up terrified at this otherworldly creature who loomed above him the moon haloing his head it was close enough to stab but what would be the point there was no killing a creature like this the creature was dressed in black from the top of his leather cap to the tip of his kneelength riding boots his face was concealed by a pair of glassed goggles and a scarf pulled tightly across the mouth his breath was ragged though the scarf and his chest heaved something twinkled on the angels chest an insignia of some kind two golden wings springing from a letter a could it stand for angel arthur billtoe wished with all his heart to remain still and silent he felt once more like the sevenyearold boy he had been in a dublin alley hiding in a water barrel being hunted by a drunken crone for the sixpence in his pocket his life was worth no more now than it had been then this creature would kill him with a glance he longed to draw the grass and weeds around him like a blanket and sleep until this fearsome flying creature had departed do not whimper he told himself whimpering at times of danger had always been a failing of his and had earned him bruises more than once in the past hold it in arthur me boy suck it down to yer boots he might have managed it had the creature not pulled a sabre from its scabbard at his belt and began plunging it into the ground as though seeking to wound mother earth each thrust brought him closer to where billtoe lay shuddering finally he could absorb the fright no more i will die if i dont speak my poor ticker will burst her spring what are you he hissed the power of his emotions lifting him to his feet what do you want with arthur billtoe the creature reared back then steadied himself its glass eyes flashed orange in the lamp glow then blackened as they landed on the prison guard billtoe it growled arthur billtoe if billtoe could have he would have changed his name on the spot such was the hatred in the creatures voice these winged types must be hateful by nature while billtoe was contemplating this the airman darted forward his curved wings rearing upwards from the sudden movement lifting the blackclad stranger into the air he dropped to earth like a giant snarling gargoyle within arms length of billtoe a fact he put to good use by clasping the guards windpipe in steel fingers billtoe he said again laying his sabre blade flat along billtoes pale throat aare you angel or devil sir stammered the guard i needs to know are you taking me up the ways or down the glass circles studied him for a long second billtoe felt the blade slide along his adams apple he felt the keen cut sing then the blade stopped its deadly arc and the creature spoke i can be angel or devil monsieur it said but in your case i will always be a devil will you kill me now asked billtoe his voice almost a shriek no monsieur not now but you are making a lot of noise so the devil lifted his sabre high and brought the pommel down on billtoes brow the guard collapsed like a dropped puppet he was not quite unconscious but billtoe thought it would be better to seek out the darkness rather than open his eyes and incur the wrath of the airman he kept his eyes closed and soon drifted away when arthur billtoe awoke it was daybreak his head felt like one giant wound and the wardens dog walker poole was standing over him encouraging the little terrier to use billtoes boot as a piddling spot geddoff snarled billtoe kicking at the dog then remembered the french devil who could still be in the area he rolled himself from the marshy puddle in which he had lain and scrambled to all fours unable to go any higher because of the pain hammering his skull devil he panted french big ruddy wings flying about like a nighthawk did you see it pooles response to this lunacy was to pretend he didnt hear he coughed furiously to cover billtoes chatter then chastised the terrier bad sir percival bad making to piddle on mister billtoe like that and he coming out of a dream the details of which i have no desire to hear i would kick you percy if you werent such a lovely lad he picked up the dog and delivered the message he had been sent with warden is looking for you he said unable to meet billtoes eyes he says hes full fed up of you and your hideyholes and you can either fill em in yourself or hell fill em in with you inside and thats what he said to me word for word i been repeating it to myself over and over billtoe was still wideeyed his gaze darting around the rocky area a thin string of drool hanging from his lips he found me he found me i was in the barrel with sixpence and he found me poole decided to misunderstand it was easier yes sir the warden finds everyone he must have eyes in his backside poole chanced a flash of wit as he trotted after sir percival back to the guards billet or maybe he has a set of wings and he flies over the island at night looking down on us billtoe sat himself down on a rock prodded the gooseegg bump on his forehead and began to cry the sky conor finn was flying but it was not the gentle experience he had hoped for the glider was a beast and to conquer it meant constantly wrestling with the contraption as they soared through the air truth be told it did not feel like soaring rather a buffeting battle with the elements the wings banged cracked and jerked threatening to snap their ribs with every gust of wind the harness bit into his chest restricting his breathing and even a collision with a sea bird would send him spiralling to the earth nevertheless conor would not have missed the experience i am the moon he thought i am the stars and then look out a seagull the glider was holding together as well as he could have hoped though he would swear that the third rib to starboard was splintering he would slip it from its sleeve later and replace it with a new rod the steering bar one of his own innovations was working perfectly allowing him to shift his weight and exert a certain control over his trajectory but it was a tenuous control and one that could be contemptuously overruled by the smallest updraught or current the night sky was heavy with clouds reflecting the lights of nearby wexford and kilmore on their underbellies every now and then conor passed below a hole in the clouds and the full moon would spotlight him with her silver rays conor hoped that from below his silhouette would be that of a large bird but nevertheless he was glad of his decision to use black fabric for the wings dyed black not painted paint would be too weighty up close and in broad daylight it would be obvious that the glider was little more than a cleverly designed kite two elongated eightfoot curved ovals for wings linked by a central circular space where the pilot hung suspended in his leather harness a shortstemmed tail rudder with leg braces and a nudge pole that could be tipped by the feet and a trapezoidal steering bar which was attached directly to the main wing strut in theory if one could successfully locate rising thermals it was possible to fly forever suspended below a glider like this of course this was a very optimistic theory which did not allow for wear and tear bad science and the simple fact that thermals were only slightly less difficult to locate than unicorns conor himself was outfitted in the sturdiest ballooning gear leather chinstrapped cap goggles and tight boots his uniform was a convincing copy of that worn by the french armys aeronauts but all in black down to the trouser piping and no insignias apart from a mysterious winged a which could possibly stand for aeronautique if i do happen to crash on the saltees thought conor i will look for all the world like a french airman who does not want to be identified as such in other words a flying spy that should stoke bonvilains mistrust of the french army it was a small comfort but twisting a thorn of disquiet into bonvilains heart was better than dying and leaving nothing but a corpse his luck had held tonight a good launch from the tunnel with everything performing as it should the steam fan had popped a few of the tunnel planks out of their grooves but that was easily repaired and there hadnt been any great loss of wind power his mounting mechanism had worked a thousand times in suspension from a tower beam but tonight it had worked in the open air and he had managed to lean forward in the body harness and ratchet his legs back into the stirrups this was one of his major innovations though there were a thousand small ones from the steam shaping of the ribs to the tail rudder the coastline approached and the black sea with the saltee islands glowing upon it like two nests of fireflies the moment he cleared saint patricks bridge the long bar of shingle that curved from the mainland to point like an arthritic finger towards little saltee the thermal he had been riding disappeared and his gilder stalled tilting forward at the nose conor was prepared for this but not ready if the stall lasted more than a few moments he would plummet to earth to a certain death in the event of a stall hold the nose down and set loose the bands there were three ropes tied off to the steering bar and all three were linked to conors wrist he released the bar tugging sharply downwards untying the hitches on all three ropes the central rope was connected to a hinged forward panel the beak which pulled the nose down the other two slipped from the blades of two wooden propellers which were immediately set whirring by the released energy of two stout rubber cords the rubberband propellers would only work once per flight and the amount of thrust they provided was minimal but it might be enough to pull him out of a stall it was the glider jumped forward barely a yard but it righted itself and caught the sea breeze conor felt it running along the length of his body smelled the salt in each gust before him the wall lights of little saltee marked his target in the blackness heartshaped he thought from up here the island looks like a heart and then i am returning to little saltee god help me i am going back and he could not suppress a shudder that was more dread than cold on the night of his daring escape conor had spiralled flaming from the sky like icarus of legend crashing into a lifeboat on victorias royal yacht which was abustle with preparations for departure conor finn lay undiscovered below a scattered dozen of cork life preservers for the duration of the overnight voyage unable to move even if the rough hand of discovery landed on his shoulder the hand never came and conor was able to sleep until the yacht blew its horn to alert a skiff in its path fortune had smiled on him once more in london where he had been able to slip overboard a couple of leagues out of harbour and swim to a slipway on the thames conor stole a jacket which fortunately had some bread and cheese in the pocket then spent the remainder of the day walking the docks listening for an irish accent by dusk he had spotted a group of london irish who had too few teeth and too many tattoos to be customs spies if you ever do make it out of this hellhole malarkey had often said find my brother zeb on the london docks show him the ink and he will look after you conor rolled up his sleeve for the dockworkers revealing his battering ram tattoo and spoke the magic word malarkey inside the hour he was up to his neck in soapy water with a mug of coffee in one hand and a fine cigar in the other zeb malarkey was a man of means most of these means being fruits of his own personal import tax zeb himself had arrived at the inn a couple of hours later and without a word of greeting examined both conors tattoo and the little saltee brand hows otto he wanted to know hows his hair conor supplied the crime boss with as much information as he could hair silky health fine nice little line in rackets going zeb had already heard of conor through a prison guard on little saltee who took bribes to pass on information conor finn the soldier boy otto speaks highly of you says you put order on the rams what is locked up fancy doing the same here it was tempting simply to shed his old life completely like a reptile shrugging off a brittle skin but conor knew enough of his own heart to recognize that being a waterfront enforcer was not for him he may not be conor broekhart any more but he was not entirely divorced from his mothers morals he could hurt another person to survive but not for payment he was an airman that was his destiny he needed to stick to the plan go to ireland build the means to reclaim his diamonds and then sail for america with the funds to equip his own laboratory so he told zeb malarkey thank you but no he had business on little saltee business that could make the rams a lot of money perhaps zeb had a few men in ireland or perhaps on the saltees who could help the rams have men everywhere what kind of business revenge not exactly there are items on the prison grounds that belong to me and your brother i gave otto my word that i would see him free my thanks for his friendship these past years zeb malarkey tossed him a purse of guineas go then islander go and spread chaos which was exactly what happened little saltee was suddenly below him in less than three minutes he had crossed the twoandahalfmile wide band of ocean between the prison island and the mainland if he had been one of an army the island would have been overrun before they could sound the warning cannon conors body ached from the constant stress on his joints and he was relieved to pull back on the bar and swing his glider into a descending curve in test flights he had succeeded in landing the glider inside the fences of a field far smaller than this island but that field had hedges instead of guards and the hedges were populated by badgers and squirrels none of whom were likely to aim a rifle at flying creatures even at night a birdseye view was very revealing there were three guards on the wall all at the northern end in the shelter of a tower conor could see the glowing bowls of their pipes bobbing close together they should be evenly spaced and on the move but centuries of quiet had bred complacency in them there were actually two walls on little saltee the main outer ring and an inner wall that circled the prison building in between the two was the work area where inmates took exercise and toiled over their salsa gardens this was where conor wished to land where the diamonds were buried a thermal suddenly took his craft causing him to overshoot his preferred landing spot by a hundred yards conor kicked the nudge bar to extreme port and pointed the nose down this put him into a tailspinning descent but his alternative was to land in the ocean it would be a pity to drown tonight having flown further in a glider than any man before him victor would be proud the thought unsettled him in prison he had tried not to think of the family and friends from his old life but since his escape he could think of little else i could simply go back explain father could challenge bonvilain yes and be murdered for his pains mother too best to simply nail the door shut on the past and begin his new life conor dropped quickly rocks and hillocks grew from what had been syrupy black space the glider fought him all the way down and he fought back cursing at his infernal craft refusing to allow it its head once inside the walls shelter the turbulence disappeared and the glider grew docile and sweet lifting her neck graceful as a swan conors boot heels dug into soft earth and he ploughed twin furrows for ten feet before he cranked the wings up behind him with a winch on his belt and came to a halt there was no time to rejoice in his landing or congratulate himself on the effectiveness of his collapsible wings though at the moment they were technically only hoisted to be fully collapsed two struts had to be removed to work to work the diamonds were buried one foot beyond the northernmost corner of each salsa patch seven patches seven bags of diamonds the nearest prison garden was virtually at his feet if he worked quickly and was not discovered he could possibly retrieve three bags tonight conor drew a sabre from his belt using it to dig into the sod searching for diamonds but was distracted from his labour by the sight of a dark and distraught figure rising from the earth a trap i am trapped but that was not the truth of it the shivering figure spoke what are you what do you want with arthur billtoe conor felt an anger so intense that it was physical his brow burned and the sabres leatherbound pommel creaked in his fist billtoe he growled springing forward arthur billtoe the speed of his motion caught the air and the wings jerked skywards conor was elevated briefly but if billtoe thought he could escape he was wrong conor landed not two feet from the terrified guard wrapping steel fingers round the mans gullet how the tables have turned who is the master now not twenty yards from where you bullied and humiliated me billtoe he said again laying his sabre blade flat along billtoes pale throat aare you angel or devil sir stammered the guard i needs to know are you taking me up the ways or down conor considered killing him the urge was strong in all likelihood this wretch had murdered linus wynter he indulged this desire to the tune of a small cut on the guards neck but he could not complete the motion still not a killer linus might have said stick to the plan you are a french spy i can be angel or devil monsieur said conor but in your case i will always be a devil will you kill me now cried billtoe no monsieur not now said conor with more than a touch of regret but you are making a lot of noise so he struck billtoe sharply on the temple with the sabres hilt relishing the thump of contact funny the guard did not seem so threatening now stretched in the grass a coward without his gun or the weight of authority behind him get the diamonds one bag at least conors plan to unearth three bags was shot billtoe could wake at any moment and tempting as the notion might be he could not keep bashing the billtoes skull all night neither could he bind and gag the man as he did not have a rope or cloth something to remember for his next visit should he survive this outing conor returned to his digging levering clods from the earth with the sabre it occurred to him then that malarkey could have lied and secreted their booty in another spot but conor thought it was unlikely in spite of inauspicious beginnings otto malarkey had become his friend and the battering rams had a strong sense of loyalty they would mount the gallows steps before betraying another man who bore the mark conors trust was warranted his blade soon clinked against a clutch of diamonds he put away the sabre and scrabbled in the dirt with his gloved fingers pulling the pouch of diamonds from the earth one found six more to go he was tempted to try for another with a second bag on his belt his future would be secure and he could leave for america tomorrow go now be prudent billtoe could wake at any second one more just one conor ran to the second salsa bed all the time imagining that billtoe regained his senses should i have killed him no a dead guard would raise suspicions there would be an investigation billtoe having conversations with a flying frenchman on the other hand would be viewed as the ramblings of a drunkard unless bonvilain got wind of them too late now fetch the second bag the salsa bed was further north along the walls curve conor ran close to the plinth avoiding the swirling currents that flowed over the islands hillocks and also the salty mist that would weigh down his wings the glider needs to collapse further he told himself the wings catch every breath of air the second pouch was as easy to find as the first had been otto malarkey had followed his instructions well the bag slid from the earth trailing clods and pebbles it was the size and weight of a small rabbit heavy enough two found now it was most certainly time to fly to attempt one more search was to invite disaster conor had a sudden image of passing the remainder of the night back in his old cell and a shudder rippled along his spine he must be away the guards were doubtless huddled in the northern tower filling their pipe bowls so he would make his escape from the south conor returned to the base of the wall and followed his nose until he found the garderobe a privy hollowed into the base of the wall with a drain running through into the ocean garderobes were normally near the stairwell so the guard would need as little time away from his post as possible and just as he had hoped the stairwell was a mere three paces past the garderobe built as a stepped bulwark to the main wall conor crabwalked up keeping his wings behind him safe from damage but open to gusts of wind more than once he was forced to brace his legs against the efforts of his hoisted wings to drag him from the steps not yet higher still there was neither sight nor sound of a sentry on the wall walk though he himself would be visible plain enough as soon as he emerged from the stairwell it was all exactly as planned but for billtoe what in heavens name had the man been doing sleeping in the outdoors conor lay his body flat along the top steps peering along the walls curve at each side the cobbles worn smooth by centuries of patrol shone orange in the electric light the crenellated parapet was head high with rows of horizontal gun ports the wind whistled through each one sending up an eerie banshee howling an offshore wind still strong it would have been most fortuitous had the wind changed to a sea breeze blowing back towards the mainland but these were the kinds of odds that could not be relied upon take advantage when lady luck smiles but do not plan for it and so conors immediate destination was not kilmore but great saltee for that was where the wind was going conor gathered his feet under him pushing his harness lower he gripped the winghoist lever in one hand and the rudder bar in the other once more into the air he stood and ran across the wall walk his footsteps seemed absurdly loud as his boots clacked on the stone surely the sounds would march along the wall to the guards tower concentrate on your actions the slightest slip could be the death of you it was curious but sometimes the voice in conors mind sounded like victor vigny i have a guardian angel and he is french this made him grin and so in spite of the lifeordeath situation it was a smiling conor finn who hoisted himself on to the little saltee parapet and launched himself into the night sky i am flying home sebber bridge great saltee pike generally worked the early shift on little saltee then spent sunlight hours and leisure days on the big island nursing his onelegged mother and fixing the cottage wall which he had been working on now for fifteen years when he wasnt mixing mortar for the wall pike was making himself money hand over fist selling information to the battering rams pike was never going to be in the gangs inner circle but he was a useful man in any situation because in spite of his apparent lack of grey matter he had an uncanny knack of accumulating information the warden a political man appreciated this and granted pike extra leave time to hook him any court gossip he could while the battering rams paid him handsomely for any customs information he was able to wheedle from his mates on the docks two bags of coin per week and neither party any the wiser as well as information pike ran the odd errand for the rams nothing violent that could see him hanged and also he was an inveterate coward his latest job was simplicity itself if a little puzzling until further notice on any night there was a stiff breeze from the mainland he was to tow a skiff around to sebber bridge and leave it there simple as that beach the boat on the shale outcrop below promontory fort then row back up the coast to the harbour no lights no whistling nor singing sea shanties or the saltee sharpshooters would put a bullet in his behind simply beach the boat and go the skiff would make its own way back to saltee harbour the next day simple orders but not to pikes taste thanks to his double pay packet he was well aware just how valuable good information was and he felt certain that there were those who would pay to know what manner of person was picking up a skiff on sebber bridge in the wee hours not someone on the up and up that was for certain honest citizens came and went through the harbour without the need for skulduggery like this the trick was how to sell the information without falling foul of the battering rams but he could chew on that problem when he had some information to sell so pike decided to delay his departure awhile until the mystery sailor had set sail then he would know what kind of a nugget he had and how much it was worth he concealed his own punt under a bank of weed then crawled high into the rocks and settled in to wait after a couple of hours he was regretting not bringing more tobacco along and was considering stuffing his pipe with seaweed when something whooshed overhead causing him to drop his pipe altogether if that was a bat then it was a big one lowflying gull more like or a kestrel over from the mainland pike had a vague sense of the creatures bigness there would be some eating in a bird like that a pity i dont have my slingshot along even a gull can taste passable when you cook it right he wriggled forward out of his crevasse just in time to see a man with wings swoop in to land on sebber bridge his heels dragging up arcs of shingle a flying man he thought flabbergasted a man that can fly pike knew instantly that this was the most valuable thing he would ever see he pulled a pad from his pocket licking the stub of a pencil that hung from a string on the binding a good tout never knows when a nugget will need recording keep your pencil close to your heart and youll never miss a trick so with his heart rattling his ribs and his fingers shaking pike sketched the winged airman hanging on to the skiffs gunwale lest the breeze carry him off to the moon he drew arrows pointing to the wings and above the arrows wrote wings as if writing the word made what was before his eyes more believable he noted it down when the airman pulled a lever and his wings were hoisted behind him he drew a diagram of the harness and how it cradled the sky rider from shoulder to knee he saw how the man took himself out of the harness like a lady from her bodice and collapsed the whole contraption down by pulling out a few stays till the wings folded up neater than a picnic blanket perhaps i should just take those wings thought pike that airman dont look so big i could part his ribs with my knife and present those wings to the warden perhaps that would be the best course of action but then he noticed a sabre on the mans belt and a revolver on his other hip there was also the possibility that these airman types possessed strange mystical powers such as the evil eye or the deathly hex best leave it at pictures for today he decided next time i will be prepared and he will be relaxed a nice shorthandled axe should do the trick the airman stowed his gear neatly under the aft seat then dug his toes into the shale pushing off the skiff slid sweetly into the dark water with no more of a splash than the waves were making on the north shore hes gone thought pike i am safe but perhaps he thought his thoughts too loudly because the airman froze and turned his glassgoggled eyes towards the rocks his head was cocked like a puzzled deer and he scanned the higher levels with twin orange circles his eyes are on fire thought pike he can see in the dark but then the strange flying man turned leaping neatly into the skiff his landing sending her scudding out across the water prow slapping the waves in seconds the dark sail unfurled and she tacked to starboard wide of the island pike sighed in relief perhaps a shorthandled axe will not do the job he decided perhaps i need something with a long handle chapter the soldiers return kilmore quay conor tacked wide riding the offshore wind as far as possible before dropping sail and rowing towards kilmore harbour the clouds had thickened and a few spatters of rain knocked on the planking the tide was on the rise so he made good time in spite of the wind on his back conor had expected to feel elated at this moment he had been wishing for it long enough there were diamonds at his belt and freedom in his future zeb malarkey had sent him new papers so he could book passage to new york tomorrow if he so wished enough to start a new life he did feel a certain satisfaction but it was grim and muted it seemed as though memories of his old life were reclaiming their place at the forefront of his mind now that he was out of prison conor wondered if he could ever feel true joy again without his loved ones to share his accomplishments with he allowed himself a brief daydream he imagined landing his glider not on little saltee but on the long mainland beach of curracloe which ran straight and flat for several miles this was the spot where victor had incessantly talked of testing their aeroplanes there would be crowds present of course and journalists from all over the world gaggles of sceptical scientists too but conor did not care a fig for any of them he was on the lookout for his parents and victor too they would be hugging each other with excitement and pride his father would reach him first as he swooped in to land perhaps isabella would attend his heart sank isabella she believes that i helped to kill her father how could she believe that instead of gliding on to the golden sands of curracloe he was alone in a boat with no one to boast to no one to celebrate with the power of flight was no longer an achievement in itself it was a way to aid him in his thievery i have flown further than any other man i have flown over water at night no one to tell but the stars the only person who knows is a cruel prison guard a buffoon who thinks that i am the devil i am the worlds first flying thief conor shook his head to dislodge this disquieting daydream then threw his back into the oars he sculled skilfully as his father had taught him bend forward dip the blades but not too deep pull with the back and then arms develop a rhythm and let that rhythm calm you a man can be truly at peace on the water in a small boat even though only a plank of wood separates him from the cold unforgiving ocean can a thief be at peace for a time perhaps conor tied the skiff off at the quay stuffed his hat and goggles into a jacket pocket then draped the coat over the folded glider he hefted the nondescript package on to his back and climbed the ladder to the pier the diamonds clinked like bags of marbles with each step he took along the quay wall he hailed two boys patching a net on the slip and gave them two shillings one for the ferry back and the other for yourselves it was common for visitors to the saltee islands to have one tankard too many and miss the last ferry common enough not to raise suspicions there were always a couple of boys on the docks willing to return a borrowed boat for a fee naturally i may have need of these boys a few nights more thought conor then i leave this place forever but there was no relish in the thought as thoughts of his family grew stronger his dream of america had paled nevertheless he would persevere as staying here close enough to home to see the kitchen light burning would be intolerable i am conor finn now i have no family kilmore village was quiet enough due to the lateness of the hour though there was still some argybargy emanating from the doorway of the wooden house the local pub built almost entirely from the deckhouse of a sunken greek ship conor was tempted to go inside and sit himself down with a bowl of stew but the cargo on his back and belt was too valuable to stow under a tavern table so he trudged on up the hill leaving the village behind his new home was two miles past the village off the old coast road conor climbed a stile and followed a worn path along the cliff edge to a set of late medieval gates with eagles perched on their mossy pillars eagles thought conor victors little joke the wroughtiron gates were imposing enough and might have deterred thieves had not the walls on either side been cannibalized by locals over the years to build their dwellings cut stone is not so cheap that it can be left piled high on a derelict estate there were no more than odds and halves left now littering the grass conor stepped over the broken wall walking along an avenue that wound through a copse of willow trees behind this screen stood a martello tower a squat cylinder of stone with walls of a prodigious thickness built by the british army to keep an eye on the saltee islands the single door was eight feet from the towers base and could only be reached by ladder and the windows were letterbox gun ports that would allow the garrison stationed inside to pick off any poor unfortunates unlucky enough to be on the offensive conor disentangled a ladder from the weeds at the base of the tower propping it up against the tower wall then balancing the weight of the collapsed glider on his shoulder he edged slowly up the rungs a pity to survive night flights over saint georges channel only to crack my skull falling from a ladder the door seemed flimsy of dry crumbling wood held together by rivets and steel bands but there were many deceptive things about this tower conor had spent many hours working on the structure almost exclusively on the inside no need to advertise the renovations a steel door lay behind the wooden one housed in a reinforced frame conor threaded a key though the lock and let himself in he sighed in almost unconscious relief as he locked the door behind him home alive the inside was far more salubrious than the exterior suggested on the first storey was a fully equipped laboratory for the study of aeronautics with more advanced machinery than would be found in many a royal college charts were nailed to the walls the theories and diagrams of da vinci cayley the marquis de bacqueville models of gliders to various scales hung from the ceiling beams tyres tubes wings engines oil drums timber planks frames and reams of fabric were stacked neatly around the walls baskets of reeds ball bearings magnets rivets and screws lay neatly in wooden bowls on the long bench on a steamwinch platform to the roof sat rifles revolvers swords two smallcalibre cannon and a pyramid of cannonballs victor was preparing for a battle he knew bonvilain wanted him dead a corsican tower at mortella point had once withstood bombardment from two british warships for almost two days with the loss of only three men the british had copied the design and misspelled the name changing mortella to martello if bonvilain wished to gain entry to victors laboratory he would have to pay dearly for the privilege it had not been difficult to locate the tower victor had told him about on the last day of his life there were two martello towers in the vicinity of kilmore and one had been occupied for the past fifty years that left the gloomily named forlorn point the tower had originally been called simply saltee watch but the men of the garrison stationed there had soon taken to calling the tower after the headland it stood on a name more in tune with the unrelenting winds and typical leaden weather of the region than the almost cheerysounding saltee watch so forlorn point it became made somewhat notorious by the folk singer tam riordan in his lament of forlorn point which began tis off i am to forlorn point for my sins the second line was no jollier and if theres a tide i aim to throw myself in it was said that the tower was haunted by the ghosts of thirtyseven men who were burned alive inside its walls when the armoury caught fire no wonder it slid to dereliction that is until victor vigny decided that it would make an ideal workshop and persuaded king nicholas to fund the project the frenchman purchased the tower in his own name to hide nicholass involvement then had a series of shipments sent there from london new york and even china the materials had been winched to the roof and then humped downstairs to the laboratory floor and there they had lain for two years undisturbed by the drunken local caretaker until conor arrived to find a key waiting for him in the talons of the pillars stone eagle conor was not worried about the ghosts indeed he was thankful for the legend as it kept the superstitious locals away once in a while a lad would bring his girl as far as the tower wall so they could touch the clammy stones then run away squealing but besides those minor intrusions he was left alone he was civil in the village but did not invite friendship he bought his supplies paid with coin and went on his way the locals were not sure what to make of the pale blond young man living at forlorn point he walks like a fighter some said always ready to draw that sabre of his handsome but fierce concluded the women one girl disagreed not fierce she said haunted the innkeeper had chuckled well if its haunted mister handsomebutfierce wants hes in the right place conors living quarters were underneath the laboratory at ground level but he did not spend much time down there as the gloomy enclosure reminded him of his cell on little saltee victor had equipped it luxuriously with fourposter bed bureau and chaise longue there was even a toilet plumbed down to the ocean but when the lights went out and the walls juddered with every wave crash conor was transported back to little saltee each morning he was woken by the booming cannon shot from the prison and one night he found himself almost unconsciously scratching some calculations into the wall with a sharp stone it was difficult enough living in such proximity to home he decided without recreating his prison cell here on the mainland and so he slept on the roof or rather what had been the roof but was now an extra level victors pièce de résistance martello towers were constructed with completely flat roofs that could bear the weight of two cannon and the men to operate them victor had used this strength and flatness as a base for a powerful wind tunnel driven by four steampowered fans for years they had been forced to study the effects of wind over wing surfaces using a whirling arm device but now lift drag and relative air velocity could be accurately measured using the most powerful wind tunnel in the world the device was unsophisticated but effective twenty feet long and twentyfive feet square powered by a steam injection system that was capable of producing a flow velocity of sixty miles per hour with this tunnel conor had learned that many of his prison designs were flawed and that many more showed promise four of his gliders made it past the model stage and he was convinced that his enginepowered aeroplane would fly too when he put it together there was another use for the wind tunnel conor used it to augment his launch from the tower roof he would hitch himself up spread his wings then duck obliquely into the wind stream to be propelled into the sky as though shot from a cannon you are taking risks victor would have undoubtedly said leapfrogging over several steps in the scientific process and your records are vague and often coded what manner of scientist are you i am no more a scientist conor would have replied i am an airborne thief that morning he sat on the roof back resting against the wind tunnels planking swaddled in a woollen blanket and eating from a can of beef the rising sun cast a golden glow over the distant saltee islands as though they were some kind of magical place mystical islands he thought of his parents and of isabella then in a fit of irritation sent his fork sparking across the stone roof and tramped down the stairs to the lower level i will sleep below and be reminded of my cell i need strength of purpose two days later conor had finished repairing the windtunnel planks and made the trip to kilmore he fancied a cooked meal and to hear the voices of others even if they were not addressing him it had come as something of a shock to him when he realized that his loneliness had intensified since escaping from prison it was necessary for him to seek out the company of men for the sake of his own sanity it was market day in kilmore and so the quay was lined with stalls and for every stall a dozen beggars there was great excitement over a humongous steam engine painted green and red which rumbled on metal wheels along the seafront belching out great puffs of acrid smoke a penny a ride conor had a quick look at the engine but quickly saw that there was nothing for him to learn here this engine was twenty years old a fairground workhorse not at all the scientific marvel its owner claimed it to be he stepped inside the wooden house found himself a corner table and called for a bowl of stew life was being lived in front of his eyes he could see it and hear it and smell it the scratch of elbows on tables the knocking of wonky chairs sunlight through the pipe smoke yet there was a distance between him and the world all he could feel was an intense irritation towards people in general everything upset him the sound of chewing the slurp of porter the nasal whine of a drunkards breathing he could make allowances for nothing i have forgotten how to be human i am a beast then conors mood was lightened by music drifting through the tavern window a gentle violin that rolled itself out like a fine carpet playing overhead riding the stale air and pipe smoke it seemed to cut through the fog surrounding conors heart warming it with its melody i know that music thought conor i have heard it before somewhere but where the landlord arrived with his stew a rich soup of beef and pork with vegetable chunks floating on the surface generally i move the beggars on young man he remarked but this blind fella the way he plays reminds me of my childhood in the stables wonderful years he wiped a tear away with a tattooed knuckle onions in the stew he blubbered then moved on conor worked on the stew savouring its flavours and textures enjoying the strangely familiar music i will throw a shilling to the musician as i leave he decided what is that tune the more conor listened the more the puzzle vexed him and then suddenly everything became clear i have heard this music and i have read it this blind fella the landlord said conor dropped a brimming spoon halfway to his open mouth rose from his chair as though in a daze and barged his way through the fairday crowd outside the sudden sunlight blinded him after the taverns smoky gloom follow the music he ran on like a rat in thrall to the piper of hamelin to the side of the wooden house a small throng had gathered swaying as one to a gentle adagio a tall blackgarbed figure at the crowds centre led the sway with the tip of his violin bow lulling the listeners conor stopped in his tracks completely flabbergasted he could not decide whether to laugh aloud or weep eventually settling on a hybrid of the two the musician was of course linus wynter so billtoe did not lie you actually were released they sat at conors table in the tavern enjoying a glass of porter after their stew linus wynters gangly limbs were too long for the furniture and he was forced to straighten his legs to fit them under the table his crossed feet poked out the other end released i was he said fiddling with pipe and tobacco pouch though i fully expected to be released if you see what i mean nicholas had signed the order before he died and it took a few days to reach the island and as marshall bonvilain had not expressly forbidden it out i slipped free as a bird he rasped a match along the tabletop and played the flame over the pipe i doubt you slipped out so easily not quite confirmed conor wynter smiled smoke leaking from between his teeth i was playing in dublin in a nice alehouse then i began to hear rumours of a baker flying up to the moon on a balloon it was a butcher and he never got anywhere near the moon believe me so i thought to myself all victor ever talked about was balloons and young conor was his student coincidence i think not so i began taking the train from westland row to wexford once a week or so hoping you would show yourself i was beginning to think you hadnt survived i almost did not it is a miracle that i sit here today linus patted his violin you remember the soldiers return how could i forget i committed large sections to memory ah you found my notes i used the space for my own diagrams did you know that the coral was luminous linus tapped his temple no blind dont you know dashed inconvenient in the area of luminous coral and such it gave me comfort to trace the notes with my fingers helped me to remember there was also the danger that i would die in that place and my music would be lost forever well linus your notes shone it was something to see my notes always shine boy a pity the rest of the world doesnt see it wynter took a deep drag on his pipe now to business do you have a plan or would you like to hear mine a plan to do what wynters puzzlement showed in the lines between his ruined eyes why to ruin bonvilain naturally he has robbed us of everything and continues to destroy lives we have a responsibility i have a responsibility to myself said conor harshly my plan is to collect all the diamonds buried on little saltee then begin a new life in america wynter straightened his back hells bells boy bonvilain killed your king he killed our friend the incomparable victor vigny he has torn your family apart taken your sweetheart from you and your answer to this is to run away conors face was stony i know what has happened mister wynter i know something of the real world now too all i can hope for is to leave this continent alive and even that is unlikely but to attack a kingdom alone would be lunacy but you are not alone of course the boy and the blind man will attack bonvilain together this is not an operetta linus good people get shot and die i have seen it happen conors voice was loud and attracting attention bonvilain was not a name to be bandied about even on the mainland it was said that informers took the marshalls coin in every country from ireland to china i have seen it happen too said wynter in hushed tones but lately i have not seen it and have had to imagine it instead which is far worse conor had imagined death many times in prison and not just his own he had imagined what bonvilain would do to his family if they ever found out the truth of nicholass murder if i fight he will kill my parents he will do it in the blink of an eye and it will cost him not a moments sleep do you believe that your father would thank you for making him the marshalls puppet my father thinks that i had a hand in the kings murder he denounced me for it all the more reason to tell him the truth no i am done i love my father and hate him too all i can do is leave and your mother persisted linus wynter and the queen conor felt his melancholia return linus please let us enjoy our reunion i know that we were only cellmates for a few days but i see you as my only friend in the world it is nice to have a friend so let us avoid this topic for the moment dont you want to clear your name conor persisted linus how can you let your father live with the idea that you have murdered his king the idea would eat declan broekhart from the inside conor knew but he couldnt see a solution of course i want to prove myself innocent of course i want to expose bonvilain but how can i do these things without endangering my family we can find a way two brains together i will think about it said conor that will have to be good enough for now linus raised his palms in surrender good enough wynter turned his face towards the window feeling the sun on his face can you spy a clock conor i cant read the sun from in here i need to return to wexford for the train forget the train linus wynter you are coming home with me wynter stood his hat brushing the ceiling beam i was so hoping you would say that i do hope the beds are comfortable i stayed in the savoy once you know did i ever tell you conor took his elbow leading him towards the door yes you told me do you still dream of the water closets i do sighed linus will we have privacy in this house we must have privacy if i am to hatch my schemes all the privacy in the world just you and i and a small company of soldiers soldiers well their ghosts linus plucked his violin strings in imitation of a musichall suspense theme ghosts indeed he drawled it seems mister finn that once again we are destined to share interesting accommodation chapter heads together linus quickly settled into his new digs and conor was happy to have him usually his thoughts stayed inside his head so it was a relief to let them out they sat on the roof together and while conor tinkered with the skeleton of his latest flying machine linus worked on his compositions a lute here i think linus would say do you think a lute too pastoral too vulgar and conor would reply i have two main problems engine weight and propeller efficiency everything else works i have proven that i think i really think that this new petrol engine i have built will do the trick so linus would nod and say yes you are right too vulgar a piccolo i think boy and conor would continue my engine needs to supply me with ten horsepower at least without shaking the aeroplane to pieces i need to build a housing that will absorb the vibration perhaps a willow basket so youre saying a lute youre right the piccolo simply does not command the same respect you see conor would say chiselling his latest propeller there is no problem we cannot solve if we put our heads together we need to bump skulls as victor used to say they were reasonably happy days the spectre of marshall bonvilain watched over them from the islands but both man and youth felt a sense of camaraderie that they had not known in years of course they argued most notably when conor set the steam fans whirling in preparation for his second flight linus wynter climbed the ladder from his bedchamber shouting over the steam engines noise hells bells boy what do you need engines for at this time of night and so conor told him and the musician almost fainted you are going to hurl yourself into a windstorm so you can fly into a prison why dont you write that sentence down and read it then perhaps you would realize how insane you are conor settled his goggles i have to do this linus that island owes me five more bags and i leave we leave for america you have to hurl yourself into space for greed for science i can understand barely thats what nick and victor dedicated their lives to its more than greed its right linus barked a bitter laugh right it would be right for you to rescue your parents and your queen from the madman who has deceived them this gave conor pause linus was speaking the truth his loved ones were in danger and he had no idea how to save them without dooming them all and if he were honest with himself he dreaded seeing that look of pure hatred in his fathers eyes theres nothing i can do he said finally nothing except take my diamonds linus raised his arms like a preacher all of this all of it for diamonds its beneath you conor ratcheted up his wings ducking into the wind stream everything is beneath me he said but his words were snatched away as he was into the night sky great saltee billtoe and pike were in the fulmar bay tavern spending their evening off over a bucket of halfprice slops as was their custom pike followed a long swallow with a belch that shook his stool thems good slops he commented smacking is lips im getting wine beer brandy and a hint of carbolic soap if im not mistaken pike was rarely mistaken when it came to slops for it was all he ever drank even though with battering ram money in his pocket he could afford actual beer rather than whatever ran off the bar into the slops tray what do you say mister billtoe you tasting soap goes down easy but doesnt stay in long eh billtoe was not in the mood for tavern chatter he wanted nothing more than to drink himself into oblivion but he was mightily afraid that when he reached oblivion the french devil would be waiting there for him since that night on little saltee one week ago arthur billtoe had not been his usual cruel and cheerful self he felt the presence of the flying demon looming over him waiting to bring down his blade then there was the small matter of marshall bonvilains dead prisoner billtoe lived each waking moment struggling with his panic the effort was such that he had developed a shiver ive been meaning to ask you mister billtoe said pike if theres something wrong with you you aint been taking the usual care with your ruffled shirts and theyre your pride and joy you been shaking a lot and mumbling too and thats plague right there or maybe yellow jack though i never heard of that this far north billtoes mood was darkened by the realization that pike the hairless simpleton was his only friend he never had much use for friends before now when you had as many dark secrets as arthur billtoe the last thing you needed was friends to wheedle them out of you but tonight he was on the brink of utter despair and he needed words of comfort that came out of an actual mouth and not just the imaginary voice of his favourite slipper to which he talked occasionally pikey can i ask you something of course you can mister billtoe i would appreciate nothing with numbers or directions though cos they give me blinders billtoe took a deep shaky breath do you believe in the devil wardens the devil if you ask me i mean why cant the convicts eat each other two birds with one stone right there convicts get fed and we dont have to bury the dead ones no snapped billtoe not the warden the man himself old horned head he turned on his barstool to face pike his face was gaunt and his eyes were wide and redrimmed and the ruffles of his pirate shirt did seem wilted ive seen him pikey ive seen him with his wings and flaming eyes he landed on the island last week coming for me he was called me monsewer the devil called my name pikey he called my name billtoe buried his face in his forearms and soon his back shook with sobbing pike licked his palm then smoothed back his one strand of hair he had seen the devil too except it wasnt your actual devil it was a man with wings strapped to his back pike saw them taken off and folded up it was a shame to see arthur all broke up with his devil talk but information like this was worth money which pike himself could collect as soon as the rams sent their man for a parley then again if anyone knows how to make real money out of a situation its arthur billtoe and wont he just love me when i take away his devil pike wrestled his sketchpad from the pocket it was bent into opened it to the sketches he had scratched at sebber bridge and slid the book across the bar i seen him too mister billtoe your devil billtoes bleary eyes peeked out from over his sleeves for a moment he didnt understand what he was seeing then he recognized the figure that pike had drawn and if pike had seen the devil too then arthur billtoe was not losing his mind his eyes assumed their usual piggy cunning and one hand scuttled out crablike to grab the notepad thats him aint it mister billtoe said pike only he aint no devil hes a man like you and me except taller and better made than us you being stumpy and me being well me but thats him ill bet aint it mister billtoe billtoe straightened shrugging off his mood like a dog shaking water from its coat call me arthur pikey my friend he said pike smiled a gaptoothed smile he was familiar with that look in billtoes beadies it was the same look he got just before he searched a prisoner billtoe could smell guineas an offshore breeze blew constant and the moon was a silver shilling behind a veil of clouds the perfect evening for clandestine flying conor finn felt almost contented as he dipped the gliders nose swooping in to land on sebber bridge his control of the craft was much improved and there was no greater impact on his heels than if he had jumped from a low wall the propeller bands were still fully wound as fortune had steered him clear of stalls there was also the heartening fact that he had recovered three bags of battering ram diamonds from the salsa beds on little saltee without a sniff of a prison guard he had worried that billtoe might have swallowed a bottle or two of courage and come looking for his devil with a few cronies but there had been neither sight nor smell of arthur billtoe i scared that rat for now but he wont stay scared long one more trip and i shall have all seven pouches why do you need all seven was a question that linus might have asked and now conor asked himself i need seven as compensation for my imprisonment it is a matter of honour this was the argument that had sustained him in prison he would do what billtoe could not take his diamonds off the island but now this plan seemed flawed why expose himself to danger time and time again when he should already be on the steamer to new york it was true that otto had been promised half of the diamonds but even if he paid off the malarkeys in full he would still have more than enough diamonds to buy him a passage to america and a new life when he got there i do not wish to leave he realized but i must staying was of no benefit to him or his family seven pouches then america the skiff was beached high on the shale with a single set of tracks heading back towards fulmar bay zeb malarkey was keeping his end of the deal and why wouldnt he with half the diamonds in his coffers and more to come conor sat on the boats gunwale unfastening the gliders harness not much flight damage tonight but he would check every rib and panel tomorrow to make sure even the tiniest tear in the wing fabric could unravel an entire panel and drop him from the sky like a plugged pigeon one of the diamond pouches slipped from inside the harness clinking on the shale to conor the sound seemed louder than a gunshot he squatted low in the skiffs shadow then gathered the bag to his chest like a babe scanning the wall for movement there was none but the liquid shimmer of lamplight take care airman one mistake could see you on the ferry back to little saltee he stowed the pouches under the aft bench and laid his collapsed glider gently on the deck then something happened that made him smile conor stood straight raising his palm to feel the breeze the wind has changed i can sail directly to kilmore he slid the skiff along the shale to the lapping waterline still waters and a fair wind good omens conor felt the water raise the skiff and hopped on board the deck shuddering under his weight with one hand he untied the sail shaking it loose of the mast with the other he grasped the extended tiller setting a course wide around the west coast of little saltee home in an hour he thought perhaps linus would play something music is a tonic for the soul conors sail caught the breeze pulling the small skiff across the waves a good boat she skips along he sailed for his new home forcing himself not to look back nothing behind but heartache from high in the rocks arthur billtoe watched the strange airman depart and though a sharp rock pressed into the guards stomach he would not so much as twitch until the man he had believed to be a demon had disappeared completely round the bend of little saltees coastline pike did not have the necessary concentration span for such caution he had relieved himself and was skipping stones into the surf before billtoe joined him at the groove sliced by the skiffs keel in the shale dunno why they call it sebber bridge muttered pike its not a bridge is it just a spit of stones going out into the current it used to be a bridge thousands of years ago said billtoe the words rattling nervously out of him before the sea washed it away went from here to little saltee then from there on to saint patricks bridge on the mainland that airman really turns your backbone soft dont he arthur said pike changing the subject he had a sword at my neck a ruddy big sword none of your fencing nambypamby pinprickers this thing could take the top off an oak tree hes a man though arthur you seen it yourself those wings of his are some sort of kite thats all thats all said billtoe incredulously you idiot dont you realize what we have just witnessed idiot arthur idiot said pike injured i took away your devil didnt i you can sleep again because of my gift idiot seems a bit harsh not harsh enough snapped billtoe who was fast forgetting his fear that man has a flying device have you any idea how much the battering rams would pay for that they could just drop into whatever port they pleased and hang customs a device like that would change smuggling forever pike cleared his throat as it happens i knows a few gents who might have ties to the rams possibly billtoe clamped a hand over pikes mouth as though the gents in question could somehow hear no no we dont involve the rams until we have those wings locked up safe somewhere otherwise those treacherous coves would nab the wings themselves and feed us to the sharks what we want is to get ourselves into a strong bargaining position pike shrugged off billtoes hand which stank of sweat and worse it was clear to him that they were friends no more it was business as usual for arthur billtoe which meant that pike was back to being a lackey to be abused whatever you say arthur thats i know thats mister billtoe to me he turned to the sea skipping one of the stones in his hand across the surface typical arthur billtoe i took away his devil and he forgets it with the first sniff of a payoff i thought it was pikey and billtoe to the end how wrong i was throwing the stones calmed him each successful skip reminding him of his childhood he was reaching back for a big throw when billtoe grabbed his arm then wrestled the stone from his fingers where did you get this he demanded excitement reddening his cheeks pike wondered was this one of those questions that werent really questions and if he answered it would he look stupid its a stone arthur mister billtoe i just picked it up billtoe dropped to his knees scrabbling in the shale until he found half a dozen more stones that pleased him he held them in his cupped palms like a tramp guarding his egg breakfast arthur are you feeling ill would you like me to collect a few more stones for you i saw a nice piece of wood further along billtoe was too happy to be annoyed these are not just stones pikey these are rough diamonds thats why our airman was stopping off on little saltee hes a diamond smuggler he rubbed his hands together clinking the diamonds like voodoo bones are you trying to tell the future with those things joked pike the naked greed in billtoes eyes making him nervous i know the future said billtoe we round up a few of the boys we ambush this airman sell his wings and steal his diamonds what about the airman we let him go free i suppose billtoe elbowed him goodnaturedly nice one pikey let him go free no we kill him cut him into little pieces and then burn the pieces as far as the world is concerned this airman never existed pike swallowed all this talk of blood made him nervous he resolved there and then never to invent anything useful or billtoe might orchestrate a gruesome end for him too chapter home there was almost perfect peace as conor sailed the skiff northnortheast between the jackeen and murrock rocks in the saltee straits these rocks spent most of their lives submerged but sometimes a trough dipped low exposing their flattened peaks when the fiveyearold conor had first seen these gnarled oblong shapes one evening on the patrol boat with his father he was convinced they were crocodiles and would not be calm until declan agreed to fire a warning shot sure enough the crack of gunfire did the trick and the two crocodiles sank below the waters this little story had become one for the fireside and it was dusted off whenever a friend visited for brandy or lemonade it had always made conor scowl but now it near drove him to tears i cannot endure this they are too close his mothers face seemed to hover before him calling him home and he could ignore her no longer no doubt she suffered as much as he did perhaps more he needed to know if i could just see them look on their faces once more before i leave to make sure they endure conor nudged the tiller with his knee and tightened the sail for a southwest tack he was going home from a distance saltee harbour seemed much as conor remembered it a grand tiara points shining silver and orange inside the pincers of the sea walls it was clear that some of the tiaras lustre had faded over the past few years sea slime crawled along the granite and the dock was clogged with haphazardly berthed boats trussed together like tangled tops the new outerwall project had been abandoned and the halfbuilt structure trailed off into the sea like an eroded sand fort the planned beacon tower was only half built and stood askew a crumbling reminder of a past era rather than the proud symbol of a new one king nicholass loss was being keenly felt even here on the waterfront conor knotted the skiffs stern line to a mussel boat and tossed the anchor into the half tide it fizzed bubbled then sank quickly bearing with it three securely fastened satchels of diamonds conor skipped across the prows of half a dozen bobbing fishing boats before hauling himself to the quayside flagstones with the aid of a brass hitching ring he strolled nonchalantly along the quay flicking his eyes upwards to the wall guards whatever else grew slack and haphazard declan broekhart would not allow his sharpshooters to lower their standards four guards stood atop the wall their wind capes fluttering around them conor saw the glint of a barrel and he knew that at the first sign of belligerence a warning shot would kick up sparks and slivers at his feet at the second sign he would be dead before his body hit the water he moved slow and easy with both hands in plain sight the quayside walkway curled the length of the outer wall to a cobbled market area which would be bustling with stalls during the day merchants innkeepers and housewives converged on the market each morning to fill their baskets with mackerel cod pollock mussels lobster crab crayfish and salmon boats arrived empty from kilmore and left full or vice versa depending on which crew had the run of the waters that day by evening the air was tangy with smells of turning fish and salt scrubbers pumped water from the harbour hosing the blood and guts into the sea most young lads on the saltees had done their time as scrubbers armed with stout bristled brushes and the energy of youth they scrubbed the grime from the flagstones only for them to be splattered crimson once more the following day conor walked beneath the wall arch past a customs booth anything asked the guard conor raised his empty palms just a raging thirst sir and a rendezvous with my sweetheart the guard smiled ah the beer and bessies two good reasons to visit the saltees its not your first time inside the wall then ahead on the hill the palace turrets poked into the night blotting out patches of stars no sir ive been here before as a boy conor had not spent every minute lost in his studies hed passed his share of time up to his armpits in mud and seaweed hed climbed cliffs built dams and on occasion stolen eggs from the puffins that waddled along the flat rocks like clockwork toys these manly endeavours sometimes caused him to miss his curfew and when this happened conor would spy through the windows of the broekhart apartments to see whether or not his father was home or even what kind of mood his parents were in he occupied the same spot now straddling a gargoyle drain ten feet off the ground across the square from the broekhart house water from the salt spray trickled from the gargoyles mouth painting white streaks on its twisted stone lips even climbing the wall brought pangs of longing for home my feet find the footholds in the stone i climb this wall as though i had done it only yesterday the broekhart home was quiet and dark but for a single candle in the kitchen window there was no sign of his parents it is late i suppose conor was greatly disappointed but relieved too the knot of nerves in his stomach was tighter now than it had been during his balloon flight from prison he knew that if he had seen his parents in abject misery it would have been almost impossible not to venture inside and reveal the truth they hate me now mother and father both but it is a false hate manufactured underneath there will still be love inside the broekhart dwelling a shadow drifted into the kitchen conor felt his pulse throb in his forehead perhaps my mother cannot sleep nightmares haunt her as they do me it was his mother catherine broekhart drifted past the window her hair sleep dishevelled her eyes were half closed and both hands waved the air until her eyes adjusted to the sudden light mother oh mother the simple sight of her tore down the barriers conor had erected round his heart it was time to end bonvilains cruel charade the consequences were on the marshalls head not conors he shifted his weight to dismount the gargoyle then froze his father had entered the kitchen and he was not alone there was a child in his arms tousled toddler lower lip jutted with bad temper a child my brother his father was not the broken man he imagined declan broekhart wore a familiar smile as he coddled the little boy wrapping him in the sleeve of his robe he spoke and through the open window conor recognized his tone even if he couldnt quite make out the words my father is happy catherine poured a mug of water for the little boy and they fussed over him together sitting by the fireplace while he had his drink gradually the childs temper softened as the memory of his nightmare was replaced by the sight of two loving parents outside on the gargoyle conor felt scalped as though the final remnants of conor broekhart had been cut away a child a brother things were not as he had imagined them it seemed as though he was the only one suffering his parents had rediscovered happiness with their new son the cold of the stone gargoyle spread through his thighs creeping up into his chest salty spray fell in sheets over the wall drenching his jacket the chill soaking through to his shoulders they have a good life thought conor they are happy again conor knew that he could not reveal himself or the truth bonvilain would kill them without a seconds hesitation it would be my fault conor turned his face away from the window and swung himself down from the gargoyle i am conor finn he told himself taking quick determined steps towards the harbour the airman flies one more time two bags of diamonds and then america forlorn point linus wynter was busy when conor reached the tower he had completely rearranged the sleeping chamber to his personal preference there was hot chocolate on the stove along with a pot of bacon and potatoes and he was stitching a seam on the sleeve of his dress coat its the middle of the night said conor climbing through the elevated door linus tapped his temple its always night for me boy i sleep when i am tired conor peered down into the cellar why do you bother to move the furniture we leave in a few days i told you this in a few days your precious flying machine is not finished when conor was not patching the wings on his glider he spent every minute constructing the aeroplane he had designed in prison complete with petrol engine and retractable landing gear it is almost complete anyway if needs be i can ship it to america were not tethered to one another said linus laying the needle against his finger to find the ripped seam maybe ill stay behind and save your family myself my family dont need saving they live in a palace with a new son this gave linus pause he listened for conors breathing then walked carefully towards him feeling for his shoulders you are so tall he said surprised victor said you would be long bones frenchy always said so you have yourself a little brother that is wonderful news wouldnt you like to meet him before you leave conor felt tears film across his eyes i i of course that is what i would like but what would it mean for the child my you can say it said linus he is your brother what would it mean for my brother blurted conor bonvilain would murder him if my father challenges the marshall he will kill them all linus seemed to glare down at conor as though he could see through the silk scarf tied across his eyes and what of isabella i hear talk in the village she has already repealed taxes and abolished import duty she is becoming a true queen how do you think bonvilain will respond to that conor wiped his eyes she is the queen she has people to protect her she loved me she said and yet she believed that i helped to kill her father thats not what i hear there is talk of conor broekhart in the village too he was a hero they say he died trying to protect the king conor snorted the official story bonvilain said that my part in the murder would be covered up to spare my family that was his gift to the broekharts and you are certain that isabella was included in this deception this was a startling thought what if isabella had not known imagine if she believed her young suitor to have perished that night dont think about it it is too painful and it makes not a jot of difference conor sat at his workbench clenching both fists before his own face please linus stop i cant bear to explore possibilities my connection with the broekharts is severed i cannot be responsible bonvilain is too big i am conor finn the name finn bonvilains gift to you conor felt as though his forehead were collapsing crushing his brain love family happiness they were luxuries life was the prize stay alive and keep your family alive i am alive i will stay alive linus barked a short laugh stay alive which is why you hurl yourself daily from a tower i made a promise to otto malarkey so you would kill yourself for diamonds but not for family or honour i think victor would be much disappointed in his student conor surged to his feet do not lecture me old man you are not my father exactly right boy said linus softly the anger draining from his face i am not your father conor turned his back without another word gathered the collapsed glider under his arm and climbed the ladder to the roof chapter snakes in the grass conor and linus barely spoke the following day apart from a few grunted greetings the american purposefully bashed himself against the furniture a few times hoping to squeeze some concern from conor but without result either conor didnt hear the groaning or he was ignoring it his heart may have been hardened by little saltee thought wynter but it was petrified by the sight of his little brother night came with little change in mood but when conor primed the engine for the wind tunnel linus felt he had to speak you cannot fly tonight conor the wind is wrong conor did not turn round you are not my father remember and the wind is not wrong it is a few degrees more to the south than i would like but i can manoeuvre around it and the moon there should be a harvest moon tonight conor buttoned his black jacket scanning the panorama before him there was barely a cloud in the sky a glowing moon was reflected in dancing sections on the oceans surface as clear a night as he had ever seen its overcast he said brusquely positioning himself below the glider which hung from a gantry overhead lower the glider would you linus familiar now with the rooftop layout counted the steps to a winch bolted to the wall ready conor raised his arms ready to thread through the harness lower away five cranks of the handle i know the same as yesterday will i bother with dinner yes sorry about last night i was in no mood for eating nothing fresh mind i will reheat last nights fare the hot chocolate too i regretted walking out on that the roof is cold linus smiled sometimes a tantrum is expensive the glider settled on to his back and conor buckled the harness across his chest and drew the straps up between his legs he reached down curling his fingers around the harness winch handle like a gunfighter checking the butt of his pistol i wound the propellers said linus conor twanged one of the bands good and tight nicely done i have a heightened sense of tautness quipped wynter locking the winch cant you wait conor the wind is wrong i can smell the salt conor buttoned the flying jacket to his chin then fixed his goggles once disguised his entire demeanour changed he stood taller and felt capable of more violence no more a boy i cannot wait linus not another night i will have my diamonds and be done with this life america awaits we can open a business together i will fly my gliders and you can test the tautness of things wynters smile was tinged with sadness i am not ready to return home just yet boy nicholas brought me here to do a job and i intend to see it through at the risk of sounding melodramatic i shall not rest while bonvilain flourishes he took the best men i have known away from me tonight i fear he may take another conor drew his sabre balancing it on one wrist to test its weight do not fear for me linus fear for anyone who stands in my way this night he sheathed the sword then checked the load in both revolvers oh and would you turn off the wind tunnel before you go to bed conor ducked into the wind tunnel and was blasted into the night linus heard him go in a whoosh of air creak of wood and trailing whoop come back alive boy he thought you are their only hope and then perhaps i will make dinner from scratch some of my famous grits perhaps an airman deserves to eat well fresh hot chocolate too conor held his breath while the tunnel blast filled his wings and propelled him towards the stars that first moment of tumult and force was as confusing as ever he could not tell sea from sky stars from their reflections the air pummelled his torso with ghostly fists until the glider aligned itself with the winds direction then came the moment of pure flight when the wind lifted him his glider creaked and took the strain and he was propelled bodily further from earth a moment of happiness nothing to do but be at peace conor found that he relished this brief stretch more each time he flew it was a calm before the storm he knew and yet while he flew with the wind at his back he could forget his troubles they were as earthbound as most humans rising thermals lifted him to an altitude higher than he had ever flown the land spread out below him like a living map he could see white tops stretching in lazy meanders for miles along the coast like contour lines on a map several small boats bobbed gently on the silver black sea fishermen taking advantage of the night tide and calm waters conor thought he heard a chorus of halloos from one boat had he been seen it didnt matter after this night the mysterious airman would fly no more the next time he took to the air would be as a free american citizen with papers to prove it thanks to zeb malarkey he would ship the flying machine in parts to be assembled in nebraska or wyoming or maybe california whichever was furthest from the saltee islands conor moved hand over fist across the steering bar turning the glider in a wide arc time to concentrate on his work or he would overshoot little saltee two more salsa beds two more bags then otto could buy his freedom and there would be plenty left for a secure life in america great saltee billtoe and pike lay behind the ridge above sebber bridge a series of sootblackened blades arranged in the long grass around them that cleaver is my special favourite said pike fondly does for any sort of flesh fish fowl or human it will put a fair fracture in a bone too it will billtoe begged to differ your common cleaver is clumsy you gotter swing yer arm too high plenty of time for me to nip in and tickle a lung with this beauty he dinged a long and deadly ice pick with his nail i favours my beloved sabre name of mary ann said a husky irish voice behind them quiet you dolt hissed billtoe the airman could be here any moment you was talking said the man wounded i was whispering corrected billtoe and then to pike why did you bring this scatterfool i could only shave three men from the prison guard said pike and you said it would take the halfdozen to knobble the airman so i picked rosy up in the pub he hasnt had more than a quart of ale billtoe was not pleased you saw the airman he was a six footer at the very least and armed to the gills we need sharp eyes and quick hands to take him not drunken red nosed paddies rosy snorted you is a paddy yerself arthur and i can chop down any man you point me at lets face it this airman of yours hes no more real than the banshee hes just one of those yokeybobs aint he billtoe chewed his bottom lip causing his chin stubble to quiver a yokeybob you know in yer brain a phantom cos of you in that barrel you told him pikey said billtoe reproachfully you told me yourself in the tavern laughed rosy you told anyone who would listen all about the devil and poor little billtoe in the barrel there aint no airman im only here for the five shillings payment why all the blades anywise one bullet would do the trick we need the blades you beerbrained beetroot face fumed billtoe because a gunshot would have the wall guard on us like flies on a cow biscuit and that would lose us any bounty our airman might be carrying if there was an airman billtoe wrapped his fingers around the hilt well rosy if there aint an airman why dont you tell that there fellow in the sky above you that hes just a yokeybob sprung from my brain rosy glanced up fully expecting to see nothing but stars what he did see had him pawing the grass for his beloved sabre god preserve us he breathed crossing himself with his weaponless hand a man with wings yokeybob my eye snorted billtoe then talked no more as his teeth were clenched on a dagger blade conor had succeeded in unearthing the final pouches but they had cost him dearly the silver moonbeams lit his wings like chinese lanterns a guard had seen him glide over little saltees outer wall and being one of the few stout chaps on the island had decided to chase what he took for an albatross he stalked his prey to the salsa beds where he realized his mistake and put a round through one of the gliders wings just as the strange airman bent low to retrieve some kind of pouch only a slight nervous shake to the guards hand spared conor a bullet in the brain gourd the shot split a stone at conors feet throwing up a shard that scored a lightning flash on the left lens of his goggles he reacted quickly ditching the glider with two yanks on the harness belts then spinning towards his attacker pistols drawn yield or die monsieur he called cocking the revolvers the guard could not decide whether he wished to yield or die or something in between yielding was not something he was comfortable with but neither did he relish a midnight battle with a flying frenchy those fellows were dangerous enough without wings as his grandfather had learned at waterloo by the time he had considered his options and thought to cock his firearm the blackclad airman was upon him leaping from rock to stone with the speed of a cat the guard would later swear and growling too like a hungry wolf a catdog frenchy twirling guns and with blades clanking on his thighs bonsoir monsieur said the airman then clocked the surprised guard on the crown conor was examining his glider almost before the guard fell the upper port section had been punctured but there were no rips radiating from the hole and the heat of the bullet had sealed the edges well enough it would hold to sebber bridge if he could get himself into the air conor threaded his arms through the straps then rolled both shoulders into the harness cinched it tight and ran for the nearest stairwell his wingtips scraped the walls on both sides and he chided himself for not binding them in leather the stairwell funnelled wind from above and it rattled his wings pushing him down but conor struggled against it forcing his way head first to the top step the gunshot had woken every guard in the billet and they converged on the stairwell in ragged formation clutching at rifles and trousers shaking dreams from their heads the sight of conor had half of them convinced that they still slept one loosed a shot but it was wild and high the rest stared stupidly mindless of each other until they tangled and fell in a bundle conor took advantage of the confusion to mount the parapet and leap into the sky catching as much air as he could a wind he prayed one tiny draught jupiter heard his prayer and sent a gift an uplifting breath that filled his wings and threw him high above the heads of the watching guards they scowled and screamed and stared in silence two thought to aim their weapons but the one who might have hit the target was accidentally shot by the other who pulled his trigger too early in the blink of a crows eye the airman had disappeared into the night swallowed by black like a stone sinking in the night sea for a long moment nobody on the wall uttered a syllable then they began to jabber furiously each man telling his own version of what he had seen even the wounded man gabbed with the rest mindless of the blood pooling at his foot this was a story they would tell many times and it needed to be made solid now wrap words around the bone before daylight made the whole thing seem unlikely it was an airman they decided the airman hadnt there been a whisper of something like this on great saltee we saw the airman seven feet tall with fiery circular eyes the story was started the word was spreading word spreading is not what a man wants when he is a smuggler and a thief conor rode the fair wind to great saltee heart pounding in his chest his blood was up and he knew that was dangerous a man takes risks when the battle fever controls him victor had once told him i have seen too many clever men die stupidly be calm calm there was not time for calm the air grew suddenly choppy and conor was forced to wrestle with his craft simply to stay aloft great saltee loomed below him as though the earth had revolved to meet him conor pointed the nose down holding it there against the tug of air resistance wind pulled at his goggles and poked fingers through the bullet hole in his wing on a night like this one conor could almost believe that men were not supposed to fly he came down at a sharp angle too fast and too steep i will be lucky if my ankles survive this he thought gritting his teeth against the impact though his vision was impaired by a cracked lens and whirling elements conor saw the skiff on sebber bridge and he also spotted the men lying in wait for him behind the ridge snakes in the grass he thought without a shred of fear utterly ready for a fight he shifted left on the steering bar in order to come down in their midst may as well have a soft landing rosy was attempting to run when conor crashed into him driving both boots into the mans shoulders he heard something snap and the man rolled howling down the rocky slope the rest jumped to their feet and ranged about him in a ragged circle none attacked sizing up their opponent these men cannot understand the principles of my rig thought conor therefore i am a ghost or a creature that will not last long soon enough they will see for themselves that my wings are fabric and my chest heaves with exertion then they will shoot me dead or perhaps not no guns were drawn yet though there were plenty of blades of course there will be no gunplay here the reports would bring the wall watch down on us and these brigands are not here to arrest me one of the five remaining men stepped forward a pace brandishing an ice pick gibbus de dymon he said then removed the dagger from his mouth and spat i said give us the diamonds airman diamonds the dropped pouch he had left a trail billtoe growled conor his voice coarsened by deep hatred the prison guard quailed who are you why me personally i never wronged no parlayvoo billtoe will be first to fall thought conor at least i will have that his hands flashed to twin scabbards at his hips drawing two battle sabres en garde he said and lunged forward a breeze caught the glider elongating his stride and billtoe who had thought himself at a safe distance was suddenly face to face with the airman he tried a move employed in a dozen bar fights a sly dig with his ice pick only to find the weapon batted aside shame on you monsieur said the airman bringing a kitchen tool to a sword fight conor slashed down and out his blade biting deep into billtoes thigh the guard squealed and grabbed the wound he was no longer a threat both hands would be employed trying to keep the blood inside his leg even now i do not wish to kill him conor realized there is only one man i could kill he heard a rustling behind him as two men advanced they are too cautious the strange uniform scares them a fortuitous breeze snapped his wings and conor added to its force by leaping directly upwards the two men passed below and the airman descended on them with boots and blades both were soon dispatched neither dead but certainly nursing a reluctance to participate in moonlight ambushes two men left one was quaking and the other circling warily biding his time watching for weakness it was pike and he did not seem inclined to retreat you go ahead matey he said propelling his comrade towards conor the unfortunate man had barely time to squeak before conor knocked him senseless with a casual blow from the sabres guard jus you and me airman said pike sporting a careless grin he studied conor took in the stance and the muscle and the weapons dangling from fist and belt to hell with this he said reaching for his pistol ill take my chances with the wall watch conor drew faster exchanging the sword in his right hand for a revolver the guards can hear my shot or none monsieur the choice is yours pike was already committed to his action so conor buzzed a shot past his ear to regain his attention the guard fell temporarily deafened to his knees gun tumbling from his fingers a warning shot the next one will put a hole in you it was useless to speak pike could not hear and combed the grass with his fingers till he found his weapon drop that pistol said conor i have the advantage over you but pike could not or would not hear and lifted the barrel his intention clear conor shot him in the shoulder the copperjacketed slug bowling the guard diagonally over the ridge screeching like a barn owl gunshot and screeching and at night too noises certain to attract the attention of the wall watch conor jumped over the ridge squatting behind it on the wall above three lights were extinguished this was protocol at the first sign of disturbance the guards plunged themselves into darkness to avoid becoming targets next half a dozen flares came arcing over the wall painting the bay with harsh red light it was time to leave quickly now before the flares dipped low enough to light the skiff conor collapsed his wings and ran doubled over to the small boat there was no time for careful folding of the glider and several of the crafts ribs snapped as he shoved it under the seat no matter wooden ribs by the stack in the tower my own ribs are more difficult to replace should they be splintered by gunshot he pushed hard into the gunwale scraping the keel across the stone and sand until the water took its weight shouts behind him now as guards poured from a fortified gateway hurrying along the coast path some on horseback the baying of hunting dogs echoed across the flat sea dogs the watch wasted no time leashing their hounds conor leaped into the skiff his momentum pushing it to sea and safety he tugged the mast from its bracket laying it flat across the planks less of a profile from shore cold water splashed over the prow spattering his face and he was glad of it he could hear his heartbeat in his ears like great hollow drums in the distance i wish to be a scientist doing injury holds no pleasure for me not even billtoe did you not enjoy that cut conor ignored the question he would deal with the workings of his mind on another day you will be a scientist again in america a new life new inventions home friends and perhaps another girl who does not remind you of isabella conor turned his mind to rowing he could not even contemplate girls without a vision of isabella blooming in his mind so the ocean conor felt confident that he was safe now the robust little craft bore him away on the current the skiff had served him well already great saltee was little more than a dark wedged hump receding billtoe had called him airman that will be a shortlived title the glider lay on the planks its wings folded awkwardly like those of a broken bird no matter it is over now the mysterious airman will fly no more the martello tower was visible on the irish coastline a lantern burning in an upstairs window a beacon to guide him home conor smiled linus has forgiven me he thought and then i hope there is hot chocolate chapter tangled web two hours later arthur billtoe sat on a fruit box in marshall bonvilains office trying to hold the flaps of his wound together his trousers were soaked and small gouts of blood pumped between his fingers in time with his heartbeat marshall bonvilain entered the room and the gouts pumped faster sorry about the fruit box arthur said hugo bonvilain sitting behind his desk but the brocade on my chairs is worth more to me than your life you understand oof course marshall stammered billtoe i am bleeding sir it is quite serious i think bonvilain waved this information away yes we will come to that later for now i wish to talk about this creature he took a notepad from his desk drawer and spun it across the desk towards billtoe it was pikes notebook open to a dynamic sketch of the airman they are calling him the airman and he can fly apparently in cases like this billtoe had learned that it was always best to plead ignorance we was taking a walk and he sprung himself on us amazed i am hmm so it was all a coincidence you just happened to be at sebber bridge making yourselves a target for the wall watch when this airman descended from the heavens billtoe nodded eagerly thats it exactly you have gone straight to the nub of the matter as usual and did mister pike do his sketching before or after he was shot i dont see how he could have done it at either time bonvilain leaned forward his bulk casting a shadow on billtoe could it be that you are lying to me arthur billtoe blood pulsed between the guards fingers no sir marshall never bonvilain sighed obviously enjoying his game of cat and mouse you are weaving yourself a tangled web i think its best if i tell you what i think youve been up to and then when i am finished speaking you colour in any details i might have missed how about that arthur billtoe nodded as if he really had a say in proceedings so firstly theres you giving me ideas for flying and salsa beds then there are reports of a flying man digging up things in the salsa beds things which pike tells me are diamonds pike is raving objected billtoe bullet fever bonvilain raised a finger no time for lies arthur youre bleeding remember and i have not finished speaking sorry mumbled billtoe now you are far too ignorant and shortsighted to have thought up this diamond scheme yourself exactly said billtoe relieved ignorant and shortsighted thats me so you must have been manipulated by whoever supplied these ideas now i know of only one person on little saltee with a fascination for flying and here bonvilains easy manner was replaced by cold hard danger be careful what you say here billtoe because if your answer displeases me you will not live long enough to die of that leg wound were these ideas conor broekharts who asked billtoe genuine confusion writ large on his features finn conor finn whatever blood was left in billtoes face drained from it he had always known this moment would come only one card left to play yes marshall he said shamefacedly he sold his ideas for blankets and such it seemed a harmless deception bonvilain grunted until he escaped on that coronation balloon with your help ill warrant no sir said billtoe squeezing the flaps of his wound together finn is locked up in the mad wing just as you ordered no escaping for conor finn billtoe paused guiltily though he may look a tad different than he did last time you saw him the years have been hard on the poor lad what with the bell work and the beatings that you ordered i wouldnt be surprised if you didnt even recognize young conor finn bonvilain laced his fingers squeezing them until the tips were white then rolling the knuckles along his forehead he knew what had happened of course he knew it was his own fault conor broekhart should have been tossed out of the window years ago not kept alive on the off chance he would be needed to control his father what tangled webs we weave bonvilain admitted to himself that he had liked the idea of having a witness to his genius how much more agonizing must conor broekharts imprisonment have been knowing his father believed him to be a murderer the marshall smiled tightly no it had been a good plan incredible circumstances had scuppered it an airman if you please how could a man prepare for eventualities that had not yet been invented conor broekhart may be a genius but hugo bonvilain was ingenious this situation was a test of his mettle it would involve some quick thinking but already the germ of a new plan was sprouting roots in the marshalls mind there would be murder involved but that was not really an issue except it could very well be murder at a high level and when indulging in such murders one must seem completely blameless european royal families did not approve of commoners disposing of their monarchs and royal disapproval generally took the form of approaching warships and annexation hugo bonvilain did not intend to share his diamonds or his seat of power with anybody especially not with isabellas close friend queen victoria of the british empire the bonvilains had been striving for too many centuries to reach the very position that he was in now for him to pack his satchel at the first sign of worthy opposition bonvilain remembered the night his father died he had been raving from the leprosy that he had picked up on a pilgrimage to jerusalem and much of what he had said was gibberish but there were moments when his eyes were as clear as they had ever been we have been pruning hed said to the young bonvilain do you know what im saying to you hugo for centuries we have been pruning the trudeaus they breed like rabbits god blast them but we have set the crown on the right head keeping the saltee islands independent you must finish the job you are the last in the line of servants and the first in a line of bonvilain masters promise me hugo promise me and the dying man had clutched at his sons forearm with bandaged hands i promise bonvilain had said unable to look at the wasted remains of his fathers face it occurred to bonvilain that he had been rocking in his seat knuckles to forehead for several moments now which may appear strange he leaned back tugging straight the redcrossed white templar stole over his navy suit thats my thinking position arthur any objections no marshall not a one glad to hear it anything else you care to tell me about our airman billtoe fished inside his head for some pertinence that the marshall would appreciate um erm oh he speaks french calls a body mishyoor bonvilain slammed the desk with both fists bouncing his writing set into the air french that clinched it he had in a moment of miscalculation revealed his francophobia to conor broekhart it seemed as though the boy had a sense of humour best to dispose of him as soon as possible the last thing he needed was a vindictive airman flying around stealing his diamonds and undermining his plans so arthur you maintain that conor finn languishes in his cell billtoe swallowed hard his adams apple bobbing apart from the languishing bit which i am not certain on yes he is in his cell good i would like to speak to him what now yes now does this pose a problem for you no there is no problem billtoes features were drawn with pain and desperation except that im bleeding marshall quite badly this wound needs closing or i might not survive the ferry to the prison bonvilain glanced at the fireplace flames crackled orange and blue in the hearth and a model broadsword used as a poker hung from a hook by the coal scuttle youre right arthur he said brightly it is time to seal that wound bonvilain boarded the ferry with captain sultan arif his most trusted officer billtoe cowered in the stern every now and then poking at the scar of fused flesh on his thigh seeming surprised each time the contact caused him pain he passed out during the short trip and each time woke up blubbering like a babe and blurting the word barrel bonvilain found that he was not in the least anxious now that he had considered the nights developments in fact he felt invigorated by the challenge of maintaining his position or even improving it after all conor broekhart was a youth with a kite hugo bonvilain was a military strategist with an army behind him apparently young conor was reluctant to commit murder whereas bonvilain regarded murder as a timehonoured and valid political tool the marshall leaned close to sultan arifs ear there may be some poisoning later ready your potions sultan nodded casually toying with his splendid moustache yes marshall may i ask who we may be poisoning myself i regret to say replied sir hugo sultan seemed unsurprised there will be others i take it oh yes bonvilain confirmed his gaze distant there will be others little saltee there was a prisoner in conor finns cell but it was not conor finn and who pray tell is this asked bonvilain pointing to the terrified wretch huddled in the corner away from the lamplight billtoe knew he was rumbled dont kill me your worship he begged dropping to his knees and grabbing the hem of bonvilains templar stole please spare me i dont know how the blighter escaped one minute he was there the next gone some form of magic perhaps he ypnotized me bonvilain did not kick him off immediately enjoying the grovelling what i dont know yet arthur is if you were actually finns accomplice you helped him escape and you were his smuggling contact oh no sir marshall gibbered billtoe i never done no colluding i dont have the depth of thought for that im not so sure this substitute scheme of yours might have worked with any other prisoner you were unfortunate to lose this particular one thats all it was sir bad blasted luck not an ounce of cooperation with the prisoner in it bonvilain decided a display of anger was called for after all sultan was watching you lied to me billtoe he shouted his voice echoing in the tiny cell you stole my diamonds the marshall whipped his stole from billtoes fingers then delivered a mighty kick which sent the guard tumbling over the bed and into the wall behind a muck plate cracked and fell billtoe lay in a heap like a spilled sack of laundry well struck marshall said sultan on the point of the chin he rolled like a cartwheel should i finish him off no replied bonvilain something more poetic i think perhaps our friend arthur needs some time to reflect on his shortcomings he was distracted by a strange glow from the rear of the cell billtoes forehead had knocked some mud from the wall and strange ghostly scribblings shone behind curious bonvilain stepped closer bending to examine the markings coral i imagine he mused old wandering heck would have loved this but the markings were manmade diagrams and equations someone had tried to cover up these markings with mud but the mud had not bonded completely with the damp surface below a glider was plainly visible on the wall bonvilain tapped it with a gloved finger hello airman he whispered it seems i provided you with your laboratory he drew a pistol from his belt rapping the wall with its grip another plate of mud cracked and fell revealing that the glider had been launched from the roof of a tower and you have left me your location and more valuable secrets i shouldnt wonder on the floor billtoe moaned am i to be executed now sir is that my fate not at the present time said bonvilain stretching i have use for you arthur billtoe your immediate fate is to clean the dirt from these walls then transcribe every mark you find underneath oh thank you sir said billtoe tears of relief dripping from his nose i shall have one of the inmates get to it immediately top of my list you misunderstand arthur said bonvilain catching the guards lapels in his fist wrenching the very coat from his back tumbling billtoe further to the back of the cell you will not be supervising this task as prison guard you will be performing it as inmate bonvilain turned to the young man who had occupied the cell for almost a year what is your name boy claude deville montgomery yer majesty answered the youth promptly though me nears n dears call me spog bonvilain blinked life never failed to surprise old billtoe there said to answer conor finn if anyone specially yerself ever got around to asking but that was only if he didnt get around to pulling me tongue out and as you can see spog opened his mouth wide to reveal two teeth and a grey tongue thank you eh spog tell me has mister billtoe been unkind to you spogs whole face frowned blinkin nasty the evil scut with the hitting and spitting pulling hair too which is hardly gentlemanly is it now well then now is your chance for revenge said bonvilain tossing him the guards jacket you are now the prison guard and he is the prisoner do unto him and so forth his life is yours and yours his spog greeted this announcement with complete calm as though his fortunes were reversed every day im yer man yer highness he said approximating a salute whatre yer views on torturin them what used to be guards i am all for it said bonvilain it builds character spog smiled his teeth like gateposts in his mouth ill make you proud yer worship the marshall winced lets stick with marshall shall we yessir yer worship billtoes senses were swirling around in his head like spirits in a witchs cauldron but still he managed to get the gist of what had transpired im im an inmate now he gasped hauling himself on to the bed bonvilain patted spogs shoulder handle your prisoner mister montgomery he said i dont deal directly with criminals spogs eyes glowed with vengeful malice yessir yer worship my pleasure you might want to avert yer eyes bonvilain folded his arms perhaps but not right away billtoe backed away from his new gaoler deeper and deeper into the cell till his elbows knocked mud from the walls revealing blocks of diagrams and calculations the corals green glow traced the dawning horror on arthur billtoes face the misery he had visited on so many others was now to be his bonvilain winked at sultan as i said poetic forlorn point due to the nights activity not one fight but two conor got no more than an hours sleep and that sleep was filled with dreams of prison guards with blades for hands and diamonds for eyes there was something else though leaping up and down in the background seeking attention a small memory of conor and his father rowing across fulmar bay when he was nine watch the oars blade declan broekhart had said see how it cuts the water you want to scoop the water not slide through it then in the dream declan said something that he had never said in real life the same theory applies to the blades of a propeller that might get your aeroplane off the ground conor sat up in bed instantly awake what was it what had he been thinking already the dream was fragmenting the oar something about the oars how could an oar help to fly an aeroplane it was obvious really the oar had a blade just like the propeller see how it cuts the water of course the oar was not bashed flat into the water it was presented at an angle to reduce drag and maximize thrust the same ancient principle must be applied to the propeller after all the propeller was really a rotating wing when the aeroplane eventually flew the propeller would have to absorb the engines power and overcome the flying machines drag it must be treated like a wing and shaped accordingly flat propellers are of no use thought conor hurriedly pulling on his clothes they must be angled and the blades shaped to provide lift by the time linus negotiated the stairs with bacon soda bread and hot coffee conor was chiselling the second blade on his new propeller ah said linus a new propeller this pronouncement stopped conor in midmotion you are blind are you not how can you possibly know what im doing linus laid the breakfast tray on a bench i have mystical powers boy and also youve been talking to yourself this past hour lift drag propulsion all that interesting stuff we blind folk aint necessarily deaf you know the scientist in conor wished to continue to work but the ravenous young man dragged him away from his precious propeller to the delicious breakfast linus listened to him tuck in with a cooks satisfaction i picked up the bread fresh in the village the folk down there are all afrenzy over stories about this airman creature apparently he slew twenty men on the island last night i hear hes ten feet tall said conor around a mouthful of bread linus sat beside him at the bench this is no joke conor you are in danger now no need to fret linus the airmans short career is over no more night flying for me from this day on scientific flights only linus stole a strip of bacon perhaps you might think of finding yourself a girl you are of an age you know conor could not help but think of isabella once there was a girl or could have been i will think of females again when we reach america when you reach america i plan to stay here and conspire against bonvilain there are others who think like i do you mean it realized conor sadly i had hoped you would change your mind no i lost friends we both did conor had no desire to rake over the coals of this familiar argument very well he said pushing away his plate the tower is yours and there will be abundant funds too but i am going in america there are airmen like me eager for the sky i see and when will you go i had planned to leave today but now i am impatient to test this new propeller she is a thing of beauty dont you think linus wynter tapped the velvet sleep mask that he now wore over his ruined eyes ill take your word for it i had this mask sent from the savoy did i ever tell you that i once stayed there let us make a bargain said conor today i transport my aeroplane to curracloe beach it will take two days to assemble and another to test when i return we will ship my equipment to new york and go by ferry and train to london we will live like kings for one week in the savoy with no talk of revolution or science then review our situation that is a tempting offer admitted linus some of the suites have pianos my fingers twitch at the thought let us agree then one week for ourselves then back into the world separately perhaps but i pray that we will be together i pray for that too then we are agreed the savoy linus extended a hand the savoy they shook on it bonvilain and sultan came ashore incognito faces shadowed by broadrimmed toquilla hats their saltee uniforms lent them no authority on the mainland and they were unlikely to attract attention dressed in civilian clothes local rowdies are far less likely to trouble dangerouslooking strangers than they are soldiers off their patch in fact some of the kilmore lads knocked huge sport from taunting saltee army boys who were under strict orders not to retaliate bonvilain and sultan were restrained by no such orders they made no overtly hostile gestures and were the very definition of gentility but still the local harbour boys got the impression that to trifle with this odd pair would lead to immediate and lasting discomfort they strolled down the quayside and into the smoky depths of the wooden house i have visited taverns all over the world confided hugo bonvilain ducking under the lintel and they all have one thing in common drunks said sultan arif toppling a sleeping sailor from his path that too information for sale is the common factor i had in mind that wretch for example the marshall pointed to a solitary man elbows on the bar staring at an empty glass a prime candidate he would sell his soul for another drink he sidled up beside the man and called to the innkeeper for a bottle of whiskey do i know you asked the innkeeper no you dont replied bonvilain cheerfully and i recommend you keep it that way now leave the bottle and make yourself busy elsewhere most good innkeepers develop an instinct about their customers and their capabilities the proprietor was no exception he would ask no more questions but he would check the load in his shotgun just in case the oddly familiar broadbeamed customer and his grinning companion unleashed the trouble that they were surely capable of bonvilain opened the bottle turning to the solitary glassgazing man now good sir you look like a gent that could use a drink i certainly hope so because i have no intention of imbibing one drop of this ripe spirit which by the smell of it has already been passed through the stomachs of several cats the man pushed his glass along the bar with one finger ill do you a favour and take it off your hands very noble of you friend said bonvilain filling the glass to the rim we aint friends said the man grumpy in spite of his sudden good fortune not yet half a bottle later they were friends and bonvilain steered the conversation as though the man had a rudder fixed to the back of his head stupid gas lamps said the man whats wrong with candles a candle never ruptured and exploded i hear a gas explosion destroyed an entire city in china cept for the cats what are immune to gas bonvilain nodded sympathetically gas dreadful stuff and as for foreigners buying our buildings stupid foreigners blurted the man vehemently buying our buildings with the big smug heads on them do you know the english own one hundred per cent of the big houses around here if not more and dont they just love living in towers lording it over the rest of us that they do agreed the nowsozzled man we got us a right scatterfool at forlorn point takes on a blind musician to cook and clean for him bonvilain was extremely interested in this scatterfool a boy like that shouldnt even own a tower he prompted more whiskey was slopped into the glass no blast it no he shouldnt boy like that should be out cutting hay like the rest of us at that age but what does he do buys reams of material sends off for all sorts of mechanical parts whats he building up there who knows like doctor frankenstein he is whatever hes doing the noise coming out of that tower at night is enough to waken a dead pig the man downed his drink in one its harshness shocking his system from stomach to eyeballs and dont tell me lobsters arent getting smarter i caught a lobster last month and i swear he was trying to communicate with the clicking claws and the pointy head yokes the landlord rapped the bar with a knuckle you can shut up now ern theyve gone dont matter said ern clutching the bottle protectively to his chest i dont like fellows with hats anyways never trust a hatter the landlord was tactful enough not to point out that ern himself sported a jaunty cap it took mere minutes for bonvilain and sultan arif to find forlorn point the old british army marker stone by the roadside helped quite a bit the place is well named noted arif placing his shoulder satchel on a tree stump from inside he selected twin revolvers and a selection of knives which he arranged on his belt i presume we are not sending for help as is occasionally the case sultan you are correct said bonvilain this is a martello tower we could have a battleship off the coast and still not gain entry we proceed cautiously diplomacy first then guile and finally violence should it become necessary they stepped over the ruined remains of the wall and across the yard careful not to snag their boots on treacherous creepers that snaked from the rocky soil it doesnt look much said sultan picking moss from the tower wall bonvilain nodded i know clever isnt it a quick circuit of the tower confirmed that there was indeed only one doorway above head height and plugged with a wooden door ill wager that door is not as flimsy as it looks muttered bonvilain sultan placed his cheek against the wall the stones vibrate from a generator marshall he noted i can hear classical music it sounds as though there is an entire orchestra in there a phonograph said bonvilain sourly how very modern conor broekhart always liked his toys so how do we get in throw stones at the doorway this is the airmans tower thought bonvilain he enters and leaves from the roof i throw stones he said to his captain you always had a good arm for stone throwing what can i do you can search in that bag of yours and see if you brought your crossbow sultans eyes glittered no need to search i always bring my crossbow linus wynter was enjoying beethovens ode to joy while he fried up some traditional southern grits on the pan his secret ingredient was cayenne pepper of course conors limited galley did not have any pepper so he was forced to use a pinch of curry powder instead it may not be quite up to his normal culinary standards but it was unlikely that conor would complain after two years of little saltee food at any rate conor had left for curracloe beach not more than five minutes previously and by the time he returned the grits would be no more than a distant memory that phonograph was a scientific wonder conor had explained how an orchestra could be transferred to a wax cylinder but in all honesty linus hadnt made much of an effort to understand the sound was scratchy and the cylinder had to be changed every few minutes but it was sweet music all the same in spite of the crackling music and the sizzling grits linus heard the muffled voices outside at first he assumed it was the local lads poking about but then he heard the word marshall and his mild curiosity turned to a ball of dread in his stomach bonvilain had found them wynter had never been much of a marksman but all the same he felt a little comforted once his thin fingers closed round the stock of the repeater rifle concealed beneath the worktop just let bonvilain open his mouth and i will do my utmost to close it forever seconds later a rock thumped against the door followed in quick succession by three more the last ringing against a steel band i thought as much said a voice a reinforced door linus checked the breech with his thumb then shouldered his way along the wall to a gun port loaded and ready say something else marshall bonvilain did conor broekhart why dont you come down so i can finally kill you may as well be blunt linus sent six shots winging towards the voice perhaps god will favour the virtuous he thought as the gunshots echoed around the towers curved walls and the discharge smoke sent his windpipe into spasms so called bonvilain conor is not at home and the blind servant pulls the trigger just so you know blind man you just grievously wounded the pillar i was sheltering behind or perhaps the devil looks after his own linus concluded covering his nose and mouth with a wet cloth from the sink i must warn conor he must not be taken i will fire the emergency flares conor was worried about linus alone in the tower in spite of the fact that the american had survived wars and prison for fifty years without his help and so he had rigged a series of emergency flares to the roof the fuses trailed down to various spots throughout the tower and were capped with sulphur sleeves it was only necessary to yank off the sleeve to light the fuse the fuses were linked so if one sparked they all sparked the nearest fuse was in what they jokingly referred to as the lounge a collection of chairs clustered around the fireplace which linus was using as a gin still fifteen steps from the rifle slot to the lounge one step down a bench by the wall nothing i dont pass by a hundred times a day linus coughed the last of the rifle smoke from his lungs and began his short walk carefully what a shame it would be to come unstuck from a twisted ankle there was plenty of time bonvilain would be reluctant to enter through the front door as there could be any number of guns pointed at that target walk slowly but surely linus was thrown into turmoil by a series of gunshots each one clanging against the door setting the metal ringing like a bell wynter dropped to all fours puzzled has the marshall grown stupid the door is reinforced he said it himself why shoot at it the answer was obvious and occurred to linus almost immediately he is not trying to kill me he is trying to distract me the marshall is not alone something cold sharp and metallic pressed against linuss neck you left the roof door open old man said a voice in heavily accented english linus knew immediately who it was sultan arif bonvilains deadly second in command you of all people should know continued sultan that sometimes trouble comes from above the fuse i must ignite it linus made a lunge for the lounge suffering the blade at his neck to gouge deeply but there was no escaping sultan arif the captain grabbed him as though he were a struggling pup and hoisted him to his feet keep your bearings know where you are it was a difficult task with such distractions to his senses there was pain in his neck and wet blood down his back the gunshot echo had not yet faded and sultan swung him around linus was utterly disorientated concentrate where are you in the end sultan made it easy for him lets go down and meet our master shall we he said pushing linus across the room wynter heard the door bolts scrape back and the gush of cool air against his face i am in the doorway he thought fingers questing for the frame sultans voice was loud by his ear i have him marshall he called the blind man is alone there is a rope ladder here i shall tie it off dont be so tiresome sultan throw him down said bonvilain nothing is more amusing than watching a blind man fall sultan sighed this was a task without honour but honour was not a quality greatly prized by the marshall relax old man tight bones are broken bones the leather in his coat creaked as he bent his arm to push linus waited for the right moment and as sultan propelled him into space he screamed loudly enough to mask the sound of a sulphur sleeve being ripped from a fuse running along the doorframe linus cried as he regained consciousness for as his head had struck the earth he had seen something a flash of light just for a moment now all was dark again his breathing was restricted by the weight of a boot on his chest i remember you said bonvilain you played piano for the king very clever a blind spy well old boy your pianoplaying days are over your spying days too come to think of it damn you hugo bonvilain rasped linus valiantly there is a special pit in hell reserved for your ilk the marshall laughed i have no doubt of it which is why i intend to delay my departure from this life as long as possible your departure however is imminent unless you answer my questions promptly linuss own laugh was bitter just kill me bonvilain your prison couldnt break me and neither can you do you know i think youre right i believe that you would resist me with your final breath i shall never understand you principled people sultan has a few principles but he can ignore their berating voices when the situation calls for it i dont really need you at any rate broekhart will be back and i will be waiting simple as that perhaps not so simple said linus at that moment the linked fuses sent half a dozen flares rocketing into the sky they exploded pink and red their light reflected on the bellies of dark clouds bonvilain watched their slow descent with catty dismay warning flares how this young broekhart wriggles i swear sometimes it seems i have been trying to bury him for his entire life help is on the way gasped linus the fire brigade will be called bonvilain thought briefly knocking his knuckles on his forehead then called to sultan fetch me pen and paper from the tower i will nail a special invitation to this mans head i am not eager to murder a blind man marshall said sultan calmly we have talked about this captain hissed bonvilain in the tone of a parent who does not wish his children to hear in your soldiering days you had no such morals that was war they were soldiers this is a blind old man fetch me the pen insisted bonvilain i did not unfurl the ladder unfurl unfurl are you william shakespeare now fire another bolt then climb up another rope sultan nodded towards the village that will take several minutes i do not believe there is time bonvilain scowled petulantly this is really too much sultan i fervently hope this old man is the one who puts a knife between your ribs i will lean over your dying body just to say i told you so sultan bowed low to show his continued loyalty too late for bowing now my good man i am very disappointed in you my apologies marshall yes of course apologies how useful at least do me the kindness of tying this spy to the pillar of course marshall linus was hoisted upright and thrust roughly against the gate pillar bands of rope crossed his legs and torso cinching tight enough to burn sultans footsteps circled round making him dizzy dizziness without sight darned unfair but at least it seemed he was to live though with bonvilain involved there would definitely be a condition very well blind man said the marshalls voice to his left low and mocking you have earned yourself a reprieve deliver this message to the airman tell him that i am hosting a gathering tomorrow night a small dinner to celebrate the life of conor broekhart which i find amusingly ironic it will be the third anniversary of his death family and friends only wine will be served for a special toast a potent vintage very potent it will seem as though the rebels have managed to infiltrate the kitchen tragic linus did not have the breath for insults be sure to tell conor that i am going to all this trouble because of him continued bonvilain fingers digging into linuss shoulder if he had remained where i left him then none of this would be necessary but because he escaped and then stole from me his brother becomes an orphan you know perhaps i will make the infant my ward raise him as my own a little marshall bonvilain chuckled enjoying his own twisted sense of humour how the people would love me noble bonvilain adopts another mans child linus managed a short sentence no one loves you bonvilain youre right said the marshall and you would think that might bother me but no i seem to find all the fulfilment i need in material wealth sultan moved bowing into bonvilains line of sight marshall those flares could attract attention bonvilain was disappointed no doubt the villagers would come to investigate the flares no more time for gloating a pity he enjoyed it so and there were all too few occasions ah well poisoning the queen and the broekharts was something to look forward to and with any luck conor would throw himself into the pot too and even if he did not bonvilain would soon be prime minister and nothing anyone said would be able to change that time for one last word with the blind man i suppose the irish will untie you he said but even so do not run away remain here and deliver my message or your master will not have the chance to kill himself attempting to foil my plans bonvilain slapped linus hard across the cheek after that spend the rest of your life wondering when i will kill you as we know you will not see me coming linus kept his lip stiff and his frown in place but he was breathing hard through his nose and had the ropes not held him he would surely have collapsed i hate myself for feeling this terror i have seen war and plague i have lived in darkness with the everpresent fear of pain but terror never before until now damn you marshall he sobbed defiantly the devil take you but he knew by the hollowness of the air and the drift of his voice that he was alone bonvilain had gone to make preparations for his celebration i should be happy conor finn thought my plan has succeeded and i am a scientist again with funds to continue my experiments far into the future i should be at least content but he could not escape the knowledge that this was not his life he was skirting the borders of it as though banned from entering and somewhere just beyond his reach another true life was waiting further away will be better how can i start again when every time i raise my eyes i see the saltees on the horizon conor was steering his horse and cart down the coast road to wexford and from there to curracloe beach five miles on the other side it was already noon as it had taken longer than expected to winch the wings down the side of the tower he would have to sleep on the beach for an extra night perhaps two depending on conditions the journey too would take longer than expected they had travelled less than a mile from kilmore and already the horse tired from such a load wings engine tail body and of course his new propeller it was a heavy burden for an old horse he would see about trading the beast in on the wexford docks he thought of linus and laughed aloud my mind compares linus to an old beast he would not be happy to hear that with linus wynter on his mind he glanced over his shoulder to check for flares as he had a dozen times already on this trip as if linus needs me as if linus needs a the flares were up all of them it seemed pirouetting to earth leaving pink trails like the spokes of a ghostly umbrella linus was in trouble it must have something to do with last nights encounter it could not be coincidence conor pulled the cart off the road driving it deep into a wooden copse the horse complained shying away from low branches but conor drove her on wedging the cart tight between two trunks the trees shook raining pine needles down on man and horse in seconds conor had unhitched the horse and was urging her back along the coast road with this animal there were two choices he could run her short and fast or slow and long conor chose fast something told him that long would be too late conor arrived at the tower to find his only friend tied to the pillar his face and neck rent with contusions his first thought was dead i have lost him again but then the old man coughed linus he said taking the americans weight youre alive wynter seemed surprised conor i didnt hear a horse she collapsed outside the village her heart i imagine he quickly sliced through the rope sliding his friend down along the pillar you wont die today said conor conducting a quick check for broken bones but theres not a piece of skin on you that isnt bruised your blood is blue youll be delighted to know i always suspected you were royalty listen to me conor said linus his throat raw and ropeburned it was bonvilain conor actually fell backwards to the grass the marshall himself here him and his bloodhound arif i left the roof door open to clear the cooking fumes stupid old man they only left because they thought the villagers would come to investigate the flares i couldve told them that youve been firing up flares and god knows what for weeks now and the locals are bored rigid watching them i couldve told them that but i didnt what did he say conor demanded tell me linus linus sighed deeply his face scarred by pain and sadness he knows you are the airman conor he plans to murder your family isabella too poison most likely at a dinner tomorrow night a dinner for conor broekhart conor squatted on the grass dumbstruck by these tidings it was the worst possible turn of events he plans to murder your family what can i do what can be done linus read his mind you must forget america now conor it is time for action i know of course but what must i do asked conor its a puzzle replied linus bonvilain knows you are coming exactly when and where they will be watching sea and sky waiting for the airman i could surrender myself blurted conor desperation large on his features then the marshall would have no need to kill anyone his secrets would be safe linus disagreed vehemently no its too late for that conor bonvilain doesnt know who you have spoken to or what army you may have gathered with your stolen diamonds but why does he tell me about the dinner to torment me to ensnare you corrected linus all of his enemies die in one night and the airman is their murderer blaming you for murder is a triedandtrusted method for hugo bonvilain conor sat still as a statue staring at the stones as though they would yield up the solution to his terrible dilemma a breeze funnelled through his fingers and sunshine warmed his crown but what could these normal things mean to him would a normal life ever be his conor said wynter crawling forward one hand reaching ahead patting the air conor are you all right conor made no sound but shallow breathing and linus realized that he would have to take charge we must leave the tower he said attempting to sound brisk and businesslike we load what we can on to the cart and leave here tonight even if bonvilain sends soldiers to hunt for you they may not know to look for conor finn there was a rustle of grass and cloth as conor climbed to his feet if linus could have seen his young friends eyes he would have been struck by the sudden determination burning there conor finn said the airman conor finn is dead my name is conor broekhart and i need to speak to my father chapter heavier than air it was clear to conor that there was only one way to end this nightmare he must expose the marshall as a murderer running away was no longer an option now that bonvilain was threatening his loved ones confronting the marshall would at least give the broekharts and the monarchy a fighting chance to survive that is how my father would wish it he may hate me but surely the truth will change that conor knew now that he should have made himself known that night on great saltee when he had seen his young brother but his parents had seemed so happy without him so safe to embrace him as part of the family would have put them all in danger false reasoning weak logic making contact now would be close to impossible bonvilain was expecting him and would have every man on the wall with orders to shoot on sight as often as possible they knew he travelled by glider and boat and so would be expecting those crafts but there may be a third option conor purchased a fresh horse in the village for an exorbitant amount and rode it hard back to where he had hastily concealed the laden cart not a moment too soon as there were half a dozen local boys perched atop the tarpaulin picking at the ropes like curious monkeys conor considered hunting the lads off but decided to employ them instead each boy was offered the staggering sum of a rough diamond for his strength and silence needless to say the offers were accepted as a single stone was worth a year of a grown mans wages even with the help of his new apprentices it took sweaty hours of heaves and grunts to free the cart from within the tree trunks and almost as long to back it on to the road now buckos conor said to his troops once the horse was hitched and ready hot chocolate for all if we make it to saint patricks bridge before dark the boys put their shoulders to the cart with gusto hot chocolate diamonds and mysterious cargo they felt like princes on a quest saint patricks bridge was a long shingled bar curving from the mainland towards the saltees legend had it that when saint patrick was chasing the devil from ireland he finally managed to trap him in the galtee mountains the devil took two huge bites from the slopes to clear himself a path and off he scarpered into county wexford with saint patrick in hot pursuit hurling rocks and boulders gathered in the fields old nick was forced into the water at kilmore and swam hard for the open sea stones peppering the water around him these stones were to form saint patricks bridge a couple struck the devil on the noggin knocking the chunks of mountain from his gob and into the ocean the smaller became little saltee the larger great saltee conor had never believed these stories putting his faith in coastline erosion and ocean currents but today glancing out to sea at the dark jagged islands it was easy to believe that they were the devils work conor and his crew arrived at the field above saint patricks bridge with an hour of sunlight still left in the day a winding path led down to the bridge itself but it was too treacherous to be negotiated by horse and cart everything would have to be carried conor stood on the cart and issued instructions like a general commanding his troops carry the lot down lay the pieces high on the bridge above the waterline everything was breakable and secret so care and silence were the orders of the day the moment conor stripped back the tarpaulin it became obvious what the secret cargo was wings engine propeller one boy the leader of the small pack stepped forward halfterrified halfincredulous sir would you be the airman what stuck it to those prison guards conor noted the gleam in their eyes the lust for extraordinary adventure i am indeed the airman and i need your help what say you boys the leader mulled it over on behalf of the group well mister airman he said i have a brother on little saltee for life didnt do more than rob a few guineas and perhaps break a few bones so i say lets get to carrying the rest cheered and rushed to the cart eager to be first down the lane i hope their enthusiasm lasts thought conor a long night of work lies ahead boys are fickle creatures and by midnight three had been distracted by hunger or mischief or parents calling them home three stayed though and finished the lugging of aeroplane parts down to saint patricks bridge whether they negotiated with their parents or were there without permission conor did not know and had not time to find out he sent one with a message for linus and a while later the american arrived with food and oil lamps picking his way down the steep path seeming uncertain on his own lanky legs like a beginner on stilts the boys gathered firewood and they lit fires around the workspace where conor laboured among engine parts tubs of grease crank handles springs pistons lengths of unsealed muslin rolls of wire pots of glue stiff brown paper a strange curved propeller and slowly the aeroplane was assembled the boys leader who went by the unlikely name uncle displayed a surprising aptitude for mechanics and was invaluable when it came to fetching tools and even predicting which tools were needed i need a wrench uncle the medium i think probly the small airman of course uncle was proved correct and lit himself a celebratory smoke conor took to explaining his innovations to keep his mind on his work and off his family steam engines are too heavy for aeroplanes to lift a steam engine you need a bigger steam engine so victor my teacher suggested a compressed gas engine or gasoline which is better but still too heavy but then i remembered aluminium isnt that rare like gold it was fifty years ago aluminium was so hard to produce that bars of it were exhibited at fairs but now the bayer process makes it and if not plentiful then it is at least obtainable so my crankcase and water jacket are made completely from aluminium this engine is light enough to lift itself and the aeroplane and it will give me at least ten horsepower in the air you hope said young uncle yes i really do hope and uncle yes airman i hate to say it but you smell rank dont you wash uncle stubbed out his cigarette on a boot heel no airman i follow the egyptians on washing bad for the soul the sun rose on a new day to find the five workers huddled around a brazier sharing a pot of chocolate all were exhausted but none were in a mood to quit by midmorning the little band was back to full strength as the boys who had taken off the night before happily played hookey for a chance to see the airman fly pick any large rocks from the bridge and toss them aside i need a smooth runway this was a simple task and uncle set the slower boys to it pointless asking the dullards to help with mechanics he explained stone clearing is exactly the work for those ones all you need are open eyes and a strong back every ten minutes or so i assures them of their genius conor nodded with exaggerated gravity uncle was proving invaluable while the others cleared the sky road conor bolted on the wings which were constructed from steamcurved ash ribs covered with unsealed muslin the crafts shape was clear now single wing set thirty feet across a long thin body resembling a river punt with the aluminium fourinchbore engine centre mounted behind conors newshaped propeller i aint never seen a propeller like that commented uncle who was apparently an expert on everything howd she go in tests what tests grunted conor tightening the last nut on the propeller linus kept the food and drink coming and when the boys flagged he pulled a tin whistle from his pocket playing a jig or a reel and without knowing it the boys would pick up their pace again the labour consumed the better part of the day but finally the aeroplane was ready sitting on the spit of shale on three wheels like a great sleeping bird it was a marvel and for long minutes the little band was silent simply gazing at the craft absorbing its every curve and strut there was fear too and none of the workers would lay a finger on the material for fear of waking the bird only linus wynter was not awestruck he had conor lead him to the aeroplanes propeller then gave the craft a thorough examination victor would have been proud he said i hope so said conor the theory is as much his as mine which is why i did this conor pulled a strip of paper from the nose and laid linuss hand on what lay beneath the american felt flaky lines of dried paint under his fingers the paint spelled out two words la brosse wynter smiled sadly he would like this that french peacock i declare if my tear ducts were working i would cry he wiped his nose and pulled the lapels of his dinner suit together i should have written something special an aria to speed you on your way theres still time i need at least a hundred feet to take off so i cannot leave until low tide uncle overheard this comment mainly because he was standing at conors elbow listening tell me something airman if you need a hundred feet to take off how many do you need to land it was a pertinent question but not one that conor seemed inclined to answer he turned and strode towards the flat rocks avoiding the enquiring gazes following him its complicated he mumbled technical i still have some calculations to complete and then as though that was the end of the matter anyway where are those ash ribs i have a few repairs to make uncle lit himself another cigarette i know great saltee well enough if airman needs the same to land as he did to take off hes not going to find it on that island anything flat on great saltee has a house on it the only place he could possibly land would be outside the palace gates in promontory square uncle laughed at the lunacy of this notion promontory square imagine if marshall bonvilain were a spider that would be his web which would make airman the fly breathed linus great saltee marshall hugo bonvilain was uncommonly excited after all this day was to be a momentous day not just for him but for every bonvilain who had ever been forced to toady to an idiot king today all their sacrifice would be made righteous hundreds of years it had taken to accomplish the task but finally the bonvilains were about to supplant the trudeaus and so when sultan arif had arrived in bonvilains office that afternoon hed found the marshall almost giddy with anticipation bonvilain stood at the office window clapping his hands rapidly in time to the strauss waltz being played by a lone violinist in the corner sultan cleared his throat for attention ah captain youve come said bonvilain delightedly what a day eh historic and all that i love strauss dont you people take me for a wagner man but i say just because my duties are sometimes gloomy it doesnt mean i have to be no strauss is the man if youve had a trying day i think i shall have an austrian orchestra brought over for my swearing in as prime minister sultan was surprised by this lack of discretion and it showed in his face oh dont worry about him said bonvilain jerking a thumb at the musician poor chap was run over by a horse and carriage a few years ago left him deaf and blind he plays from memory i got him from kaiser wilhelm only arrived this morning its an omen i said to myself how can anything go wrong today sultan began to feel nervous things always went wrong around the marshall usually for other people god willing all will proceed well how can it not asked bonvilain stepping in from the balcony the queen and her loyal supporters will soon be dead there are no heirs and so i will be sworn in as prime minister this broekhart boy this airman will no doubt attempt some form of rescue and then we will have him too and even if he does not come once isabella is gone he will be nothing more than a disgruntled fugitive the marshall sat at his desk smoothing the felt surface with one palm now let us talk about poison sultan arif placed a corked ink bottle on the desk it was halffilled with a pale yellow powder this is wolfsbane from the alps he explained a thimble of this can be mixed with a glass of wine or sprinkled over food several minutes later the victim will experience a strange tingling in the hands followed by chest pain extreme anxiety accelerated heartbeat nausea vomiting and eventually death due to respiratory arrest eventually purred bonvilain i like that he picked up the bottle holding it to the light as if its deadly qualities would become more apparent now sultan you know how vital it is that i appear blameless in all of this i must suffer with the rest and only my strength shall save me it cannot be sham the queens own physician must confirm that i am at deaths door then you must only drink half of your glass said sultan that is half a thimble of wolfsbane you will suffer as wretchedly as the others but without the respiratory arrest bonvilain poured a glass of brandy from a crystal decanter half a thimble you say are you certain you would wager my life on it reluctantly replied sultan i have an idea declared bonvilain tapping a pinch of powder into his glass why not test the measure on the musician he pulled a sad face but you are so fond of blind men and i am eager to hear more of his repertoire sultan felt a bead of sweat run down his back there is no need to test it marshall we have used this method before but not on me i want you to take it that would reassure me but it will take hours to recover protested sultan weakly i am needed today you are needed captain said bonvilain proffering the tumbler and this is what you are needed for but if the airman arrives if the airboy arrives i will deal with him i have been on a few campaigns sultan i do know how to swing a sword i am asking you to drink this captain will you refuse me again sultan felt trapped in this opulent cage the portraits of bonvilain marshalls though the ages glared down at him daring him to disobey i could kill him he thought at least i could try but it was a battle of the mind and sultan had already lost he had been doing the marshalls bidding for years now i have done worse than this much worse sultan arif thought of the damage he had done in the name of the saltees the lives he had ruined the men who suffered in prison still he reached out took the glass and threw the liquid into the back of his own throat bravo cried bonvilain careful with that glass now its crystal sultan plonked the glass on the table and waited for the poison to take effect numbing of the extremities was the first symptom of wolfsbane when his fingers bean to tingle sultan stared at them as though they belonged to a stranger numb he said capital cried bonvilain it begins sultan was all too aware of the misery the coming hours contained he would suffer the pain of the damned and if he was lucky live to forget it play something doleful bonvilain called to the violinist though the man could not hear him the captain needs cheering up an hour later when sultan was clawing at the carpet his lungs aflame each breath like a dagger wound bonvilain squatted before him clicking his fingers for attention now captain he said genially the next time i tell you to kill a blind man you do it understood sultan may have nodded or he may have lapsed into spasm either way bonvilain felt certain that the lesson had been learned saint patricks bridge the time had come to fly sundown and low tide the shale bridge was as smooth as it could ever be and the engine was primed for takeoff there was nothing to hold conor back but his own anxieties he sat on the flat rocks watching the sky for birds do you hear any bats he asked linus who reclined beside him long skinny legs stretching down to the sand bats yes if this is a haunt for bats they could gum up the propeller linus was silent for a long moment no no bats but something is lurking on the ridge i hear shuffling a lot of shuffling conor stood craning his neck backwards for the view the villagers lined the ridge like teeth in a vast mouth more arriving every second to fill the gaps they peered down to catch a squint of the airman all of kilmore is here he groaned what did you expect to give away diamonds build a heavierthanair flying machine on the beach and stay a secret you are the airman come to fight bonvilain he is not a popular man look theyre lighting torches now they have lamps linus tapped his temple i cant look boy blind remember and anyway couldnt you use a few lights my god exclaimed conor of course lights would be most helpful well then invite those good folk to come down after all in a few hours none of this will matter the queen will know the truth bonvilain will be banished and you will once again be sir conor of the saltee islands not necessarily said conor there is an alternative ending linus stood brushing off the seat of his pants not tonight my young friend the planets are aligned the runes have been thrown i found a fourleaf clover in the grass tonight after three years conor broekhart comes back from the dead perhaps said conor but for how long great saltee twoyearold sean broekhart lay in his bed but he was not sleepy i think he has a fever said catherine touching the back of her hand to the young boys forehead perhaps we should stay at home stay home agreed the smiling sean declan stood in the doorway shoulders broad in his dress uniform sean is fine darling he thrives were he any stronger i would enlist him right now if you dont want to go just say the words no need to drag little sean into your schemes catherine straightened a row of medals on her husbands chest i have been saying the words since the invitation arrived its so strange dont you think this sudden desire of the marshalls to celebrate conor declans brow creased a lot had changed in these past weeks he felt more himself than he had in years three years to be exact and while he still felt gratitude for what hugo bonvilain had done for conor and the family he had concerns about the mans methods especially the tight rein he held over little saltee recently his men had begun to tell him horror stories about the prison its not strange its natural hugo feels some guilt too after all his men were supposed to be guarding the king that was always the problem with nicholas he did not want to live his life under guard he was too trusting by far talk to isabella declan she is expecting it you have already spoken to the queen about this catherine took her husbands arm she spoke to me isabella has concerns too she needs an ally that the men will listen to you are the only one who can challenge bonvilain declan did not want this burden the marshall is my superior officer and he has been very good to us i dont wish to wound you declan but your mind has been elsewhere these past years you have been blind to the injustices that grow commonplace on the saltees nicholass dream was to create a utopia for the people that has become isabellas dream too it is not hugo bonvilains he wishes to be prime minister he has always wished it declan admitted the facts like shafts of light through chinks in a heavy curtain i have heard things perhaps i can investigate catherines grip tightened on his arm one more thing perhaps this is not the night to say it but victor vigny a traitor they found letters in his apartment detailing the islands defences my own men were with bonvilain when he found the bodies i know all about the evidence but i knew victor too he saved us remember he saved himself countered declan then gently victor was a spy catherine they are a cold breed we saw of him what he wished us to see there were tears in catherines eyes now just promise me you will stand by isabella whatever she decides to do your first loyalty is to her of course she is my queen very well said catherine drying her eyes now i must ready myself again why dont you tell your son a story put him off to sleep before the nanny arrives little sean seized on the word story daddy he called story story story declan squeezed his wifes hand before she left the room i am here now catherine i will take care of us all including the queen he sat on seans bed and as usual he could not gaze upon one son without thinking of the other but he forced the melancholy look from his features and smiled down at the boy well sean broekhart not feeling sleepy tonight no sleep replied sean belligerently tugging his fathers sleeves with small fingers so small thought declan so fragile i think one of my stories might do the trick which one would you like captain crows army no crow said sean his lip jutting conor tell me conor story seans budder declan was taken aback sean had never asked about conor before and for some reason declan had never anticipated this moment conor story insisted sean pummelling his daddys leg declan sighed very well little one a conor story there are many tales about your brother for he was a special person who did many amazing things in his life but his most famous deed the one for which he earned the gold medal in the cabinet was the rescue of queen isabella of course she wasnt a queen in those days merely a princess princess said sean contentedly on this particular summer afternoon conor and isabella had exhausted the fun to be had tracking an unused chimney to its source and decided to launch a surprise pirate attack on the kings apartment and so declan broekhart told the story of the burning tower and when it was over and the princess saved he kissed his sleeping boy and left the bedchamber with a heart that felt strangely lighter saint patricks bridge this is madness thought conor lunacy there are so many things that can go wrong the engine could prove too weighty in spite of the aluminium casing the propeller has not even been tested in a wind tunnel and could rip the nose apart as easily as propel the craft the untreated muslin was lighter than the treated variety but may not deflect the air currents sufficiently to give lift the steering was rudimentary at best and would allow no more than a twentydegree turn and even that could pull the wings off the wing tips may not provide enough balance for a takeoff so many things saint patricks bridge had become a cathedral of sorts the villagers had made the trek down the steep path for the spectacle and most were crowded into the natural amphitheatre above the shale outcrop they wiggled into comfortable positions opened baskets of food and chatted amicably while they waited the rest lined both sides of saint patricks bridge holding their lanterns aloft lighting a path for the airman more expectations thought conor as if overthrowing a military leader were not enough now i must entertain a village into the bargain he made a final tour of la brosse holding an oil lamp close to the underside of each wing searching for tears smoothing down bumps no more need for delay thats your fourth final inspection if my ears serve me correctly said linus from the shadows go now conor or you will miss the tide yes of course you are right i should leave immediately it must seem silly to everyone all this preparation for such a small journey linus stepped into the lamps glow the light caught him from below casting ghostly shadows along his thin face you are wrong boy this is a momentous journey historic conor buttoned his aeronauts jacket not historic i am afraid there will be no official record no photographs nothing is acknowledged without at the very least a fellow of the royal society every week a new crackpot appears claiming to have flown linus raised his arms high to the watchers like a conductor acknowledging his audience every man woman and child here will remember what is about to happen on this beach for the rest of their lives no matter what the history books say the truth will never die conor strapped on his goggles and hat linus if something happens something unfortunate will you find a safe way to contact my father he must know the truth linus nodded i will find a way boy this old spy has a few tricks up his sleeve but i have faith in you conor climbed the short ladder to the pilots seat positioning himself carefully on the drivers bench something on his jacket clinked against the frame it was the winged a symbol i dont suppose i need this any more said conor unfastening it bonvilain knows exactly who i am he tossed it twinkling over linuss head to the boy known as uncle a keepsake for you so that when people tell you that this never happened at least you will know different uncle polished the winged a on his shirt thanks airman i was hoping for the goggles but i suppose youll be needing those unfortunately yes but you can have this pair if i come back in return for one last favour anything cried the boy already imagining strutting along kilmore quay goggles at a jaunty angle on his crown so long as it doesnt involve bathing no no bathing i need two of your tallest boys to stand at the wing tips they must be strong and they must be quick on their toes uncle summoned his two tallest boys and positioned them as conor had asked these two are so thick they make the village idiot look like sherlock holmes uncle confided to conor theyll run straight into the sea if you want then to the two lads run fast wont ye buckos hold the wings level and ill swap those diamonds for two bars of toffee righto uncle said one toffee said the other who looked a lot like the first they can stop before the water said conor fixing his goggles i need them to run alongside and keep the wings balanced as soon as i lift off they let go can they do that of course they can theyre not thick said uncle sorry they are thick but not that thick conor nodded good uncle if things go badly for me tonight i want you to stay with mister wynter he will pay you a decent wage will he make me bathe no he will debate the matter with you until you decide to wash ah one of those very well for you airman though i may have to murder him in his sleep fair enough i waste time talking with this boy time to be off conor braced his feet against two wooden blocks and stood leaning forward to grasp the engines crank the engine had always run well enough on a block in the tower but that was the way of things engines ran well until they were needed the engine caught on the second revolution coughing like a sick dog then spluttering forth a roar the crowd cheered and conor felt like doing the same stage one complete now if he had done his calculations correctly the vibrations would not tear his aeroplane apart for a while at least after an initial burst of enthusiasm the engine settled to about ten horsepower spinning conors revolutionary propeller and sending the exhaust fumes streaming over his shoulder the aeroplane bounced and reared eager to be off a wild beast on a tether this can never work i have no speed control this frame cannot last for more than five minutes too late for doubts now too late conor strapped on his harness then released the brake lever and the plane leaped forward bumping over the shale surface in his peripheral vision conor saw uncle urging one of the runners on with strokes from a switch with one hand he buckled his harness across his chest while the other struggled to keep the tiller straight you should have buckled your harness before releasing the brake idiot the ocean was approaching fast and he had not sufficient speed he urged the craft forward with jerks of his torso and tried to ignore the smoke and oil spattering on his face and goggles you should have fixed an exhaust pipe to the body what were you thinking lanterns sped past on either side speed trails blurring one into the next it was all he could do to keep the aeroplane between the lines the vibration was terrible rattling his backbone clicking his teeth rolling his eyes in their sockets some form of absorbance is needed cloth padding or springs this was not the time for ideas the aeroplane though just brought to life was already dying rivets popped material ripped and ribs groaned it had minutes left before the engine shook it to pieces like a dog shaking a rag doll conors feet found the pedals on the floor and he pushed forward angling the wings the aeroplane lifted a fraction then dropped to earth he pushed again and this time the lift was greater and the vibration decreased no longer could he feel the bump over each stone transmitted through the wood into his rear end which was a relief the water loomed black before him and then underneath conor vaguely registered his two runners splashing into the ocean then he was airborne and away i am flying a machine he thought can you see me victor we did it great saltee marshall bonvilain had arranged for the dinner to be held in his own apartments which was very unusual none of the guests had ever been in the marshalls rooms before this night and they had never heard of him extending an invitation bonvilains tower was separate from the main palace further south along the wall and had been occupied by his family since its construction it had the distinction of being the tallest structure on great saltee and sat grey and imposing on the skyline like a reminder of the marshalls power he could often be seen on his balcony brass telescope screwed to his eye keeping a watch on everything making the entire island feel guilty the dining room was sumptuous decorated with swathes of oriental silk and painted paper screens the table itself was circular and low to the ground surrounded by thick cushions when queen isabella and the broekharts were ushered into the area it felt as though they had stepped into another world catherine was especially amazed its so its so cultured said hugo bonvilain stepping from behind a screen in place of his usual sternly cut blue suit and templar stole he wore a japanese robe bonvilain could not help but notice his guests surprised faces this is a yukata tatsu robe tatsu is the japanese word for dragon embodying the powerful and turbulent elements of nature i spent a year in japan in sixtynine as personal bodyguard to emperor meiji before my father died and i was called back emperor meiji insisted i take some of japan home with me i rarely have it taken out of storage but this is a special occasion and i thought you might like to see a more relaxed marshall catherine was the first of the small group to recover from her surprise you look striking marshall why thank you catherine no one minds sitting on cushions i hope no one objected though cushions are not the most comfortable of seats for those with ceremonial swords at their belts nor for that matter for those in fashionable dresses thank goodness bustles are no longer fashionable catherine commented to the queen or we should be rolling about like skittles the meal was mostly fish and rice served by a single wizened servant coco is also the chef said bonvilain i lured him away from a restaurant in london with the promise of a decent kitchen he is portuguese but can cook any meal you wish japanese is one of his specialities an hour passed slowly in spite of several cultural lectures from the marshall eventually catherines patience reached its limit she made a small snuffling sound and twisted her napkin as if to strangle it declan winced he knew that snuffling sound well trouble was brewing the meal is lovely marshall said catherine but i am sure we did not come here just for food and small talk your invitation was vague and so i would like know how do you propose to celebrate conors life bonvilains face was a mask of regret and understanding you are right catherine i have been shying away from tonights raison dêtre conor your son the hero of the saltee islands i thought we could share our memories of that brave young man and then perhaps raise a toast i have been saving a special bottle of wine it was a good performance and the marshall felt that if needed he could produce a tear but why now prodded catherine i admit to being a little puzzled marshall he was spared the need to answer by the sound of a bugle piping from the wall declan leaped instantly to his feet thats the call to arms king nicholas had insisted that the saltee buglers learn us army signals no need for panic said bonvilain hurrying to the balcony i was warned he might show up who asked the queen an enemy of the state your majesty explained bonvilain fixing his eye to a brass telescope this one calls himself the airman airman said declan ive heard rumours about him you mean hes a real threat real yes said bonvilain squinting into the eyepiece a threat absolutely not simply a frenchman with a kite come and look the lenses in this thing are quite fabulous catherine grasped declans arm to stop herself shaking all this talk of flying and frenchmen had put victor vigny in mind a frenchman in a kite she said voice strained oh dear god of course said bonvilain feigning shock exactly like vigny the murderer i believe this airman could be one of his acolytes a curious hybrid of crazed revolutionary and scientist i should not have even mentioned him how insensitive of me please remain indoors the wall guard will shoot him down declan took bonvilains arm leading him to one side shoot him down marshall but you said he posed no threat bonvilain bent his head spoke in a low voice not a realistic one though my men have found a grenade workshop declan blanched grenades marshall i am captain of the wall watch why do i not know all of this captain declan my informants on the mainland reported to me barely two hours ago i fully intended to broach the subject after dinner but in all honesty a frenchman in a glider dropping grenades it seemed ludicrous something from a penny dreadful at any rate the wind is towards the mainland tonight so how could this madman possibly glide here at that moment a clunking mechanical noise echoed across the channel it thrummed from a low register to a high one spluttering alarmingly perhaps this airman does not rely on the wind said declan snatching the telescope from its stand conor always said that one day man would build an enginepowered aeroplane enginepowered said bonvilain through gritted teeth a clever one that conor eh declan glanced down at the wall the watch had extinguished their lights and gathered in a cluster at the third tower several had climbed the parapet and were pointing skywards two held telescopes pointed thirty degrees skywards northeast declan raised the marshalls telescope to his eye and followed their line for a moment he saw nothing but night sky and stars but then something flashed across his field not a bird too big to be a bird declan zigzagged the telescope trapping the object in his circle of vision what he saw took his breath away it was a flying machine conors dream come alive in front of his eyes the aeroplane could not be called graceful but it was flying lurching through the air trailing billowing streams of smoke in the moonlight declan saw the airman seated behind the engine shoulders hunched as he wrestled with the controls face obscured by goggles and soot gritted teeth white against the blackness i see him he gasped the airman hes flying catherine rushed to the balcony leaning over the rail peering skywards oh my goodness if only conor could have seen this she turned to her husband this cannot be coincidence you need to talk with this sky pilot behind them a shrill whistle blew twice and immediately the wall watch stripped off their cloaks twirling them like bullfighters three gatlinggun teams hoisted their weapons on to custom wall mounts whoever this airman was he was headed straight for a hail of fire bonvilain still had the whistle to his lips the order is given i had no choice catherine he may be carrying grenades my first duty is to the queen declan surely you understand catherine turned to her husband eyes blazing fully expecting his support but it was not forthcoming the marshall is correct admitted declan though it pained him to say it there is an unidentified craft approaching the island the pilot may be armed there is no option but to open fire he is flying a motorized kite said catherine her eyes stung by declans betrayal the walls are four feet thick had he a brace of cannon on his wings he could not penetrate the tower declan would not be swayed from his duty this man has conquered the skies so perhaps he can conquer our walls too i hear rumours of grenades filled with poison gas we must not expose the queen he took catherines hands in his the queen cannot die do you understand catherine searched her husbands face for a deeper meaning to his words and she found it the queen cannot die because if she does bonvilain becomes prime minister very well declan i understand said catherine dully the queen must live so the airman must die she dropped her husbands hand and stepped across the threshold i have no stomach for this murder enjoy your victory marshall absolutely thought bonvilain but aloud he said one never enjoys the death of another madam i have been involved in many battles but no matter how righteous the cause i have always concluded they could have been avoided this time sadly there is no alternative and with a regretful halfsmile on his lips the marshall raised his whistle and blew one final blast below on the great saltee wall the gatling operators cranked their handles pouring a thousand rounds a minute into the sky through their revolving barrel system the bullets sped towards the airman trailing grey smoke tails no one can survive that thought declan no one bonvilain was thinking exactly the same thing it was a battle of vectors and gravity the gatling cradles would only allow for a certain elevation and even though they had a level range of feet the airman was as yet too high to be struck but gravity was his enemy too his fragile craft could not stay aloft forever and when it dropped the bullets would shred it to confetti the noise and sheer concussion from the guns were shocking it seemed as though the very island shook it was easy to imagine the wall being pounded to dust under repeated recoil the chambers belched long cylinders of smoke and steam rose in clouds as the water boys cooled the barrels by dousing them from buckets declan had never seen gatling guns at work on a battlefield but he had heard that a single round could tear a man apart there was enough lead in the air now to defeat an entire army the sky was thick with their buzzing like a dense swarm of metal hornets determined to find the same target declan raised the telescope for one last look at the airman even from this distance it was clear that he was in dire straits hot oil bubbled on his face and goggles both hands were locked in struggle with a vertical rudder and strips were coming loose from his wings flapping behind the aeroplane like may day ribbons declan lowered the telescope he is gone we will never know his true purpose seconds later the airman lost his battle for control and altitude his engine spasmed growled and died it seemed then as though there was a moment of echoes as the craft spiralled down and the marksmen held their ammunition waiting it was not a long wait mere seconds a short command was barked from the wall and the gatling cranks were turning once more eighteen barrels spat fire and a fresh blizzard of rounds rocketed into the night sky spent cases clinked on the parapet like coins thrown to a beggar the bullets tore through the crafts wings and body almost halting its descent the impact was terrible splintering the fragile body and tearing the wings to nothing round after round slammed into the engine until it exploded in a tight orange burst tendrils of flame shot along ribs and ropes tracing the remains of the aeroplane against the night sky they did not hear a splash the night sky conor flew his machine through the sky above great saltee a savage crosswind sheared across his bow tilting him to starboard and he noticed a congregation of lights by the third tower lights meant guards the lights below winked out one by one and conors stomach heaved with dread i am the target now for a moment there was nothing but shadowed activity from the third tower then dots of fire flashed and a hail of shot erupted towards the heavens a second later conor heard the scream of the bullets and their frustrated cry as they passed below pure panic bubbled in conors chest and he almost jumped bodily from the machine wait wait i must pass bonvilains tower the engine was stuttering missing beats like a failing heart losing its battle with the skies both wings were in tatters now the winds claws ripping strips of muslin from the frame below conors toes the pedal had broken free from its stanchions and jiggled uselessly almost in position a few more yards a second swarm of bullets blasted towards him and conor felt the highest missiles tugging at the landing gear sending the wheels spinning he was in range now time to say goodbye to la brosse all evidence of his flight would soon be destroyed conor knew that the marshall would never have allowed him to reach great saltee alive so the trick was to persuade bonvilain that the airman was finally dead this was a challenge as a master of deception bonvilain was not an easy man to deceive but he knows nothing about flight in the heavens i am the master conor wore his glider harness with one extra strap that connected him to his flying machine the rest were as usual buckling him to his glider which lay folded across his back ribs slapping against his flying jacket ripples running along the fabric linus had repaired it for him and it was stronger now than it had ever been one more flight old friend it was difficult reaching down in all the confusion it was difficult figuring which way was down so conor ran his hand along his own body finding the strap at his waist he yanked it upwards freeing the buckle and the aeroplane rocked loosely around his torso but did not fall away as they were still bound together by momentum and gravity the bullets were splintering the wood around his legs now if he did not separate his invention would become his coffin with a practised motion conor reached for the springloaded lever at his side one swift tug and the gliders wings deployed they spread themselves wide against the stars like some great night bird acting like a powerful brake lifting conor clear of the doomed aeroplane he watched it go dipping into the shoal of glinting bullets his historic invention was obliterated completely nothing left but burning fragments and a crushed metal heart the engine exploded blew itself into fistsized pieces which spun into the darkness gone no place in history for la brosse far below on great saltee a haze of gun smoke shrouded the wall and through it conor saw the muted glow of electric globes they turn the lights back on because they believe themselves safe conor hung in the sky finding his bearings bonvilains tower was marked out by the rectangular glow of an open door isabella and his parents were inside that tower in mortal danger it could be that he was already too late into the lions den thought conor then dipped the gliders nose aiming for the light bonvilains tower marshall bonvilain stepped over the threshold into the dining room his face an exaggerated picture of regret behind him the last flames of destruction flickered out in the sky from below on the wall came the sounds of highspirited congratulation and the hiss of steam rising from glowing gun barrels a great pity he said chin low that man had so much to teach the world the gathering had been morose before now the humour had switched to irate bonvilain took one look at the mood writ on his guests faces and realized that a crisis was fast approaching there was no other way ladies declan as marshall i could not permit an assault on the wall isabella stood by the fireplace flushed cheeks contrasting with a highcollared ivory dress bonvilain was unsettled by her expression as he had not seen this look before ever since the coronation isabellas confidence had been growing now she had the temerity to glare at him and just after he had supposedly saved her life i sincerely prefer the old isabella he thought confused and griefstricken is how i like my monarch no one was talking and they were all treating bonvilain to the same disgusted stare they have been conferring bonvilain thought while i was on the balcony are we all distressed he asked innocently shall i close the window and still no one spoke bonvilain saw that the queen was working up the courage to deliver a lecture i think i shall sit for this said the marshall calmly dropping crosslegged to a cushion else my legs may give way you have something to say majesty isabella took a step forward her dress almost disguising the shake in her legs the sweep found something marshall in my fathers chamber these were her first words of the evening oh really said bonvilain brightly but inside he was discomfited in his position there was no such thing as a good surprise yes marshall really isabella took a small leatherbound book from her bag and held it close to her heart this is my fathers diary bonvilain decided to brazen it out why thats wonderful majesty something to connect you to king nicholas not so wonderful for you marshall continued isabella clutching catherines hand for support my father was very suspicious of your activities he wrote how you abuse your power to build a personal fortune how you cultivate a network of spies on the mainland how you are suspected of complicity in dozens of murders the list goes on i see said bonvilain while in his head plotting it will be difficult to make them take the poisoned wine now already they do not trust me isabellas legs were no longer shaking and her tone was regal do you see i think not marshall did you know that my father planned to see you in prison did you know that he planned to completely revise the power structure on the saltee islands to inaugurate a parliament bonvilain managed to maintain his bland expression but he knew that a crisis was upon him typical he thought murder one enemy and three more spring up in his place may i read something for you asked isabella bonvilain nodded it is not my place to allow or forbid majesty i shall take that as a yes said isabella with a curt smile she released catherines hand to open her fathers diary hugo bonvilain is a scourge she read his power is formidable and he abuses it at every opportunity when i have proof of his crimes he will spend the rest of his life staring at the same cell walls he has condemned so many to suffer within but i must be careful nothing is below the marshall and i believe if he knew of my plans then he would take whatever steps necessary to thwart them i do not fear for my own life but isabella must be kept safe she is my heart isabellas voice almost broke at the end but she reached for catherines hand and finished strong bonvilain clapped both palms on his knees well thats damning stuff said bonvilain obviously the text is a forgery planted by one of my enemies i must make them drink how to do it how i know my fathers hand said isabella firmly i have no doubt of it but an expert forger can deceive sharper eyes than ours have the book verified by an expert of your choice i insist on it this book is a grave insult to my lifes work and i will have my name cleared i have not finished declared isabella you are removed from office immediately declan captain broekhart will take your place bonvilain kept the rage inside him corked up tight declan would certainly make a fine marshall i thoroughly approve but surely i deserve an opportunity to enough ordered the queen in a tone that brooked no argument you will remain here under house arrest until your affairs can be investigated bonvilain silently cursed himself he had provided the queen with the perfect forum to launch her attack he had some men hidden in a secret compartment behind the wall but it was difficult to reach behind a tapestry and pull a hidden lever under such scrutiny everything rests on the poisoned wine if it were just the queen i could force it down her gullet but declan broekhart would run me through with that darned ceremonial sword and if his wifes stares were daggers i would be dead already a great relief shone in isabellas eyes and shoulders dipped as the tension drained from her body the prospect of this confrontation had terrified her since the diarys discovery she had planned every word in her speech and finally victory was hers and her fathers and now hugo bonvilain she said i think we should conclude what we are here to do we should raise a toast to our beloved conor broekhart bonvilain bit his lip oh thank you spirits of irony the gods have a sense of humour after all bonvilains expression was peevish i hardly think under the circumstances catherine stepped forward plucking the special bottle from the ice bucket i realize that you invited us here in a transparent attempt to toady to isabella and declan but we wish to honour our son and you will raise a glass with us this is ridiculous grumbled bonvilain but i of course will not cause my queen displeasure he stood and slouched while declan opened and poured bonvilain muttered under his breath and threw hateful stares the picture of a beaten bully and certainly not a schemer on the verge of his greatest coup they held their crystal glasses aloft bonvilains at halfmast with catherines smile of approval isabella gave the toast to conor my best friend my prince and saviour look after my father tears sparkled in catherines eyes and declan actually moaned bonvilain tried not to laugh but it was difficult look after my father you can look after him yourself if i have my way bonvilain waited for his guests to drink but they did not he abandoned his surly expression for a moment to glance at their faces each one regarded their twinkling glass with dawning suspicion perhaps this wine is poisoned perhaps this is why bonvilain invited us here there was only one way for bonvilain to allay this suspicion ah well there goes my evening its the water closet for me until morning to the broekhart boy how i miss him he said quaffing half of his glass in a single swallow to conor my son said declan heaven is lucky to have him and raised the glass to his mouth but before he could do more than wet his lips something dark detached itself from the night outside and pounced on hugo bonvilain something dark with wings conor hurtled through the window a creature of the night crashing into bonvilain tumbling them on to the low table crockery and cutlery flew and both men were instantly entangled in swathes of gold embroidered tablecloth only conors wings remained exposed and he must have resembled a giant moth attracted to the cloths bright pattern declan reacted quickly throwing his glass aside and wrapping his fingers round the grip of his ceremonial sword ceremonial but razor sharp nonetheless it is the airman he thought come to kill the queen the situation with bonvilain must be set aside until this common enemy was dealt with he grabbed a hank of tablecloth bent low and used his weight and strength to spin the warring pair from the table they rolled across the floor still battling though bonvilains blows were growing weak and ineffective the airman drove his fist repeatedly into his enemys face until bonvilains eyes lost their focus declan reached for the collar of the intruders jacket but was too slow the airman spun around speaking urgently did you drink have you raised the toast a strange question for an assassin to pose thought declan but no time for distractions put him down then ponder his questions he swung his sword intending to render the airman unconscious with the flat of his blade only to find it almost causally batted aside by his enemys forearm the toast did you drink something in the mans attitude unsettled declan as though he were about to make a terrible mistake the face or perhaps the voice something he held back from striking uncertain now of his strength of purpose catherine had no such doubts she saw nothing of the airmans face from her angle there was only her husband and the man attacking him she hitched up her skirt and planted a solid kick square in the airmans side following it with a dashing blow from a handy flower vase conor staggered sideways dripping water and wearing daffodils wait he gasped shrugging off his harness and wings dont but he was given no respite isabella pulled a samurai sword from its presentation case and adopted a fencing stance before him en garde monsieur she said then launched a blistering attack conors sabre barely cleared its scabbard in time to parry the first thrust isabella he gasped completely disorientated you must stop the queen was in no mood to stop anything i will stop when you are dead assassin conor managed a lucky counter riposte which bought him the second he needed to find his balance isabella had improved as a fencer since their lessons with victor but conor could still see the bones of his teachings you have studied marozzo well he gasped victor would be proud isabellas blade quivered then froze what did this mean who was this man to invoke victors name declan gathered his wife and the queen behind him sword raised for battle you will show your face sir he demanded i grant you five seconds before we duel to the death and that death will be yours conor slowly reversed his grip then buried the tip of his sword in the floorboards very well but before i do tell me if you drank a toast there was no toast snapped declan now off with those goggles sir conors shoulders slumped and he seemed on the verge of collapse but he drew himself erect and pulled the collar down from his chin then pushed the goggles up to his forehead his face was blasted black from soot and oil but his eyes were clear and a lock of blond hair had come loose from his leather cap the watchers were confused what they were seeing was not possible father i know you vowed to kill me should we meet again said conor slowly but there are things you do not know victor did not kill the king nor was i involved it was bonvilain conor breathed his mother you live declan sank to his knees as though gut punched his breath was laboured and tears streamed down his face my son lives how is it possible and suddenly conor understood the scale of bonvilains deception my parents genuinely believed me dead bonvilain spun a different lie for each party isabella was the first to reach him hugging him tightly kissing his cheek her tears mingling with his oh conor conor where have you been conor held her tightly reeling from the strength of emotions aimed at him he had been expecting mistrust and anger not love that was you in the cell moaned declan i said i would kill you i sent you to hell catherine rubbed her husbands back but then couldnt keep herself away from her son she rushed to him taking his face in her hands oh conor you are a man now she said grown as tall as your father at seventeen conor was vaguely surprised to remember that he was only seventeen conor finn had been more than twenty declan broekharts face was suddenly terrible with rage bonvilain did this all of it and by god i will make him pay bonvilain in the swirl of emotions conor had forgotten about hugo bonvilain he turned clumsily in the embrace of his mother and queen to find only a puddle of blood where bonvilain had fallen he plucked his sabre from the floorboards and scanned the chamber to find his old enemy sliding along the wall quietly making for the door father called conor pointing with his sword we must secure bonvilain finding that his escape was thwarted bonvilain reached behind a tapestry and pulled his hidden lever the fireplace slid aside on a pulley mechanism revealing a tightly packed group of holy cross guards bonvilain smiled his mouth a bloody mess more than one gap in his teeth my last line of defence he said spitting crimson and to the soldiers kill the women they are impostors it was a cunning order diverting conor and declan from their path in order to defend isabella and catherine the soldiers tumbled from their confined space drawing daggers and swords no guns guns would bring the wall watch running luckily the secret space was cramped and so the men were stiff and light dazzled which gave the broekharts a seconds advantage they used it well bundling the halfdozen holy cross guardsmen back towards their hiding place watch the marshall conor called to isabella he is no longer the marshall said the queen raising the samurai sword i have been taught how to slice a man into three pieces she said to bonvilain take one step towards us and i will demonstrate those strokes for you bonvilain pinched the bridge of his nose ordinarily he would rush this silly girl and crush the hands that held the sword but the poison in his wine was beginning to affect him already his fingers were tingling and a volcano bubbled in his innards he needed to be away from here before the more extreme symptoms the path to the door was blocked by the broekharts his secret passage was a melee of flailing limbs and blades and the only other exit was the balcony bonvilain tripped over conors discarded wings and on to the balcony searching furiously below for something to rescue him imagine hugo bonvilain needs rescuing how embarrassing below the wall watch stripped down the gatling guns apparently oblivious to the commotion sixty feet above their heads they had obviously not noticed the giant birdlike creature crashing into their marshalls apartments bonvilain felt his stomach lurch as the poison twisted his guts i must escape i need a way down there crossing the courtyard below was sultan arif a duffle bag in his hand and another slung across his back where the devil is that fool going sultan he shouted captain arif i need you now sultan missed a step but he did not stop i am going home hugo he called without turning i have many sins to atone for for the first time in many a year bonvilain experienced real rage get back here he demanded pounding the railing i dont have time for your sulking send me a rope on a crossbow bolt arif disobeyed yet again if you have drunk the toast then i would advise you stay calm marshall he advised quickening his pace towards the gate a speeding heart moves the poison more quickly through your veins traitorous wretch roared bonvilain do not doubt that we shall meet again and i know where we shall meet whispered sultan his back turned on bonvilain once and for all a speeding heart moves the poison more quickly bonvilain realized the truth of those words as a spasm hit him and he vomited bile over the balcony calm yourself hugo there is still time with one last shake of his fist in sultan arifs direction bonvilain went back into his own apartment where declan and conor broekhart were battling furiously with three of the holy cross guard three were already down unconscious or clutching their wounds at that moment declan broekhart took a blade in the shoulder leaving his son to fight alone catherine dragged her husband clear and queen isabella kept her sword levelled at bonvilain that girl is really becoming quite irksome why did i let her live this long bonvilain realized that he had allowed his schemes to become too elaborate i need these people dead but more than that i need to be in a safe place where i can regain my strength i have funds and supporters on the mainland conor drove the three holy cross guards back with a wide swing then drew a pistol from his belt firing off two low rounds a couple of soldiers collapsed with shattered shins gunfire thought bonvilain that and the word poison from the courtyard will have the wall watch running i must away the poison was in his legs now sticking needles in his toes cramping his muscles across the room conor broekhart struggled with the final guard a huge scotsman wielding a shortened broadsword this was one of bonvilains mercenaries and a veteran killer for a moment bonvilain nurtured a glimmer of hope then conor stepped under the big scotsmans swing and knocked him flat with the sabres finger guard the airman tumbled the final guard back inside the cavity then reached behind the tapestry and sealed them inside their moaning could be heard through the grate behind you son said declan through gritted teeth the marshall conor rounded on bonvilain with three years of hatred glowing in his eyes he was a figure from childrens nightmares a man in black wielding a bloody weapon lips pulled back in a snarl bonvilain he said with a strange calmness generally bonvilain would have relished the opportunity for some choice remarks followed by swift mortal combat with this whelp but now his system was afire with wolfsbane his tongue felt strange and swollen in his mouth and his legs bent under the weight of his torso soon my judgement will be gone i must escape now isabella stepped forward you will answer for your crimes hugo bonvilain your reign is over there is no escape bonvilain bent low grunting like a wild boar he grasped conors harness dragging the glider on to the balcony escape he muttered drool dripping from his slack lip fly away airman conor followed him cocking his pistol im warning you bonvilain bonvilain managed a dry laugh conor broekhart always in my way in paris when i ordered your fathers balloon shot down when i set the kings tower alight even now perhaps you are magical as people believe it was difficult to understand what hugo bonvilain said his loose lips bubbled with spittle and blood the marshall rolled his body up on to the balconys parapet keep away or you will never know my secrets conor ached to finish bonvilain but isabellas light touch prevented it dont conor i need to know everything he has done there is so much to be set right isabella turned to the marshall come down from there ordered isabella your queen commands it bonvilain struggled to his feet clumsily pulling the harness round his shoulders i have no queen no god no country he mumbled cinching the chest belt with rubbery fingers that would have to do he did not have the dexterity for the remaining buckles all i have is cunning and with a focus born of hatred bonvilain reached inside his dragon robe to a dagger at his belt with the intention of flicking it from the waist conor saw the gleam of the blade as it cleared the silk isabella even now he tries to kill isabella conor swung his pistol but declan broekhart was quicker even though his shoulder was wounded he hurled his sword spearlike with such force that it pierced bonvilains vest of chain mail and lodged in his heart bonvilain sighed as though disappointed with the book he was reading then stepped backwards off the parapet into the night an updraught filled the gliders wings floating bonvilain over the courtyard past the disbelieving eyes of the wall watch and hundreds of saltee islanders raised from their beds by the gatling guns bonvilain hung there for several moments his dripping blood painting swirls on the flagstones before a crosswind flipped the glider about urging it out to sea conor watched him go dropping closer and closer to the cold ocean the silhouetted sword protruding from his lifeless heart and with him went the nightmare that his life had become none could tear their eyes from bonvilains corpse arresting even in death further from land he drifted and lower too until his toes skimmed the ocean conor wished to see him go down to be certain that it was over but he did not bonvilain was lost to sight before the ocean claimed him below was consternation the watch were hammering on the wall access door and the people surged against the foot of the tower declan broekhart took isabella by the hand leading her to the parapet the queen is safe he called raising her hand long live the queen the cry that came back was relieved and heartfelt long live the queen chapter time apart great saltee one month later queen isabella had taken to walking the wall every morning at sunrise she believed that it gave her subjects heart to see her there before too many sunrises she could call to everyone she saw by name conor often joined his queen on her morning strolls and on the morning before his planned departure to study for a science degree at glasgow university they met below what had been bonvilains tower isabella stood with her elbows on the parapet watching a cluster of fishing boats half a mile offshore the small crafts bobbing in the choppy channel currents they will never find him you know said conor bonvilains mail vest has taken him straight to the bottom he is food for the crabs now isabella nodded without a body he becomes the bogeyman they say he has been seen in paris and dublin i read in the london times that bonvilain survives as a killer for hire in whitechapel they were both silent for a minute convincing themselves that they had actually seen hugo bonvilain die what will you do with this place conor asked finally slapping the tower wall a diamond market i think replied isabella it seems ludicrous that the diamonds are here and yet we trade in london youre making big changes there are many things to be changed little saltee for one did you know that only fourteen of the prisoners are from the saltee islands the majority of the other poor souls are from ireland or great britain well no more i will shut the prison down and contract the mining to a professional firm conor glanced at the s branded into his hand little saltee will always be with me it has marked my body and mind what will happen to the prisoners he asked every case will be reviewed by a judge i suspect most have served their sentences and more besides reparations will have to be made i would be grateful if you could look kindly on a certain otto malarkey he is not as fearsome as he seems of course sir conor you will make a fine queen my father was the scientist i am a businesswoman you can be my royal scientist on your return mother told you isabella took his arm and they promenaded along the wall catherine told me about glasgow i am supposed to talk you out of it and how would you do that i could always have you hanged conor smiled like the old days sometimes i wish the old days were here still isabella stopped at one of her favourite spots on the wall a dip facing the mainland where centuries ago masons had built a lovers seat from this vantage point at various times during the morning it was possible to view morning sun illuminating the church towers stainedglass window as the sun moved it seemed as though the saint christopher figure in the window moved a little too isabella sat on the stone seat pulling conor down beside her i miss the old days too but its not too late for us is it conor i hope that it is not replied conor then i shall wait said isabella and her playful side surfaced shall you fly home to see me sir airman i am merely a sir is that not too common for a queen that is easily fixed with one prick of my hat pin you can become a prince hat pin is that legal it doesnt have to be a hat pin so long as there is blood and you are in great pain conor took her hand in his i think now that i shall be in great pain until i return then study hard earn your paper and come home quickly your queen needs you i need you and they kissed for the first time with the stainedglass sun painting rainbows on their faces and the hubbub of morning trade rising from the square below all the goodbyes had been said he had kissed his mother and dangled his little brother upside down all that was left was to leave conor strolled down to the port on a sunny morning keeping one eye on the barrow boy bobbing down the hill with his luggage the sea was calm and a small passenger steamship chugged on its ropes in the outside dock a small crowd had gathered on the deck and conor smiled when he saw the attraction linus wynter was treating the passengers to an impromptu rendition of an aria from the soldiers return he stopped singing when he heard conors footsteps on the planks its about time you showed up boy i had to sing just to stop the captain casting off any excuse linus said conor flipping the barrow boy a shilling you have secured the laboratory our tower is in good hands uncle has moved in with a couple of his dullards as he calls them how does uncle smell not so good all we can hope for is that he will fall into the ocean with a bar of soap in his pocket conor leaped across a yard of sea on to the steamship do you think scotland is ready for your genius linus smiled broadly adjusting his tinted eyeglasses which conor had fashioned for him the scots are famous for their appreciation of music robert burns was a poet of the people like myself glasgow will take me to its bosom i feel sure of it in six months we will be the toast of the city you can see into the future now old friend linus searched the air until his hand found conors shoulder other men look up and down left and right he said but men like us are different we are visionaries eoin colfer
