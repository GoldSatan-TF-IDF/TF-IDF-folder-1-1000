sharon kay penman devils brood prologue he would be remembered long after his death one of those rare men recognized as great even by those who hated him he was a king at twentyone wed to a woman as legendary as helen of troy ruler of an empire that stretched from the scots border to the mediterranean sea king of england lord of ireland and wales duke of normandy and aquitaine count of anjou touraine and maine liege lord of brittany but in gods year henry fitz empress second of that name to rule england since the conquest was more concerned with the judgment of the church than historys verdict when the archbishop of canterbury was slain in his own cathedral by men who believed they were acting on the kings behalf their bloodied swords might well have dealt henry a mortal blow too all of christendom was enraged by thomas beckets murder and few were willing to heed henrys impassioned denials of blame his continental lands were laid under interdict and his multitude of enemies were emboldened like wolves on the trail of wounded prey the beleaguered king chose to make a strategic retreat and in october he sailed for ireland there he soon established his lordship over the feuding irish kings and secured oaths of fealty from the irish bishops the winter was so stormy that ireland truly seemed to be at the western edge of the world the turbulent irish sea insulating henry from the continuing outcry over the archbishops death but in the spring the winds abated and contact was established once more with the outside world henry learned that papal legates had arrived in normandy and he was warned that his restless eldest son was once more chafing at the bit in accordance with continental custom he had been crowned in his fathers lifetime but the young king was dissatisfied with his lot in life having the trappings of shared kingship but none of the power and henrys agents were reporting that hal was brooding about his plight listening to the wrong men henry fitz empress decided it was time to go home chapter one april dyved south wales soon after leaving haverford they were ambushed by the fog ranulf had long ago learned that welsh weather gave no fair warning honored no flags of truce and scorned all rules of warfare but even he was taken aback by the suddenness of the assault rounding a bend in the road they found themselves riding into oblivion the sky was blotted out the earth disappearing under their horses hooves all sound muffled in this opaque smothering mist as blinding as woodsmoke and pungent with the raw salttang of the sea drawing rein ranulfs brother rainald hastily called for a halt mother of god it is the devils doing ranulf had a healthy respect for lucifers malevolence but he was far more familiar than rainald with the vagaries of the welsh climate it is just an earlymorning fog rainald he said soothingly i can smell the brimstone on his breath rainald insisted can hear his cackling on the wind listen and youll hear it too ranulf cocked his head hearing only the slapping of waves against the rocks below them rainald was already shifting in the saddle telling their men that they were turning back before ranulf could protest he discovered he had an ally in gerald de barri the young clerk and scholar whod joined their party after a stopover at llawhaden castle kicking his mule forward gerald assured rainald that such sudden patches of fog were quite common along the coast theyd soon be out of it he promised and offered to lead them for this was a road he well knew pressed too by ranulf rainald reluctantly agreed and they ventured on slowly and very warily now i know what its like for your wife rainald grumbled glancing over his shoulder at his brother poor lass cursed to live all her days batblind and helpless as a newborn babe ranulfs wife rhiannon was indeed blind but far from helpless ranulf took no offense though rainalds tactlessness was legendary in their family slowing his mount he dropped back to ride beside rainalds young son the boys dark coloring had earned him his nickname rico for upon viewing him for the first time rainald had joked that he was more an enrico than a henry swarthy as a sicilian ricos olive skin was now a ghostly shade of grey and ranulf reached over to pat him reassuringly upon the arm horses do not fancy going over cliffs any more than men do and welsh ponies are as surefooted as mountain goats rico did not seem comforted yes but whirlwind is cornish not welsh ranulf camouflaged a smile for the placid hackney hardly merited such a spirited name they breed surefooted horses in cornwall too lad to take his nephews mind off their precarious path he began to tell rico of some mischiefmaking by his youngest son morgan and soon had rico laughing he missed morgan missed his elder son bleddyn and daughter mallt above all missed rhiannon but hed agreed to accompany rainald to the holy well of st non even knowing that hed be away for weeks for he knew the real reason for rainalds pilgrimage rainald had claimed he wanted to pray for his wifes soul but beatrice had been ailing for many years hers a malady of the mind that only death had healed rainalds true concern was for his other son nicholas who had not been blessed with ricos robust good health frail and sickly nicholas was not likely to live long enough to succeed to his fathers earldom as evidenced by rainalds desperate decision to seek aid from saints not doctors rainalds pain was all the greater because nicholas was his only male heir rico was born out of wedlock and thus barred by church law from inheriting any of his fathers estateseven though rainald himself was bastardborn the irony of that was lost upon rainald who was the least introspective of men it was not lost upon ranulf who shared rainalds tainted birth both of them natural sons of the old king henry neither of them had suffered from the stigma of illegitimacy though as a kings son rainald had been judged worthy to wed the heiress of the earldom of cornwall and ranulf had long been the favorite uncle of the current king henry fitz empress henry would gladly have bestowed an earldom upon him too but ranulf who was halfwelsh had chosen to settle in wales where hed wed his welsh cousin and raised his familyuntil forced into english exile by a welsh princes enmity his welsh lands were forfeit and his english manors were meager in comparison to rainalds vast holdings in cornwell but ranulf had no regrets about turning down a title he was at peace with his yesterdays and hed lived long enough to understand how few men could say that for certes rainald could not nor could the king his nephew absent these many months in ireland where hed gone to evade holy churchs fury over the slaying of thomas becket gerald de barris voice floated back upon the damp morning air a naturalborn talker he was not going to let a bit of fog muzzle him and he continued to engage rainald in conversation not at all discouraged by the earls taciturn distracted responses ranulf listened amused for gerald was an entertaining traveling companion if somewhat selfserving the nephew of the bishop of st davids he was returning to england after years of study in paris and he reminded ranulf of thomas becket another worldly clerk blessed with great talents and even greater ambitions becket had been a superb chancellor wielding enormous influence because of his close friendship with the king what a pity it was ranulf thought that harry had taken it into his head to elevate becket to the archbishopric but who could ever have expected the man to undergo such a dramatic transformation he wasnt even a priest had hastily to take holy vows just days before his investiture but once he was canterburys archbishop hed devoted himself to god with all of the zeal hed once shown on behalf of englands king henry hadnt been the only one discomfited by beckets newfound fervor his fellow bishops had often been exasperated by his provocations his refusal to compromise his selfrighteous piety even his holiness the pope had been confounded at times by beckets intransigence all that had changed of course as he bled to death on the floor of his own cathedral and when the monks had discovered their slain archbishops vermininfested hairshirt under his bloodsoaked garments none had doubted they were in the presence of sainthood acclaimed as a holy martyr in death even by those whod considered him to be a vexation and an enigma in life thomas becket was sure to be anointed as the churchs next saint already people flocked to his tomb at canterbury seeking healing cures and buying little vials of his blood as precious relics more than fifteen months after beckets death ranulf still marveled at it all was becket truly a saint he smiled wryly then remembering his last meeting with his nephew the king just before henrys departure for ireland over a latenight flagon of wine henry had challenged him wanting to know if he believed becket was a saint he still recalled his reply i cannot answer your question harry doubt that anyone can i do know though that saints are not judged like ordinary men that is after all what makes them saints henry had reflected upon that in silence then said sounding both skeptical and regretful saint or not thomas got the last word for certes menevia was the name given to the small settlement that had sprung up around the cathedral of st david its houses were outnumbered by shabby inns stables taverns and a few cookshops for the shrine of the welsh saint was a popular choice for pilgrimages because of its remoteness and the difficulty of travel in wales the holy see had decreed that two pilgrimages to st davids were the equivalent of one to st peters in rome the cathedral itself was situated just west of the village in a secluded hollow out of sight of the sea raiders and norsemen who had pillaged the coast in bygone times the men expected to be accosted by villagers proclaiming the comforts of their inns the superiority of their wines and mead the bargain prices of their pilgrim badges to their surprise the streets appeared deserted advancing uneasily they finally encountered an elderly man in a doorway leaning heavily upon a wooden crutch where have all the folk gone rainald called out and when he got only a blank stare in response ranulf repeated the question in welsh to better effect to the harbor the ancient replied hobbling forward a few steps sails were spied and when word spread people went to see most pilgrims come on foot but we do get some who sail from normandy and flanders even a few frenchmen who lack the ballocks to brave welsh roads he grinned showing a surprising mouthful of teeth for one so old but ranulf knew the welsh were particular about tooth care cleaning them with green hazel shoots and polishing them with woolen cloth flipping him a coin for his trouble ranulf interpreted for the others translating the old mans frenchmen into english to avoid confusion it was not always easy to live in lands with so many spoken tongues to many of the welsh the invaders from england were french for that was the language they spoke to the french those who dwelled on the rainswept island were english but those descendants of the men whod followed william the bastard to victory in gods year thought of themselves as norman and his nephew henry was angevin to the core having no interest in incoming ships they continued on toward the cathedral where they received the welcome worthy of an earl although gerald de barri was disappointed to learn that the bishop his uncle was away they were escorted to the guest hall and were washing off the grime of the road when they heard shouting out in the close ranulf and rainald hastened to the window looking down at a man sprinting toward the bishops palace as several canons hurried to meet him he sank to his knees chest heaving the king he gasped struggling for breath the king is coming his ships have dropped anchor in the harbor by the time their party reached the beach henry and his companions had come ashore and were surrounded by a large crowd villagers pilgrims and the local welsh it always amazed ranulf to watch his nephew with his subjects for he had not enough patience to fill a thimble and yet he showed remarkable forbearance when mobbed by supplicants even those of lowbirth ranulf had seen many people undone by the lure of power so many that hed long ago concluded it was a sickness in and of itself one as dangerous in its way as the spotted pox or consumption harry he thought had come the closest to the mastery of itso far your grace rainald bellowed loudly enough to hurt nearby eardrums henry turned toward the sound for at thirtynine he still had the keen hearing of a fox he beckoned them forward and they made the public obeisance due his rank and then were enfolded into welcoming embraces for henry had never been one for ceremony henry showed no surprise at their appearance upon this remote rocky shore my fleet anchored safely at pembroke he said with satisfaction but how did you guess that id be landing at st davids rainald looked puzzled but ranulf joked all know i have second sight before admitting that theyd not passed through pembroke knew nothing of the landing of the kings fleet and their meeting upon this westernmost tip of wales was pure happenchance well it is an auspicious omen nonetheless henry declared getting my homecoming off to a good start several canons from the cathedral had arrived by now and henry allowed them to lead the way from the beach explaining piously that hed sent his fleet on ahead yesterday but had refrained from traveling himself on the holy day of the lord christs resurrection the canons murmured approvingly at such proof of their sovereigns reverence ranulf and rainald who knew their nephew far better than these credulous clerics exchanged amused grins henrys campaign to placate the church had already begun st davids was only a mile distant but their progress was slow because of the crowds pressing in upon them henry did not seem to mind leaning upon a pilgrims staff he turned their trek into a procession goodnaturedly acknowledging the greetings of the villagers even bantering with a few of the bolder ones but the friendly relaxed atmosphere changed abruptly when they reached the cathedral close more of the canons were clustered at the gate making ready to welcome the king a muddy stream grandiosely known as the river alun bordered the northern side of the churchyard bridged by a large marble stone its surface polished and worn by the tread of countless pilgrim feet as henry approached an elderly woman stepped forward and cried out in a hoarse strident voice henry had a good ear for languages but welsh had always eluded him and he turned to the canons for enlightenment obviously flustered they sought to ignore the womans ranting insisting she was babbling nonsense and not to be heeded henry knew better one glance at the spectators told him that some looked horrified others embarrassed and a fewthose with the dark coloring of the welsheagerly expectant what did she say ranulf he demanded of the one man he could trust to give him an honest answer ranulf answered reluctantly yet truthfully she called upon lechlaver to revenge the welsh upon you henry scowled who the devil is lechlaver some heathen welsh god noit is the name of yonder rock realizing how bizarre that sounded ranulf had no choice but to tell henry the rest local legend has it that merlin made a prophecy about lechlaver he foretold that a ruddyfaced english king the conqueror of ireland would die upon that rock it was suddenly very still the crowd scarcely seemed to be breathing and more than a few surreptitiously made the sign of the cross some of henrys own companions cautiously edged away in case merlins prophecy involved a celestial thunderbolt rainald reached out as if to keep henry from advancing any farther ranulf did not consider himself to be particularly superstitious but even he did not want his nephew to set foot on that slick marble stone henry looked from one tense face to another and then slowly and very deliberately strode forward leaping nimbly onto the rock he crossed without a misstep turning back to face the spectators he said in a voice pitched loudly for all to hear who will believe that liar merlin now there was a collective sigh as breathing resumed and the world of shadows receded before henrys scorn and certainty beaming rainald made haste to follow as did the others people trooped over lechlaver the depths of their unease revealed now by the intensity of their relief only the welsh bystanders stayed on the other side of the shallow river their disappointment etched in the downturned mouths the averted eyes one youth could not endure to see merlin shamed before these arrogant foreigners and called out in heavily accented french you are not the king in merlins prophecy for you are not the conqueror of ireland henry swung around to confront the young welshman and for a suspenseful moment his audience wondered if they were to see his notorious angevin temper take fire but then henry laughed if your merlin thought anyone could truly conquer ireland lad he was a poor prophet indeed adding under his breath to ranulf as they resumed their progress toward the cathedral how do you defeat a people who lack the common sense to know when theyre beaten ranulf smiled knowing that henry was speaking too of the welsh and his disastrous campaign of six years past his ambitious plans to bring the rebellious welsh lords to heel had come to naught thwarted by the erratic weather the rugged mountainous terrain and phantom foes who refused to take the field preferring hitandrun raids evasive maneuvers and nightfall forays that recognized their weaknesses and played to their strengths faced with a rare military defeat henry had withdrawn his army back across the border and changed his tactics forging an alliance with rhys ap gruffydd the most powerful of the welsh princes so far this stratagem had proven successful wales was more peaceful than it had been in years glancing over at henry ranulf hoped that his nephew would apply the lessons hed learned from the welsh in his current battle with his holiness the pope and the mighty roman church but it was just thata hopefor he of all men knew how dangerously stubborn henry fitz empress could be there were faint bloodstains upon the tiles in canterbury cathedral testifying to that chapter two may savigny abbey normandy it was dusk when the bishop of worcester rode through the gatehouse of the cistercian abbey of our lady although a prince of the church roger traveled without an entourageonly a servant his clerk and four menatarms their presence required on the outlawinfested roads he did not think an ostentatious display was appropriate for he was living in exile having left england in protest over the english kings contest of wills with thomas becket few had emerged unscathed from that cataclysmic conflict between church and crown but rogers loyalties had been shredded to the bone becket was more than a fellow prelate and the head of the english church he was also a close friend and henry fitz empress was more than rogers sovereign the two men were first cousins and companions since childhood roger had been one of the few men whod dared to tell the king the truth in the turbulent aftermath of beckets murder that henry might not be guilty of the actual deed but neither was he innocent but he had also been one of the bishops sent to rome to plead henrys case before the pope denying that the archbishop had died at his order now he was once more thrust into the role of peacemaker riding to savignys great abbey to bear witness to this meeting between two papal legates and his cousin the king knowing full well how high the stakes were for all concerned in addition to the two cardinals a number of norman and breton bishops would also be present by rogers reckoning at least eight were men who could be expected to support the king in truth many of beckets fellow bishops had been less than enthusiastic soldiers in the archbishop of canterburys crusade to vanquish the english king feeling that hed been needlessly provocative and acrimonious always scorning compromise in favor of confrontation until his ungodly murder had transformed him from oftenirksome zealot to blessed holy martyr becket had found his strongest advocates among the bishops of france his warmest welcome at the court of louis capet the french king two of his most steadfast allies had been the bishop of rheims louiss brother and the archbishop of sens whod laid henrys continental lands under interdict and whose sister was louiss queen it did not surprise roger that neither of these prelates would be present at the savigny council for he knew pope alexander wantednay neededto mend this dangerous rift with the most powerful monarch in christendom just as henry needed to make peace with the holy see it would be a great pity he thought if harrys foolhardy pride thwarted that rapprochement roger was surprised though by the absence of john des bellesmains the bishop of poitiers he would have expected john to be there come what may for his friendship with thomas becket had gone back many years begun in their youth as clerks in the household of the archbishop theobald but poitiers was the capital of poitou the domains of the lady eleanor henrys controversial queen and duchess of aquitaine in her own right roger wondered now if eleanor had deliberately kept bishop john away from savigny knowing his sympathies lay firmly with the slain archbishop if she had then mayhap the rumors of her estrangement from harry were not true but with eleanor there could be other reasons other motives as yet undiscovered even though his sister maud the countess of chester was one of eleanors intimates roger had always been rather wary of his cousins queen a woman who dared to meddle in those matters of state best left to men and if harry spun webs to make a spider proud eleanor could entangle archangels in her snares roger suspected that she intrigued even in her sleep the hosteller was waiting to welcome roger and grooms had materialized to lead their horses to the stables after an exchange of courtesies roger was turning to follow the monk toward the abbey guest hall when his attention was drawn by a flash of color unlike the unbleached white habits worn by the cistercian monks moving about the abbey garth this man was garbed in a cope of bright blue silk decorated with wide embroidered borders and a matching blue mitre the points ornamented with scarlet thread the processional cope and mitre proclaimed him to be a prelate of holy church and the fleshy ruddy face was vaguely familiar to roger but to his embarrassment the name eluded him fortunately his gaze then fell upon the bishops companion a slightly built man no longer young starkly clad in the black cowl and habit of the benedictines abbot of one of christendoms great jewels the island monastery of mont st michel and a friend of long standing both to roger and his cousin the king and as he warmly returned abbot robert de torignys greeting roger recalled the identity of the mystery bishop the abbots neighbor prelate of the city across the bay richard of avranches bishop richard wasted no time in breaking the bad news i fear your journey has been for naught my lord bishop he declared dolefully his sorrowful visage almost but not quite disguising the relish that people invariably take in being the bearer of evil tidings the king met this afternoon with the holy fathers legates but it did not go well king henry balked at renouncing his constitutions of clarendon and when no progress could be made on this contentious issue he stalked out in a rage saying he had matters to tend to back in ireland by now others had gathered around them roger recognized the abbot of savigny utterly dismayed that this disaster should occur on his watch he was flanked by the equally flustered bishops of bayeux sees and le mans theirs the doomed expressions of men trapped between scylla and charybdis owing their allegiance to henry and their obedience to pope alexander bishop william of le mans felt a flicker of hope though with rogers arrival and at once entreated him to seek out his cousin the king his grace will heed you my lord for he has great respect for your good judgment surely you can convince him of the folly of abandoning the talks with the holy fathers legates roger was past the first flush of youth and a day in the saddle had taken its toll his back ached and his muscles were sore and cramped hed been looking forward to a bath and a nap before he changed his travelstained clothing and presented himself to the cardinals and the king suppressing a sigh he looked at the circle of expectant faces and agreed to do all in his power to keep his cousin from returning to ireland savignys abbot had turned his own quarters over to his royal guest and abbot robert offered to show roger the way observing the older mans sedate pace and calm demeanor roger realized that he did not seem nearly as disquieted as the bishops id almost forgotten he said how well you know the king and abbot roberts mouth hinted at a smile i know this much he said amiably the king does not like to make war but when he does he does it very well and sometimes the wisest tactic is a strategic withdrawal indeed roger agreed and they entered the abbots great hall overflowing with the kings servants household knights barons and clerics roger was running the gauntlet of greetings had just reached the bishop of evreux when the bedchamber door opened and henry strode into the hall as usual he did nothing to call attention to himself and his clothing would have been remarkably plain and unadorned for a minor border lord much less the man who ruled the greatest empire since charlemagne but henry had no interest in the trappings of power only in the exercise of it nor did he need to strut and preen as roger had seen other men of rank do as thomas becket had done during his years as the kings elegant worldly chancellor yet henry was always the focus of all eyes even upon those rare occasions when his identity was not known even as a youth hed had it the force that gave him the mastery of other men it was as if he were a lodestone a magnet that attracted light and luck not metal that was so fanciful a thought that roger laughed softly to himself as he moved toward his cousin the king henry was delighted to see him reaching out to clasp rogers hand in both of his forestalling a formal obeisance at last id begun to fear youd been waylaid by bandits or breton demons adding with a gleam of mischief not that one so virtuous and worthy would have anything to fear from the forces of darkness what evil spirit would dare to defy a bishop your graces faith in my sanctity is most heartening roger said dryly given that some claim your lineage can be traced to the devil henrys grey eyes flashed but with amusement not anger ah yes the righteous abbot bernard once declared that my lord father was the devils spawn or words to that effect as i recall my father laughed at him much to the sainted bernards indignation roger knew that story well it was legendary in their family the man henry sardonically called the sainted bernard was likely to become a genuine saint as the holy see had begun the canonization process but impending sainthood had not tempered henrys disdain for abbot bernard had been a bitter enemy of the counts of anjou claiming that the angevins sprang from a depraved stock doomed and damned roger did not doubt that abbot bernard was a holy man blessed by the hand of the almighty but neither did he deny that bernards earthly behavior had not always been saintly gods lambs were not always meek mild and forgiving and for a moment he thought sadly of his friend and martyr thomas becket shaking off the memory he reminded himself that todays needs must take precedence over yesterdays regrets meeting henrys gaze evenly he said i hear my lord king that youve a sudden yearning to see the irish isle again henrys expression was not easy to read for he had the irritating ability to appear utterly inscrutable when it served his purposes yes he said youve heard right come on in jerking his head toward the open bedchamber door and ill tell you of my travel plans several men were gathered in the bedchamber only one of whom roger was pleased to see his uncle rainald earl of cornwell the othersarnulf bishop of lieieux geoffrey ridel henrys acting chancellor and richard of ilchester archdeacon of poitierswere trusted royal councilors but they had also been avowed enemies of thomas becket fending off his uncles bear hug of a greeting roger acknowledged the bishop and archdeacons with cool civility and then turned to face henry you are not truly ending the talks ere they begin harry of course not henry accepted a wine cup from rainald gesturing for roger to help himself on the morrow arnulf will seek out the legates and offer to mediate our differences and what are those differences they demanded that i repudiate the constitutions of clarendon henrys smile was without humor and you know how likely i am to agree to that cousin roger did henry had attempted to define and clarify the ancient customs of the realm by putting them down in writing a radical proposal to his conservative bishops who had been accustomed to vague ambiguous terms that could be accepted or repudiated as circumstances warranted but they were practical men for the most part well aware that there must be accommodation between church and crown if the king refused to unsheathe his secular sword to enforce spiritual penalties how effective would those penalties be compromise was anathema though to the archbishop of canterbury thomas becket had refused to accept the constitutions in any form whatsoever arguing that the church not the king was the giver of laws but henry had forced the issue for accommodation was possible only if there was trust on both sides and henry no longer believed he could trust his former friend and chancellor becket had eventually given in and ordered the bishops to accept the constitutions only then to repent and recant his sworn oath within less than a year becket had fled into french exile and the pope reluctantly dragged into this dangerous dispute had backed beckets position and came out in opposition to the constitutions of clarendon the stalemate had endured for the remainder of beckets life looming ahead of them now like an uncharted rock threatening to sink all hopes of a peaceful settlement that would not happen though as long as roger drew breath he was going to steer this ship into a safe harbor if it was the last thing he ever did when i was in rome last year to plead your case at the holy see i spoke at some length with several of the cardinals i gathered that the churchs objections to the constitutions were not so much based upon the contents they accepted your argument that the customs set down were indeed the traditional practices of the realm more or less their concerns were with the oaths that you demanded of all the bishops never had such oaths been required by any of your predecessors we balked at taking vows that might conflict with canon law as you well remember harry it was only when thomass resolve briefly weakened that we had to agree his resolve briefly weakened did it henry echoed sarcastically that is a very kind way to phrase it cousin i believe his exact words to you and the other bishops were if the king would have me perjure myself so be it i will take the oath he demands and hope to purge the sin by future penance roger winced sorry but not surprised that someone had broken the confidentiality of the bishops conclave informants clustered around kings like bees at a hive i admit that was not thomass finest hour and his behavior at clarendon is not easily defended but i need not remind you cousin that your behavior has not always been defensible either what matters is how we settle this issue now would you be willing to agree not to demand such an oath of your prelates in the future when henry nodded roger glanced toward the bishop of lisieux he had no liking for the other man but he did not deny that arnulf was highly intelligent well educated and an accomplished diplomat that would be a beginning my lord bishop arnulfs smile was both confident and complacent indeed it would he said and gestured toward a parchment sheet filled with scribbles scratched out words and ink splatters my lord king and i were discussing this very matter ere you arrived there must be a way to satisfy the cardinals without making an explicit renunciation of the constitutions how does this sound the king of the english vows to abolish any new customs which have been introduced into his realm to the prejudice of the church roger considered the wording yes that might do it shooting his cousin a sharp look he said this vow is acceptable to you harry of course i do not see this as a controversial issue for i am confident i have not introduced customs detrimental to the church for certes not knowingly henry said blandly and roger sighed for hed expected as much fortunately the papal legates would expect as much too theyd not be going into this blind remembering that he held a cup of claret he took a swallow warmed as much by a surge of optimism as by the wine it was beginning to look as if both sides might win this war setting his cup down on the table next to arnulfs draft he asked to be excused so that he could wash away the dust of the road henry let him reach the door before he asked the question roger had hoped to avoid do you not want to know what the cardinals told me about beckets killers roger already knew the answer to that deceptively innocuous query it is my understanding that the killers are on their way to rome to do penance for thomass murder yes henry said and what penance do you expect the pope to impose i would not know roger said untruthfully a lie that henry pounced upon with zest what penance can he impose roger to take the cross and journey to the holy land does that seem sufficient punishment to you for the murder of an archbishop roger frowned for henry had just demonstrated the logical absurdity of the churchs insistence upon disciplining their own the constitutions of clarendon had been the result not the cause of the conflict between henry and becket it had begun with henrys desire to make clerics subject to secular law the church had long claimed sole authority to judge the offenses of men in holy orders or the crimes committed against them even men whod merely taken religious vows must be tried in ecclesiastical court not the kings court no matter how heinous his transgression a clerk was beyond the reach of royal justice and the harshest penalty the church could impose was degrading depriving him of his orders henry had been outraged by these mild punishments and he demanded that clerks convicted of serious crimes in an ecclesiastical court should then be stripped of the churchs protection and handed over to his courts for sentencing roger still remembered the litany of horrific crimes henry had assembled to bolster his argument more than one hundred murders committed by clerics in the eight years since hed become king including the scandalous case in which an archdeacon poisoned the archbishop of york and as punishment was deprived of his archdeaconry roger remembered too the case that sometimes troubled his dreams even now a clerk in worcestershire had raped a young girl and slain her father when henry insisted that the man be turned over to a royal court becket had ordered roger as bishopelect of worcester to imprison the man so he could not be seized by the kings justices roger believed in the principle defended so passionately by thomas becket that the clergy had christ alone as their king and were not subject to royal jurisdiction it was easier to argue though when the consequences of that principlethe abused daughter and widow of the murder victimwere not kneeling at his feet pleading for justice a pity henry said coolly that thomas was so adamant so scornful of compromise on the issue of jurisdiction had he been more reasonable his murderers would not have gone free ironic is it not cousin roger could have pointed out that becket would not have been murdered if henry had not lost his temper and spoke those fatal words that sent four men to canterbury cathedral thinking they were fulfilling the kings wishes what miserable drones and traitors i have nourished and promoted in my household who let their lord be mocked so shamefully by a lowborn clerk but he did not for what purpose would it serve it would change nothing he looked at henry hearing an echo of his cousins hoarse desperate denial as god is my witness those men did not murder him at my bidding the real pity he thought was that harrys remorse had faded so fast with the mediation of archbishop rotrou of rouen bishop arnulf of lisieux and the archdeacon of poitiers peace was made between the english king and the roman church it was agreed that henry and the papal legates and bishops would ride south to avranches and henry would there do public penance for his part in the murder of the archbishop of canterbury and receive absolution of his sins from the castle battlements henry had a superb view of the bay and in the distance the celebrated abbey of mont st michel it was one of the marvels of christendom built upon a small rocky island that was entirely cut off from the mainland at high tide it had a dreamlike appearance seeming to rise out of the sand and sea foam like a lost vision of gods kingdom its high precarious perch above the waves so spectacular and dramatic that at first glimpse pilgrims did not see how it could have been the work of mortal men it was low tide now and the dangerous shifting sands had been laid bare henry could see a few tiny figures trudging across those sands toward the abbey but not as many as would be expected he knew why of course many of the pilgrims had delayed their crossing upon hearing that the king of england would be doing penance upon the morrow at avranchess cathedral of st andrew the apostle that would be a sight to behold a rare tale to bring back to their towns and villages upon completion of their pilgrimages henry narrowed his eyes as much at that unwelcome thought as at the unrelenting gusts of seaborne wind belying springs calendar with its chill glancing at his closest companion he said it has been far too long since i visited your abbey mayhap we can make time ere i must depart for caen when was i there lastwhen i came with louis abbot robert pretended to ponder the question as if he did not have every one of the kings stays seared into his memory like a brand a royal visit was the greatest honor imaginable but it was also a great expense and a great strain for the striving after perfection on such an occasion was both exhausting and utterly elusive thinking of henrys sojourn with the french king he smiled at the memory for it had always amazed him that henry should have been able to win over the man whod been eleanors first husband of course that unlikely peace had not lasted but it had endured long enough for henry to arrange an even more unlikely marriage between his eldest son hal and louiss daughter marguerite child of the woman hed wed after divorcing eleanor i believe that was indeed your last visit my liege he confirmed all the while marveling at the vagaries of fate he had devoted much of his life to a history of his abbey and his times and he wondered what future historians would make of the improbable story of henry fitz empress and eleanor of aquitaine a great heiress and a great beauty shed wed the young french king at thirteen easily winning his heart for hed been pledged to the church at an early age would have happily served the almighty if his elder brother had not died in a fall from his horse and he retained a guileless innocence a monkish simplicity that was ill suited to the worldly sophistry of the royal court their marriage had been neither happy nor fruitful for they were as unlike as fire and milk in fourteen years of wedlock eleanor had given birth to only two children both daughters and when their union was finally dissolved on the grounds of consanguinity the true reason was her inability to give him a male heir barely three months later she had shocked their world by wedding henry then duke of normandy who was nine years her junior louis the king was horrified that so dangerous an adversary as henry should have access to the riches of eleanors aquitaine and louis the man was mortified and hurt that eleanor should have defied him by choosing such an unsuitable husband one ambitious bold clever and lusty their swift secret marriage had led to war with france and louiss humiliation was complete when henry needed but six short weeks to send his army reeling back across the border and but two years to claim the english crown eleanor then proceeded to salt louiss wounds by giving henry five sons and three daughters losing only william to the deadly perils of childhood at least louis had the consolation of envisioning his daughter as queen of england but even that had not gone as planned two years ago henry had mortally insulted thomas becket by allowing the archbishop of york to crown his fifteenyearold son a coronation that becket had futilely forbidden but in the chaos and confusion marguerite had not been crowned with her young husband giving louis yet another grievance against his angevin rival a sudden clamor turned henrys attention from the abbey to the town below them the streets were winding and narrow accommodating the hilly terrain and he could only catch glimpses of riders and horses but then the wind found a fluttering banner of red and gold and he smiled my son is riding into avranches he announced i should have known from the cheers he glanced toward the abbot wanting to share his pride and pleasure with his friend youve not seen the lad for years have you rob wait till you see how hes grownalready taller than me and hes just three months past his seventeenth birthday others had followed henry onto the battlements his uncle rainald his cousin roger his justiciar richard de lucy and hamelin de warenne his half brother hamelin was the illegitimate son of henrys father geoffrey count of anjou taken under henrys wing after geoffreys untimely death hamelin had flaming red hair an open freckled face that made him seem much younger than his thirty years an impulsive nature and thanks to henry a very wealthy wife whod brought him the earldom of surrey his affection for henry was equaled only by his awe and he beamed now to see his elder brother in such good spirits does hal know why you summoned him to avranches henry shook his head he thinks he is here just to swear to those agreements i am making with the church seeing abbot roberts puzzled look he explained i have a surprise in store for the lad below them men were riding into the castles inner bailey there was no need to point out the young king everything about himthe spirited grey stallion and ornamented saddle the costly mantle of fine scarlet wool the white calfskin gloves studded with pearls the stylish pointed cap with a turnedup brim embroidered in gold thread the gilded spurs attached to his boots with red leather strapsproclaimed him to be of high birth and one of gods favorites hed been blessed too with uncommonly good looks tall and well formed with vivid blue eyes and gleaming golden hair cut short around his ears one lock allowed to curl fashionably onto his forehead catching sight of his father up on the battlements he doffed his cap in a gesture both graceful and dramatic and henry grinned staring down at this handsome youth abbot robert blurted out if he is not the very image of count geoffrey he has my fathers coloring for certes henry agreed and his sense of style he has my fathers ready wit too did you hear rob what he said at his coronation feast to honor him i myself carried the great boars head dish to his table the archbishop of york commented that it was not every prince who was served by a king and hal said quick as a flash yes but it can be no condescension for the son of a count to serve the son of a king abbot robert did not see the humor in that flippant remark but he laughed dutifully because henry was laughing as he had been no admirer of count geoffrey of anjou though he hoped that hal had inherited nothing from his grandsire but his striking good looks swinging easily from the saddle hal soon joined his father up on the battlements choosing to climb a wooden ladder rather than gaining access to the ramparts by entering the keep spotting william marshal the head of hals household knights henry beckoned for him to come up too and then gathered his son into a welcoming embrace after exchanging hugs with his kinsmen hal courteously greeted the justiciar and abbot robert who gave him credit for having much better manners than count geoffrey tell him brother hamelin prompted nudging henry in the ribs and hal was instantly alert tell me what henry feigned a scowl at hamelins impatience but he was not one for waiting either i have a surprise for you lad hal had retained a childs love of surprises but some of his fathers surprises had seemed more like ambushes moreover he did not like to be called lad now that he was a man grown and an anointed king what he asked with more wariness than anticipation marguerite is here hal blinked in disappointment hed known marguerite for most of his life theyd been wed when he was five and she was two and a half he tended to think of her as a little sister when he thought of her at all oh he said politely wondering what he was supposed to say well her presence is but half of the surprise it is my intention to have her crowned this summer at winchester archbishop rotrou will preside and your cousin roger has agreed to take part too henry said with a playful smile at roger and because of the furor that becket caused about your coronation i have decided that you will be crowned againa gesture of good will toward the church hals interest was now fully engaged he loved pageantry and rituals and revelries his first thought was that they could hold a tournament afterward but he decided not to share that idea with his father knowing that henry disapproved of tourneys as frivolous wasteful and a threat to the public order his next thought was even better the realisation that his coronation would be the ideal opportunity to achieve a longdelayed desire and i could be knighted too henry was already shaking his head no lad not yet you know i think louis ought to be the one to knight you that would mean a great deal to him and go far toward mending the breach between us but i do not care who knights me all that truly matters is that it is done i am already seventeen how much longer must i wait some events are worth waiting for henry said giving his son a reassuring pat on the arm you are still young for such an accolade how old were you will when you were knighted caught off balance william marshal stiffened the last thing he wanted was to be pulled into this ongoing squabble between father and son twenty and one he said reluctantly feeling that hed somehow let hal down by speaking the truth hal was not easily discouraged though and how old were you he demanded of henry providing the answer himself a triumphant sixteen not for the first time henry wondered how he could have sired such obstinate offspring for hals brother richard was even more headstrong and mulish and thirteenyearold geoffrey was already showing signs of the same willfulness only little john and his joanna were biddable and easily pleased but a man wanted his sons to show pluck and spirit and so he did not deny hal outright promising vaguely to give his request serious consideration hal had heard this before for theyd been having this same argument since henrys return from ireland last month he was coming to the conclusion that his fathers promises were counterfeit coin they looked genuine but they could not be spent he was opening his mouth to protest further when roger intervened hal he said quietly i believe that is marguerite coming out of the hall youd best go down and greet her lad ere she feels slighted you know how sensitive lasses can be hal almost asked roger how he knew that what with him becoming a priest at such a young age but he was angry with his father not his cousin and his sense of fairness stifled the gibe nor did he want to hurt marguerite and he nodded grudgingly turning toward the ladder his gaze came to rest upon the girl below in the bailey and he came to an abrupt halt that cannot be marguerite at the sound of her name she glanced upward hal had not seen her in more than a year shed left england in april of and had spent most of her time since then at her fathers court hed remembered to send her gifts for new years and her saints day but shed always been on the periphery of his life the childwife whod eventually share his throne and bear his childrenone day far in the future until then he would not lack for female company girls had been chasing after him since he was thirteen and he usually let them catch him now he gazed down at the heartshaped face framed in a linen barbette the chinstrap made newly fashionable by his mother her fair hair covered by a gauzy veil of saffron silk and he was stunned by the changes in her she was so stylish of a sudden slim and curvy where shed been skinny and flat soso womanly he sketched a bow she responded with a graceful curtsy and he pantomimed that hed be down straightaway when he looked back at the men they were all grinning he was too amazed to take offense she is lovely he marveled counting surreptitiously on his fingers henry spared him the trouble she is fourteen now lad and as you say very lovely indeed hal hesitated umis she old enough to he flushed slightly but grinned too and his father laughed umi would say so but if you have doubts you can always ask her hal usually did not mind being teased could give as good as he got i will he said winked and headed for the ladder descending to the bailey so rapidly that they halfexpected him to land in a heap at marguerites feet instead he sprang lightly to the ground and was soon gallantly kissing his wifes hand as she blushed prettily and cast him adoring looks through fluttering lashes well henry said i do believe the lass is answering him without even being asked and they shared smiles remembering what it was like to be young and bedazzled by a comehither look a neatly turned ankle for henry memory took him back to a rainspangled garden in paris an afternoon encounter with louiss queen that would change lives and history he could still remember how breathtakingly beautiful eleanor was that day hed have been content to gaze into her eyes for hours trying to decide if they were green with gold flecks or gold with green flecks she had high finely sculpted cheekbones soft flawless skin hed burned to touch and lustrous dark braids entwined with goldthread ribbons he yearned to unfasten hed have bartered his chances of salvation to bury his face in that glossy perfumed hair to wind it around his throat and see it spread out on his pillow hed watched mesmerized as a crystal raindrop trickled toward the sultry curve of her mouth and wanted nothing in his life so much before or since as he wanted her shed known that louis was heeding his councils advice planning to divorce her and then compel her to wed a man of their choosing a pliable puppet whod keep her domains under the control of the french crown in that soaked summer garden shed taken her destiny into her own hands offering him aquitaine and herself and he was so besotted that he could not say which mattered more to him the richest duchy in europe or the woman in his arms theyd agreed to wait though for she shared his pragmatism as well as his passion and they both knew even a glimmer of suspicion and louis would never set her free nine months later they were wed in her capital city of poitiers never had he been happier not even on the day he became englands king lying entangled in the sheets on their wedding night shed confided that their lovemaking had been like falling into a fire and somehow emerging unscathed laughing huskily when he showed he was not yet sated and murmuring my lord duke tonight all of aquitaine is yours for the taking henry returned to reality with a start staring blankly at roger as he realized hed not heard a word of his cousins question eleanors alluring ghost receded into the past leaving him with a sense of wonder that twenty years could have passed since that torrid may night he also felt an odd sense of loss although he wasnt sure why i want to talk with you will he said abruptly and the young knight whod been sidling toward the ladder straightened his shoulders and braced himself for what he knew was coming ive been warned henry continued that my son has been consorting with the wrong company i cannot do much about his association with raoul de faye as he is the queens uncle but hal has gathered around him a band of youths who are rakehells and idlers lightminded callow malcontents several of them accompanied him to avranches juhel de mayenne simon de marisco adam dyquebeuf and hasculf de st hilaire you know them for what they are will know that barnacles clinging to a ships hull can slow it down even render it unseaworthy why did you not alert me that he was being led astray my lord king will was miserable knowing that whatever he said he was sure to be in the wrong either with his young lord or his sovereign why do you think i chose you to tutor my son in the arts of war and chivalry because you sit a horse well and can wield a sword there is no shortage of knights with those skills i chose you because you are steadfast and honest because you have more motherwit than most men because i thought i could rely upon you to watch over my son to keep him safe i would give my life for the young king will said simply with such sincerity that none of those listening could doubt him i do watch over him my liege ive done my best to teach him what he must know and i am proud of his prowess for he is an expert rider and has mastered both sword and lance with admirable ease but i cannot spy on him not even for you my lord king i am his sworn man and my first loyalty must be to him to do less would be a betrayal he would not forgive nor could i forgive myself the silence that followed was stifling girding himself to bear the kings wrath will raised his head and met henrys gaze the kings eyes were the color of smoke his mouth tightly drawn as if to stop angry words from escaping keep him from harm will he said at last do not let me down will swallowed knelt hastily and then retreated just as hastily vastly relieved by his reprieve but not fully understanding it rainald did not understand either the impudence of the man why were you so forbearing with him had he dared talk to me like that id have dismissed him straightaway if i did that henry said hal would lose the one trustworthy and honorable man in his service the one man whod be loyal to his last breath how would that benefit my son rainald do you not know how rare such men are men who put loyalty above ambition and greed and royal favor and even rainald realized that henry was speaking not only of william marshal but of thomas becket the false friend whod betrayed him for reasons he could never comprehend people had begun to gather at dawn before the cathedral church of st andrew the apostle not wanting to miss the spectacle of a king brought low forced to do penance like all mortal men they were to be disappointed henry arrived with the papal legates and barons and bishops beyond counting theyd all gone into the cathedral where henry swore upon the holy gospels that hed neither commanded nor desired that the archbishop of canterbury be slain and that when he was told of the crime he was horrified and truly grieved for the death of thomas of blessed memory he admitted though that the killing was the result of his heedless angry words and he pledged to honor the commitments made to holy church on this the last sunday before ascension in gods year the eighteenth year of his reign his son the young king then took an oath to honor all those commitments that did not relate only to henry but all of this was done out of sight and sound of the waiting crowds when henry finally emerged from the church the spectators were disappointed anew for he was not bareheaded and barefoot and clad only in his shirt a few men explained knowingly that he was spared the usual mortification because hed not been excommunicated but most of the bystanders took a more cynical view that kings were always accorded special treatment even by the almighty henry knelt upon the paving stones only then removing his cap and received public absolution by the cardinals albert and theodwin when he rose the cardinals and the bishop of avranches led him back into the cathedral a symbolic act of reconciliation with the church and the almighty the dissatisfied onlookers dispersed when they realized the show was over roger bishop of worcester stood alone for a moment before slowly reentering the church for he had been close enough to henry to hear him say softly after the absolution check thomas and mate chapter three june poitiers poitou from an open window of the queens solar in the maubergeonne tower maud countess of chester looked down upon a garden vibrant with summer flowers and echoing with youthful high spirits eleanors son geoffrey was playing quoits with two friends a game that was by its very nature boisterous and somewhat hazardous when the players were youngsters of thirteen and fourteen it was guaranteed that the horseshoes would be flung about with abandon missing the targeted hob more often than not scarring the grassy mead and scaring songbirds from budding fruit trees and overhanging willows the shouts of the boys and the barking of their dogs had drawn an audience of giggling girls all of them highborn and destined for the marriage beds of princes the oldest of the girls was mauds daughterinlaw bertrada whod wed her son hugh three years ago becoming at thirteen countess of one of englands richest earldoms the honour of chester the prettiest was geoffreys sister joanna only in her seventh year but already showing signs that shed inherited her mothers fabled beauty elevenyearold constance darkhaired and whipthin was a great heiress in her own right betrothed to geoffrey in early childhood she would bring to him the duchy of brittany and alys also eleven was a daughter of the french king plighttrothed to geoffreys older brother richard one day to rule with him over the vast lush domains of eleanors aquitaine eleanor and aquitaine maud always thought of her friend in those terms for it was aquitaine that had defined eleanor that had conferred upon her the queenships of france and then england few brides had ever brought such a dowry as aquitaine to their husbands eleanors duchy comprised the counties of poitou berry saintonge angouleme perigord the limousin la marche the auvergne the agenais and gascony stretching from the atlantic ocean to the massif central and the rhone valley from the pyrenees to the river loire it encompassed much of southwestern france dwarfing the lands controlled by the french king and it had been blessed by nature and god with a mild climate fertile soil deep river valleys ancient oak forests and some of the best vineyards in christendom by taking eleanor as his queen louis had gained greatly in stature and the french coffers had overflowed with the riches of aquitaine maud thought that her cousin harry might not even have won his crown had he not wed eleanor as soon as she was free aquitaine had been his steppingstone to the english throne mauds friendship with eleanor had endured for almost twenty years but shed never spent that much time in the other womans domains for neither had eleanor for much of her married life shed been traveling with henry or acting on his behalf in normandy and england or occupied with her many pregnancies it was only four years ago that shed taken up residence again in aquitaine holding her own court at poitiers and gathering the reins of government into her own hands turning away from the window maud wandered restlessly about the chamber eleanor had excused herself to confer with saldebreuil de sanzay her constable in poitou and maud was growing bored with her own company several charters were spread across a trestle table and she scanned the top one briefly it was a routine act of patronage remitting taxes for a citizen of la rochelle in exchange for his agreement to pay rent to the abbey of fontevrault what caught mauds attention was the change in the form of address instead of the usual fidelibus regis et suis it read fidelibus suis maud gazed down thoughtfully at the parchment eleanors charters had always begun to the kings faithful followers and hers this one was addressed simply to her faithful followers did it matter a careless mistake by her scribe or another feather in the wind a subtle but significant indication that eleanor was asserting her independence and her authority her right to govern in her own name a sudden spate of cursing drew her back to the window geoffreys friends had begun to quarrel over a throw and before long they were rolling around in the grass as geoffrey and the girls cheered them on maud watched serenely with two sons of her own she knew how little such youthful squabbles meant she didnt hear the opening door did not realize she was no longer alone until eleanor joined her at the window eleanor the mother of four sons paid even less heed than maud to the garden brawl petronillas daughter has just ridden in she said hazel eyes luminous with pleasure i was hoping shed arrive in time to witness richards investiture maud jogged her memory isabelle was the elder of petronillas two daughters wed as a child to the count of flanders alienor whod wed isabelles brotherinlaw the count of boulogne a few years ago was already here as far as maud knew eleanor had not spent much time with her sisters children that she had taken the trouble to make sure both girls were present in poitiers showed maud how much her friend missed petronilla whose death that past year had robbed eleanor of her last living link to a sundrenched blissful childhood to a time when shed been indulged and pampered and cherished as her fathers favorite in this exotic land she so loved below in the garden joanna had decided the tussling had gone on long enough and with an authority that would have done credit to a girl twice her age she demanded that the boys stop fighting they did probably glad of an excuse to end their pummeling but maud was amused by the little girls aplomb thinking that the young eleanor must have been just as selfassured and poised smiling at joannas mother she said are the rumors true about joanna that she may soon be plighttrothed to the king of sicily there have been talks eleanor confirmed but were still in the preliminary stages of negotiation so it is too soon to tell how it will go there is no hurry after all for joanna will only be seven in october i see no reason for her to grow up in a foreign court she said so emphatically that maud thought of joannas older sisters tilda had been the first to go wed two years ago in faroff saxony at the age of twelve then it was the turn of eleanors namesake known as leonora wed to the young king of castile at the age of nine the two women looked at each other the same thought in both their minds in their world princesses were born to be bartered for foreign alliances and although the church officially disapproved of child marriages it was a common occurrence henrys mother had been sent to germany at the age of eight marguerite had been wed to hal before she was three eleanor had been thirteen when her fathers unexpected death set in motion the events that would give her the crown of france and a life in exile maud had been older than eleanor but not by much when shed been married to the earl of chester a man utterly lacking in either honor or mercy but one of the great lords of the realm because she was quickwitted and resilient and pragmatic maud had learned to live in relative peace with her savage unstable husband to take solace and joy in her children and eventually to revel in the freedom of widowhood but she had made sure that her daughter would be no child bride beatrix had not wed ralph de malpas until after shed celebrated her nineteenth birthday as the only daughter in a family of sons maud had often longed for a sister and as she gazed at eleanor now it occurred to her that this woman was as close as any bloodsister could be they had much in common both beautiful in their youth both strongwilled proud and confident in their powers to charm both now within hailing distance of their fifth decade for they would celebrate their fortyeighth birthdays that summer i had an interesting conversation this morn with your niece alienor maud commented with a wry smile she wanted to know why i had never remarried after randolphs death i hope you did not shatter all her illusions about marriage eleanor said no less wryly you must remember that her parents were that rarity a couple whod wed for loveor lust and alienor seems content enough with her own husbandso far no i was circumspectfor me i said merely that my memories of randolph were too vivid for me to contemplate taking another husband eleanor laughed approvingly it is no easy feat for a wealthy widow to escape her legion of suitors you must have been very fleet of foot indeed dearest i made sure maud acknowledged never to leave my lands without a sizable escort one large enough to discourage any ambitious young lordlings with ambush and marriage on their minds knowing that eleanor had fended off two such attempts to force her into matrimony as shed journeyed back to aquitaine after her marriage to the french king had been annulled she indulged her curiosity to ask if you could have been certain eleanor that you need not fear being remarried against your will would you have remained unwed eleanors mouth tightened almost imperceptibly you do not truly think that the french court would have permitted that no sooner was the ink dry upon the annulment decree than louiss advisors were arguing amongst themselves deciding which french puppet to place in my bed had they even suspected id so hastily wed a man of my own choosing theyd never have allowed me to return to my own domains but yours was a conjectural question was it not so in that spirit be not entangled again in the yoke of bondage maud blinked for eleanor rarely let her bitterness show so nakedly your interpretation of scriptures is somewhat uncanonical she said dryly that is from st paul is it not if my memory serves he also said it was better to marry than to burn hardly a rousing endorsement of wedlock i have never understood eleanor confessed why the church sees lust as so great a sin why would the almighty have made coupling so pleasurable if it were so wrong but when i tried to argue that point with louis he was horrified that i dared to question the teachings of the holy fathers and it convinced him that we were a depraved and wanton lot we southerners he could never forgive himself for the carnal pleasures he found in my bed he was not much of a husband or a king either for that matter but by god hed have made a superb monk eleanors face shadowed for even now memories of her marriage to the french king were not welcome ones he may well have been right though about the people of the south we view lust as we do wine and food and laughter as essential ingredients for a joyful life my grandfatherah how he loved to vex his priests and distress his confessor he wrote troubadour poetry you know and some of it would have made a harlot blush he liked to joke that one day hed establish his own nunnery and fill it with ladies of easy virtue on our wedding night i told harry some of the more scandalous stories about my grandfather and he laughed until he nearly choked gasping that between us we had a family tree rooted in hell this last memory was both more pleasant and more painful than those from her marriage to louis and eleanor fell silent for several moments i think she said at last that i would have wed harry even if i were not threatened with a husband of the french courts choosing i wanted children for i knew louis would never let me see our two daughters and indeed he did not i needed an heir for aquitaine and i wanted to give harry sons to prove wrong those whod dared to call me a barren queen i always knew it was louiss failing not mine how could i conceive if i so often slept alone and i am assuming that you had no trouble getting harry into your bed maud queried so blandly that eleanor could not help smiling you could safely say that she conceded and maud felt a surge of sadness that things had gone so wrong between her cousin and his queen she remembered how it had once been remembered the early years of their marriage when theyd been so sure that the world like the english crown was theirs for the taking lusting after empires and each other striking such sparks with their quarreling and their lovemaking that the air around them always seemed charged as if a storm were about to break eleanors attention was focused again upon the gardens she was still a very handsome woman but even queens were vulnerable to the passage of time now though her smile was dazzling chasing away the years cares even regrets maud glanced over to see what she found so interesting another youth had sauntered into the garden accompanied by a huge wolfhound maud guessed him to be about sixteen for he was already taller than many grown men and he moved with the athletic grace of one utterly comfortable in his own body maud knew how unusual it was for one so young to have such physical presence both of her sons had been as clumsy and gangling as colts when they were this boys age he had curly redgold hair and a scattering of freckles and she would later marvel that she had not known his identity at once but it was not until joanna gave a delighted squeal and flung herself into his arms that she realized she was looking at eleanors second son richard who would on the morrow be invested as duke of aquitaine jesu that is richard indeed it is eleanor glanced curiously at her friend why do you sound so surprised because the last time i saw him he was a boy not a man he looks older than his years for he will not be fifteen until the autumn no september he was born on the nativity of our lady the first and only time that harry was present for one of my confinements maud grinned at the memory for shed been present too at richards birth i remember now harrys brother will later told me that theyd been hard put to keep him from bursting into the birthing chamber harry was never one for waiting below in the garden richard was swinging joanna in circles making her shriek with laughter the other girls had clustered around him but geoffrey and his friends did not seem as pleased by his arrival in their midst maud could not blame geoffrey for his discomfort although only a twelvemonth separated the birthdays of the two boys geoffrey looked like a child next to his brother his slightness of build and his lack of height cruelly accentuated by richards adult appearance mauds two sons had been allies from earliest childhood she suspected that was not the case with richard and geoffrey the sight of eleanors sons reminded her that all of the royal brood was not accounted for hal and marguerite were in normandy with her brother roger making plans for their coronation at winchester but no mention had been made of eleanors youngest nestling john the lastborn the afterthought the child jokingly dubbed john lackland by his father is john here too she asked and eleanor shook her head he is with the nuns at fontevrault she said and while her words were matteroffact her tone was dismissive maud was saddened but not surprised by the other womans indifference for she had been there for johns birth shed been summoned in haste by eleanors sister petronilla had been panicked fearing that eleanor might die in childbirth her fears were understandable for eleanor was fortytwo and the older a woman was the greater the risks she faced in the birthing chamber but the real reason for petronillas alarm was guilt she had made a grievous mistake she had told eleanor about henry and rosamund clifford maud turned her head aside not wanting eleanor to read her thoughts it was more than five years since eleanor had suffered so to give john life but to maud those grim memories would never fade she knew eleanor had not expected her husband to be faithful she was worldly enough to know that a man with an itch would scratch it but rosamund clifford had not been a passing fancy a bedmate whose name hed not remember come morning the daughter of a welsh marcher lord rosamund had been favored with a pretty face golden hair and a gentle docile nature and to the surprise of all but her ambitious conniving father she had stirred in henry more than lust maud supposed she should not have been so surprised by his liaison with this biddable girlwoman but shed expected better of her cousin a man worthy of eleanor of aquitaine ought not to be susceptible to fluttering lashes flattery and bedazzled adoration be that as it may he had taken rosamund to his bed a pardonable sin but hed then grown careless and indiscreet so much so that their trysts were soon an open secret heedless of eleanors pride he had installed rosamund at woodstock a favorite royal manor and soon afterward petronilla had decidedfor reasons known only to her and the devilto tell eleanor then in the seventh month of a difficult pregnancy of her husbands public infidelity eleanor had reacted as anyone but petronilla could have predicted although it was the dead of winter she took ship for england and headed straight to woodstock maud had not been witness to the meeting between her cousins queen and his concubine all she knew of it came from petronilla who had confided in baffled frustration that nothing had happened encountering the girl on the snowcovered path to the spring eleanor had spoken only four words how old are you and when rosamund as yet unaware of her identity had said she was nineteen eleanor had said nothing else she had petronilla reported indignantly just turned and walked away maud had understood eleanors response even if petronilla had not a woman heavy with child was at her most vulnerable clumsy and awkward in a strangers body it would be adding insult to injury for an aggrieved wife to discover that her husband was smitten with a girl young enough to be her own daughter eleanor had refused to remain at woodstock retreating to her palace at oxford and it was there that shed gone into labor weeks before the baby was due the birth had been a hard one and they had not been sure either mother or child would survive it but eventually eleanors last son was born a small dark creature who could not have been more unlike her other infants so sunkissed and robust and golden john had been fretful from the first almost as if he sensed his entry into the world had been unwelcome and when the exhausted eleanor had shown no interest maud had been the one to instruct the chaplain to baptize him for the saint whose day it was st john the evangelist maud had understood that john was a living reminder to eleanor of pain and humiliation and betrayal she had hoped that in time a mothers instincts would prevail over a wronged wifes resentment she was no longer sure that would ever happen in the years since johns birth eleanor and henrys marriage had suffered on the surface all seemed well but the telltale signs were there for those in the know eleanor had begun to pass most of her time in aquitaine ostensibly to soothe the rebellious inclinations of her restive recalcitrant barons henrys liaison with rosamund clifford continued although hed taken care to be much more discreet after his woodstock blunder their separations stretched out for months at a time it was no longer a certainty that theyd hold their christmas and easter courts together most troubling for maud eleanor had kept her distance in the aftermath of thomas beckets murder offering no comfort to henry at a time when he desperately needed it it was no surprise therefore that there was much gossip and speculation about their possible estrangement when shed learned from eleanor that they had never discussed rosamund or woodstock maud feared that they had crossed their rubicon from what little eleanor had confided and from all shed left unsaid maud had concluded that there had been a communication breakdown of monumental proportions eleanor proudest of the proud had waited for her husband to broach the subject of rosamund to offer her an apology for flaunting his mistress so openly but henry had utterly misread her silence vastly relieved that she had not given him an ultimatum had not demanded that he banish rosamund from his bed and life not understanding that she was unwilling to risk the humiliation of a refusal hed assumed that his worldly pragmatic wife did not see his infidelity as so great a sin grateful that shed chosen to deal with the problem of rosamund clifford by not even acknowledging there was a problem hed eagerly entered into their conspiracy of silence never once detecting the scent of burning bridges in the air if her cousin henry had allotted rosamund clifford too little significance mauds other male kin had given her too much her uncles rainald and ranulf and her brother roger were well aware that henrys relationship with his queen had taken a turn for the worse but they blamed rosamund for every fissure every crack in the foundation of the royal marriage maud knew better for she understood that it was far more complicated than a kings careless adultery eleanors greatest grievance was not a simpering lass with flaxen hair and smooth skin it was aquitaine always aquitaine it puzzled maud that her male relatives could not see this was it that men could not believe a woman might share their ambitions their need for power eleanor saw herself as more than henrys queen mother of his children first and foremost she was duchess of aquitaine never doubting that she could have ruled as well as any man and better than most she knew the importance of the dowry shed brought to each of her marriages but the expectations shed brought to those marriages were very different shed been given no say in her marriage to louis but in daring to wed henry shed taken her destiny into her own hands she had no intention to be subservient to her new husband what shed had in mind was a partnership it had not come to pass of course shed underestimated henrys strong will and overestimated the influence she could wield over him it was not that he believed as most men did that women were by their very natures incapable of exercising power or acting without male guidance no son of the empress maude could ever look upon women as mere broodmares and eleanor had counted upon that she had not realized though that henry was by his very nature unable to share power he had occasionally allowed her to act as regent in his absence but he always kept a firm hand on the reins nor did he accord her opinions the respect she felt they deserved utterly ignoring her warnings against elevating thomas becket to the archbishopric of canterbury too often shed found herself relegated to the sidelines or the birthing chamber more and more aware of the ultimate ironythat the husband shed discarded had paid her more heed than the one shed chosen for herself but henry had done more than circumscribe eleanors role as his queen hed usurped her role as ruler of aquitaine within two years of his coronation as englands king hed demanded that her barons do homage to him homage previously reserved for her alone the riches of aquitaine had gone into his coffers the coins issued in her domains bore his name not hers when their daughter had wed the king of castile two years ago he had given the province of gascony as her marriage portion not consulting eleanor as he disposed of lands shed expected to go to her heir to richard even after hed permitted her to return to poitiers he continued to control her financial and military resources keeping the real power in his own hands no rosamund clifford was only one of eleanors grudges the girl may have ignited the fire but the fuel was already stacked up awaiting such a spark the saddest aspect of it all to maud was that she was sure her cousin was utterly unaware of the depths of his wifes resentment she thought that he was undoubtedly the most brilliant man shed ever known with one great failing he seemed unable to view their world from any perspective but his own just as hed been oblivious to eleanors discontent he could not comprehend why his eldest son was so unhappy to be a king in name only maud had seen the damage his blindness had done to his marriage she could only hope that it would not prove as harmful with his sons another quarrel had broken out in the gardens below them this one between richard and geoffrey richard had demanded a turn in their game of quoits geoffrey had refused and now they were debating the issue in loud belligerent voices glancing at eleanor maud said diplomatically i imagine the lads are too near in years to get along with each other id wager they both are closer to hal not really eleanor admitted hal and geoffrey have their differences though they usually patch them up but richard and hal are like chalk and cheese squabbling over the most minor matters i keep hoping theyll outgrow it she added not very convincingly maud was surprised for hal was very easygoing with a flair for friendship it is only natural she ventured that richard would be jealous of hal it must be difficult for a youngster to understand why his older brother inherits the crown and the she got no further for eleanor had begun to laugh jealous richard good lord no richard cares not a fig for england gazing down at her second son she said with absolute certainty and great satisfaction richard does not begrudge hal his crown or kingdom not as long as he gets aquitaine on the following day the sunday after pentecost as church bells pealed and the citizens thronged to watch richard was escorted through the city streets to the abbey of st hilaire there archbishop bertram of bordeaux and bishop john of poitiers offered him the lance and banner that were the insignia of the duchy and he was officially recognized as count of poitou and duke of aquitaine maud had attended many opulent feasts in her life christmas fetes weddings a coronation she soon decided that eleanors revelries in her sons honor would rank among the most memorable the great hall was shimmering in light sun streaming from the open windows and ablaze with color the walls decorated with embroidered hangings in rich shades of gold and crimson new rushes had been strewn about fragrant with lavender sweet woodruff and balm because the hearth had not been lit the guests were spared the aggravation of smoke spiraling up toward the rafters and the air was sweet to breathe perfumed with honeysuckle and violet their seductive scents luring in from the gardens butterflies as blue as the summer sky the tables were as splendid as their surroundings draped in snowy white linen cloths set with silver wine cups and salt nefs and delicate finger bowls maud her son hugh and daughterinlaw bertrada were among the honored guests seated at the high table giving her an ideal vantage point to observe her fellow diners and the happenings in the hall clearly eleanor had spared no expense to make richards day as perfect as possible a small fountain bubbled with wine candelabras flared with candles of wax not tallow and maud was impressed to see that every guest had been provided with a knife for it was normally expected that people would bring their own utensils the food and drink were equally praiseworthy eleanor had ordered rich red wines from cahors and gascony costly sweet wine from cyprus and for the fortunate guests at the high table the celebrated saint pourcain from her auvergne a wine so outrageously expensive that even maud had rarely tasted it a trumpet fanfare announced the arrival of each course followed by ewers bearing lavers of warm perfumed water so guests could wash their hands the dishes were carried in on large platters and then ladled onto smaller plates called tailloirs at each table so that the diners could help themselves it was common practice for three people to share a tailloir but here too eleanor had been lavish and each dish was meant for two guests with those at the high table accorded an unheardof honor individual dishes for each one maud could not recall such a luxury at her cousins coronation not even at the famously extravagant fetes hosted by thomas becket in his days as henrys chancellor she was so delighted by the quality of the food that she contemplated halfseriously bribing eleanors cooks to join her household the guests were offered goose stuffed with herbs garlic grapes and sage there were grilled oysters and a lamprey torte with walnuts mint cloves and saffron a delicate soup of almond milk and onions with sops of bread pike in a white wine galentyne sauce a blancmange of venison meat blanched almonds rice and sugar the cooks had done themselves proud with the lighter dishes too providing an almond tart doucette and another of cream custard and the sweet wafers known as angels bread eleanor had even imported oranges from spain so that her cooks could prepare a comfit with the candied rind honey and ginger when the meal was finally done eleanors almoner collected the trenchersstale bread used as platesto be distributed to the poor and the trestle tables were dismantled so there would be room for entertainment harpists and flutists had played while the guests were eating but now livelier diversion was provided tumblers and daredevils juggling torches and swords maud had been invited to join eleanor and richard upon the dais so she had one of the best seats in the hall but she found her fellow guests more interesting than the performers virtually all of the highborn of aquitaine and the lands farther south were present eleanors own family was there of course to share richards triumph raoul de faye her maternal uncle and seneschal her other uncle hugh viscount of chatellerault his new wife ella and his son william her two nieces petronillas daughters isabelle and alienor her sister by marriage the lady emma of laval henrys half sister recently widowed but so beautiful that it was unlikely shed remain unmarried for long if anyone but maud thought it odd that henry was absent that opinion was not voiced according to eleanor henry had gone into brittany to deal with yet another rebellion but it was obvious to maud that he was not missed the lords of poitou were well represented saldebreuil de sanzay constable of poitou the count of la marche count william of angouleme and his son vulgrin geoffrey de rancon lord of taillebourg porteclie de mauze a distant cousin of eleanors and sir herve le panetier her steward aimar viscount of limoges and his wife sarah a daughter of mauds uncle rainald maud was particularly interested in the presence of the counts of la marche and angouleme and the viscount of limoges for theyd been the ringleaders in a rebellion against henry just four years ago she wondered if they were signaling by their attendance that they were hostile to henry not eleanor and richard or had they simply not wanted to miss such a celebrated fete the archbishop of bordeaux and bishop of poitiers were present as was the abbot of tournay and there was a large contingent from the lands to the south of aquitaine just as henry cast a long shadow so too did the other conspicuous absentee raimon st gilles count of toulouse the most powerful lord of the south and the most hated like his father before him raimon was ambitious ruthless and always dangerous count raimon had long been a sworn enemy of the dukes of aquitaine for eleanors father had a claim to toulouse maud thought the claim to be rather tenuous arising out of a disputed inheritance involving eleanors grandmother eleanor took it very seriously though enough to have convinced both of her husbands to assert her claim by force neither louis nor henry had succeeded in prying toulouse from count raimons grip but their failures had not discouraged eleanor and she continued to consider toulouse as rightfully part of her domains part of richards inheritance the jugglers had completed their performance and a troubadour had taken center stage the audience quieted and he began to sing a lovers plaint imploring his lady that she could make of him a begger or richer than any king so great was her power over him maud joined the other guests in applauding enthusiastically that was wonderful she exclaimed who is he that is levet raimbaut daurengas joglar seeing mauds blank look eleanor leaned over to explain further a joglar is similar to a jongleur a court performer most troubadours do not sing their own compositions not those of high birth like raimbaut or countess biatriz maud had glanced curiously toward raimbaut daurenga regretting that she was no longer young for this southern lord was as handsome as he was talented but her head swiveled back toward eleanor at the mention of countess biatriz the countess of valentinois she is a troubadour too she calls herself a trobairitz but yes she is very gifted and i hope that well hear some of her songs tonight raimbauts sister the lady tibors is a trobairitz too i believe maud was fascinated for it was very unusual in their world for women to compose poetry the only female writer she knew was henrys half sister the abbess of shaftsbury who wrote skillful lais and fables under the name marie de france and here were two women poets as guests at eleanors table why did women troubadours flourish here and not elsewhere a slender darkeyed woman followed the joglar and mauds interest sharpened for surely she must be going to perform one of the compositions of the countess biatriz much to her disappointment the song was in the lengua romana the language of the south is she not going to sing in french eleanor shook her head i forgot that you do not know the lengua romana in my grandfathers youth the dialect of poitou was very similar to the lengua romana or lemozi as they call it but nowadays poitevin is more like the french of the north most of those in my lands speak both tongues and i made certain that richard was tutored in the lengua romana slide your chair closer and i will translate for you ive lately been in great distress over a knight who once was mine she quoted she says she loved him to excess but he betrayed her because she could not sleep with him night and day she suffers lamenting her mistake mauds eyes widened is it common for women of the south to be so bluntspoken eleanor grinned in one of the other verses of that song she declares that shed give almost anything to have her handsome knight in her husbands place maud shook her head in bemusement life is truly different in these southern regions especially for women women are more free to speak their minds eleanor agreed and men even listen to us at times for power is not solely a male preserve here we do not follow the practice of primogeniture the eldest son does not inherit his fathers estate it is divided up amongst all the sons and often it is bequeathed to a daughter take the countess of mauguio over there she inherited mauguio upon her fathers death and held it in her own right through two marriages last year her son dared to call himself count of mauguio and began to intrigue with the house of montpellier long an adversary of her family she was outraged by what she saw as his betrayal i do not blame her maud exclaimed i have so often heard sad stories like this women swept aside like so much chaff by male kin unwilling to wait for their inheritance ah but this is not france or england the countess of mauguio struck back swiftly disinheriting her impatient son in favor of her granddaughter maud was amazed she could do that eleanors eyes reflected the closest candle flame taking on greenish glints in its flickering light this is not england or france she repeated proudly and maud could only nod thinking indeed not raimbaut daurengas joglar had taken up a gittern again making ready to sing another of his lords compositions his earlier french rendition had been a courtesy for the poitevin guests but now he chose his own language the lyrical lengua romana of the troubadour cars douz e fenhz del bederesc mes sos bas chanz per cui maerc cab joi sespan viu e noire without eleanor to translate for her the words held no meaning for maud she discovered it was easy to be caught up in the flow of the language though for it held a melodic harmony that french or english lacked putting her in mind of the softer sounds of spanish or italian it was a beautiful tongue this lengua romana but an alien one and as she listened she fully comprehended for the first time that this was an alien world too eleanors aquitaine chapter four november gisors castle norman vexin marguerite wished that she did not feel so shy with this stranger who was her father she did not doubt that the french king was a kindly man a good man quick to smile slow to find fault the vices of his youthhis temper his stubbornnesshad been mitigated by the passage of time and his piety was acclaimed by all she knew he was in his fiftythird year an age that seemed ancient to a girl not yet fifteen his flaxen hair was sparse around his crown like a monks tonsure and his eyes were heavylidded but still as brightly blue as a summer sky shed always been thankful that shed inherited his fairness and not the unfashionable dark coloring of her dead mother a spanish princess she could not remember shed heard it said that hed been comely in his youth and she supposed it might well be true but if she could visualize louis in his prime she could not see him wed to her husbands mother each time shed tried to envision louis and eleanor together her imagination failed her it occurred to her that she could count on the fingers of one hand the times shed been alone with louis for shed been sent to king henrys court before shed celebrated her first birthday but shed grown up knowing that she was the daughter of the king of france knowing what a proud heritage that was and never doubting that this father shed so rarely seen had not forgotten her now though she was discovering that they had little to say to each other and when louis suggested that they seek out her husband she felt a surge of relief for hal was never at a loss for words a tiltyard had been set up in the northern end of the upper bailey and the young king of england had drawn an admiring audience a skilled rider hal had made several successful runs at the quintain hitting the target deadon each time whereas his competitors were not so fortunate as louis and marguerite approached a knight struck the shield a glancing blow and was unhorsed when he was smacked by the sandbag attached to a wooden pivot when it was hals turn again he drove his tenfoot lance into the shield with enough force to set the quintain post vibrating well done louis called out loudly enough for hal to hear and then in a lower tone to marguerite the lad could not look more like a king with the blessed crown of jerusalem upon his head i think so too she agreed so ardently that louis smiled pleased that she seemed to have found such happiness in her marriage at that moment marguerite happened to notice the boy watching from the sidelines a pale solemn child with an untidy shock of brown hair her half brother philippe so jubilant had louis been upon philippes birth on an august evening seven years ago that he became known as philippe dieudonne the godgiven louis had already sired four daughters but philippe was his hearts joy an only son born late in life to a man whod long despaired of begetting a male heir never had marguerite seen such a doting father and as she glanced over at her little brother she found herself thinking unkindly that no one would ever say of philippe what louis had just said of hal once hal caught sight of them he tossed his lance to a squire and swung from the saddle he greeted louis with a flourish acknowledging their kinship both by marriage and vassalage for hed done homage to the french king for the duchy of normandy slipping his hand into marguerites he entwined their fingers together a silent but subtle declaration of unity that louis noted approvingly he was very pleased with this young soninlaw of his for hal was goodnatured and gallant but also malleable and overly eager to claim his kingship chaffing at the bit like a finely bred stallion ready to run come walk with me louis said shepherding them in the direction of the gardens bare and fallow under a pallid november sun passing through the wicker gate he seated himself upon a wooden bench gesturing for them to join him your invitation to meet me at gisors gladdened my heart he murmured and was a most welcome surprise for id heard that you planned to remain in england into the new year holding your christmas court at winchester that was our intent hal admitted hesitating before confirming what louis already knew but my lord father summoned me to return to normandy adding after another longer pause and of course i obeyed but not willingly louis thought not willingly at all marguerite told me that you came to gisors straightaway from the harbor at barfleur how long shall i have the pleasure of your company ere you must seek out your lord father hals shoulders twitched in a half shrug in truth he said i am in no hurry to see my father finding a smile he said wryly the church holds that fighting during christmastide is a sin a violation of the truce of god are you so sure that you and your father will quarrel once you are together louis asked and hal raised his head his eyes searching his fatherinlaws face he seemed to be making up his mind how much to confide and marguerite leaned over whispered something in his ear too softly for louis to hear am i sure that we will quarrel hal said at last noit need not be i have only to defer to my father in all matters stifle my complaints accept his judgment without question or qualm and we will be in perfect accord louis was faintly surprised that the wound had already begun to fester the lad was like his father in one way if no othertheir mutual lack of patience if you were to defer to henry in all matters he said mildly you would be a puppet prince not an anointed king hal stood up suddenly began to pace if you see that so clearly why cannot my father well we shall have to make him see turning then to his daughter louis suggested that she make sure that her little brother philippe did not get into any mischief whilst he and her husband continued their discussion marguerite had been taught that obedience was a womans duty and she did not object to being dismissed so summarily as she exited the garden she glanced back and smiled at the sight meeting her eyeshal and her father talking quietly together their heads almost touching their faces intent he has found an ally in papa she thought and with a light step she went to find philippe normandy was a land honeycombed with castles but none were as formidable as the clifftop stronghold overlooking the river ante beneath the walls of falaise the village straggled down the steep slope its narrow street deserted in the chill november twilight from a window in the upper chamber of the castles great keep meliora looked in vain for signs of life the villagers were huddled by their hearths secure in the shadow of the royal fortress as night descended over the norman countryside meliora pulled the shutters into place with a shiver went to stand by the chambers sole source of heat a brazier heaped with charcoal she knew her mistress did not like falaise and she understood why the castle had dominated the valley for one hundred years and had been designed for defense the towering rectangular keep was impregnable but not particularly comfortable rosamund cliffords chamber was neither spacious nor well lighted although the wall hangings were made of costly lincoln wool and the canopied bed was piled high with plush coverlets since henry was so rarely there to keep her warm at night he at least saw to it that she did not lack for furlined blankets rosamund was seated before a wooden frame working upon an altar cloth of finely woven spanish linen she was an accomplished needlewoman and passed much of her free time embroidering church vestments she had recently finished a beautiful crossstitched chasuble for the priest at godstow priory and meliora supposed that the altar cloth was meant for godstow too as rosamund was very generous to the nunnery where shed been educated she looked up with a quick smile as meliora drew near and the older woman smiled back wishing that rosamund did not look so pale so fragile when the king had engaged her for rosamund she had accepted eagerly for she was a widow twice over with grown children and she preferred life on a larger stage than her home village back in cornwall shed assumed that the king wanted her to act as a shepherd keeping his little lamb safe from wolves shed not expected though that his lamb would become so dear to her nor had she expected that her employment would last so long far more pragmatic than the conventreared rosamund shed assumed that the kings passion for the girl would soon flame out but seven years later the fire still burned although she wondered cynically if their frequent separations played a role in that she often thought rosamund must be the most neglected concubine of all time for her royal lover practically lived in the saddle patrolling the length and breadth of his empire with a speed that seemed to defy the laws of nature when the french king had remarked sourly that he could almost believe henry had learned how to fly he was speaking for legions of frustrated adversaries and thwarted rebels but to meliora henrys remarkable mobility meant only that most of rosamunds nights were lonely ones i do not suppose she said that the king told you how long our stay at falaise will last rosamund shook her head i doubt that he knows himself he expects to be in normandy for the rest of the year and so it makes sense for me to be here falaise is conveniently located accessible from most areas of the duchy meliora agreed that falaise was well situated but she suspected that henrys choice had also been influenced by the fact that it was not a castle favored by his queen he would not want to risk another awkward woodstock encounter given falaises history meliora found it rather ironic that he should have tucked his mistress away here of all places where one of christendoms most notorious liaisons had begun from these castle battlements a duke of normandy had noticed a young girl washing laundry in the village stream below bedazzled by her beauty he took her as his bedmate and the following year she gave birth to a son marriage was out of the question for arlette was only a tanners daughter but the duke recognized their son as his and when he later took the cross he named william as his heir against all odds the boy known as william the bastard would lay claim to the duchy and end his days as king of england as for arlette shed married well after her lovers death and this tanners daughter would be remembered as the mother of a king a bishop and a count during these past weeks at falaise meliora found herself thinking often of arlette her duke and their bastardborn son who would become the greatgrandfather of englands current king she wanted to believe that rosamund would be as lucky as arlette but she did not think it likely arlette had been strong enough to defy the world prideful enough to ride through the main gate of the castle when the duke summoned her no back alleys for her whereas rosamund reminded meliora of a flower set down in alien soil she was too tender too delicate to thrive at the royal court the two women were unlike in another way too arlette had been fertile while rosamund was barren meliora supposed that it was not entirely accurate to apply that cruel term to rosamund for twice shed gotten with child only to miscarry in the early weeks of the pregnancy what saddened meliora the most was rosamunds lack of hope as much as she yearned for children even children born out of wedlock she had no expectations of motherhood she loved henry enough to live in sin with him but she never forgot that they were sinning and she saw her failure to conceive as gods punishment for those sins rosamunds head was bent over the altar cloth and meliora reached out brushed aside the long blond braid dangling across the embroidery frame she was not usually given to whimsical notions but it seemed to her that she could sense arlettes bold spirit in the chamber with them a ghostly presence watching over rosamund with that most condescending of emotionspity rosamunds breathing had quickened coming in audible gasps and she was clutching at the sheets like one grasping for a lifeline when henry gently shook her shoulder she jerked upright eyes wide and unfocused and he said soothingly it was but a bad dream love no more than that she rolled over into his arms clinging with such urgency that he gazed down at her in surprise you truly are disquieted what did you dream to give you such a fright i do not remember she lied in truth she remembered all too well for this was a recurrent nightmare one that troubled her sleep several times a year it was always the same she was lost in the woods alone and afraid as darkness came on it matters for naught she assured him just a silly dream i am so sorry beloved for awakening you i was not asleep he admitted and she strained to make out his features in the shadows a faint glimmer of lamplight filtered through the slit in the bed hangings not enough to illuminate his face hed arrived long after nightfall as usual without warning and wasted no time in carrying her off to bed so the only conversation theyd had so far was carnal in nature what chases away your sleep she asked so solicitously that he brushed her mouth with a quick kiss my eldest son sitting up he shoved a pillow behind his shoulders hal came back from the french court with a head full of foolish notions and saddle bags stuffed with laments the lad has begun to collect grievances like a miser hoarding coins i cannot imagine what grievances he might have with you you made him a king well he now sees that as an empty honor he complains that i have not provided him with income adequate to his rank that i have given him naught but promises that i continue to delay his knighthood and to refuse to allow tournaments in my domains and above all that i treat him like a raw stripling instead of a man grown rosamund was not deceived by his matteroffact recital of hals complaints i think she said indignantly that he owes you more gratitude than this henrys mouth tightened hal insists that he be given the governance of either england or normandy and i know full well who planted that baneful seed the lad has always paid heed to the wrong people and when he opens his mouth these days the french kings words come tumbling out you refused him of course of course he is far too young to govern on his own nor can his judgment yet be trusted his susceptibility to louiss blandishments proves that all too well what happened when you denied his demand he went off in a rage is sulking with the little marguerite at bonneville henry was both angered and hurt by hals willfulness and with rosamund he had the luxury of candor i had no choice but to refuse him rosamund he is not ready for such responsibilities after his coronation id instructed him to meet with the canterbury monks it is past time for the archbishopric to be filled again but the monks have balked at accepting my nominee the bishop of bayeux and id hoped that hal might make them see reason he met with them only briefly at windsor showed little interest in resolving the dispute it grieves me to say it but he seems more intent upon the pursuit of pleasure than in learning the duties of kingship she did not need to see his face now she could hear the unhappiness in his voice and she wanted desperately to offer comfort it was her private opinion that hal was flighty spoiled and immature but she saw no reason to share it with henry he is very young she ventured and as shed hoped henry seized upon that aye that he is he kept reminding me that i was just seventeen when my father turned normandy over to me but i doubt that i was ever as young as hal he sounded more bemused now than irate it is not his fault life has been so much easier for him i had to fight for my kingship and halwell hal has always known he would be king after me mayhap it is not so surprising that hed take longer to reach manhood not surprising at all she said knowing that was what he needed to hear and when he slid an arm around her shoulders she could feel that some of the tension had ebbed his muscles were no longer so tightly corded hes a good lad you know a son to be proud of he is too easily influenced but that is a fault of youth and inexperience hell learn better he has the makings of a fine king rosamund he does not lack for courage or wit and he is amiable spirited and very generoustoo much so although she could not see his face it sounded as if he was smiling it is expected that a lord be openhanded and bountiful next to valor that is the most admired of virtues but hals generosity is rapidly becoming the stuff of legend he bestows his largesse upon his followers as if he were midas one reason why he has attracted so many drones idlers and parasites but he ought not to be blamed for the greed of others it is commendable that he wants to take care of his household knights i only wish he were not quite so lavish since the money hes spending is mine he laughed softly but it is his nature to share and i doubt that will ever change last year he was out hunting with some friends and they stopped at a pond to water their horses and eat a meal when hal discovered that he did not have enough wine for them all he emptied it into the pond so they all could have a taste laughing again he gave rosamund an affectionate hug say what you will the lad has a knack for the grand gesture as king that will stand him in good stead he just needs seasoning needs time she murmured agreement grateful that shed been able to ease his mind what harm did it do if he made allowances for his sons bad behavior if he was right and hals shortcomings were those of youth time would remedy them and tonight at least his sleep would be untroubled the welsh love of their homeland ran deep and they often sickened when uprooted from welsh soil they had a word for this heartfelt longing hiraeth which expressed the sorrow of exile the sadness for what had been lost a yearning for what could have been two years after their banishment from gwynedd by a vengeful welsh prince rhiannon and ranulf had found little contentment in england rhiannons pain was keener for her husband was only halfwelsh and hed not adopted her country as his own until he was grown rhiannon had never known another world trefriw called to her in her nighttime dreams and in her daylight reveries her aged father was there as was her younger sister and her newly married daughter her mother was buried in the tiny graveyard at llanrhychwyn the chapel in the hills above trefriw where she and ranulf had been wed shed gone blind in childhood and the few memories she had of sight were visions of gwynedd england was an alien land would never be hers but her love for her husband was greater than her love for wales when hed told her that he was loath to tear her away from the only life shed known she had quoted scriptures to him entreat me not to leave thee for whither thou goest i will go and where thou lodgest i will lodge thy people will be my people and thy god my god if she had not been able to make his people hers as she had pledged she never regretted her decision to follow him into english exile and because she knew how restless he was how dispirited she had not objected when he wanted to answer the english kings summons even though it meant venturing into a world more foreign to her than england she agreed to accompany him to his nephews christmas court at chinon castle in touraine henry had fallen in love with chinon as a young boy and his affection for the castle had only deepened over the years he liked its locationrising up against the sky on a high hill overlooking the river vienne he appreciated its ancient history for the site had once been occupied by a roman fort he valued its formidable defenses protected on three sides by steep cliffs and blocked on the fourth side by a chasm of his making hed spent considerable sums on chinon the round tour du moulin was his work as was the square tour du tresor where crown revenues were stored and hed renovated the royal residence and great hall along the south side of the castle bailey when it had come time to choose where to hold his christmas court his decision had been an easy one on the day before christmas the great hall echoed with the clamor of laughter and music after a lavish midday meal guests were dancing that popular favorite the carol while others preferred a less energetic activity engaging in conversation enlivened by the regions excellent wines from his seat upon the dais henry watched the pageantry a vibrant panorama of color and sound and motion he was playing a rare role for him that of a bystander for hed twisted his ankle spearing the wild boar that would grace his christmas table and hed propped his injured leg upon a footstool reluctantly acquiescing with his doctors orders at least for a day or two he did not mind missing the carol for dancing was not one of his passions but he did mind the enforced idleness even during mass he was restless impatient known to pick his priests for the brevity of their sermons hobbled now by a strained ankle he could only occupy himself with mental musings it puzzled him that hed not found more pleasure at chinon it had been several years since hed had so many of his family under one roof his queen his sons richard geoffrey and john his daughter joanna his uncles rainald and ranulf his half brother and half sister hamlin and emma his cousins roger and maud only his eldest son was absent expected daily to arrive from normandy virtually all of his english and norman and angevin barons were there most of his bishops even many of eleanors lawless poitevin lords his christmas court was a resplendent success a dazzling reflection of his power and prestige tangible proof of his status as the greatest king in christendom so why was he not better pleased by it his gaze swept the hall coming to rest upon the regal elegant figure of his wife theyd often been apart during their two decades of marriage but never so long as this last separation nigh on two years he hadnt been sure what to expect but so far their reunion had gone well enough no woman could act the queen more impressively than eleanor even after all these years he was still proud to enter a hall with her on his arm as he watched his wife the corner of his mouth curved and pleasurable warmth began to spread throughout his body centering in his groin their nights lovemaking had left him sated scratched and wondering how he could have stayed away from her bed for so long in his thirtynine years hed had women beyond counting or remembering but none had ever stirred his lust so easily as the one hed wed hed often joked that she could kindle a flame quicker than summer lightning and last night shed done just that radiating so much heat that hed halfexpected to find scorch marks on the sheets in some ways she was still an enigma to him strongwilled passionate stubborn worldly too clever by half infuriating seductive prideful daring even reckless tallying up her vices and virtues he was amused to realize he could not be sure which were which but on this christmas eve at chinon castle he was more than willing to give her the benefit of every doubt for he missed their easy intimacy the mutual instinctive understanding that had been theirs since that rainy afternoon in a paris garden it had been a long time since hed felt that they were in such natural harmony beckoning to a servant he instructed the man to fetch his queen and then on impulse his uncle hed planned to give ranulf his surprise on christmas morn but he saw no reason to wait ranulf hastened over shepherding his wife and young son morgan up onto the dais henry ordered chairs to be brought out for them watching from the corner of his eye as his servant caught eleanors attention she would not come at once for she was not a woman to be summoned she would wait just long enough to make it seem as if she were obeying a whim of her own stifling a smile for he was pleased that he could still read her so well he began to exchange the usual courtesies with ranulf and rhiannon as always henry was intrigued by rhiannons ability to follow the sound of his voice her head tilted she turned her brown eyes toward him so unerringly that few would have suspected her blindness after hed inquired after their other children a recently wed daughter and a grown son he directed his attention to morgan asking his age and grinning at the boys answer eight years ten months for he could remember when he too had marked birthdays as milestones in accordance with custom boys of good birth were sent to live in a lords household to receive their education and henry was surprised that no such provisions had been made for morgan when ranulf admitted that they had not yet chosen a lord to supervise his sons instruction henry suggested that morgan join the royal household ranulf was momentarily at a loss both honored and conflicted by the offer he was well aware what a great opportunity this would be for the boy but it was complicated by morgans welshnorman blood his elder son had chosen rhiannons world over ranulfs even changing his baptismal name of gilbert to the welsh bleddyn and hed chosen too to remain in wales with gilberts example in mind ranulf was not sure what was best for morgan for rhiannon it was much simpler she did not want to be separated from her son yet she knew it was inevitable sons were sent away at an early age in wales too that was the practice because shed steeled herself for just such a moment she kept silent waiting with outward composure for ranulf to decide their sons future only the tightening of her hand on morgans shoulder revealed her inner turmoil ranulf opened his mouth still not sure what he would say but morgan was quicker hed overheard his parents discussing his education on several occasions knew that they were deciding between the households of the earl of cornwall the earl of chester and a welsh lord named cynan ab owain glancing from his father to his cousin the king he made his own choice say yes papa he entreated say yes ranulf knelt so they were at eye level his eyes searching the boys face are you sure and when morgan nodded he said well harry it seems to be settled good ill keep an eye on the lad never fear now we have another matter to discuss ive had an interesting offer recently from a welsh prince you love notdavydd ab owain henry broke off then as eleanor drifted over to the dais and invited her to join them once she was seated beside him he said you are just in time love we were talking about a prince of north wales davydd ab owain the one who banished ranulf the very one i never understood uncle just why he was so out of sorts with you what did you do to earn his disfavor i was a friend of the man he killed the man who ought to have been ruling gwynedd in his stead ah yes hywelthe poet prince a good man a far better one than davydd henry shifted in his seat turning toward eleanor i am not sure if you remember love but hywel and davydd were both sons of owain gwynedd hywel being the eldest the most capable and the bestloved but davydd and another brother rhodri lay in wait for hywel after owains death and he was slain in their ambush owains surviving sons then divided up his lands davydd is no longer content with his share of the pie though is casting a covetous eye upon his brother maelgwns portion the isle of anglesey so in order to war upon maelgwn he wants to make peace with england having figured out that only a fool would fight battles on two fronts that sounds like davydd ranulf shook his head in disgust make him pay dear for his peace harry i did henry assured him he must truly be hungry for maelgwns lands as he agreed to all my terms without argument i think youll be particularly interested in one of his concessions uncle you are welcome to reside again in his domains welcome to return to your manor attrefriw was it truly ranulf stared at henry incredulously he agreed to this rhiannons french was quite serviceable by now for shed been wed to ranulf for more than twenty years but she was suddenly unsure of her mastery of his language afraid to believe what she thought shed heard we can go home she asked doubtfully and when henry confirmed it she buried her face in ranulfs shoulder and wept for joy ranulf was blinking back tears himself holding her in an embrace that was oddly private in such a public setting for that moment they were oblivious to the crowded hall the curious stares even their wideeyed young son watching with a smile henry brushed aside their euphoric expressions of gratitude joking that he feared theyd misunderstood him it was wales theyd be going back to not eden eleanor who was fond of both ranulf and rhiannon leaned over and murmured an approving well done but then she said harry in a very different tone glancing toward her he saw that she was looking across the hall at a new arrival a tall figure still clad in traveling clothes a mudsplattered hooded mantle even at a distance henry recognized him at oncewilliam marshal his son hals sworn manand fear caught at his heart his injured ankle forgotten he was on his feet by the time william marshal reached the dais he knelt saying my liege my lady in a low voice my son henry swallowed for his mouth was suddenly dry what have you come to tell us will the younger mans head came up sharply ah no my liege your son is well i swear it relief rendered henry speechless for a moment what did you expect me to think he said angrily for anger was an emotion he could acknowledge you arrive in our midst like the grim reapers henchman looking as if you bear the weight of the world on your shoulders christ jesus will ive seen happier men about to be hanged i am indeed sorry my lord king to have alarmed you for naught although henry gestured impatiently for him to rise will stayed on his knees if i seem troubled it is because i am loath to deliver this message your sonhe bade me inform you that he will not be attending your christmas court at chinon he is holding his own court at bonneville i fear henry said that i could not get out of this bed if the castle caught fire jesu woman are you seeking to kill me my very bones feel like melted wax eleanor cocked a skeptical brow if lust could kill harry youd have been dead years ago i never claimed to be a monk love that was your first husband as i recall amused in spite of herself she hid her smile in the crook of his arm mock him if you will but poor louis has you beaten in one race at leasthis sprint toward sainthood i grant you that he conceded but unlike louis i never wanted a halo only a crown propping himself up on an elbow he entwined his fingers in the dark river of her hair he loved it flowing loose like this his mind still filled with erotic images from their lovemaking her long tresses tickling his chest a silken rope looped around his throat whipping wildly about her face when she tossed her head from side to side you realize he said that weve likely scandalized the court disappearing in the middle of the afternoon for a daylight tryst what truly scandalized the court is that you were off bedding your wife and not your concubine what sort of example is that to set for your barons henry was instantly alert not sure if she was being sarcastic or playful or finally throwing down the gauntlet about rosamund he felt a prickle of resentment for it was very unsporting to ambush a man in the aftermath of sex what concubine he asked warily trying not to sound defensive what concubine she echoed mockingly come now harry you do not expect me to believe that youve been sleeping alone these two years past i think it is safe to assume that you found a bedmate or two or three in the course of your travels his first reaction was relief that this was not about rosamund after all she was gazing up at him serenely with just the suggestion of a smile but those greenishgold eyes had never looked more catlike utterly inscrutable and he found himself thinking of the way cats played with their prey before moving in for the kill i plead guilty he said i did occasionally take a woman to warm my bed but surely you would not fault me for that eleanor you might as well blame a man for eating when hes hungry i could not agree more you need not fret harry i know full well what matters and what does not it was interesting to see that she could so easily make him squirm over his little trifle but she had no intention of pursuing it further that ship had sailed henry chose to take her words at face value for that allowed him to preserve their marital peace without paying too high a price for it i do not say it as often as i ought but you hold my heart he said and then grinned and any other body parts you care to claimas long as you give me a chance to get my strength back first a most tempting offer my lord husband but one best deferred till tonight sitting up she shook her hair back and then because shed always faced her fears headon she added with studied nonchalance in truth harry youve worn me out i am not as young as i once was after all henry yawned his gaze lazily tracking the curves of her body so familiar and still so pleasing to the eye surely you know love that fruit is sweeter once it has ripened he said thinking that the female body must surely be one of gods greatest works a treasure trove that never lost its allure no matter how often he explored its riches eleanor studied his face it was true he could play fast and loose with the truth when it served his purposes but hed never been gallant never been one for courtship compliments hed once admitted that he could see no reason for lavish flattery for if a woman was beautiful she already knew it and if she were not shed know he lied so when he said he still found her desirable she did not doubt him of course he had no notion of the effort it took to keep the years at bay or that shed come to see time as the enemy yawning again henry swung his legs over the side of the bed his mellow mood notwithstanding eleanor had not expected him to remain abed with her not with so many daylight hours remaining to keep him idle hed need to be shackled to the bedpost not bothering to summon a servant hed begun to collect the clothing theyd discarded in such haste wrapping her arms around her knees she remembered how much shed liked to watch him naked for unlike her first husband hed always been quite comfortable in his own skin she still enjoyed the sight of his nudity for his constant activity had kept him fit deep chested with wellmuscled arms and the bowed legs of one whod spent much of his life on horseback he was she thought a fine figure of a man shed missed having him in her bed of the secrets she kept from him none of them involved their lovemaking shed never had to feign pleasure with him if her satisfaction was bittersweet it was because shed felt the need to compete with his little sugarsop to prove she knew his body and his wants far better than rosamund clifford ever could it shamed her that she could not dismiss the clifford chit as easily as she had the other sluts hed bedded but as well as she lied to others she could not lie to herself and shed become acutely aware of their age difference in the beginning it had not troubled her at all that she was nine years older that was no longer true not since hed taken up with a girl young enough to be her daughter watching as he shrugged into his shirt and pulled his braies up over his hips she was angry with herself for her lack of pride and angry with him for his lack of loyalty she could forgive his physical infidelity his emotional infidelity she could not gathering up her gown chemise and silken hose he deposited them within reach at the foot of the bed shall i call for one of your ladies love shed need help taming her tousled tangled hair but she was not ready to rejoin the world waiting beyond that bedchamber door there were matters still to discuss matters more important than desires of the flesh what mean you to do about hals latest defiance henry was pulling his tunic over his head and his voice was muffled in its folds once he was free he said ruefully i was hoping youd have some suggestions eleanor what ails the boy he is a king for the love of christ why is that not enough for him he wants more than privileges and prestige harry he wants to exercise power can you truly blame him at his age youd have demanded no less at his age id been fighting for two years to claim the crown stolen from my mother he keeps throwing that at methe fact that i was younger than he is now when i took command of normandy but we both know that is a false comparison for all the love i bear him hal is not ready to rule on his own when left to his own devices he passes his time playing those damnable tourney games carousing with dubious companions and spending money like a drunken sailor if one of those coxcombs who cluster around him like bees to honey expresses admiration for his new mantle like as not hell strip it off and hand it over whilst he was in england the exchequer could not keep track of all the bills submitted by merchants for his rash expenditures look at that foolishness at bonneville last month he threw a feast restricted to knights named william for the love of god they came out in droves too more than a hundred of them eager to wallow at the trough eating and drinking enough to feed an entire town for a week eleanor could not keep from smiling and you see no humor at all in that no i do not he insisted but the corner of his mouth was twitching and after a moment he conceded well somebut id find it much more amusing if i were not paying the bills he was scanning the floor rushes for his leather belt and dagger sheath after christmas i go to auvergne to meet with the count of maurienne i know she responded irked by his sudden change of subject she was familiar with his newest schemeto secure a future for their youngest nestling by marriage to the counts daughter and heiress the arrangements had been made months ago he would journey to auvergne meet the count while mediating a dispute between the king of aragon and her personal bete noire count raimon of toulouse and then hed escort the count and his young daughter to limoges where the marriage contract would be sealed but it was hal she wanted to discuss not john and she was about to steer the conversation back to their eldest son when henrys next words showed his mention of auvergne was not a digression after all wed agreed that youd continue on to limoges with our sons and await my arrival but there has been a change of plans hal comes with me to auvergne like it or not i sent word to him this morn a command not an invitation i mean to keep him on a short leash until he proves he can be trusted offlead eleanor exhaled a soft breath almost a sigh he still did not understand what a sharp sword hed given his enemies by crowning hal hed claimed he was merely following the custom of his continental domains and it was indeed traditionally done in france she did not doubt louis would crown his son philippe in due time but she knew that there was more to henrys controversial decision to crown hal never before done by an english king hed seen his mother cheated of her queenship by her cousin stephen had seen the suffering that resulted from stephens usurpation and the resulting horrors of civil war a time so wretched that the people had whispered that christ and his saints must surely be asleep hed had to fight fiercely for his own inheritance both in normandy and england and such a turbulent childhood had left scars he was bound and determined to spare his sons what hed endured and that was his true reason for insisting upon crowning hal in his own lifetimeto make sure that thered be no doubts about the legitimacy of his heirs claim to the english crown but in acting to protect hal hed made himself dangerously vulnerable the future would always exert a more potent pull than the past and hal now represented the glowing promise of tomorrow while henry was reduced in the eyes of many to the status of a caretaker king the risk hed taken would not have been so great had he not such a multitude of enemies men eager to use the weapon hed unknowingly given them as she watched him moving about their bedchamber eleanor felt an unwanted surge of sadness at the terrible irony of it all before she could think better of it she resolved to make one final attempt to reach him to make him understand that if he did not learn the art of compromise and conciliation he was courting his own ruin hal is not entirely in the wrong you know she said quietly you do not give him sufficient income to maintain a royal household which makes it inevitable that he should go so deeply into debt and there is something to be said too for his other grievances he turned toward her his surprise evident upon his face and what would that be pray tell she ignored his sarcasm choosing her words with care you keep saying hal is too young too callow to rule in his own right i do not deny that he may well make mistakes but how else will he learn harry do not make it sound as if i am fretting over the usual mishaps of youthtavern brawls getting a village girl with child playing the fool with his friends the stakes are far higher for hal and you well know it it is rather late to complain about that is it not the truth is that this is a coil of your own making hal is a king because you would have it so you cannot change what is done can only learn to live with it i could do thatif he were not taking his lessons at the french kings knee youve forfeited the right to bemoan that too if you did not want louis to have a say in hals life you ought not to have married him off to louiss daughter instead of deploring louiss malign influence you need to do what he doeslisten to the lad i do listen to him eleanor the trouble is that i like not what i hear i love him as my life but i cannot trust him to rule on his ownnot yet and when will that day come when he reaches twenty and one thirty every apprenticeship has a set term how many years do you mean to keep him a king in training i cannot answer that he said so abruptly that she saw his temper was catching fire how can i i know not what the morrow holds i do she thought no less angry now than he was if he were blessed to reach scriptures three score years and ten hal would still be on that short leash even on harrys deathbed hed be figuring out a way to rule from the grave he had ever to keep his hand on the reins which meant that hal would be doomed to ride pillion behind him and how much freedom would he permit richard she knew well the answer to that too she had never been allowed to be more than his surrogate in her own domains it would be no different for richard just as hal was a shadow king richard would be a shadow duke answerable to harry always to harry henrys anger was cooling as fast as it had sparked he supposed it was only natural that shed come to hals defense all knew how protective a lioness was of her cubs he did wish she could be more understanding of his plight more likewell like rosamund but if a man wanted comforting or cosseting hed need to look elsewhere those soft curves of hers hid some very sharp edges he did not want to tarnish the afterglow of their lovemaking though this had been one of the best afternoons theyd had in a long while lets not quarrel love we both want the same for hal differ only in how to achieve it i daresay the lad and i will be working well in tandem long ere louis goes to god hed touched unwittingly upon eleanors greatest fearthat her sons would not be well settled in their own lands by the time they would face a more formidable foe than louis by all accounts his philippe was a sickly little lad and might not reach manhood the boys death would pass the french crown to one of his sisters the main reason that henry had angled to wed hal to marguerite but marguerite had two older sisters eleanors daughters by her marriage to louis and they were both wed to highly competent ambitious men the counts of champagne and blois eleanor had discussed this with henry on several occasions but thered been no meeting of their minds henry thought the best way to counter the french threat was to keep power consolidated in his hands a strategy that would work she thought tartly only if he did not intend ever to die she said nothing though for why waste her breath fully dressed now he crossed the chamber and gave her a lingering kiss i shall see you love at supper i trust hed taken a few steps before turning back toward the bed i almost forgot to tell you ive settled upon a successor for the archbishop of bordeaux william the abbot of reading i thought we could have him consecrated during our stay at limoges she drew a sharp breath i thought i told you she said that i favored the abbot of tournay for that position did you it must have slipped my mind but i daresay youll be well pleased with william for he is a good man pious and well educated and english she almost spat the words out somehow held them back this was not the first time hed preempted her choice of prelates the recently deceased archbishop of bordeaux and the bishop of poitiers were both his men but her tolerance was no longer what it once had been and slights like this stung more than they had in the past seething in silence she was even more affronted that he seemed unaware of her outrage grasping for any weapon at hand she asked him with poisoned politeness if hed made any plans for the morrow henry paused at the door glancing over his shoulder nowhy i thought youd want to have a requiem mass said for his soul surely you have not forgotten harry tomorrow will be the second anniversary of thomas beckets murder he was very still for a moment staring at her as if she were a stranger no he said tersely i have not forgotten she knew shed wounded him when hed least expected it and her satisfaction lasted until the door had closed behind him once he was gone it ebbed away along with her anger leaving her with naught but the ashes and embers of a dying hearth fire chapter five february near limoges aquitaine eleanors eyes intently searched the sky it was the blanched faded blue of midwinter leached of color and utterly empty barren of clouds and her missing peregrine her vexation was all the sharperbecause the hunt had begun with such promise when a heron had been flushed from the rushes along the river shed detached the leash and the falcon launched itself from its perch on her leather glove soaring up into the sun as it sought to gain height over its prey and then it was diving down upon the heron faster than any arrow a dark angel bearing death in its talons but the heron veered abruptly and the falcon missed as it hurtled past the heron turned upon its attacker and suddenly the falcon was the one in flight fleeing before the larger birds thrusting beak the triumphant heron checked its pursuit and flew toward the safety of its river refuge while eleanors thwarted peregrine disappeared over the horizon her falconer had repeatedly issued the recall and swung the lure up into the air to no avail a quarter hour had passed by now with no sign of the errant falcon but eleanor continued to probe the sky as if she could compel its return by sheer force of will all the while muttering some of the most colorful creative obscenities that the countess of chester had ever heard moving her mare in closer maud looked at the queen with mock horror what language my lady luckily my brother the bishop is not within earshot does your lord husband know you have such a command of curses she teased and eleanor tore her gaze away from the sky long enough to give maud a look that was more impatient than amused who do you think i learned them from her falconer had come back into view shaking his head in defeat and she swore again as angry with herself as with the lost bird she was not ready she admitted needed more training but i only brought two from chinon and the other falcon is ailing with a catarrh then you had no choice maud pointed out for your royal guest was keen to go hawking and he seems well pleased so the day has not been a total loss following mauds gaze eleanor saw that the king of navarre was indeed in a jovial mood bantering with their host the viscount of limoges and mauds brother roger had taken no active part in the hunt one of the few bishops who obeyed the churchs ban on hawking for those in holy orders and sancho was joking about his abstention with the heavyhanded humor permitted to kings feeling the womens eyes upon him roger sent a smile winging their way and then turned back to deflecting the royal gibes he does look content eleanor conceded and that was no small achievement for the navarrese king had been growing restless and irritable as the days passed and henry did not arrive madame aimar the viscount of limoges was guiding his stallion in her direction i am so sorry about the loss of your falcon he said unhappy that the days success would be marred by this setback i took pains that all would go well had my chaplain begin the hunt with a prayer that the birds would not stray but i can assure you that she will be found each time ive been unlucky enough to lose one of my falcons it has always been retrieved by the local villagers eleanor knew he was probably right any peasant spotting a belled hawk with leather jesses would know at once that it was a lords bird and worth a goodly reward but she could not shake off her chagrin for she never willingly relinquished something that was hers with an effort she brought her attention back to the conversation viscount aimar was telling them what hed just learned from king sancho that the saracens were as avid hunters as christians and even though they were infidels theyd come up with a most intriguing means of controlling their hawksby covering their heads with leather hoods until they were ready to be set upon their prey eleanor was no less interested in this new method than aimar and made a mental note to mention it to henry whose passion for hawking bordered on obsession aimars servants had begun to unload the wagons setting up trestle tables and unpacking stools so the hunting party could take refreshments in comfort and eleanor did her best to dismiss her wayward falcon holding out her hand so the viscount could help her dismount rainald assisted his daughter from her mare and then hastened over to do the same for his niece wanting to know if maud would be journeying with him ranulf and rhiannon when they returned to england to his surprise she refused and with his usual tactlessness he blurted out why youve been here for months are you not ready to go home yet the queen has kindly extended an invitation to remain at her court uncle and i was glad to accept why not i am a widow with grown children and bertrada is old enough now to act as hughs lady does not need a motherinlaw to dog her steps besides maud added with a grin that belied her years and any claims to matronly dignity what fool would prefer chester to poitiers rainald still looked baffled but maud and eleanor traded smiles both well content with the role that the countess of chester had chosen to play a surrogate sister for the queen who still grieved for her blood sister viscount aimar was hovering close by waiting to escort her to the table and eleanor was turning toward him when her uncle stepped between them murmuring a deferential a moment if i may my lady eleanor allowed raoul to draw her aside and as soon as they were out of the viscounts hearing he said harry and hal are likely to be arriving any day now and we may not have many opportunities for private conversation do you think this time together has served to mend the rift between them no i do not a pity raoul said because convention seemed to demand it a fathers estrangement from his son would be considered tragic by most people for him it would be a blessing a godgiven chance that might never come again his loathing for his nieces angevin husband was not personal hed not liked her french husband either he wanted aquitaine to be ruled by their own wanted no more foreigners over them eleanor was regarding him with a sardonic half smile you really ought to get harry to teach you how to mask your thoughts uncle if you were any more eager to see the breach widen between them youd be panting like yonder greyhounds he shrugged ive never lied to you lass you know what i want and why i want it she was the first to look away i just wish she said so softly he barely heard her that you were not quite so happy watching the death throes of my marriage it was then that the bearers shouted and a grey heron broke cover near the river powerful wings taking it up into the sky over their heads most of the hunting party had already relinquished their falcons and were moving toward the tables but richards bird of prey still perched upon his leather glove his reaction was instantaneous and his gyrfalcon exploded into the air with breathtaking speed like the peregrine it rose rapidly and then it was plunging earthward its sleek white body blurring into a streak of light as it caught up with its quarry they collided in midair and then plummeted to the ground out of sight in the marsh grass release the dogs richard yelled but the greyhounds were already in motion racing to subdue the heron before it could escape from the much smaller gyrfalcon richard had slid from his saddle and was running toward the deathstruggle when he and the bearers finally emerged from the reeds he had the bloody heart of the heron in one hand and his beautiful lethal hawk in the other eleanor had never seen him so excited and she felt a surge of fierce pride as he headed straight for her eager to share his triumph did you see her stoop maman that was so fine a kill wellnigh perfect indeed it was dearest she agreed her own disappointment dispelled by richards jubilation others were gathering around them and richard basked in the attention feeding the heart to the gyrfalcon as he accepted their plaudits whistling for the greyhounds so they could get their wellearned praise too only geoffrey stood apart watching with an expression surprisingly jaundiced for a youngster of fourteen the men were as willing as eleanor to prolong the moment remembering the pride of their first kills it was only with the arrival of a messenger for the viscount of limoges that they began to disperse turning toward the tables now laid out with wine and food eleanor stayed where she was though flanked by her uncle and her son for the expression on aimars face was not that of a man whod just received welcome news after conferring briefly with the messenger he moved hastily in her direction madame ive just gotten word that king henry has ridden into limoges that was no surprise for henry had sent word that he would reach aimars city within a day or two of the start of lent and this was shrove tuesday eleanor inclined her head waiting for him to reveal what had disquieted him about her husbands arrival your son the young king is with him of course as are the king of aragon the count of maurienne and his daughter aimar paused obviously unhappy with what he would say next he is accompanied as well by the count of toulouse no one spoke eleanor could see her suspicions mirrored on the faces of richard and raoul she would sooner have broken bread with lucifer than with raimon st gilles and her husband well knew it so why had he brought the count to limoges henry count raimon and the young king of aragon had been ushered to the castle chambers set aside for them and were washing away the grime of the road but hal had remained in the great hall his hair was tousled there was a smear of dirt on his cheek and his clothes and boots were mudsplattered yet he still looked like one of the heroes in a troubadours song or geste the handsome dashing young knight who was without peer and existed only in a storytellers imagination he was surrounded by those guests whod not gone hawking commanding their attention so completely that few at first noticed the hunting party had returned following in eleanors footsteps marguerite forgot etiquette and brushed past the queen in her haste to welcome her husband at the sound of her voice hal sprang to his feet and swept her into a close embrace a display of public affection that would have been considered unseemly in others but earned hal indulgent smiles from even the most judgmental hal showed more decorum in greeting his mother his host and their companions but wasted no time in drawing eleanor aside for a more private conversation i had an inspired idea he confided but i will need your help to bring it about maman how often do so many of high birth gather together like this we have no less than four kings two queens and a multitude of counts earls barons and their ladies what better setting could we have for a knighting ceremony and what better time we could do it next wednesdaymy eighteenth birthday he explained as if eleanor had been elsewhere on that auspicious occasion and needed reminding will you talk to him maman will you make him see how perfect it would be to do it here to do it now as usual hals enthusiasm was contagious and eleanor found herself agreeing even though she did not think henry would heed her she knew she should remind hal of his fathers stubborn insistence upon having him knighted by the french king but she hadnt the heart to interject reality into his dream it was her sons strength and his weakness that he could not conceive of defeat having gotten what he wantedhis mothers backing in this coming clash of wills with his fatherhal announced that he was greatly in need of a bath and he and marguerite exited the hall with an eagerness rarely shown for bathing eleanor turned to find her constable saldebreuil de sanzay at her side you ought to have heard the lad madame he said with the fond familiarity of one whod known hal all his life he was telling us some highly entertaining if rather improbable tales about past hunts he claimed that one time hed set a young gyrfalcon upon a crane but the bird had a large fish in its beak and dropped it as the gyrfalcon began its stoop his hawk shot right by the crane and went after the fish the constable laughed so heartily that he began to wheeze and eleanor felt a pang for this man had been her rock her mainstay since her days as queen of france hed always refused to reveal his exact age and hed gone to war against time with the same valor and fortitude hed mustered against other foes but it was a battle he was doomed to lose and she was coming to understand that it would be sooner than either of them had anticipated as their eyes met his smile faded away have you heard my lady the count of toulouse rode in with your lord husband the king do you know why he would bring the count here no she said grimly but i intend to find out henry had already bathed and changed his clothes and was getting his hair and beard trimmed when eleanor entered his bedchamber ah there you are love he said cheerfully how was the hawking id wager your hunting was nowhere near as successful as mine eleanor felt a prickle of foreboding for he sounded much too smug for her liking she gestured in dismissal and the servants emptying the bathing tub abandoned their buckets and withdrew the barber hesitated scissors poised in midair when henry nodded he quickly retreated flustered by his queens icy demeanor henry showed no such misgivings though holding the scissors out to eleanor with a grin if you are chasing my barber away youll need to finish the task he began i assume you want a private conversation although id not be adverse if you intend to jump my bones when she reached for the scissors he surprised her by catching her hand and pressing his mouth to her palm past experience had taught her to suspect such high spirits a reliable indication that he was up to something and as she began to clip the curly bright hair at the base of his neck she stared at the back of his head wishing she had the power to see into his skull into the serpentine convoluted byways of his brain it was surely one of gods inexplicable jests that shed taken both a lamb and a fox to her marriage bed did you meet the count of maurienne yet hes a likable man amiable and quite reasonable we struck a very advantageous deal for johnny if count humbert dies without a male heir johnny and his daughteradela i think no alicewill inherit maurienne and savoy if the count does manage to sire a son then hell settle the principality of rousillon upon our lad so whatever the outcome therell be no more talk of john lackland henry swung around in the chair so abruptly that eleanor nearly sliced his ear maurienne controls the alpine passes the trade routes into italy were gaining so much for so little eleanorjust four thousand silver marks and the pledge of alliance i am familiar with the marriage terms harry and with your ambitions in italy the count is not the guest ive come to discuss and you well know it henrys mouth twitched as he suppressed a smile ah you mean the king of aragon a fine lad although i do wish he were not so young once hal discovered that alfonso will be able to rule on his own when he turns sixteen next month he pounced upon that like a starving hound upon a bone and gave me no peace i will say this of our son he does not lack for perseverance i do not give a besan for the king of aragon why did you not warn me that youd be bringing that weasel st gilles back with you not at all put out by her flare of temper henry turned in his seat so they were facetoface if it is any consolation count raimon is no happier to be here than you are to have him need i remind you harry that i have a weapon in my hand if you do not speak soon i will not be responsible for what i do laughing openly now he claimed the scissors tossing them into the floor rushes id not want to lead you into temptation without warning he snaked an arm around her waist and pulled her down onto his lap thirteen years ago i made you a promise that i was not able to keep now i grant you that i rarely lose sleep over broken promises but this is one wrong i am delighted to right just what are you saying what happened thirteen years ago love you went to war against raimon st gilles asserting my claim to toulouse and you failed her voice trailed off her eyes widening you cannot mean that he has agreed to do homage for toulouse she was staring at him incredulously and it occurred to henry that hed never before seen her at such a loss for words that is exactly what i mean eleanor now you understand why i said count raimon is not overjoyed to be here what i do not understand harry is how you did it id not have thought even merlin could have wrought such a miracle actually love it was not so difficult for all his vices raimon is no fool and is quite capable of reading a map on one side lie the lands of king alfonso my young ally who loves raimon not and with good cause on his other lie the lands of count humbert soon to be my kin by marriage these alliances had begun to pinch raimon in his most vulnerable male parts for he was becoming convinced that i was aiming to encircle and isolate him with god knows what mischief in mind henry laughed again i had no intention of waging war but raimon expects others to be as false and treacherous as he is and he could not rely upon the french king to pull his chestnuts from the fire this time since he is no longer wed to louiss sister so he decided that homage was a cheaper price to pay than blood and he he got no further for eleanor stopped his words with a passionate kiss you ought to have told me she chided but i forgive you she could forgive a lot for toulouse it had long been the litany of her house that the st gilles family had stolen toulouse disregarding her grandmothers rightful claim and shed persuaded both husbands to assert her title to the county neither had succeeded and maud had given her some mordant incisive advice resign herself to its loss unless she meant to try again with a third husband but toulouse was not just her inheritance it was richards she kissed henry again and then slid off his lap you may just have made amends for giving gascony away gascony henry was genuinely puzzled i did not give gascony away it was our daughters marriage portion and i specified that it would not happen whilst you still lived i know he had taken care to preserve her rights but what of richards passing strange but hed never understood that the succession to aquitaine mattered no less to her than the succession to the english crown did to him shed wanted a generous dowry for her daughter in faroff castile just not at richards expense but gascony was yesterday toulouse was today id best find richard and let him know at the door she paused to favor him with the sort of smile hed not gotten from her in several yearsutterly spontaneous admiring and affectionate id given up hope that the day would ever come when id see raimon kneel to do homage to me she admitted i only wish my father were alive to witness it for he died thinking that toulouse was lost to us henry started to say something then stopped but his expression was suddenly so guarded that eleanor froze her hand on the door latch harry it was not so much a question as a demand and he acknowledged it by exhaling a pentup breath wellthe truth is that he has not agreed to do homage to you eleanor i see she leaned back against the door regarding him in silence that threatened to stretch into infinity he does homage to you but not to me what about richard henry was thankful that he could reassure her on that point hoping it would allay her disappointment of course hell do homage to richard after another uncomfortable silence she said it gladdens me to hear it but once she was out in the stairwell she sank down on the stone steps not wanting to face others until she was sure her rage was under control it did not surprise her that raimon st gilles would dare to insult her like this he was not a man to humble his pride before a woman not unless forced to it but harry had not done that hed chosen to accommodate the count of toulouse because it was easier that way easier for him standing up she brushed the dust from her skirts when maud had urged her to relinquish her hopes of claiming toulouse shed offered other advice as well no less pragmatic and unsentimental you cannot change a man harry least of all you will always come second with him for his kingship will come first and there in the stairwell of the viscount of limogess castle eleanor could hear her own response echoing down through the years and mauds uncompromising reply so you are saying then that i must accept harry as he is but what if i cannot then learn to love him less the viscount of limoges had given maud a tour of his kennels where his favorite greyhound bitch had recently whelped as he escorted her across the bailey afterward he offered her the pick of the litter once the puppies were old enough to be weaned when maud demurred he insisted saying with a smile you have been a godsend to my wife sarahs nerves were on the raw at the prospect of entertaining so many highborn guests and you and our duchess have gone out of your way to put her at ease doing what you could to make sure that nothing went amiss maud thanked him thinking that only in aquitaine would a duchess outrank a queen they were passing the open doors of the stables and she came to a sudden halt having caught sight of a familiar figure standing by one of the stalls excusing herself she stepped into the shadows of the barn hal was currying a beautiful white stallion so occupied in his task that he did not hear mauds approach he swung around in surprise when she spoke his name and then smiled in recognition cousin maud come take a look at my new palfrey shield your eyes though he added with a grin lest you be dazzled by his radiance his jest was not far off the mark the horse was as perfect a specimen as maud had ever seen hal had begun to comb out its silky mane saying that it was as soft as his wifes hair playfully begging her not to repeat that to marguerite and then declaring that hed settled upon a name morel maud was not surprised by his choice that was a popular name for knightly steeds in chansons de geste dare i ask how you could afford such a magnificent beast have you taken to banditry in your spare time hal laughed do not think i have not been tempted cousin but morel did not cost me even a denier he is the product of a benign conspiracy between my mother and king alfonso hed visited her at poitiers last summer to discuss their mutual enemy count raimon and she arranged for him to bring morel to limoges spanish horses are the best in christendom he said happily so she could not have given me a finer birthday present indeed maud agreed reaching out to pat the palfreys muzzle you made mention only of your mother was morel not a gift from both your parents she hoped that was so for separate giftgiving was not an augury of a healthy marriage but he was already shaking his head no morel was my mothers present my father promised me four iceland gyrfalcons when one of his agents next goes to norway iceland gyrfalcons were quite literally worth a kings ransom so that was a very lavish expenditure from a man not noted for extravagant spending that was a most generous gift maud said feeling suddenly sad although she wasnt quite sure why yes the terseness of his response made it seem incomplete and hal appeared to sense that raising his head he met mauds eyes over the stallions back assuming that he remembers he said but without malice she thought he sounded sad too hal maud was not sure if she should venture onto such unstable ground but shed begun to realize that there was no one to speak on her cousin harrys behalf the only voices hal heard these days were those hostile to his father i know you are disappointed that harry refused to knight you i am disappointed that the weather did not allow us to go hawking today i am disappointed that i lost three straight games of hazard to hasculf de st hilaire yesterday but when my father denies me the rite of passage to manhood i think a stronger term is needed than disappointment cousin maud he does not mean it that way hal truly he does not his intent is not to slight or demean you nor to cause you pain he has it in his mind that you need to be knighted by the french king for that would do honor to you both limoges cannot hold a candle to paris lad surely it is worth waiting for a splendid ceremony at the french court no he said it is not worth the wait not to me hed not raised his voice not showed any anger but there was a finality in his words that discouraged maud from persisting father and son were more alike than they knew and that was not a thought to give her any comfort the count of toulouse made such an exaggerated obeisance before eleanor that it bordered upon mockery my deepest sympathies madame he said blandly i can only imagine how disappointed you must be eleanors son was standing so close that their shoulders were touching and she could feel the jolt of tension that shot through richards body putting her hand casually on his arm she gazed coolly at her adversary and why would i be disappointed my lord count count raimons eyebrows rose in feigned surprise why because of the loss of your falcon of course i heard about your illfated hunt very bad luck indeed not at all my falcon was found two days ago none the worse for her mishap you are not as well informed as you think my lord count bending over her hand again he said i rejoice in your good fortune my lady he had oddly colored eyes a pale goldenbrown with yellowish glints wolf eyes eleanor thought and as the count sauntered away she said as much aloud richard looked startled and then laughed great minds think alike maman alfonso calls him el lobo loco the crazed wolf eleanor smiled el lobo locoi like that it was no surprise that richard and king alfonso had struck up an easy friendship for they were of an agefifteenwith many interests in commona shared love of hunting and horses a mutual loathing for raimon st gilles their rapport pleased eleanor for friendships of youth often forged the alliances of manhood alfonso has been teaching me how to swear in his language richard confided spanish curses are very satisfying for they roll right off the tongue alfonso has a number of colorful names for el lobo loco cabron huevon and my own favorite hijo de mil putas eleanor had an inkling of its meaning but she did not want to deny richard the pleasure of instructing her dare i ask you to translate or is it too crude for my maidenly ears to hear that amused richard greatly you could teach a soldier to swear maman it means son of a thousand whores amen she said and richard grinned making the sign of the cross it was then that her uncles raoul and hugh reached them with saldebreuil de sanzay a few steps behind she was touched by their loyalty theyd seen her talking with raimon st gilles and hastened over to offer their support viscount aimar was also making his way toward her shed decided not to join henry upon the dais while raimon swore homage not wanting to see his smirk his silent gloating but she was warmed now by the hatred filling the hall all of it aimed at raimons arrogant dark head and at least she would get to watch el lobo loco humble himself before her son at least she would have that satisfaction a sudden stir indicated henrys entrance wasting no time with preliminaries he took his seat upon the dais hal followed looking very regal and very unhappy richard gave his tunic a quick tug and hastened to join them a silence settled over the crowded hall as the count of toulouse began his walk toward the dais eleanor knew he must be dreading the ceremony to come but no emotion showed in his face mounting the steps of the dais he removed his sword knelt before henry and placed his hands together palm to palm in the universal gesture of submission my lord king and liege lord i raimon st gilles count of toulouse do willingly enter into your homage and faith and become your sworn man and to you faithfully will i bear body chattels and earthly worship and i will keep faith and loyalty to you against all others henry was as impassive as raimon we do promise to you as my vassal and liegeman that we and our heirs will guarantee to you and your heirs the lands you hold of us against all others that you may hold said lands in peace rising then he raised raimon to his feet and gave him the ritual kiss of peace richards gaze briefly caught his mothers and he made a comic grimace for hed been complaining only half in jest that hed sooner kiss a badger than his new vassal but when raimon glanced his way he was appropriately solemn showing the gravity that the occasion required what happened next however took him utterly by surprise instead of kneeling to him raimon moved toward his brother knelt and swore homage to hal richards mouth dropped open he looked bewildered and then enraged when raimon finally did homage to him he made no effort to hide his fury slurring his words in his haste to get his oath said giving his kiss of peace with the distaste of one embracing a leper eleanor was utterly still heedless of the turmoil swirling around her her kinsmen and her vassals had watched in disbelief and now they were turning to her dismayed and angry eleanor raoul was so close she could feel his breath on her cheek what in hellfire just happened hed been outraged that st gilles would be swearing homage to a man who was duke of aquitaine only by marriage while ignoring the woman who was duchess of aquitaine by blood right and the anointing of the almighty hed consoled himself that st gilles would be accepting richard as his liege lord but hed never expected that homage would be done to hal too there was no legal basis for it hal had been crowned as king of england duke of normandy and count of anjou he had no claim to aquitaine no claim to toulouseuntil now christ on the cross he sputtered what sort of doubledealing was that he already had his answer though sure that eleanors hellspawn husband was seeking to add toulouse to his own domains to make it part of his angevin empire glaring at his niece he found himself wondering how much shed known but he dismissed that suspicion as soon as it surfaced for all the color had drained from her face even her lips were white eleanor he said again alarmed by her pallor and her continuing silence eleanor ignored him ignored them all never taking her eyes from the dais from the husband who had betrayed her yet again henry stared at his wife in exasperation it never occurred to me that you would object it is but a formality after all and i thought it would please hal and did you spare even a thought as to how richard would react for the love of christ woman sometimes you act as if richard is the only child of your womb and the rest are foundlings i am not speaking as richards mother but as duchess of aquitaine did you not see the reaction of my barons in the hall you rekindled all of their suspicions all of their mistrust in one grand gesture harry and for what if it is indeed an empty honor as you allege then why should hal be pleased by it and if it is not better you tell me now if you have designs upon toulouse i have a right to know henry shook his head in disgust i am beginning to wish id never heard of toulouse no i do not harbor any great scheme to annex it not that i expect your ranting rebel lords to believe me aquitaine is one large lunatic asylum and you clearly have been spending too much time there eleanor or you would not have needed to ask me such an insulting question i would not have needed to ask you any questions at all if only youd told me what you had in mind more fool i but i thought youd want st gilles to do homage to hal as well as richardto honor both your sons more fool you but the words never left her lips for she knew now that the time for talking was done lent was always the season of dread for cooks not only was meat banned from every table but so were eggs milk butter and cheese the cooks of the viscount of limoges had shown considerable ingenuity though offering up a seafood feast that pleased even the demanding palates of his royal and highborn guests only henry took no enjoyment from the meal meant to celebrate the betrothal of his youngest son and the count of mauriennes daughter in truth henry had never displayed much interest in food eating and drinking sparingly even in those months when the menu was not so restricted but on this last sunday in february it was henrys sour mood that was spoiling the revelries for him his eyes swept the high table coming to rest morosely upon the count of toulouse he was beginning to think the man was accursed for certes hed brought naught but trouble to limoges taking a swallow of wine without really tasting it henry tallied up the grievances he could lay at the counts door richard had provoked a public quarrel with hal over that illfated act of homage and so now hal was out of sorts too but instead of finding fault with richard hal had concluded that his father was to blame for the botched affair henry was beginning to think that his eldest also held him accountable for the great flood and the expulsion from eden in this at least hal and richard were united for henry hadnt gotten a civil word from his second son since the ceremony it would seem henry thought that richard had inherited his share of the angevin temper the sad truth was that he did not know richard well at all he was eleanors had always been eleanors as for his queen he had no illusions that theyd made peace they were operating under a truce at present no more than that her public pose notwithstanding he knew she was still aggrieved for reasons that made no sense whatsoever he could almost believe there was something in the water or air of aquitaine that caused people to act so moonmad it was just as well that hed be going into brittany in a few days whilst she returned to poitiers some time apart would give both their tempers time to cool the thought of brittany diverted his attention to his third son mayhap he ought to take geoffrey with him it might be good to pass some time with the lad in the lands hed one day rule he did not know geoffrey all that well either and hed never meant it to be that way he had wanted the same easy rapport with his sons that hed enjoyed with his own father despite his best intentions though his children had been relegated to the outer edges of his life unable to compete with the myriad duties and demands of kingship but hed remained confident that there would be time to make amends for those lost early years to forge a bond with his sons that could never be broken he did not understand why it was now proving so difficult fidgeting restlessly in his seat he shifted so he could see his youngest son john had been permitted to sit at the high table next to his future fatherinlaw he was a solemn child the only one of their brood with eleanors coloring a stranger not only to henry but to his family for john had passed the first years of his life with the nuns at fontevrault abbey henry thought he looked ill at ease doubtless overwhelmed by all the unaccustomed attention there was something about this forlorn little boy that touched henrys heart and he was glad hed been able to arrange such a promising future for the lad too often a younger son was shunted aside valued more cheaply than his older brothers henrys gaze flicked from john roaming the hall until he located william marshal at one of the lower tables the young knight was surely the ultimate example of the sorry fate that could befall a spare son will had been offered up by his father as a hostage a pledge of john marshals good faith marshal a man of no scruples whatsoever had promptly broken his oath and when warned by king stephen that his small son would pay the price for his treachery his response had been so coldblooded so pitiless that it had soon passed into legend go ahead and hang will hed told stephen he had the hammer and anvil with which to make other and better sons wills life had been spared only because stephen could not bring himself to hang a fiveyearold child it was a story henry had never forgotten he was not easily shocked but that had shocked him profoundly once hed chosen will as one of hals household knights hed wondered occasionally how will had dealt with a memory like that wondered if his ambition and steely sense of purpose could be rooted in that sad history turning his gaze back to john he watched the child play with the food on his trencher and felt a surge of pride that he could provide so well for all his sons thankful that johnny would prosper in a world so often cruel to unwanted children once the meal was finished servants began to clear away the trestle tables so there would be room for the entertainment viscount aimar had arranged performances by troubadours tumblers and he promised an amazing act involving a dancing bear seats were positioned on the dais for all the royal guests count humbert and the count of toulouse henry stopped a nurse from ushering john off to bed swooping the boy up onto his lap there you go lad the best seat in the hall he said fondly and john regarding him gravely with eleanors enigmatic eyes perched on the arm of his chair like a bird about to take flight the little boy seemed more comfortable once joanna joined them for shed often been with him at fontevrault and she was so outgoing and confident that henry thought she could coax a turtle from its shell smiling into her upturned laughing face he wondered why sons could not be as easy to please as daughters my lord king count humbert had risen from his chair seeing that he wanted to talk henry rose too allowing joanna and john to share his seat the count made amiable polite conversation for several moments before raising the one issue still to be settled between them we have agreed that your son and my daughter will inherit maurienne and savoy when i die but we have not yet discussed what young john will bring to the marriage what lands do you mean to confer upon him prior to the wedding henry had anticipated this demand knowing that hed have to offer something of value since the marriage contract was weighted so heavily in his favor of course he said affably it is my intention to endow john with three castles chinon loudun and mirebeau the count had spent time poring over maps of henrys domains so he was familiar both with the castles and their strategic location forming a triangle between normandy and aquitaine that is satisfactory he said smiling henry had no time to savor the moment though hal was on his feet staring at them accusingly you cannot give those castles to john they are mine henry swore under his breath we shall discuss this later he said hastily intent upon reining hal in before the other guests took notice of their dispute it is true these castles are in anjou but you will not be the loser for it he assured his son i will make other provisions for you promises can be broken hal glared at his father fists clenched at his sides i was invested with anjou and it cannot be partitioned without my consentwhich i will never give henrys face flamed i told you this is neither the time nor the place we will discuss this later there is nothing to discuss and to henrys fury and frustration his eldest son turned away stalking down the steps of the dais and shoving his way through the suddenly silent crowd flushed with embarrassment henry could only watch but hal never looked back henry paced the solar as if it were a cage his fury rising with each step eleanor had made herself comfortable in the windowseat sipping from a wine cup as she watched her husbands fuming when hal finally entered henry crossed the solar in three strides slamming the door shut with enough violence to reverberate out into the stairwell how dare you shame me like that before the court few men could stand up to henry in one of his angevin furies even kinsmen like ranulf and rainald feared getting scorched by those flames only his cousin roger was not daunted by the royal rage during their clashes over thomas becket theyd once had a public shouting match that earned roger a reputation as a man who was utterly fearless and utterly foolhardy but eleanor saw now that roger had a rival in recklessness for hal did not flinch how dare you give away my castles he shot back and without even a word to me beforehand i told you henry snapped that id make sure you were compensated for their loss i do not believe you hal said flatly why should i you handle the truth carelessly and your promises ebb and flow like the tides i reach for one and all i grasp is a handful of foam and sand henry could not remember the last time anyone had dared to defy him like thisnot since thomas becket i am done with making excuses for your rash heedless behavior for too long you have been playing the fool instead of learning the duties of kingship you have done nothing to earn my trustor my respect until you do youll be kept on a short leash and that is a promise you can rely upon hal flushed hot color surging into his face and throat say what you will your threats and insults and mockery will change nothing i will never agree to relinquish those castlesnever blinking back tears of rage he whirled then fled the chamber before his emotion could overcome him before henry could stop him with a powerful thrust of his arm henry cleared the table sending wine cups flagon and candles flying eleanor rose without haste tilted her cup and poured wine onto the smoldering floor rushes i think the viscount would rather we did not burn his castle down she said and henry gave her a look that all but ignited the air between them i suppose it was too much to hope that youd be helpful he said scathingly she did not respond at once regarding him pensively hal had nothing of his own neither castle nor crofters hut yet now he planned to give three valuable angevin castles to sixyearold john and he did not think hal would be resentful how could he be so blind i could not take your side harry she said for i believe hal is in the right i would do all i could to mend this breach between you i swear i would if only you could see that hal is in the right he echoed but because there had been no anger in her voice his own anger began to ebb away he is a credulous idle spendthrift and god pity him a lamb amongst wolves how can you not see that eleanor i will not let my son become a puppet for the french king and if he blames me now so be it in time he will understand that i was acting in his best interests she was taken aback by the sadness that swept over her it was both unexpected and unwelcome she looked at him this man whod been husband lover partner for more than twenty years and she felt such a confusing welter of emotionsregret resentment a painful sense of lossthat her words caught in her throat i am sorry harry she said and there was such sincerity in her voice that he forgave her with a fleeting mirthless smile so am i love life would be far more peaceful if youd given me only daughters as you did for louis mayhap we could make a tradehal for louiss little philippe he seems like a docile biddable lad even now he could still make her smile a docile biddable lad would drive you to drink harry it would be like riding a timid meek gelding who shied at every shadow youre right he admitted wryly amused by how well she knew him he did indeed prefer a mettlesome stallion but he also wanted one that was broken to the saddle fortunately even the most spirited horse could be tamed with enough patience a gale was brewing and by dark the winds had picked up rattling shutters tearing off shingles and testing the castle walls for points of entry a fire roared in the hearth of henrys bedchamber but he could still hear the muted sounds of the storm wailing into the night like the cries of the damned that was an unusually morbid thought for him but his confrontation with hal had inflicted some deep wounds and he was still brooding about it hours later your move harry his cousin prompted and with an effort he forced his attention back to the chessboard his distraction had cost him roger a skilled player had maneuvered him into an untenable position to gain time he signaled for wine and one of his squires hastened over with a flagon ranulf stood and stretched hed smothered several yawns and had begun to drop hints about the lateness of the hour but henry did not want him to leave not yet these two kinsmen of his could be relied upon to give sound advice for roger had a good head and ranulf a good heart once hed summoned them though hed found himself reluctant to unburden himself not wanting to start the bleeding again his sons defiance hurt more than he was willing to admit and talking about it would change nothing but if he did not want to confide in them he still wanted them to stay trusting them to keep his ghosts at bay pushing away abruptly from the table he said i cannot keep my mind on this game tonight sit in for me uncle taking the seat henry had vacated ranulf studied the chessboard and whistled softly as he saw his predicament you are too kind he said dryly you could at least provide me with a flag of surrender when did a welshman ever roll over and play dead henry perched on a corner of the table but he was too restless to sit for long and soon he was wandering aimlessly about the chamber picking up and discarding items at random this was going to be a long night he briefly considered going to eleanors bedchamber but if he was no longer wroth with her he was still disappointed by her stubborn defense of the indefensible a pity rosamund was so far away tumbling a wench might make it easier to sleep but he could not very well ask aimar to find him a bedmate not with his queen under the same roof jesu shed stab him with his own dagger like as not a soft knock at the door drew all their attention given the hour and they watched as one of the squires hurried over to open it after a brief exchange with someone out in the stairwell he turned back toward henry frowning in perplexity the count of toulouse is without your grace seeking a few words with you shall i admit him raimon st gilles was the last man henry had expected to see the last one he wanted to see his curiosity got the better of him however and he nodded entering the chamber with his usual swagger the count made a perfunctory obeisance then said brusquely i have urgent information for you my lord king but it is not meant for other ears must be given in private henry hesitated but boredom won out go down to the hall he told his squires and see if you can find some mischief to get into he stopped his kinsmen though as they started to rise the bishop of worcester and lord ranulf are staying i would trust them with the surety of my soul with all due deference my liege i do not raimon objected with all due deference my lord count it is not open for debate raimon scowled at roger and ranulf who looked back at him coolly very well i shall rely upon your discretion and honor my lord bishop lord ranulf for i am putting my life at risk by coming to the king as hed expected that riveted their attention upon him when i swore homage to you my liege he said i vowed to keep faith with you until my last breath and i am here to prove my sincerity his words and his delivery were too theatrical for henrys taste what have you come to tell me you are in peril my lord a conspiracy is forming against you and the conspirators are very highborn and very dangerous it is a plot that crosses borders involving the king of france the counts of flanders boulogne champagne and blois they are casting a wide net my liege are seeking to draw in the king of scotland too what you call a conspiracy my lord count they most likely would call statecraft so they are forging another alliance hoping to protect their interests how is this any different than what theyve done in the past because in the past they did not have a rival claimant for the english crown henrys eyes narrowed go on he said coldly i am sorry my lord but your son the young king is an eager participant in the plot against you the french king and the count of flanders have played skillfully upon his lack of experience and his poor judgment convincing him that he can gain power only by rebellion he has been persuaded that there is no other way to claim his just due henry opened his mouth to deny st gilless accusation to insist that his son would never betray him like that but he could not for there was a chilling plausibility about the counts revelation how do you know all this i have many enemies my liege so i try to make sure that i am rarely surprised i am sure you have spies at the french court just as louis has spies at yours mine are better informed for they are better paid until now roger and ranulf had kept silent but ranulf could no longer restrain himself his suspicions feeding upon his inherent dislike of raimon st gilles you have made a most serious accusation my lord count i do not doubt that the french king is scheming with others to thwart the king at every turn but i do not believe that hal would ever connive to harm his father and if that is what you are alleging you will need more convincing proof than the whispers and conjectures of paid spies and informers raimon would have ignored ranulfs challenge had roger not chimed in too saying skeptically i agree with lord ranulf what proof can you offer to you my lord bishopnothing i care not if you doubt what i say my concern is for you my lord king he said swinging back to henry i do not know the ultimate aim of their conspiracy it may well be that the young king intends only to compel you to give him a share of your domains rumor has it that he has demanded you turn over england or normandy to him and i doubt that the french king wants to see you dethroned that would set a fearful precedent after all as for the others i daresay they have less interest in preserving the sacred inviolability of kingship he paused then for dramatic effect well aware of the impact that his next words would have alas my liege i have not told you all of it you are nurturing vipers in your own nest the young king is not the only one to heed the blandishments of your enemies your sons richard and geoffrey are implicated as well doubtless swayed by their mother for as much as it pains me to say it your queen is involved in the conspiracy too doing all she can to turn your sons against you and stir up rebellion in her lands ranulf choked on his wine began to cough so violently that he sounded as if he were strangling roger had long cultivated the polished persona of a prince of the church rarely giving others a glimpse of his inner self now he gaped at raimon too stunned to hide his dismay gratified by their reactions the count glanced toward henry but here he met with disappointment for the kings face was utterly impassive an inscrutable mask that revealed nothing of his thoughts is there more henry asked and his voice too was dispassionate when raimon shook his head he said i will remember what you have done my lord never doubt that this was not the response the count had been expecting but hed obviously been dismissed and he withdrew reluctantly disquieted and dissatisfied henry strode toward the door slid the bolt into place with a loud thud only then did he turn back toward the other men who were watching him mutely no more able to read his expression than the count of toulouse well he said now we know where the snake went after it was thrust out of eden never have i heard such poison spewed from a mans mouth ranulf said indignantly thank god you were not taken in by his malice harry i daresay there is some truth in what he said roger cautioned anxious lest his cousin dismiss the counts warning out of hand because hed gilded it with lies i do not doubt his claim that a conspiracy exists nor do i doubt that st gilles has seized upon it to settle a few grudges of his own eleanor warned me that he had an evil heart and a corrupt soul i ought to have paid her more heed henry had begun to pace too angry and agitated to keep still i knew he hated her of course but it never occurred to me that he would dare to strike out at a queen my queen and he was not content with that he must malign my sons lads of fourteen and fifteen a wonder he did not think to throw johnny into the fire too ranulf and roger traded glances for they both caught the omissionno mention of hal henrys shock was giving way to rage i swear by the rood that st gilles will rue this day i can only deal with one enemy at a time but his reprieve will not be for long that too i swear upon the holy cross what will you do harry henry had stopped before the hearth standing so close he was in danger of being singed by the leaping flames on the morrow uncle i shall go hunting he said and at another time he would have been amused by their bewilderment all know how i love the chase so that will arouse no suspicions whilst i am off hunting i will send word to the castellans of my border castles instructing them to lay in supplies enough to withstand a siege and to strengthen their garrisons when louis moves against me he will find that we are expecting him as rogers eyes met ranulfs again he saw that they shared the same concern and because he knew his uncle was too kindhearted for utter candor roger realized that it would be up to him only a madman would credit st gilless venomous accusations against your queen and younger sons but i very much fear that there is some truth in his charges against hal henry was silent for so long that they thought he was not going to answer when he finally turned away from the fire they saw there was no need for words his answer was plainly writ in the anguished slash of his mouth the glimmering grey eyes the first time that either man had seen him on the verge of tears i know he said huskily god help us both i know eleanors dream was unraveling besieged by an undercurrent of noise and flashes of light she came back to reality with reluctance instinctively aware that these were still the hours of night the hours of sleep as soon as she moved she winced for her thigh muscles were sore memory came flooding backher husbands return from his hunting trip long after dark after shed gone to bed shed awakened to his embrace his mouth hot upon hers his beard scratching her throat his lovemaking had been impassioned intense and yet oddly impersonal for she suspected that any soft female body would have satisfied his need his side of the bed was empty but still warm and she jerked the bed hangings aside blinking in the glare of torchlight a quick glance at a notched wax candle confirmed her suspicion that it was much too early to be awake henry was already dressed though sitting on a coffer he was pulling his boots on and she wondered if he meant another days hunting why are you up at such a godforsaken hour he glanced over his shoulder at the sound of her voice but offered no explanation and she sat up with a sigh knowing sleep was lost to her now too a servant had fetched wine and bread to break their fast and henry poured a cup carried it across the room and handed it to eleanor i want you to take geoffrey with you when you go back to poitiers he said and she looked up at him in surprise i thought he was accompanying you into brittany has there been a change of plans yes but he did not elaborate instead began to buckle his scabbard belt further proof that he had a journey in mind eleanor tugged at her hair finding it caught under her hip shed braided it before going to bed but henry had unfastened it during the night drinking her wine she wondered where he meant to go if not into brittany the festivities at limoges were over the kings of aragon and navarre had departed for their own lands as had many of the attending barons and their ladies john had been sent back to fontevrault abbey to resume his studies his little bridetobe would accompany eleanor to poitiers there to be raised with constance and alys and joanna only the count of toulouse still lingered uncaring that none wanted him there putting eleanor in mind of a vulture hovering over carrion awaiting his chance to swoop down to feed she was sure he was up to no good and she was glad she would soon be seeing the last of limoges glad she would be going home to poitiers favored of all her cities watching henry as he moved around the chamber she was jolted to realize that this might well have been the last time shed share his bed where do you go from here harry before he could respond the door swung open and hal entered why did you summon me so early maman he complained yawning id hoped to remain abed for he stopped abruptly as henry moved into his line of vision his eyes cut from his father to his mother in the rumpled bed and to eleanors surprise he flushed deeply she was astonished surely he could not be embarrassed by this proof that shed spent the night with harry and then as he gave her a look of silent reproach she understood to hal shed been sleeping with the enemy the summons was mine henry said regarding his son with a lack of emotion that eleanor found troubling i am returning to normandy this morn and you are coming with me hal was still off balance but he tried now to regain his footing by saying emphatically i think not you are not being given a choice henrys voice was toneless and to hal his gaze was as piercing and predatory as those iceland gyrfalcons hed promised but would never deliver hal glanced back at eleanor seeking guidance but this woman seemed like a stranger to him clutching blankets to cover her nudity her hair tumbling about her shoulders in wanton disarray utterly unlike the coolly poised elegant mother who was his lodestar and mentor as their gazes crossed she shook her head almost imperceptibly signaling that she did not know what his father intended you need not look to your mother for assistance henry said still in that matteroffact manner that hal found more disturbing than outright anger would have been it is only natural that a mother bird should protect her chicks but when it is time for a fledgling to leave the nest he is on his own hal was quick to seize his fathers metaphor and turn it back against him but that fledgling cannot learn to fly if his wings are clipped clever lad henry said softly and it was not a compliment lest youve forgotten i warned you that youd be on a short leash until you prove it is no longer needed so for the foreseeable future youll be closer than my own shadow and since youve been keeping dubious company of late i am dismissing those selfseekers and sycophants who are leading you astray men such as hasculf de st hilaire adam dyquebeuf and juhel de mayenne hals outraged gasp was audible to both his parents you cannot do that it is done henry said tersely and his son whirled to face his mother an involuntary stunned cry of maman escaping his lips eleanors eyes locked with his sending a message that was both reassurance and warning i understand your reluctance hal she said but you are not in a position to resist you must do as your father commands normally a kings leavetaking was a chaotic noisy event but those whod gathered in the inner castle bailey to watch henrys departure were subdued and somber some of hals knights lurked in the shadows unwilling to call the kings attention to themselves but william marshal strode out into the chilly march sunlight a silent affirmation of loyalty to his unhappy young lord eleanor noted the gesture and approved marguerite and hal were embracing he brushed tears from her cheeks with his fingers before taking his stallions reins his defiant gaze raked the bailey finding sympathy from most of the onlookers for this was aquitaine these were his mothers vassals only the count of toulouse looked satisfied with his disgrace as their eyes met hal leaned from the saddle and spat seeing that they were about to depart eleanor moved forward trailed by her uncle constable and viscount aimar my lord husband she said go with god and henry acknowledged her farewell with a formal madame brushing his lips to her outstretched hand searching for his other sons he found them standing on the steps of the great hall and gave them a grave salute then signaled his men to move out hal had recovered his aplomb by now and he blew kisses to his wife winked at his cousin maud and smiled at his mother before putting the spurs to his stallion the last glance he cast over his shoulder though was a long meaningful look aimed at william marshal marguerite had begun to sob in earnest and maud put a supportive arm around the girls shaking shoulders but it was then that her eyes came to rest upon henrys queen eleanor was standing with her uncle raoul and her son richard and as maud looked at them it seemed to her as if their faces were carved from stone she instinctively made the sign of the cross to ward off a superstitious sense of foreboding and then turned back to console hals weeping young wife chapter six march chinon castle touraine the day was overcast and at first sight chinon castle seemed under siege by encroaching clouds gazing up at its mistshrouded towers henry felt a weary sense of relief he was back in his own domains now back in the land of his birth and as always returning to chinon was a homecoming as they approached the village people crowded into the streets to watch although theirs was a meager royal procession disappointing for those yearning for spectacle or pageantry travelbegrimed household knights three solemn earls and two troubled kings whod barely spoken a word since leaving limoges reining in before the stone bridge that spanned the river vienne henry glanced at his sons averted face hal had withdrawn into a cocoon of sullen silence when compelled to acknowledge henrys existence he did so with exaggerated deference addressing his father as my liege in a voice dripping with sarcasm henrys half brother hamelin had done his best to restore family harmony but his lectures on filial duty had fallen on deaf ears and hal was soon treating his uncle with the same mocking courtesy he offered his father henry was fond of hamelin but hed never valued his brothers advice and so it was no surprise when hal did not either he had more respect for the earl of essexs judgment and as they crossed the bridge he debated asking the other man to try his hand at peacemaking essex was a renowned knight and hal might pay more heed to his counsel as difficult as it was for henry to ask for help he was realizing that with hal he needed all the help he could get once theyd ridden up the limestone cliff to the castle henry hastened to his bedchamber hed gotten wet while fording a stream earlier in the day and his chausses were clinging clammily to his skin stripping them off he rubbed his legs briskly with a towel while fulke one of his squires rooted around in a coffer for dry clothing his other squire warin was supervising servants as they lugged a second bed up the stairs for henry trusted his son so little now that he insisted they sleep in the same chamber thus guaranteeing that their nights would be as disquieting as their days an older man had just entered bearing henrys favorite falcon on his outstretched arm and henry smiled his mood momentarily lightening see that a chicken is freshkilled for her meal he instructed the falconer making up his mind to fly her on the morrow the season was ending but hed still have a few more afternoons to rejoice in the pure joy of the open air the boundless sky and poetry on the wing he was tempted to ask hal to join him but that was a fools fantasy it would take more than a shared love of hawking to bridge the chasm yawning between them he was pulling on a dry tunic when the earl of essex sought entry henry waved him in without ceremony for essex was more than a loyal vassal eleanor had once compared henry to a welldefended castle claiming that he let some people into his outer bailey very few into the inner bailey and none at all into the keep for whatever reason he remembered that now and acknowledged that essex had earned access to the inner bailey somehow managing to circumvent those barriers set up after thomas beckets betrayal essex had become a friend there was comfort in that realization and surprise too for essex was surely an unlikely candidate to become a kings confidant in so many ways he was an anomaly tall and slender and fairhaired he looked more like a court fop than a warrior but his languorous manner could not be more deceiving he wielded a sword with lethal skill and was one of henrys most capable battle commanders he held an english earldom but hed been raised in flanders growing to manhood at the court of the flemish count philip in the six years since hed inherited his brothers title and returned to england hed been besieged by ambitious mothers hoping to snare him for their marriageable daughters but hed shown no interest in taking a highborn bride only henry knew that hed given his heart to a flemish mistress he could never wed and doted upon an illegitimate daughter who could not inherit his lands and hed gained a welldeserved reputation for loyalty despite being the son of one of the most treacherous disloyal barons ever to draw breath the worst of the lawless lords whod ravaged england during those wretched years when king stephen had fought with henrys mother the empress maude for the english crown geoffrey de mandeville could have taught judas about betrayal and herod about cruelty he had abandoned king stephen for the empress maude deserted maude to pledge his allegiance again to stephen and was contemplating yet another breach of faith when stephen struck first stripping him of his base of power the tower of london as always though stephens punishment was halfhearted and hed allowed the earl to remain at liberty hed promptly rebelled and unleashed hell upon the innocent and the defenseless burning pillaging raping his men devastated towns and churches alike inspiring such fear that it was said the grass withered where he walked hed died assaulting one of stephens castles not long after hed been excommunicated for seizing ramsey abbey since he could not be buried in hallowed ground the knights templar had hung his coffin in a tree so as not to pollute the earth his son and namesake was allowed to inherit the earldom once henry ascended the english throne serving henry faithfully till his death when his title and lands passed to his younger brother william geoffrey de mandeville rested today in consecrated ground the pope having granted a posthumous absolution at his familys behest but his reputation could never be restored and his name was still a byword for treachery and betrayal yet this same man had sired two sons of honor and integrity henry did not understand it any more than hed understood how john marshal could have begotten a worthy son like will he could only be thankful for it if youd hoped for an idle afternoon my liege those hopes are about to be dashed essexs smile was wryly sympathetic word of the kings arrival invariably spreads faster than a summer brushfire and the great hall is already filling with petitioners claimants plaintiffs supplicants and selfseekers of every stripe some have cases pending before your curia regis others want you to resolve local disputes and all of them are entreating that they be heard henry sighed but he was accustomed to this for a kings time was almost as valued as his favor ill grant audiences this afternoon and hold court on the morrow he said casting a regretful look in his falcons direction the priest of st maurices has asked to see you too knowing that henry had paid for the construction of the church essex guessed that hed take a personal interest in its progress do you want to see him first when henry nodded the earl started for the door then paused shall i ask your son to join you in the hall henry hesitated he knew that the earl was trying in a more subtle fashion than hamelin to reconcile father and son would hal be pleased by the invitation but when had he ever shown interest in the more mundane duties of kingship no willem he said using the playful nickname hed bestowed upon the earl in affectionate acknowledgment of the other mans boyhood in flanderswillem being flemish for william more likely than not id have to command his presence and that would defeat the purpose would it not willem took his candor for what it wasa declaration of trustand made a discreet departure for he was wiser than hamelin knew better than to push when the king was ready to talk about his sons wayward behavior he would pick the time and place henrys squires had been quietly conferring for they were constantly engaged in a losing battle to make their lord look more regal and they offered him now a choice of two short cloaks called rhenos one lined with sable the other with miniver henry cared only for staying warm in the great hall and selected at random then fended off their efforts to get him to change his plain green tunic for a more fashionable one with a diagonal neckline when a knock sounded on the door he seized the opportunity to escape their ministrations and strode over to answer it himself he was expecting willem and the priest of st maurices he was not expecting to see his son may i come in henry stepped aside to let hal enter and his squires at once dived for the door murmuring vague excuses as they fled passing strangepeople usually enjoy watching bloodshed hals joke was a lame one but it was a joke nonetheless and henrys initial surprise gave way to astonishment theyd not been on speaking terms for days and suddenly the lad was making jests after considering his possible responses he chose silence waiting warily for hal to reveal his intent hal seemed ill at ease wandering about the chamber he lavished attention upon henrys falcon before picking up one of the discarded cloaks may i borrow this sometime i thought you were aiming higher than a cloak henry said coolly and hal let the garment slip through his fingers onto the floor i hate this he blurted out for the first time meeting henrys eyes what do you hate hal that we are estranged or that you were dragged away from limoges against your will both hal admitted with a flickering smile i have the right of it in our quarrel papa but it serves for naught to fight like this even if we cannot agree we need not turn words into weapons i have said things in anger that i now regret and i hope that is true for you too this is a remarkable change of mood just a few hours ago you were acting as if i were the antichrist if you have experienced a divine revelation like st paul on the road to damascus i will be most interested to hear about it henrys sarcasm was so sharp because hed been affected in spite of himself by his sons use of papa an echo of simpler happier times color rose in hals face but he did not look away i suppose i deserve that he conceded i ought to have found a better way to express my objections to the marriage contract for that i am indeed sorry continuing quickly i do not want you to misunderstand what i am saying though i am apologizing for my bad manners not for my protest as for what caused my remarkable change of mood the creditor blamefor that must go to uncle hamelin at henrys obvious surprise hal could not help grinning i know how unlikely that sounds but even a blind pig finds an acorn occasionally and what acorn did hamelin dig up he reminded me of the date today is the fifth of marchyour birthday henry was taken aback so it is he said for hed indeed been born on this day forty years ago at le mans it had entirely slipped my mind mine toountil uncle hamelin spoke up hal was looking discomfited again he made me see that i owe you better than this he said in a low voice i hope that you can forgive my public rudeness i promise you that it will not happen again henry wanted very much to believe him yes i can forgive you he said cautiously but you must understand hal that nothing has changed and nothing will change until you prove to me that you can be trusted i know that and ill not mislead you papa nothing has changed for me either i am never going to agree to the loss of chinon and the other two castles nor am i going to stop demanding my just due as an anointed king but in the future i will try to keep our quarrels private and i will accord you the respect you deserve as my father and my king hal paused before saying hopefully fair enough henry nodded slowly fair enough hals relief was palpable i was afraid he said that youd not believe me they regarded each other in silence for a few moments neither knowing what to say next fearful of taking a misstep onto such very thin ice reaching down hal retrieved the cloak from the floor rushes and fastened it around his shoulders since we just agreed to a truce he said cheerfully that must mean that i can borrow your clothes no now id best get down to the hall and find uncle hamelin i am going to make him very happy by telling him that he singlehandedly brought about our reconciliation at the door he halted there is one more thing papa i need to request a favor henry said nothing all his suspicions flaring up again hal did not seem to read anything ominous in his silence though for his smile did not waver it was not just my anger that has kept me so quiet since we left limoges ive been coping with a wretched toothache it comes and goes but is worse when i eat or drink henrys response was skeptical not sympathetic and i suppose you want to go into the village in search of a barber wholl pull it again hal surprised him good god no id not let a barber get within a mile of me with a pair of pincers he gave a shudder of mock horror i would like you to send for an apothecary surely there must be herbs that i can take to ease the pain so hal had not been conniving to leave the castle henry had rarely been so happy to be proven wrong yescloves might help i will tell the steward to fetch the village apothecary straightaway hal looked pleased thank you for this fine cloak too he ran his fingers admiringly over the softly woven material i suppose youll want it backeventually this time his smile was full of mischief and it called up memories henry had been seeking to suppress memories of the boy whod been so quick to laugh to tease so proud to be a crowned king not yet corrupted by the siren songs of the french court henry stood motionless for a time after hals departure deliberately calling up echoes of the count of toulouses warning they have played skillfully upon his lack of experience and his poor judgment hed spoken a harsh truth when hed told hal that nothing had changed but he could not deny that the faintest of sparks had been kindled a feeble glimmer of hope in the dark that had descended upon his world at limoges dinner normally scheduled at noon had been shifted to a later hour as part of the lenten abstinence and was not served until after vespers had rung it turned out to be a pleasant surprise for henrys household knights and the castle garrison whod been anticipating gloom and bleak silence instead the meal that evening was informal enjoyable and raucous in the absence of women hal was in high spirits and had the men laughing uproariously over his extravagant account of what he called the saga of the royal tooth he claimed that chinons barber hearing of his malady had stalked him relentlessly all afternoon urging him to have the tooth extracted he vowed that he need not use the pincers if i was skittish about them that there were other ways only these other ways made the pincers sound better and better one method was to coat the ailing tooth with the ashes of earthworms another was to mix up a powder of ants and their eggs and blow it through a quill onto the tooth or smear on a concoction of newts and fen beetles when i questioned where hed find newts or ant eggs he assured me that all the necessary ingredients were at hand by then i realized that he and master gervase the apothecary were partners in crime and i began to fear the worst chinons castellan blinking back tears of mirth offered to send to the nearest city tours or angers to find a surgeon who made his living by pulling teeth hal hastily made the sign of the cross as if to ward off evil jesu forfend sir robert my new friend the barber told me more than any man would want to know about their methods he described a popular procedure in which they cauterize the skin behind the victims ear then heat henbane and leek seeds over hot coals and have him inhale the smoke through a funnel since i know henbane is a poison i assume the next step in the process would be to hide my body afterward several knights chimed in with horror stories of their own but hal was not ready to yield center stage and it occurred to his amused father that hed have made a fine minstrel or player adroitly recapturing control of the conversation hal launched into the next chapter of his narrative his meeting with master gervase the apothecary he said they think pain is caused by worms breeding in the tooth that reassured me greatly of course he explained that the worms could be driven out by lighting a candle made of mutton fat and burning it as close to the ailing tooth as i could endure meanwhile hed hold a basin of cold water under my jaw and the worms would seek to escape the heat and fall into the water i considered it but then i started to wonder how we could be sure that the worms could not swim hal said with such tongueincheek seriousness that the hall erupted into hilarity again when the laughter subsided hamelin provided more fuel for the fire by asking hal what treatment hed finally settled upon hal grimaced and shook his head ruefully by that point uncle id begun to fear that the only choice open to me was to drown the wormsand my sorrowsin drink but when he saw that his sale was in danger master gervase offered a few recommendations more tolerable than ant eggs or powdered newts at first he suggested that i rub the oil of the box tree on the afflicted tooth and i was tempted but then he let slip that this remedy also cured piles which i found right curious did i really want to put a potion meant for the arse into my mouth with an actors innate sense of timing hal paused for the audience to react and was not disappointed seeing that i was not keen on the box tree oil master gervase advised me to rub the tooth and gum with betony or cloveswhich was what my lord father had suggested hours ago slanting a facetious glance toward henry he said so if you ever tire of governing my liege you can always earn a living as an apothecary this time his sally was met with cautious silence his audience waiting to see how henry would react for under the circumstances that could have been a harmless jest or a barbed gibe it was only after henry smiled that the other men felt free to laugh and he realized that some of their merriment was due to sheer relief that father and son seemed to have made peace hal continued to amuse with his comic commentary expressing his doubts about the draught that the apothecary had eventually prescribed to ease his pain and help him sleep a blend of henbane black poppy and bryony root for they were all poisons he wondered too why the martyred maiden apollonia was the patron saint for toothaches when shed had all of her own teeth cruelly extracted by her pagan tormentors wasnt that he mused rather like picking a virgin as the patron saint for whores or a miser as the patron saint for spendthrifts henry enjoyed watching hals performance it had been a long time since hed seen his son so lighthearted so carefree this meal was in such stark contrast to the tense unpalatable dinners theyd endured since leaving limoges that he found himself savoring the bland lenten fare even eating a few mouthfuls of salted herring a despised dish that rarely appeared on a royal table chinons cooks had offered up a particularly mediocre menu confident that henry was not likely to notice the final course was a soupy pudding made with almond milk and dried figs but before the men could push away from the tables hal rose and banged on his wine cup with a knife to attract attention i want to end dinner with a salute to my lord father he announced and on cue a servant entered with a flagon and two silver wine cups reaching for one hal handed the other to henry puzzled he followed his sons lead and leaned over so hal could ceremoniously clink their cups together taking a swallow he looked at hal in surprise for the vessels were filled with hippocras a costly spiced wine that was served only upon special occasions even by the wealthy and highborn looking pleased with himself hal lifted his cup high you may not all know that this is a special daymy lord father the kings birthday i would have you drink to his health and good fortune the men raised their own cups and the hall resounded with cries of to the king glancing back at henry with a sly grin hal signaled for silence i am grateful to my uncle the earl of surrey for reminding me as this is not a birthday to go unmarked it is not every day after all that a man reaches the venerable age of fifty henry inhaled the wine hed been about to swallow and began to cough again the audience quieted watching henry to see if he was amused or annoyed by his sons jape getting his breath back he laughed and the men burst into applause and cheers so grateful were they that the rift between their lord and his son was on the mend none wanted to be forced to choose between them for how could a man weigh the present against the future rising henry lifted his cup as hal had done lets drink now to my son who has every attribute of kingship except the ability to count midst the laughter his gaze came to rest affectionately upon his beaming brother hamelin had given him a birthday gift more valuable than gold silver or myrrh a new beginning henry did not linger long in the great hall for his hours in the saddle had caught up with him and he felt unusually tired after joking with willem that his sons jest had been on target for tonight he felt far closer to fifty than forty he withdrew to his bedchamber in the keep hal had already retired losing much of his earlier animation once his tooth began to pain him again and when henry entered the chamber his son was sound asleep an empty vial of the apothecarys draught in the floor rushes by his bed henrys squires were awaiting him yawning behind their hands as they drowsily assisted him to undress glancing from their drooping eyelids to the flagon of night wine on a nearby table henry smiled guessing that hal had shared it liberally with them none had ever faulted his sons generosity it was his good heart that had gotten him into trouble he was too trusting a troubling flaw in a king he would have to be taught the lessons henry had learned at an early age the bedchamber was lit only by the flickering flames of the dying hearth and there was no sound but the even breathing of hals father and his squires it was difficult to lie still to wait too much was at stake though for impatience and hal did not fling back the bedcovers until he was sure that the other occupants of the chamber were asleep he was fully dressed save for his boots and he hastily pulled them on fastened his belt and slid his sword into its leather scabbard as silently as a ghost he held his breath as he raised the door latch stifling a triumphant laugh when none of them stirred as he slipped out into the stairwell his father preferred to sleep in the keep rather than in the royal apartments hed built along the south wall emerging into the bailey hal stood motionless for a moment his eyes searching the darkness but he could detect no lights no signs of life a few men might still be awake in the great hall though and he quickened his pace until hed gotten past it ahead of him lay the gatehouse flanked on each side by stone towers there he found the guards sharing a flask and throwing dice they sprang to their feet in alarm as he entered for gambling during sentry duty could bring the wrath of the castellan down upon them but their dismay lessened once they recognized hal as he was not known to be a disciplinarian how may we serve you my lord hal had a good memory for faces and hed been at chinon often enough in the past to become acquainted with the garrison he called them by their given names now a familiarity that he knew theyd find flattering giles daniel and mauger is it not i could not sleep he pointed at his jaw knowing that even if theyd not been in the great hall during dinner theyd have heard by now of his afternoon encounter with the barber and apothecary it seems that not even poppy and bryony root are strong enough to vanquish a toothache i was wandering about the bailey like a lost soul and then i saw the light from the gatehouse window giles was their spokesman and he said expansively we would be honored to keep you company my liege alas we lack those comforts that a king has every right to expect with a wave of his hand he took in the barren dimly lit guard chamber weve not even a stool to offer you and the only wine we have tastes like verjuice if you can take my mind off this wretched toothache giles that will matter more to me than all the luxuries of constantinople as for the wine with a grin hal reached under his mantle and produced a wineskin now he said glancing down at the dice what game are we playing hazard or raffle the hour that followed was one the guards would never forget they could scarcely believe that they were gambling with the young king sharing his wineskin and bantering with him as if he were one of their own hal lost more than he won and joked that he had worse luck than a cuckolded husband he asked them about their families and their bedmates for they were too young to afford wives and told them stories of hunts and tournaments giving them glimpses of a world that was as fascinating to them as it was foreign and when mauger complained of his fathers strict ways and heavyhanded discipline hal offered him sympathy and the knowing smile of one whod walked in maugers shoes they were sorry therefore when he stretched and got to his feet for they were not yet ready to return to reality ive kept you from your duties long enough he said wincing as he gingerly touched his sore jaw you are good lads the lot of you seek me out on the morrow and ill find a way to show my appreciation they thanked him profusely dazzled by visions of silver coin and fine wine and a kings favor and assured him that it had been their pleasure to be of service hal smiled tossed his wineskin to mauger and took a step toward the door before pausing there is something else you could do for me he said and they vowed that he need only name it ill not be able to sleep tonight it is not just this accursed tooth in truth ive an itch that only a woman can scratch they grinned for that was an itch they well knew and suggested that any maid servant in the castle would be honored to swive him i suppose so he said with becoming modesty but i have a particular lass in mind one who lives down in the village the young widow of the blacksmith lowering his voice he winked i am depending upon your discretion for shed not like to have her name bandied about the garrison but i can assure you that no man sharing her bed will have any thoughts to spare for teeth they were quiet looking at him in consternation and hal hid a smile for he read their faces and their minds as easily as a monk could read his psalter they wanted to please him were eager to be part of this benign conspiracy knowing they could dine out on this story for the rest of their lives theyd heard the whispers of his disgrace the rumors that he and his father were feuding but hed certainly seemed to be on good terms with the king during dinner and he was famed for his generosity not one to forget a favor it was giles who found the solution we can lower the drawbridge for you my lord but youll have to go on foot hoping hed come up with a compromise that accommodated the young king whilst protecting themselves he waited anxiously to see if it was acceptable to hal to his great relief hal laughed and clapped him on the shoulder why would i need a horse her house is but a stones throw from the bottom of the hill and it was as easy as that to escape from his fathers formidable castle at chinon the night was cold but the days clouds had been swept from the sky by a brisk west wind and the darkness was lit by stars beyond counting hal supposed he should be nervous yet all he felt was excitement it had been hard to wait calmly as the guards manned the chains and winches first raising the iron portcullis and then lowering the drawbridge for the noise seemed loud enough to awaken the dead but no one came out to investigate and hal was soon standing on the causeway waving jauntily at his unwitting accomplices he hoped theyd not pay too high a price for their misplaced trust but to his fathers credit he did not make scapegoats of those who could not defend themselves no his anger would not be turned upon the hapless guards there would be one person hed blame and only one at the bottom of the hill he hesitated then decided to head for the grandcarroi the village crossroads he could only hope he had not long to wait what he would do if his wait were in vain he refused to contemplate the village street was deserted even the dogs were asleep hal had just passed the silhouette of st maurices church when figures stepped from the shadows into his path hal felt no surprise as the moonlight revealed their identities peter fitz guy simon de marisco and of course william marshal these men were far more than members of his retinue they were good friends and he embraced them like brothers peter and simon shared his jubilation but will was somber his expression showing both resolve and recognition of the great risk they were taking hal knew the older man was conflicted for unlike the others he still saw henry as his king not his enemy but his loyalty to his liege lord had proved stronger than his misgivings and hal was deeply touched by his steadfast devotion flinging his arm around wills shoulders he hugged the knight again and privately vowed that will would be well rewarded for his staunch unwavering allegiance i knew youd be here he exulted i knew it simon and peter grinned and began to tell him of the troubles theyd had in their race to reach chinon before the king interrupting each other freely as they complained happily about taking lesserknown roads and getting little sleep and having to hide in the nearby woods as they kept the castle under surveillance it was will who cut their premature celebrating short reminding them tersely that time was of the essence they knew he was right and followed him hastily back into the safety of the shadows explaining to hal that the others were waiting in a copse of trees on the edge of the village what about fresh mounts hal wanted to know were going to need them for well not be able to spare our horses i sent a man ahead to alencon will said so theyll be ready for us when we get there that had been hals main concern for he knew how fast his father traveled under ordinary circumstances in times of need hed shown an uncanny ability to put wings to his horses hooves bless you will he exclaimed rejoicing that a few whispered words to marguerite could have set in motion such a perfect plan hed not doubted though that will would understand the cryptic message shed borneone simple word chinon how could he fail when he had right and god and such valiant knights on his side when they wanted to know how hed gotten out of the castle he grinned and promised to tell them all about his ruse as soon as they were safely away he was eager to share for not many men could claim to have outwitted his father with such ease wills concern about delay was justified though and it would have to wait he liked the looks of the stallion theyd chosen for him it was pawing the grass eager to run so was hal and he swung up into the saddle with a laugh of pure pleasure his eyes moving from face to face he felt such a surge of affection for these men that his throat tightened and his eyes misted songs will be sung and tales told of the events of this night well soon have my fathers hounds on our trail but this is one fox that will not be caught he put spurs to his horse then the wind carrying echoes of his laughter back through the silent streets of the sleeping village my lord wake up my lord henry opened his eyes quickly closed them to shut out the glare of torchlight his head was throbbing and he wanted only to spiral down into sleep again but the voices were insistent filtering the light through his lashes he saw tense faces floating above him harry this was his brothers voice and he guessed that it was hamelins hand clamped upon his shoulder opening his eyes again he gazed blearily at the men hovering around the bed what was the matter with him his head felt as if it were stuffed with cobwebs my lord king you must get up willem was standing beside hamelin your son is gone he has fled the castle henry blinked his gaze sweeping the chamber nearby his squires lay on their pallets snoring peacefully but hals bed was empty what do you mean he is gone what time is it nigh on dawn my liege sitting up with an effort henry saw that his castellan was in the chamber too why was he having so much trouble making sense of this hed always awakened like a cat instantly on the alert fetch that basin he ordered and when hamelin brought it to the bed he splashed water onto his face it was frigid a thin sheen of ice coating the surface and the shock chased away the last of his grogginess what are you saying how could hal have gotten out of the castle these dolts lowered the drawbridge for him glaring over his shoulder the castellan gestured and three terrified young men were shoved forward shrinking back they stared mutely at the king as the castellan gave henry an angry summary of the nights events so they stood there grinning like jackanapes and waved him on his way he concluded caustically and it took half the night ere they realized that he was not coming back and then another hour or so until they mustered the courage to summon me one of the youths stumbled forward and fell to his knees by the bed forgive us my liege he pleaded he wanted to tumble a wench and we could see no harm in it we did not let him take a horse he swallowed looking up at henry with silent tears streaking his face he played us for fools sirei am so sorry he played us all for fools henry said but he was still struggling with disbelief could hal have truly done this could he have been so cunning so false so heartless i am a light sleeper he said how could he have been sure that id not awaken and then he caught his breath comprehension coming like a blow his eyes moved from the flagon of night wine on the table to his squires still sleeping in the midst of turmoil and for a fleeting moment he saw too a silver wine cup filled with hippocras he put it in the wine he whispered they looked at him blankly and he said it again needing to hear the words spoken aloud for only then could he believe them the sleeping draught sweet mary mother of god the sleeping draught for that convenient toothache of his my lord king willem reached out clasped his hand in a warm firm grip what would you have us do henrys head came up saddle the horses the castellan at once headed for the door hamelin was trying to awaken the squires without any luck willem glancing toward the forgotten guards dismissed them with an abrupt gesture they fled the chamber not daring to look back and willem began to gather up clothing for the king henry was already on his feet grabbing garments from the earl he dressed quickly and silently willem waited wisely saying nothing but hamelin could not hold his tongue how could he do this i would never have thought him capable of such treachery moving toward his brother he came to a hesitant halt not sure what to do next harryharry i am so sorry henry looked at him so am i he said at last and then added in a voice that sent chills along hamelins spine but not as sorry as that traitorous whelp will be chapter seven march poitiers poitou the windowseat was cushioned and sunlight was filtering into the solar over mauds shoulder for they were double windows and covered with thin sheets of horn which admitted more light than the usual linen screens a blazing hearth and woolen wall hangings shut out the chill and the fireplace had a feature that maud had not seen before a stone hood that kept the smoke from escaping into the chamber by funneling it up the chimney the floor rushes were fresh and fragrant maud had been impressed to learn that they were changed weekly for she knew some english barons whod consider it extravagant to replace them more than once a year one of eleanors musicians was strumming a plaintive melody on his gittern two of her ladies were embroidering pillow covers and her favorite greyhound was sprawled bellyup before the fire a third attendant was reading aloud for their entertainment the sorrowful tale of starcrossed lovers tristan and iseult it was a pleasant peaceful scene and maud thought again that they knew how to live well in aquitaine little wonder eleanor had yearned for her homeland during her years of marital exile for neither paris nor london could match the splendorsor the comfortsof poitiers eleanor was not stitching as her ladies were and maud realized that shed never seen her friend with a needle in her hand her aunt the empress maude had not been one for embroidery either maud supposed it was a small but subtle form of rebellion for even queens were expected to do needlework to occupy themselves with womanly tasks as for herself maud did not object to this particular domestic duty she was a skilled seamstress and enjoyed exercising her imagination with needle and thread her current project was an elegant chrysom cloth of fine linen in four years of marriage her daughterinlaw bertrada had already given birth to three children and so maud thought it only logical that thered be a need again for christening attire in the coming twelvemonth she was sorry bertrada was not with her at poitiers for shed become quite fond of the girl but her daughterbymarriage had insisted upon returning to england with ranulf rhiannon and rainald shed been surprised that hugh had not taken bertrada when hed departed on pilgrimage after christmas to the holy spanish shrine of santiago de compostela their separation might be for the best though giving bertrada time to recover from her last confinement she knew of no woman whod want to face the birthing chamber every year much less a lass who was barely seventeen thinking of difficult deliveries called johns birth to mind and she glanced toward the queen eleanor was seated at a table occupied with pen and parchment which aroused mauds alwayslively curiosity a letter must be very private indeed if it could not be entrusted to a scribe she was amusing herself by speculating about the nature of her friends confidential message when the door suddenly banged open with enough force to startle them all richard swept into the chamber like a whirlwind that was the only way maud could describe his dramatic entrance he was so flushed that he seemed to be feverish and he looked eerily like his father in his rage he was followed by raoul de faye and a third man who was a stranger to maud slamming the door behind him richard strode toward his mother paying no heed to the others in the solar youll not believe what that damned fool has done maman he fled from chinon castle and has taken refuge at the french court eleanor rose so swiftly that her chair toppled over into the floor rushes one glance toward her attendants was all it took rising they quickly departed the chamber so did the musician it never occurred to maud that the queens dismissal applied to her too and even if it had shed not have stirred from the windowseat nothing short of a direct command would have sufficed given richards remarkable revelation about hal god help him what had that reckless lad done now and why was richard so distraught over his brothers disgrace from what shed observed there was little love lost between them how do you know this richard he was with me when the message came fromwell better we mention no names raoul gazed coolly in mauds direction seeing her not as his nieces friend but as the kings cousin it is true hal has bolted and the cat is amongst the pigeons for certes spotting a flagon and cups he moved to the table and began to pour for them saying wine will not make the news go down any easier but it cannot hurt glancing over his shoulder he beckoned his messenger to come forward tell the queen what you told us the man removed his hat with a flourish then knelt before eleanor my lord dared not commit words to parchment madame lest it fall into the wrong hands but lord raoul knows his identity as do you my lady he bade me come straightaway with the news of the events at chinon your son the young king did indeed take flight when king henry learned of it he rode after him in all haste but the young king made great speed covered more than a hundred miles in less than a day and night and he had planned ahead for fresh horses were awaiting him at alencon king henry continued on though as far as argentan but hed gained no ground and at argentan he was told that lord hal had suddenly veered east he gave up the chase then knowing further pursuit was futile and the young king soon reached safety in the lands of the french kings brother the count of dreux hell and furies eleanor had begun to pace her skirts swirling about her ankles what was he thinking when does he ever think richard straddled a chair and accepted a wine cup from raoul if he were to sell his brain he could claim it had never been used eleanor did not seem to be listening reaching the hearth she stopped suddenly morel jesu i ought to have seen this coming seeing that they did not understand she said he did not take his new stallion left him behind with me at limoges he did not want to risk losing him for he was planning his escape as early as that the messenger still knelt and raoul reached out helped the man to his feet youve done well will be rewarded for your service go down to the great hall and get a meal then tell the steward to find you a bed as the man withdrew moving with the stiffness of one whod spent many hours in the saddle raoul brought a wine cup over to eleanor rather pointedly he did not offer any to maud but she did not notice the snub she was dismayed by hals folly but troubled too by the implications of this mystery messenger raoul de faye had paid one of henrys lords or knights to spy upon him and eleanor had known about itand approved eleanor looked at her wine cup seemed about to drink then set it down how did hal manage to get away it could not have been easy not with harry watching him like a hungry hawk to give the lad credit where due he was right clever about it he got harry to drop his guard by seeking his forgiveness then feigned a toothache to be able to see an apothecary and once hed been given a sleeping draught he put it in his fathers wine raoul laughed but eleanor did not does it matter how he did it richard sounded impatient what matters is that he has put us entre la espada y la pared this was another spanish expression hed picked up from the young king of aragon one he obligingly translated for them now saying it meant between the sword and the wall eleanor seemed lost in her own thoughts and did not respond stepping forward raoul put his hand on her arm the lad is right hals flight was a signed confession of his guilt and confirmed all of harrys suspicions of a conspiracy with the french this means we no longer have time as our ally eleanor hal has flushed our quarry and whether we are ready or not the hunt is on eleanor frowned i am well aware of that uncle my god mauds whispered words seemed to echo in the sudden silence she was staring at eleanor in disbelief you are conspiring against harry eleanor stiffened for shed not expected maud to sound so horrified leave us uncle she said adding you too richard when her son did not move he did not look happy about it but he followed raoul from the solar as soon as the door closed behind them maud rose and crossed the chamber not stopping until she was close enough to look into eleanors eyes is it really true then you are part of this plot eleanor could have said that she had not fully committed herself for it was technically true but that was a sophistry the conspiracy might still be in its initial stages but shed known since limoges that thered be no turning back yes she said resisting the impulse to say more shed not have thought that shed need to explain herself not to maud but the other woman was regarding her now as if they were strangers whatever grievances you have against harry i cannot believe you want him dead of course i do not eleanor snapped neither do my sons nor louis either for that matter can you imagine louis of all men plotting regicide i daresay he hopes to bleed away some of harrys strength to keep him from expanding his empire at louiss expense he hopes too that my sons will be easier to deal with than harry that may well be true for hal but not for richard as hell learn to his cost you keep saying my sons but they are harrys sons too and however you think he has wronged you eleanor nothing could justify turning a mans children against him eleanor was taken aback by the hostility in that accusation you think i did that no harry handled that quite well all by himself my sons love him not and why should they they barely know him richard and geoffrey call him the aquilon a norman name for the north wind he sweeps into their lives wreaking havoc and then moves on with nary a backward glance and when he does pay them heed it is only to make use of them in his various schemes and stratagems that is what kings do and can you truly say that you have not done it too that you are not using richard to protect aquitaine richards interests and aquitaines interests are one and the same there is no conflict there and what of hal it seems to me that you are seizing upon his discontent to right your wrongs how fair is that you could not be more mistaken eleanor said coldly hal did not need me to prod him into rebellion that was harrys doing not mine hal is a crowned king yet he has nothing to call his own harry denies him even the semblance of independence much less any real authority and when hal has protested harry seeks to content him with empty promises let me tell you what hal says of those promisesthat they are counterfeit coin and he is right harry may not be a perfect father but he does love them eleanor you know he does yes ill grant you that but he sees them as pawns on his imperial chessboard hell never treat them as men grown for in his eyes theyll always be children children in need of his guidance and superior wisdom he is convinced he is in the right and is utterly unwilling to compromise why should he he is the puppeteer after all the one pulling the strings but neither hal nor richard are puppets as he is about to discover i do not deny that harry is stubborn or that he makes mistakes some of them grievous certainly he has erred with hal but there had to be another way than this eleanor i thought so tooonce i talked myself hoarse trying to reach him maud trying to make him see that he is the one sowing seeds of rebellion but hed not listen not if it meant sharing power ive told him that he governs as if he never intends to die and it is no jest you know what happens to saplings trapped in the shadow of a massive oak their growth is stunted well i am not going to let that happen not to my sons harry made hal a king and it is time he acknowledges him as one as for richard he will rule aquitaine with me until he grows to manhood and then he will be accountable to the almighty not the king of england and once geoffrey weds constance he will geoffrey too but he is just fourteen need i remind you that when harry was fourteen he hired routiers and went off on his own to england intending to help his mother fight stephen yes and when the routiers balked at his promises of payment and threatened to desert leaving him stranded he asked stephen to lend him money to return to normandy stephen was so amused by his sheer bravado that he did does that sound like your ordinary fourteenyearold eleanor for this is what it comes down to does it not how could you have forgotten the mettle of the man i do not need you to lecture me about harrys capabilities after twenty years of marriage id say i know him far better than you do maud shook her head slowly i am beginning to think that harry is not the only blind one in your family you once described louis as dithering at every royal crossroads he is not going to defeat henry fitz empress not in this life or the next neither are striplings like hal or richard nor are you oh i know you can match harry in shrewdness and daring and iceblooded resolve but you cannot take the field against him can you why do you think i am so distraught over this madness because this is a war you cannot hope to win henry was facing a far more formidable coalition than just louis and her sons but eleanor was not about to reveal that to maud for it was painfully apparent that shed greatly misjudged the other woman she said nothing and after a moment maud moved shivering to the hearth feeling cold to the very marrow of her bones why did you let me stay in the solar i would to god id never heard a word of all this for what am i to do now with what i know eleanor did not doubt the sincerity of her distress but she had no sympathy to spare for mauds misery there is nothing you can do mauds nerves were so raw that it took very little to inflame her temper how can you be so sure of that she challenged how do you know that ill not tell harry what ive learned because eleanor said you love your son as much as i love mine to maud there was something ominous in that matteroffact statement what are you saying eleanor that my son is to be held hostage for my good behavior eleanors eyes narrowed the only sign that she was now as angry as maud no i am saying that your son hugh is one of hals most enthusiastic allies he has pledged his honor and the vast resources of chesters earldom to this rebellion so youd best hope that you are wrong about this being a war we cannot win maud gasped losing color so rapidly that she looked ill ii do not believe you hugh is in spain would he have gone on pilgrimage if he were conspiring against the crown it was a feeble hope though and eleanor was quick to snatch it away the rebellion was not to begin so soon that is why raoul and richard were so vexed with hal hugh expected to have plenty of time to make his pilgrimage and id wager that he planned to pray at santiagos holy shrine for victory not that he shares your doubts about the outcome he sees hal as an anointed king one he wants to serve and there are many young lords who share his convictions maud reached out grasped the back of the closest chair for support she had never been so frightened as she was at this moment if hugh was in rebellion her daughter beatrixs husband might well be implicated too for hed been bedazzled to be the brotherinlaw of the earl of chester it is not enough that youve poisoned your own well she said bitterly no you must poison mine too jesus god you sound just like harry he cannot admit that our sons have minds of their own and it seems that neither can you i did not subvert hughs loyalty did not lead him astray i never even discussed hals grievances with him the choice was his i love my son dearly but i am not blind to his failings he lacks the attributes of leadership has always been easily influenced it would not take much to convince him that hed be embarking upon a great adventure hal would have been just as easily persuaded and thered be many at the french court eager to do the persuading but you could have put a halt to it eleanor if youd warned hal that this rash intrigue could be his ruination hed have listened to you but you did not and ill never forgive you for that she was turning toward the door when eleanor spat you have not been dismissed yet my lady countess maud paused then dropped a deep mocking curtsy at that moment she wanted only to strike out to make eleanor hurt as much as she was hurting and she had the weapon at hand what is there left to say madame unless you wish to discuss those rumors of your involvement in the conspiracy what are you talking about maud feigned surprise harry did not tell you then the count of toulouse sought him out at limoges and warned him that you were plotting with the french king against him eleanor stared at her what sort of game are you playing maud why should i believe you even if that swine st gilles did come to harry with his suspicions how would you have known about it i know because my brother and my uncle were in harrys bedchamber when st gilles brought his baneful offering roger held his tongue of course having had practice in keeping the confidences of the confessional but ranulf knew that i could be trusted with secrets mayhap because id kept so many of his and he told me what happened should you like to know harrys response he was outraged that st gilles should dare to malign you like that not for a heartbeat did he wonder if it could be true as he proved by sending richard and geoffrey back with you to poitiers eleanors throat had tightened but she was not about to let maud see that her words had wounded that does not surprise me his pride would keep him from believing it not pride maud said trust and confident that shed gotten the last word she made her departure eleanor exhaled a ragged breath and sat down abruptly on the settle shed been shocked by mauds judgmental response and she felt betrayed by a woman shed long trusted she was hurt and disappointed but above all she was angry and there was no dearth of targets for her furymaud for her disloyalty hal for his foolhardy flight from chinon raoul for taking pleasure in the wreckage of her family louis for simply being louis raimon st gilles for being even more treacherous than shed realized harry for his obstinacy his arrogance and his faith in her the remainder of her rage she spilled over onto herselffor caring about his pain pain hed brought upon himself she swore aloud using all of henrys favorite oaths but it did not help and when she was nudged by her greyhound she gratefully accepted the dogs silent sympathy she invited the animal up onto the settle beside her and was taking what comfort she could from the abiding absolute loyalty shining from those slanted dark eyes when the door opened and raoul entered the chamber i am guessing that you did not patch up the rift with our troublesome countess he said for when i passed her in the stairwell she drew her skirts about her as if i were infected with the pox eleanor hastily blinked back the tears that had begun to trickle from the corners of her eyes knowing her uncle would see them as womanly weakness for he constantly feared that her regrets might give way to remorse and then repudiation of their plans no we did not patch up the rift she greatly disapproves of our intentions and was not shy about expressing that disapproval why in our ladys name did you allow her to remain in the solar eleanor she asked me the same question eleanor said with a mirthless smile because maud is not a woman to be dismissed as if she were a maid servant she conveniently ignored the fact that shed tried to do just that moments ago because she would have to be told sooner or later especially now that hal has forced our hand and because i thought she would understand you ought to have known better it was only to be expected that her kinship to the king would count for more than her friendship with you blood always wins out what happens now will she try to warn harry no she will not eleanor said with enough certainty to ease his qualms as you say uncle blood will out her love for her son is greater than her loyalty to harry dinner was an elaborate affair as eleanor was entertaining william le templier the new archbishop of bordeaux and john aux bellesmains the bishop of poitiers the first course was being served when her steward was called aside listened intently to the message being murmured in his ear and with apologies hurried from the hall he soon returned and hastened toward the high table madame the king is here he has just ridden into the bailey eleanor set her wine cup down with a thud all along the length of the table she saw her guests reacting to this startling news none of them with pleasure raoul paled and saldebreuil de sanzay frowned and for a brief moment an expression of unease shadowed richards face geoffrey less practiced in concealing his emotions looked downright alarmed although she maintained her public poise eleanor was shaken too for she was not ready to face her husband what if shed been wrong about mauds keeping quiet shed departed the morrow after their confrontation could she have gone to harry after all the steward glanced around the table saw the tension and began to laugh ah no madame tis the young king your son hals unexpected arrival loosed chaos in the hall for he had to be welcomed by the clerics and the other guests and apologies had to be made for interrupting the dinner but at last they were gathered in the privacy of eleanors solar all family except for her venerable constable saldebreuil hal was lounging on the settle with marguerite sitting so close that she was practically in his lap geoffrey was hovering nearby eager to begin bombarding his elder brother with questions raoul and eleanors other uncle hugh were also in high spirits treating hal as if he were returning from a battlefield triumph only richard stood apart and when their eyes met eleanor shot him a silent warning to mind his manners shed long been troubled by the strain between her two oldest sons and she did not want richard to spoil hals homecoming by starting a quarrel as young as he was his sarcasm could be lethal and she did not want him exercising it at hals expense hal was relating the story of his escape from chinon with a flair for the dramatic that would have done justice to the song of roland he was extravagantly complimented for his cleverness and only his mother spared a thought however reluctant for the injury hed inflicted upon his father i never doubted he concluded that i would get away not for a moment just as i knew my knights would be there for me i am indeed blessed to have such loyal men and such a fair wife he added laughing and dropping a kiss upon the tip of marguerites nose she laughed too blushing very becomingly what happened once you reached my fathers court i was welcomed as a king ought to be louis made me a new great seal and i was given lavish quarters in his paris palace and as soon as word spread of my arrival the counts of flanders and boulogne traveled to the french court to meet with me as did the count of blois and hal broke off sat upright on the settle and glanced over at eleanor blue eyes bright with excitement but first i must tell you maman i was knighted in paris it was impossible not to share in his joy and he was immediately inundated with praise even richard bestirred himself to offer a laconic congratulations after a moment to reflect raoul began to laugh well it was not the way hed expected it but harry got his wish hal was knighted by the french king hal looked over at raoul and shook his head i was not knighted by the french king that drew all their attention as hed hoped and he paused to heighten the suspense i asked the most worthy honorable man i know to confer knighthood upon me i asked will marshal there were exclamations of surprise and astonishment for they did not see why hal would have chosen a mere knight to perform such a significant ceremony when he could have had it done by a king only eleanor understood and crossing the solar she leaned over and kissed her eldest son on the cheek that was a very generous gesture hal i am sure will was greatly honored by it hal separated from his wife long enough to rise to his feet and give his mother an exuberant hug i had trouble convincing him that i was serious but once i had he was overwhelmed loyalty like his should be rewarded she said approvingly it does not hurt to let the world know too that you value fidelity a great lord is expected to show great generosity to his vassals and knights it makes others all the more eager to serve you i suppose he said vaguely for the truth was that hed not considered the political ramifications of his choice it had been an impulsive act a way to honor a man he greatly respected the embodiment of knightly chivalry sitting down again beside marguerite he smiled up at his mother i know it was not easy for will to defy my father i am sure he had misgivings and i think he overcame those misgivings because of you maman me what do you mean hal once we were safely in french territory naturally we wanted to celebrate we celebrated so much in fact that the next morn i felt as if the bells of notre dame were going off inside my head even will drank enough to loosen his tongue he started to talk about you maman about how he owed you his very life about what a great queen you were and what an honor it had been to serve you whilst he was one of your household knights he grinned he sounded smitten if truth be told eleanor was pleased but marguerite looked puzzled what did he mean about owing her his life hal slid his arm around her waist quite happy to enlighten her it happened five years ago in poitou darling my mother was ambushed by the de lusignans to save her from capture will and his uncle the earl of salisbury fought like demons she got away safely thank god but the earl was slain and will was wounded and taken prisoner will had no money for the ransom although he lied and pretended that he had kin willing to pay it he knew sooner or later theyd find out the truth but he was desperate to buy as much time as he could thenas he described itthe miracle happened his captors announced that his ransom had been paid by the queen and set him free when he returned to poitiers grateful beyond words my mother not only gave him a position in her household but she provided him with a destrier and chain mail thus winning his heart for all eternity marguerite was regarding eleanor with wide admiring eyes shed been astonished by some of hals stories about his motherthat shed gone on crusade with louis and their caravan had been attacked by saracens that her ship had been captured by pirates in the pay of the byzantine emperor only to be rescued in the nick of time by the king of sicilys fleetbut this one sounded as if it came straight from a minstrels tale you have led the most remarkable life she blurted out like iseult or guinevere both of those legendary queens had also been faithless wives but eleanor knew that her daughterinlaws insult was an innocent one and she smiled at the girl before turning back to hal you mentioned a number of highborn lords have they fully committed themselves to our rebellion indeed they have all of them it was very easy to come to terms with them maman i promised the count of blois two hundred pounds a year and the castle of amboise the count of flanders shall have the county of kent a thousand pounds a year and the castles at dover and rochester and his brother the count of boulogne shall have the county of mortain in normandy and the honour of hay in wales best of all louis thinks that the king of scotland will also commit to our cause in return for northumbria and the earldoms of huntingdon and cambridge for his brother we can count too upon raoul de fougeres and most of the breton barons and in england the earls of chester leicester norfolk and derby not to forget your lords in poitou maman has there ever been such a redoubtable alliance not since all those greek kings sailed for troy at least hed retained some of his tutors lessons eleanor thought but she was appalled by his blithe admission that hed given away so much of his inheritance the others were staring at him with the same amazement only marguerite seemed untroubled by hals shortsighted misguided mistake from the corner of her eye eleanor caught a glimpse of her second son richards lip had curled his disdain so obvious that she knew he was about to pounce and that would only make matters worse moving quickly to forestall him she said hal as gladdened as i am by your visit i am somewhat surprised by it too i know you avoided your fathers domains but even so the danger was great hed pay handsomely to get you back in his control and our world is full of men whod betray their own mothers for a handful of deniers why did you take such a risk the risk had been part of the appeal but hal knew better than to confess to that to his mother i came he said to bring my brothers back with me to paris hal and marguerite had been the first to withdraw after yawning and complaining very unconvincingly that he was exhausted from his journey hed gone off to marguerites bedchamber their laughter giving the lie to his professed intent to sleep richard and geoffrey were the next to go eager to start packing alone in the solar with her uncles and her constable eleanor sat down wearily on the nearest seat an uncomfortable coffer chest you need not say it raoul she warned hal has made a grievous mistake i know that all too well a pity hal does not raoul observed but without heat he was not heartbroken that his grandnephew should be disposing of his lands with such careless abandon and as his eyes met his brothers he saw that hugh agreed with him aquitaine could only benefit by it richard had been quick to see that too saying scornfully before he departed that hal could slice england up six different ways from sunday as long as aquitaine remained intact we have to look upon the bright side raoul continued yes hal is pledging to give away most of his inheritance ere he even comes into it but when harry hears of this he is like to have an apoplectic fit and that would solve our troubles rather neatly eleanor raised her head and there was nothing of the niece in the look she gave him you have said enough she said and raoul knew better than to argue not when she sounded like that he excused himself and hugh soon followed madame when eleanor turned toward him saldebreuil rose and limped over to her this does not bode well for a quick resolution of the rebellion your lord husband will never agree to honor your sons promises and hals new allies will not be willing to make peace unless he does do you think you can talk sense into the lad make him see that hes blundered into a den of thieves eleanor appreciated his candor the bluntness of an old soldier who knew his days were dwindling freeing him to speak his mind it is too late for that he has already struck these devils deals and cannot repudiate themat least not until he wins she added with a queens cynical understanding of statecraft damn louis for this the rest of them are no better than wolves on the prowl but hal is wed to louiss daughter and he owed him better than this saldebreuil thought that eleanors analogy was an apt one for hal was indeed a lamb let loose amongst wolves thankful that their young duke was not as trusting as his elder brother he sat down again for his bones were beginning to ache what will you do my lady if you send richard and geoffrey to paris there will be no turning back i know she said but you saw the looks on their faces theyd set out tonight if it were up to them how could i tell them not to go i cannot do what harry has done treat them like feckless flighty children richard would never accept that and geoffrey is already very jealous if he were not permitted to go to paris too hed never forgive richard events were taking on a momentum of their own and choices were being made for her much to her dismay if only she did not have to rely upon louis if only she could take command of this illassorted coalition but men like philip of flanders were not likely to pay heed to a woman and for a moment she could hear echoes of mauds tarttongued reminder that she could not take the field herself looking up she saw that saldebreuil was watching her with the protective concern allowed an old and devoted retainer and she mustered up a smile for his benefit before saying grimly raoul was right when he said that whether we are ready or not the hunt is on hals rebellion has become a war and it is a war we must win chapter eight april rouen normandy henry held his easter court that april at alencon it was one of the most miserable times of his life his rage still smoldered yet the object of his anger was well out of reach being lauded at the french court he sent archbishop rotrou to paris to fetch his son but he did not have any hopes of success he was still waiting too to hear from eleanor hed dispatched an urgent message instructing her to use her influence with hal but hed not yet gotten a response from her not that he expected shed have any luck in bringing hal to his senses the youth whod betrayed him so cruelly and then fled to his enemys embrace was a stranger to him it was almost enough to make him believe in changelings and since nothing in his life seemed to be going right anymore he was not at all surprised to get a communication from rome informing him that on february the pope had canonized thomas becket as a saint after easter henry moved on to rouen and had rosamund clifford summoned from falaise he took little pleasure in her presence though for his world was out of kilter the archbishop had not yet returned from paris nor had there been word from his queen he lay awake at night dwelling morbidly upon the events at chinon blaming himself for allowing hal to delude him like that and vowing it would never happen again hunting offered a respite from the bleak landscape of his own thoughts but incessant rains often robbed him of even that brief reprieve the only happiness he had that april came with the unexpected arrival from england of his natural son geoff whod raced for southampton and took ship for normandy as soon as hed gotten word of hals defection geoff was the oldest of his children having turned twenty that past december hed been raised in henrys household treated since infancy as the kings son and henry was determined that his outofwedlock birth would not besmirch his prospects his grandfather had done right by his numerous illegitimate children and henry meant to do no less for geoff intending a career in the church for the boy hed put geoff into deacons orders at an early age and bestowed upon him the archdeaconry of lincoln but he had even grander plans in mind for geoff and was very pleased that hed now be able to share them in person with his son the day after geoff reached rouen the weather cleared and henry seized the opportunity to spend the afternoon in the forest of roumare west of the city the season for hart would not begin until the summer but roebucks could be hunted in the spring and henry was eager to try his new pack of running hounds the best of the breed known as chien bauts returning at dusk with enough venison to feed a hundred of christs poor he was weary and muddied and more relaxed than hed been in many weeks geoff deserved much of the credit for his change in mood for his son was as passionate about the hunt as he was and just as competitive they were still squabbling playfully about which of them had brought down the last buck as they entered the city gates and headed toward the ancient ducal castle on the south bank of the river seine i know it was my arrow geoff was insisting turning in the saddle to ask the earl of essex for confirmation of his claim you saw the kill willem tell my father whose arrow brought it down when willem grinned and muddied the waters by suggesting it might well have been his geoff gave a hoot of derision loud enough to startle his stallion which shied suddenly and almost unseated its young rider much to henry and willems amusement geoff was a skilled horseman and soon got his mount under control he was usually thinskinned about being laughed at for like many born on the wrong side of the blanket he was very sensitive to slights but he was so pleased to see his father laughing that this was one time when he was quite content to be the butt of their humor if hed thought it would cheer henrys spirits hed willingly have been tossed head over heels into the seine upon their arrival at the castle henry ordered the deer carcasses to be turned over to his almoner saving only a few haunches for their table that evening he then took geoff and willem to the kennels to show them a litter recently whelped by lerre his favorite lymer bitch and the king of england and his son were soon down on their knees romping with lerres puppies rising reluctantly henry brushed straw from his tunic and bent over to give the mother dog a fond farewell pat he lingered though in the kennels for he wanted a private moment with geoff i needed a day like this for it has been a wearisome week the pope has been complaining that i have left six english bishoprics vacant for far too long and since i am now back on good terms with the church i felt obliged to address his concerns so ive been mulling over candidates hope to have the selections made by months end willem and geoff tactfully refrained from mentioning the reason those bishoprics had been unoccupied for so longbecause henry collected six thousand pounds a year from the revenues of vacant sees henry went on to tell geoff that hed written to the pope assuring him that the vacancies would be filled as soon as free elections could be held geoff nodded politely trying to hide his boredom even though he knew he was destined for a career in the church he had little interest in church matters if it had been up to him hed have chosen knighthood but hed been loath to confess this to henry hed do almost anything to avoid disappointing his father at the mention of free elections willem began to laugh it must be said that you have your own interpretation of what free election means my liege may i tell geoff about the instructions you sent yesterday to the cathedral chapter at winchester when henry shrugged willem turned to geoff your lord father ordered the monks to hold a free election and then he added but i forbid you to accept anyone save my clerk richard de ilchester archdeacon of poitiers geoff grinned and the corner of henrys mouth twitched even as he protested that he was merely trying to make sure that there were no misunderstandings i am giving the bishopric of ely to my chancellor geoffrey ridel he deserves it for his steadfast loyalty during the clash with becket i am inclining toward robert foliot for hereford as he is kin to the bishop of london that was not a surprise for the bishop of london had also given henry unwavering support against becket and geoff nodded again but his fathers next words took his breath away i mean the bishopric of lincoln to go to you lad me butbut i am not even a priest neither was becket until two days ere he was consecrated as archbishop of canterbury yes geoff thought and we know how well that turned out he could not say that though to henry and he mumbled his thanks with such a lack of enthusiasm that even henry noticed the prospect of becoming a bishop was an alarming one to geoff but he was an optimist both by nature and experience and he was soon consoling himself that his consecration could be delayed for months even years he could argue with perfect truth that he was too young to hold such an exalted position once he was in his chamber in the keep henry washed and changed his hunting clothes all the while giving some thought to geoffs muted response geoff was usually so highspirited and exuberant grateful for the smallest favor mayhap he felt overwhelmed by the honor he would have to talk to the lad reassure him that he was worthy of it he was bantering with his squires who were delighted to see him so cheerful when a knock sounded at the door after a whispered exchange in the stairwell warin glanced back at henry it is the archbishop of rouen my liege not waiting to be told he stepped back so rotrou could enter for he knew how impatiently henry had been awaiting his return from paris rotrou was not alone accompanied by arnulf bishop of lisieux henrys brother hamelin maurice de craon an angevin baron and longtime friend and willem still in his muddied hunting garb henry knew at once that rotrou did not bring welcome tidings he was an elderly man but he seemed to have aged a decade in the fortnight since henry had last seen him hamelins face was a mirror reflecting utter misery and while willem looked impassive his very presence was ominous for rotrou would not have needed his support unless his news was dire indeed but what sent a prickle of unease along henrys spine was a memory triggered by the sight of rotrou and arnulf together they had been the ones whod come to tell him of beckets murder welcome back my lord archbishop henry gestured toward a chair but rotrou shook his head fearing that if he sat down hed not be able to get up again never had he dreaded anything as he dreaded telling the king what hed learned in paris as terrible as it had been to bring word of beckets murder this was worse there was no way to soften the blow and so he did not try when i met with the french king and demanded that the young king be sent back to your court so you might resolve your differences he interrupted to ask me who sent such a message i replied of course the king of england and he said that was impossible since the king of england was there with him and had no need to send ambassadors he went on to claim that your sons coronation established him as the true king the only king henrys jaw clenched and hot color surged into his face and throat the anger hed felt toward hal was submerged in the scalding rage now directed at the french king his son was an idiot but the true guilt was louis capets hed taken advantage of hals credulous nature poisoned his mind against his own blood and made of him a cats paw a dupe of the french crown with an effort henry found a strained smile for the aged cleric i ask your pardon my lord archbishop for sending you on a fools errand it was a cruel waste of your time little wonder you look so boneweary my lord kingthere is more i would give anything if i did not have to tell you this the young king was not alone at the french court his brothers richard and geoffrey are there with him no that is not possible you must be mistaken my liege i saw them with my own eyes i spoke to them henry continued to shake his head that makes no sense even if hal somehow bedazzled them with promises and bribes eleanor would not have let them join in his folly she would never have allowed them to follow him to the french court the archbishop no longer met henrys eyes she sent them to paris my lord she has been conspiring with your enemies against you ii cannot explain how she could have so forgotten the loyalty and obedience she owes you as your wife and queen it is almost as if the french king has cast a spell upon your entire family but there is no doubt of her participation in this odious unholy plot your sons admitted it nay they boasted of it a suffocating silence fell when the men realized that henry was not going to speak they quietly withdrew for even hamelin understood that there was no comfort they could offer no balm for a wound so deep henry had lost track of time it could have been hours it could have been days since the archbishop had told him that hed lost his sons and had been betrayed by his own queen he was not in pain not yet he was numb so stunned that nothing seemed real when hed learned of beckets murder hed been plunged into an emotional cauldron overwhelmed with grief anger shock guilt and fear feelings so intense that it was as if he were drowning in them nownow there was only a void a vast emptiness filling his head and his heart he did not hear the knocking at first and when he did he could not rouse himself to respond he did not even turn his head when the door opened continuing to stare into the hearths shooting flames mesmerized by that whitegold blaze of heat and light and sheer raw energy passing strange how fire could be both a blessing and a scourge saving life and taking it keeping winter at bay even as it devoured the damned the sinners condemned to the deepest pits of helleverlasting my liegeharry he looked up unwillingly saw willem standing beside him with geoff hovering by the door we brought you some food the earl said softly should you get hungry later a stray thought surfaced the realization that this was the first time the other man had ever called him by his given name he nodded in acknowledgment and waited for them to go away but when he turned his eyes from the fire they were still there and after a prolonged pause willem began to speak i was eleven when my father died being so far away made it harder for me as id not yet come to think of flanders as home id never truly known him not the man he really was but i loved the man i thought he was and i grieved for him when i learned the truththat he was accursed with the mark of cain upon himi fought against believing it as long as i could as young as i was i understood that i was losing far more than my father i was losing my past my memories could no longer comfort me for they were false henry had never heard willem speak of his father hed not so much as mentioned his name those echoes of that young boys pain penetrated his haze and he looked intently into the other mans face and once you did believe it willemwhat then how did you learn to live with a loss like that i tried to find answers how could he have been so kind to my brothers and me and yet capable of such unforgivable cruelty i wellnigh drove myself mad looking for reasons for justifications for any glimmer of light henrys eyes caught his and held and did you find the answers you sought no i did not sometimes there are no answers to be found harryand that was the hardest lesson of all willem was still holding the platter of food setting it down on the table he said well leave you now god keep you my liege henry got to his feet as he heard the door close behind willem the aroma of roasted venison wafted off the trencher but he was not tempted his gorge rose in his throat at the very sight of the sliced meat he could not imagine ever taking pleasure in a meal again ever taking pleasure in anything as he turned away he saw that his son had not gone with willem geoff still stood by the door clutching a wine flask to his chest looking so young and wretched that henrys frozen heart felt the first thawing he did not welcome it did not want to feel again you need not stay lad geoff hesitated but he stood his ground and then he found his tongue and his words came tumbling out in a desperate rush i brought you wine papa i thoughtthought it might help getting drunk i mean much to his surprise a ghost of a smile flitted across henrys lips believe it or not geoff ive never gotten drunk i have geoff said earnestly and it does chase the hurt away venturing farther into the chamber he held the wine flask out to henry and inhaled audibly when his father took it geoff was still in shock too hed always liked the queen for shed been good to him her kindness had puzzled him at first but he decided she did not mind his fathers straying since it occurred whilst theyd been long apart during those sixteen months when hed been in england fighting to claim the crown that was rightfully his but she was now jezebel in his eyes one with delilah and bathsheba all the wicked women of scriptures and he harbored a savage hope that she too would end her days as jezebel did in ignominy and shame carrion for hungry dogs at least now you know why hal and his brothers were so easily led astray he said and then tensed afraid hed overstepped his bounds but his father showed no anger and he was emboldened to continue she turned them against you papa they would never have heeded the french kings blandishments if she had not urged them on as unwelcome as it was that was the first logical explanation offered for why his sons had become his enemies hals defection to the french court was a festering wound one he suspected hed take to his grave for it could never heal if he could not understand why it had happened richard and geoffreys treachery was even more incomprehensible to him but if it were all eleanors doing it suddenly made dreadful sense she had stolen his sons away turned them into weapons to use against him and fool that he was hed never seen it coming never suspected for even a moment that she was capable of such a vile unforgivable betrayal papado you want me to go henry looked at his son and then slowly shook his head no lad i want you to stay theyd not talked passing the wine flask back and forth as they watched the hearth log burn away into ashes and cinders and glowing embers eventually geoff had fallen asleep in the floor rushes not stirring even as henry tucked a blanket around his shoulders a pale grey light was trickling through the cracks in the shutters and henry guessed that dawn must be nigh hed not slept nor had he been able to follow geoffs advice and drown his sorrows in spiced red wine hed passed the longest night of his life locked in mortal combat with his ghosts calling up and then disavowing twenty years of memories he would banish that bitch from his heart if it meant cutting her out with his own dagger and when at last he allowed himself to grieve he did so silently and unwillingly his tears hidden by the darkness his rage congealing into a core of ice geoff was awakening yawning and stretching blinking in bewilderment to find himself on the floor remembrance soon came flooding back and he jerked upright his eyes frantically roaming the chamber in search of his father papa papaare you all right he immediately cursed his clumsy tongue how could a man be all right with a knife thrust into his back but when henry answered his voice was level and measured revealing nothing of the nights turmoil i am well enough geoff he said rising from the windowseat and moving to the hearth where he sought in vain to revive a few sparks i have need of you this morning lad anything papa anything at all first i want you to fetch my squires then find willem and tell him that i shall be holding a council meeting this afternoon lastly i want you to go to a house on st catherines mount close by the church of st paul i shall give you a letter to deliver to the lady dwelling there tell her to start packing her belongings that i will be sending a cart i want her moved into the castle by nightfall chapter nine july rouen normandy letter from rotrou archbishop of rouen to eleanor queen of england greetings in the search for peace marriage is a firm and indissoluble union truly whoever separates a married couple becomes a transgressor of the divine commandment so the woman is at fault who leaves her husband and fails to keep the trust of this social bond a woman who is not under the headship of the husband violates the condition of nature the mandate of the apostle and the law of scripture the head of the woman is the man she is created from him and she is subject to his power we deplore publicly and regretfully that while you are a most prudent woman you have left your husband you have opened the way for the lordkings and your own children to rise up against the father we know that unless you return to your husband you will be the cause of widespread disaster while you alone are now the delinquent one your actions will result in ruin for everyone in the kingdom therefore illustrious queen return to your husband and our king in your reconciliation peace will be restored from distress and in your return joy may return to all if our pleadings do not move you to this at least let the affliction of the people the imminent pressure of the church and the desolation of the kingdom stir you for either truth deceives or every kingdom divided against itself will be destroyed and so before this matter reaches a bad end you should return with your sons to your husband whom you have promised to obey and live with turn back so that neither you nor your sons become suspect we are certain that he will show you every possible kindness and the surest guarantee of safety truly you are our parishioner as much as your husband we cannot fall short in justice either you will return to your husband or we must call upon canon law and use ecclesiastic censures against you we say this reluctantly but unless you come back to your senses with sorrow and tears we will do so eleanor did not reply the bishop of worcesters ship approached the norman coast at dusk and anchored in the seine estuary two days later roger disembarked at the rouen docks and he was admitted to the kings riverside castle as the noonday sun reached its zenith as usual he traveled with only a small retinue and they were quickly settled in roger then went in search of his cousin the king he soon learned that henry was absent off hunting in the roumare forest the great hall was empty the inner bailey all but deserted he assumed that the barons with henry were part of the hunting party and archbishop rotrou would be found in his own palace close by the great cathedral but there was something eerie about the silence the lack of the customary hustle and bustle and organized disorder that heralded the kings presence not wanting to go back to his cramped stifling chamber he found himself wandering aimlessly about the castle grounds as if movement could keep his troubled thoughts at bay had fortunes wheel ever spun so wildly his cousin had begun the year as the most powerful king in all of christendom only to be struck down by one calamity after another the betrayal by his queen and sons had opened the floodgates inundating him in wave after wave of defections and desertions anjou and maine were for the most part loyal but brittany england and normandy were in peril and roger could not help wondering if henry was being punished for the death of the churchs newest saint thomas of blessed memory rogers own nephew the earl of chester had joined the breton rebels the earl of leicester son of henrys former justiciar was with hal as was his cousin the count of meulan the chamberlain of normandy had treacherously gone over to the enemy bringing with him more than one hundred armed knights the earls of derby and norfolk had thrown in their lot with the rebels and other english lords were under suspicion including rogers elder brother william earl of gloucester for the most sinister aspect of rebellion was that the kings vassals need not openly declare for hal to do henry harm they need only do nothing and that was what many of them were choosing to do waiting to see who was likely to prevail father or son england was rife with rumors and speculation fed by the news coming out of normandy in june a twopronged assault had begun upon the eastern border philip dalsace the count of flanders and his brother matthew the count of boulogne were laying siege to driencourt while louis led a french army against verneuil should these two fortresses fall the road to rouen would be open to them as alarming as that was henrys english supporters were alarmed too by his apparent inactivity hed been at rouen for more than three months the longest hed ever been in one place during his entire reign and by all accounts hed been passing most of his days hunting deer not rebels concern for henrys mental state had been one of the reasons for rogers trip to rouen the other was the cloud of suspicion hanging over his older brother he did not want william to be tarred with hughs brush nor did he want his sister maud to be banished from royal favor it was not her fault that her son had turned to treason and he hoped to make henry understand that the sun was high overhead radiating heat rarely felt in england and roger was heading back to the great hall when a shout echoed from the battlements riders coming in he halted hoping it might be henry returning from the hunt it wasnt but the new arrival was a welcome one william de mandeville the earl of essex once theyd exchanged greetings willem turned his horses reins over to his squire smiling when roger asked why hed not gone hunting with the king hed been meeting with some of the routiers he explained as a new contingent had just arrived from brabant roger was not surprised to hear that for he knew such mercenaries were the backbone of his cousins army rather than relying upon the grudging military service given by his vassals henry preferred to hire professional soldiers and such men were always easy to find despite the disapproval of the church routiers from brabant and flanders and even wales were available for those lords with enough money to engage them debating that point with roger henry had insisted that routiers made superior fighters because they could be mobilized at once they would serve as long as they were paid their desire for plunder gave them enthusiasm for their work and their fearsome reputation often weakened enemy morale roger had not been convinced by his cousins arguments for he still thought it immoral for a man to earn his living by killing fellow christians but now he felt a flicker of relief so worried was he about henrys plight at least hed have routiers on hand for the defense of rouen should it come to that i hope you are bringing good news about the siege of leicester willem said and roger was pleased to reply in the affirmative henrys justiciar richard de lucy and his uncles rainald and ranulf had been besieging the city and castle of the rebel earl of leicester since early july and roger was now able to tell willem that the townspeople had surrendered the castle still held out and a truce had been struck till michaelmas rogers other news was not as encouraging though de lucy had ended the siege of leicester castle in order to hurry north where the scots king had been staging bloody border raids now it is your turn willem the last we heard in england the sieges of driencourt and verneuil were still continuing tell me they have not fallen i would that i could driencourt fell to the counts of flanders and boulogne last week and they moved on to arques the siege of verneuil still goes on the town is composed of three wards called burghs each with its own walls and ditch the french have taken the first two but the third and the castle still hold out roger stared at the other man jesu how can you sound so calm arques is less than twenty miles from rouen first of all rouen is well defended no easy prize for the taking secondly the flemings suffered a great reversal at arques the count of boulogne took an arrow in the knee and the wound has festered his brother was so distraught that he halted their advance whilst matthews injury is treated roger did not see that as such a great reversal hed met the count of flanders and he thought philip was the most formidable foe that henry was facing far more ruthless than louis how long would his brotherly concern last i do not understand why harry has taken no action why does he linger here at rouen doing nothing why did he not try to relieve the sieges of verneuil or driencourt willems smile was one of patronizing patience he was wryly amused that people were always so quick to make uninformed judgments about military matters as clever as roger was had he ever led an army planned a campaign the king was wise enough to see that he had to wait for his foes to move first beset on so many sides he has to fight a defensive war and he understood from the first that normandy must be protected at whatever cost if he were to lose normandy many of his english barons with lands on this side of the channel would join the rebellion to save those estates moreover hed be forced to choose between england and anjou if normandy was taken trust me roger it has not been easy for him to wait like this he is a man accustomed to seizing the initiative trust me too that he has not been doing nothing he fortified all his border castles often using his hunting as a means of sending confidential messages or holding clandestine meetings he has more than five thousand brabancon routiers at his command and he made a swift secret trip to england this spring to bring back money from the royal treasuries at winchester and northampton so he can hire more if need be when the time is right hell strike back and when he does i have no doubt that he will prevail from your lips to gods ears roger said lightly but he was greatly reassured by willems cool certainty for he respected the earls grasp of strategy and battle lore tell me willem how is harry copingtruly willem shrugged it is hard to say he has never been one for confiding has he i am guessing that he draws strength from his anger at least during the daylight hours how he fares alone at night is between him and the almighty the sun was hot upon his face and he touched rogers arm saying lets find some shade in the gardens and you can tell me about the new archbishop of canterburys thwarted consecration roger grimaced that was a disaster all was in readiness for the ceremony and on that very day we got a letter from hal claiming that the archbishops election was invalid because hed not given his approval and warning us that hed made an appeal to the holy father so we still lack an archbishop until we hear from rome which is most unfortunatealthough ill admit that i thought the monks had made a poor choice in prior richard oh the man is laudably inoffensive with the virtue of realizing his limitations but he is hardly a worthy successor to st thomas willem thought that prior richards appeal might have been the fact that he was so very different from the volatile intense martyred archbishop but he was too tactful to say so to roger knowing he and becket had been friends opening the gate into the gardens he asked if there was any chance that hals ploy could succeed and the pope take his side roger shook his head i see louiss fine hand in this appeal to rome he was outraged that harry was able to reconcile with the church so easily and hed like nothing better than to stir up more trouble between harry and the holy see but the pope thought it was in the churchs best interests to make peace with so powerful a king and he roger stopped in midsentence distracted by the sight meeting his eyes five boys were racing around the gardens laughing and shrieking the object of their amusement was a young blindfolded woman laughing too as she stretched her arms out trying to catch them as they danced around her both men smiled for theyd often played hoodman blind themselves in their youth roger assumed that the children were some of the sons of the nobility being educated in the kings household and as he drew closer he recognized one of them from henrys christmas court at chinon his uncle ranulfs youngest son morgan morgan recognized him too and ended the game by crying out cousin roger as he dashed over to embrace his kinsman the other children began to back away seeing that the fun was over the woman removed her blindfold and at once dropped down in a deep curtsy she was very pretty with blue eyes and fair skin too well dressed to be a nursemaid she was obviously known to willem though for he strode forward and gallantly kissed her hand then glanced back at roger with a glint of mischief my lord bishop may i present the lady rosamund clifford my lady this is the kings cousin the bishop of worcester rosamund flushed as she and roger exchanged stilted greetings and she quickly made her excuses her withdrawal from the gardens so hasty that it was practically an escape the boys trailing in her wake roger gazed after her taken aback so this was the infamous rosamund clifford reading his thoughts willem grinned she is not as you expected is she no she is not roger conceded i thought shed be moremore sultry he said eleanor was a great beauty after all when she was younger i suppose i imagined rosamund to be cast in the same mold i know the lass is comely enough but she is no cleopatra she is soothing though and mayhap that has its own charm willem laughed softly much has been said of the queen but i daresay none have ever called her soothing have they indeed not roger agreed hed heard that henry was now openly living in sin with rosamund and while he deplored adultery of course he could understand why the king had taken such a defiant stance in light of the queens betrayal well at least there is one who is benefiting from these tragic events you mean rosamund i doubt it the world is full of women eager to be the kings concubine but rosamund does not seem comfortable in that role that is to her credit roger said thinking sadly that there were no winners in this wretched family war then only losersand with the worst still to come roger went to bed early that evening and had just fallen asleep when he was awakened with a summons from henry who was having a late supper with the hunting party by the time hed dressed and gone to the great hall the meal was done for henry was never one to linger at the table he impatiently cut short rogers formal greeting saying come with me cousin roger did following him out into the inner bailey the days heat had faded and the sky was a deep twilight turquoise stars glimmering like scattered shards of crystal it was a beautiful evening but henry seemed oblivious to his surroundings even after theyd entered the gardens he paid no heed to the fragrant roses the scent of honeysuckle and thyme or the soft bubbling of the fountain roger wondered if he remembered that the garden was eleanors creation hoped he did not so henry said have you brought me any good news from england or more bad tidings the edge in his voice put roger in mind of a finely honed sword blade and he was grateful that he did have good news to offer i learned ere i sailed that the scots king was retreating back across the border after failing to take carlisle the royal army was in close pursuit and burned berwick in retaliation for the scots ravages in northumberland he could not tell if henry had heard that already his expression gave away nothing the scots king is a twolegged viper henry said after a long silence he offered to aid me in putting down the rebellion providing at his own cost a thousand armed knights if id recognize his claim to northumbria i said no but hal was willing to promise that and more from what i hear he has been so openhanded with his new allies that if i died tomorrow and he had his victory thered be little left to govern all the more reason then roger said quietly to make sure that he does not win and henry gave him a sharp searching look it gladdens me to hear you say that cousin i would that all of your family shared the sentiment roger did not shrink from the challenge we are deeply shamed by my nephew hughs treachery but he is an aberration harry a foolish youth easily seduced to folly the rest of us remain loyal to the true king to you i never doubted your loyalty roger but what of your brother can you speak for him yes i can roger moved closer so that light from the rising moon fell across henrys face my father was a great man loyal to your mother and you until his last breath it would not be too much to say that you might not have won your crown if not for his unwavering support ill grant you that henry said but we were not speaking of my uncle robert may god assoil him we were speaking of your brother william no one would call william a great man if truth be told i have always thought him to be a bit of a fool but he is no traitor cousin he is your liegeman and only yours i bear a letter from him assuring you of that reaching into his tunic roger held a sealed parchment out and after a barely perceptible pause henry took it tucking it away in his belt i have a message too from my sister maud would have you know that she was deeply grieved when hugh joined the rebellion it broke her heart henry wanted to believe roger for hed always been very fond of maud but belief did not come easily to him these days i am sure you will understand if i have doubts about that cousin because of the friendship between maud and your queen that was one more casualty of this accursed rebellion he decided not to push further do you know where they areyour sons henrys mouth curved down hal has had a busy summer with the counts of flanders and boulogne at the siege at driencourt the last i heard richard and geoffrey were still in paris supposedly being looked after by raoul de fayehardly the ideal choice for a guardianso god only knows how they are abusing their newfound freedom and my devoted queen continues to spin her webs from poitiers roger sighed having no words to assuage such bitterness he chose instead to return to the conversation hed had earlier that day with the earl of essex for he needed to know that henry shared willems confidence willem told me that the count of flanders has halted his march upon rouen whilst his brother recovers from his wound it surprised me that philip should show such family feeling for i always thought the man had ice water in his veins you are forgetting that matthew is more than philips brother he is his heir too roger had indeed forgotten that the count of flanderss marriage was childless passing strange he thought that philip and matthew were both wed to nieces of eleanor the daughters of her dead sister petronilla harry was right about the queens webs they covered half of christendom philip is a twolegged viper too he said acidly for all that he poses as a champion of chivalry and knightly honor you do not know the half of it roger louis was stricken with his usual eleventhhour misgivings and when he realized that war was actually at hand he began to waver like a reed in a high wind my agents at the french court told me that it was philip who bolstered louiss quavering resolve harrywhat happens if verneuil falls to the french willem seems to think that rouen could still hold out but id rather not see englands king trapped in a town under siege neither would i henry said dryly but verneuil is not going to be taken i recalled hugh de lacy from ireland and sent him to verneuil ere the siege began if need be hell hold the castle till hell freezes over but it will not come to that not with louis in command roger sensed that henry was talking about more than the fate of verneuil you expect to win this war then he said and henry gave a short harsh laugh should the day ever come when i cannot outwit or outfight louis capet ill willingly abdicate henry had begun to pace crunching the gravel underfoot for he still wore his hunting boots archbishop rotrou said he could almost believe louis had cast a malevolent spell upon my family that gives louis too much credit if he ever took up the black arts hed bewitch himself as likely as not i suppose the argument might be made that my sons are feebleminded and that could certainly apply to hal but ive seen no evidence that richard and geoffrey share his absurd faith in french honor roger hesitated but the answer henry was groping for seemed so obvious to him that he could not hold his tongue if you are searching for the sinister force behind this rebellion harry you need look no farther than poitiers my beloved wife the circe of aquitaine henry laughed again and to roger it was like the sound of shattering glass instead of turning men into swine she turns my sons into rebels but it was so damnably easy for her roger that is what i do not understand why were they so susceptible to her poison roger did not know and another silence fell as he watched henry stride back and forth on the narrow garden walkway he was somewhat surprised that the other man was willing to discuss his familys treachery but he was flattered too that henry had chosen him as a confidant cousinmy confessor has another explanation for my recent trials and tribulations he thinks that god is punishing me for thomas beckets death rogers jaw dropped almost at once he dismissed the claim that this explanation had come from henrys confessor sure that hed never have dared to suggest that to the king hed given up hope of ever hearing these words from his cousins lips but now that he had he was quick to seize this rare precious chance to save a soul that same thought has occurred to me too harry that was not the answer henry wanted why he demanded that would make my penance at avranches rather pointless would it not how honest do you want me to be cousin henry frowned i asked you he said at last because you are a man of god and because you were the only one with the courage to tell me that you blamed me for beckets murder that if i were not guilty neither was i innocent so yesi want you to be honest very well i do not think you are truly contrite harry oh you said all the right things to the bishops and papal legates but your actions send another message look at the bishops you recently selected to fill those vacant sees four of the six were men either actively hostile to thomas or kin to those who were henrys face had hardened but he said tersely go on this rebellion you are facingit is inexplicable in so many ways you yourself questioned how eleanor could so easily have subverted your lads and then there is her involvement i am a student of history harry and there is no shortage of tales of rebellious sons but i know of no other queen who dared to rebel against her lord husband so i have wondered how it came to pass and i have wondered too if the almighty has looked into your heart and saw that you have not truly atoned for your part in thomass death do not be shy roger hold nothing back roger ignored the sarcasm you asked what i thought harry you are the only one who knows if i am right but i would urge you to search your conscience and if you do indeed repent thomass death for all the wrong reasons you must come to terms with that do you know what i am thinking now that i am very glad you are not my confessor henry picked a rose from a nearby bush idly tore off the petals and dropped them onto the grass at his feet there is one problem with your theory of divine retribution roger if i accepted it that would cast eleanor as the instrument of the almighty roger smiled not at all discouraged for he was accustomed to his cousins gallows humor hed planted a seed one that might god willing take root and for now he was content with that henry had halted head cocked to the side and then roger heard it too a familiar voice calling out my lord king they were turning toward the sound as willem hastened into the gardens a messenger has just ridden in he said breathlessly the count of boulogne is dead they crowded around henry as he read rapidly by torchlight when he looked up it was with a chilling smile count philip was so stricken by his brothers death that he has ended the campaign is leading his army back into flanders it seems his chaplain and other churchmen told him that this was gods punishment for stirring sons to rebellion against their father there was a stunned silence and then the great hall erupted in cheers and laughter taking advantage of the turmoil roger slipped away the castle chapel was empty although candles still flickered and the scent of incense hung in the air approaching the altar he knelt and prayed for the kingdom and for his cousins troubled family hal might have been forgiven for thinking that war was good sport as his initial foray was a highly successful one hed captured the castle of one of his fathers vassals hugh de gornai and had taken prisoner the baron himself and eighty of his knights this was the first time that hed bloodied his sword and it had been an exhilarating experience after that he joined the army of the counts of flanders and boulogne and that too was exciting for he had great respect for count philip who was widely known as a preudomme a man of prowess the highest compliment that could be paid in their world when driencourt castle surrendered after a twoweek siege it only confirmed hals giddy certainty that victory would soon be within their grasp but then count matthew was wounded at arques and within a few days he was dead that was a shock to hal for hed genuinely liked the count a cousin as well as an ally even more stunning was count philips sudden decision to end the campaign and withdraw to his own lands shaken and bereft hal had ridden south to verneuil in need of his fatherinlaws solace there he soon regained his emotional equilibrium louis had greeted him with flattering warmth assured him that count philip would rejoin the campaign once hed had time to grieve and predicted that verneuil was on the verge of collapse only the castle and one of the burghs held out and hunger was prowling the streets of the beleaguered town it was just a matter of time louis said until verneuil was theirs that time seemed to have come on august when a delegation of citizens ventured out under a flag of truce admitting that their people were woefully short of food they asked louis for a truce so that they could warn the english king that they must surrender if he could not raise the siege this was normal practice and louis was compelled by the chivalric code to grant their request he gave them only three days though an unusually brief respite on august the town must yield if henry had not come to their rescue by then and louis in turn promised that their surrender would be on honorable terms with no harm to the townspeople or their chattels or the hostages they offered up as proof of good faith hals spirits soared with yet another triumph within reach and the next two days passed quite pleasantly for with military operations suspended he and his knights amused themselves with bohorts informal tourney games as the sky streaked with the vivid colors of sunset baldwin de bethune borrowed some dice and they cleared a space so they could gamble by firelight hal ordered a keg of wine to be brought out declaring that a celebration was in order for on the morrow the town would surrender and the castle would soon be forced to seek terms too he did not have a chance to enjoy his impromptu festivities though for it was then that he was summoned to the french kings command tent as soon as he ducked under the canvas tent flap hal knew that something was wrong the men were somber their expressions troubled and louis was as white as newly skimmed milk he is here he blurted out and hal caught his breath my father i thought he was in rouen he was the kings brother robert said testily but now he is at conches with an army and he has sent us an ultimatumthat we either end the siege and withdraw or we do battle on the morrow hals stomach lurched for he did not want to face his father on the battlefield louis had assured him that it would never come to that as he looked at his fatherinlaw it was obvious that louis did not want to fight his father either a quick glance around the tent told him that few of the men did hal knew pitched battles were rare for most lords and kings preferred skirmishing and sieges to risking all on one throw of the dice but he sensed that there was more at work here than the usual military caution his father cast a long shadow louis was standing by an oaken trestle table reaching for a silver cup he drained the wine in several deep gulps hal was startled to see that his hand was none too steady how did he get here in time louis asked blessed lady i only gave them three days how does he ever do it robert snapped for he was always ready to blame louis when their plans went awry for twenty years he has been doing what mortal man cannot you ought to be used to it by now he could feel verneuil slipping away even as he spoke he doubted that his brother had the backbone for a bloody confrontation for the war without quarter that the english king would wage on the morrow be that as it may the count of blois said coolly having little patience for roberts rancid jealousy in the best of times we must decide now how we shall respond to his challenge it is not as if we have many options either we retreat or we fight not necessarily heads turned toward the speaker as the count of evreux stepped from the shadows into the light of louiss candelabra hal did not know simon de montfort all that well a tall balding saturnine figure with piercing black eyes and a tongue like a whip he was respected for his courage but disliked for his arrogance and his slyness once he was sure that he had their attention he said there is a third choice are you interested in hearing it my liege louis did not like the count and did not trust him either but after a moment he nodded tell us he said and de montfort did when hal exited the tent he was surrounded by his knights for rumors were spreading that the english king was at conches and a battle was looming they began to pelt him with questions wanting to know if it was true hal brushed them aside where is will marshal find him for menow they were alone in hals tent for hed barred the others from entering are the rumors true my lord has your father come to the defense of verneuil yes he is here will thought he was braced for it but he still flinched for this was his greatest fear hal was his liege lord but so was henry to fight against the kings men was not the same as drawing his sword against the king himself the christus domini whod been consecrated with the sacred chrism scriptures spoke quite clearly on that matter for who can stretch forth his hand against the lords anointed and be guiltless so we fight on the morrow he said bleakly nothere will be no battle will blinked we are retreating then no hals throat was tight he swallowed with difficulty the count of evreux reminded louis that the townspeople do not yet know of their reprieve he said we could take advantage of their ignorance insist that they surrender as agreed upon that makes no sense do they expect king henry to watch placidly as this takes place they hal swallowed again aware of a sour taste in his mouth the bishop of sens and the counts of blois and champagne are going to my father tonight asking for a days truce and promising that louis will meet with him on the morrow to negotiate an end to the siege they will then summon the townsmen tell them that their time has expired and they must surrender the town or their hostages will be hanged my fathers army is encamped at conches about ten miles north of here so by the time he learns that he has been deceived it will be too late the town will be ours wills was an easy face to read and hals fair skin reddened do not look at me that way this was not my doing did you protest yes hal ducked his head in embarrassment they laughed at me will louiss brother and simon de montfort told me that i was still learning the lessons of war that i was not seasoned enough to understand they pointed out that guile is always an acceptable tactic that ambushes are not dishonorable that if the enemy can be tricked so much the better they reminded me that the first tenet of warfare is to lay waste the land to burn the crops in the fields and torch the villages to starve the enemy into submission they said this was merely another stratagem and did you believe them no hal confessed i did not what they mean to doit is not honorable is it will he looked so unhappy and vulnerable at that moment that will felt a protective pang hal was his king his companion his comrade in arms but there were times when he seemed like a younger brother too one in need of guidance and counsel the answer he gave hal though was utterly uncompromising brutally honest it is more than dishonorable it is despicable and cowardly and the french king will carry the shame of it to his grave the earl of leicester had a castle at breteuil midway between conches and verneuil but hed fled at the approach of henrys army and henry ordered the castle razed to the ground he chose breteuil as the site for his meeting with the french king meaning to use the smoldering rubble to convey a message in and of itself but the morning dragged on and louis still had not arrived henry was stalking back and forth casting frequent glances up at the sun almost directly overhead by now willem and the earl of pembroke had just made a wager as to how much longer henry would be willing to wait sauntering over to the king he joked seems like louis overslept id be willing to fetch a mangonel from conches if you want to give him a wakeup hell not soon forget do not tempt me willem henry waved aside a wineskin being offered by one of his squires and shaded his eyes for another look at the sun louis is prone to inconvenient attacks of conscience and remorse mayhap he is suffering from one this morn and is ashamed to face me afterjesus god willem spun around his eyes following henrys gaze billowing black clouds of smoke were spiraling up into the sky coming from the south from verneuil geoff had never seen a sight as sorrowful as the town of verneuil much of it had been destroyed in the siege and the one surviving ward was in flames a few men were trying to drag tables and bedding to safety and a few others had formed a bucket brigade in a futile attempt to fight the rapidly spreading fires but most had gathered in small groups watching in stunned silence as their homes and shops were consumed geoff was close enough now to see bodies lying in the street and nearby a woman with a torn bloodied skirt knelt in the dirt weeping as she clung to a small terrified child the stench of death overhung the town a sickening rank smell of blood urine fear and burning flesh and geoff would later mark this august thursday in gods year as the day when hed forever surrendered any youthful illusions about the glory and majesty of war the arrival of armed men in their midst panicked some of the townspeople but others were too dazed to react staring at henry and his knights with hollow empty eyes but as the wind caught the kings red and gold banner one man stumbled forward to clutch at henrys stirrup gazing down into that upturned face streaked with smoke and tears henry recognized him as the mercer whod carried to rouen the towns plea for rescue and he swung from the saddle i tried to stop them my liege from opening the gates i kept telling them that youd sworn you were coming to our aid but they feared for our hostages and they thought they could save themselves by surrender the mans mouth had begun to tremble we did what the french demanded but it availed us naught theyd promised wed not be harmed then their soldiers swarmed into the town like mad dogs stealing whatever they could carry away wed not hidden our women thinking theyd be safe the hellspawn paid no heed to the pleading of respectable wives and mothers dragged them from their houses into the street as if they were whores and when their men tried to protect them they were slain and then they set the fires so many that there was no hope of putting them out why did they do that sire why did the french king not keep his word henry shook his head so angry he could not trust himself to speak willem had joined them not wanting to interrupt the mercers anguished account of his towns betrayal but now he touched henrys arm gesturing toward the castle the drawbridge is coming down as they watched the gates were swung open and men came racing out with the castellan hugh de lacy in the lead thank god you are here my liege gasping for breath de lacy fell to his knees before henry as much an act of exhaustion as one of obeisance but if only youd come a few hours sooner we could do nothing had to watch from the battlements as the townsmen surrendered and that treacherous french judas turned the town over to his soldiers for their sport but we were dumbfounded when we saw what was happening in the french camp they were pulling out leaving behind tents carts livestock even their mangonels and other siege engines wed expected them to launch another attack on the castle and instead they were retreating getting stiffly to his feet de lacy winced for hed incurred several minor wounds in the defense of the castle it makes sense now though they saw your banners my liege and fled like rabbits the craven whoresons theyll never get over the shame of this de lacy broke off for his king had whirled and was running for his horse the other knights were quick to follow watching as they galloped away from the burning ruins of verneuil the castellan shouted after them catch the bastards make them pay they did not return to verneuil until nightfall the castle garrison came out to greet them but asked no questions the torchfire playing upon the weary grim faces told them all they needed to know weve run out of most of our provisions de lacy said to henry but what we have is yours my liege we would be honored to give you shelter tonight that is kind of you sir hugh willem interjected but we will continue on to conches where we left our supply wagons he wanted to get henry away from verneuil knowing the sight of the towns charred remains would only salt his wounds but henry gave him a quelling look and shook his head no he said curtly we stay here tonight willem knew better than to argue taking de lacy aside he told him that theyd overtaken the french armys rearguard and killed those theyd caught but louis and his knights had gotten across the border to safety for now willem added coldly and then told the castellan of the days treachery de lacy was outraged if the town had been taken by storm the french would have been justified in pillaging raping even burning it to the ground but once theyd made a truce they were honorbound to keep it and the deceit theyd practiced upon henry was such a flagrant violation of the conventions of war that it threatened the very foundations of their society sworn agreements of respite and truce were like the peace of god ways that the church and kings sought to avoid guerre a outrance war to the extreme to the death when men heard of the french kings shameless duplicity de lacy snarled they would not be willing to serve such a lord willem hoped that was so but he had a more jaundiced view of his fellow men and their flexible concept of honor this he said tiredly will be remembered as a day of infamy and he went in search of henry he found the king walking with geoff through the wreckage of verneuil and fell in step beside them they passed the blackened shells of houses and shops an occasional body draped in cloth and awaiting burial the flames had been extinguished but the wind still swept embers up into the air and they glowed in the dark like scorched fireflies the night was hot and still now and then there came to them muffled wailing muted sobs the sounds of mourning they walked for what seemed like hours to willem and in that time henry spoke only once saying in a flat tight monotone that went beyond anger i want this towns walls rebuilt find men to see to it willem i will my liege willem said and they continued on in silence from the twelfthcentury annals of roger de hoveden the king of france neither restored to the burghers their hostages nor preserved the peace as he had promised but entering the town made the burghers prisoners carried off their property set fire to the burgh and then taking to flight carried away with him the burghers beforementioned into france when word was brought of this to the king of england he pursued them with the edge of the sword slew many of them and took considerable numbers but in order that these events may be kept in memory it is as well to know that this flight of the king of france took place on the fifth day before the ides of august being the fifth day of the week upon the vigil of saint lawrence to the praise and glory of our lord jesus christ who by punishing the crime of perfidy so speedily avenged the indignity done to his martyr chapter ten august rouen normandy gilbert foliot bishop of london was pleased but not surprised to be given such a warm welcome by the king of all englands clerics he had been the most steadfast in his support of henry and the most critical of thomas becket during their acrimonious clash between church and crown hed been twice excommunicated by becket the second time for taking part in the coronation of henrys son and this ecclesiastical censure had set off henrys fateful rage leading to beckets bloody murder upon the floor of his own cathedral gilbert had been absolved by rome seven months after beckets death but had been restored to his bishopric only that past may for his hostility to the martyred archbishop was a stain upon a previously unblemished reputation once widely admired for his austerity his estimable intellect and masterly knowledge of canon law he would now go to his grave known as the bishop whod defied a saint and for a proud man like gilbert foliot that was not easy to accept it was some consolation though that he stood so high in the kings favor and he gratefully accepted a seat beside henry upon the dais in the great hall sipping a cup of spiced red wine he listened with enormous satisfaction as henry related the flight of the french king from verneuil he was equally pleased to hear that henry had sent a detachment of norman knights and brabancon routiers into brittany to deal with the breton rebels for his desire to see the king triumph was greater than his disapproval of hired mercenaries henry turned the conversation then to the bishoprics still vacant because of hals appeal to rome and gilbert was happy to reassure him that he could rely upon the backing of the church he did not doubt that his holiness the pope would approve the elections pointing out that the papal legates had instructed the electors to choose men who would preserve the peace of the realm and reminding henry that the only prelate to cast his lot in with the rebels was that perpetual malcontent the bishop of durham and the bishop of lisieux may god damn his treacherous soul to hell henry said bitterly for that was still a fresh wound gilbert had never liked arnulf of lisieux considering him to be a selfserver and far too devious and cynical for his own good but he was surprised nevertheless that arnulf should have made such a major miscalculation concluding that the bishop was most likely trying to keep a foot in both camps he was even more surprised by what henry said next asking if it was true that hed founded a hospital in honor of thomas becket for the slain archbishop was usually a topic that henry assiduously avoided no my liege the hospital of holy trinity at southwark was founded by thomas himself after his canonization we changed the name to st thomas the martyr and i offered sinners a remittance of thirty days of penance if they contribute to the hospital since the king had been the one to bring the subject up gilbert now felt free to mention a recent action of henrys i heard my liege that you have named thomass sister mary as abbess of barking that was a signal honor for abbesses of barking were normally daughters of kings but henry shrugged it off saying that he was merely righting a wrong i ought not to have sent beckets family into exile he admitted it was done in anger and was unjust to hold them to account for his transgressions this was the first time that the king had confessed to making mistakes of his own in his war of wills with becket it is a generous gesture nonetheless gilbert said henry shrugged again it had not escaped him that gilbert no longer made use of the slain archbishops surname thomas had always been thinskinned about his familys merchant origins preferring to call himself thomas of london rather than the more pedestrian thomas becket a sensitivity his enemies had been quick to seize upon hed always been thomas to henry until their fallingout after that hed managed to make becket sound like an epithet you never liked him did you gilbert no my lord king i did not in fact when i chose him as archbishop you said that id performed a veritable miracle turning a worldly courtier and soldier into a man of god gilbert blinked hed not known that his angry sarcasm had reached henrys ears i am sorry my lord for what you were right henrys smile was rueful you can hardly be blamed for disliking him he had a tongue like an adder calling you a hapless judas and a rotten limb calling your fellow bishops priests of bael and sons of false prophets he was never one for forgiving his enemies gilbert agreed wondering where henry was going with this you of all men know how vengeful he could be how prideful and stubborn most of those who are so certain of his sanctity never even laid eyes upon him but youre in a unique position to judge gilbert can you truly accept the churchs canonization of him as a saint that was a question gilbert has often asked himself in the months after beckets murder yes my liege he said quietly i can why henry asked but he sounded more curious than skeptical it is true that thomass life was not a holy one but none can deny he died a martyrs death and is that enough to confer sainthood upon him his martyrdomand the miracles that have been reported at his tomb and elsewhere in the months since his murder miracles can be faked as you well know for reasons of politics and profit how can you be sure they are genuine i daresay some of them are not but there have been too many to discount my liege you may be sure i investigated these reports with great care for if truth be told i did not want to believe in them even when thomas cured my fever i continued to doubt henry had heard of gilberts own miracle eight months after beckets murder hed fallen gravely ill lay near death until his friend and fellow bishop jocelin of salisbury prayed to thomas for his recovery so what convinced you then the manner of his death could not be dismissed out of hand nor could the discovery that hed worn a hairshirt and braies under his garments infested with vermin and lice that had burrowed into his groin or the revelation of his confessor that hed mortified his flesh with daily penitential whippings i was told that his back was scarred with the marks of past scourging can there have been more painful proof of sanctity henry could not argue with that i admit i thought he was a hypocrite until i learned that hed worn those filthy liceridden braies next to his private parts after that i did not doubt his sincerity however misguided it was gilbert nodded his agreement and then there are the miracles they began almost as soon as he drew his last breath the wife of a sussex knight was cured of her blindness after praying to thomas eight days after the martyrdom father william de capella a london priest whod been stricken with palsy was cured after drinking water mixed with the saints holy blood i spoke with father william myself could find no other explanation for the recovery of his speech a local womans palsy was healed after her husband applied rags dipped in the martyrs blood to her afflicted legs people are said to have been cured of lameness deafness withered limbs and deadly fevers gilbert leaned forward so caught up in the intensity of his recital that he did not notice as wine splashed from his cup even the brother of one of the men implicated in the murder was cured after drinking the waters of st thomas water mixed with his blood remarkable that he bled enough to keep filling those little tin phials that the monks pass out to those who make offerings henry said dryly that is almost a miracle in itself surely you do not doubt the existence of miracles my lord king of course not but it cheapens them to be accepted too readily is it true that thomas punishes those who fail to keep promises they make to him and when gilbert confirmed it henry said with a crooked smile now that sounds more like the becket i remember gilbert was not deceived by the flippancy it was obvious that henry had been paying closer attention to the martyrs miracles than he was willing to admit before he could respond though there was a stir at the other end of the hall henrys steward was pushing his way toward the dais my liege a messenger has just arrived from brittany have him come forward henry commanded and a disheveled youth muddied and bedraggled soon approached the dais kneeling he looked up at henry with a gleeful grin that conveyed his message better than any words could have done i bring you glad tidings your grace my lord william du hommet bade me ride to rouen as if my horses tail were on fire and by god i did we engaged the breton rebels yesterday morn in open country near the town and castle of dol which theyd taken by bribery it was a total triumph my lord we captured seventeen of their knights and killed most of their menatarms some got away but lord raoul de fougeres and the earl of chester and sixty or so knights retreated back into dol castle lord du hommet said to tell you that they are penned up like lambs for the slaughter but he lacks the siege engines to take the castle and urges you to come straightaway by now the man was surrounded by henrys lords and knights and as soon as he was done speaking he was barraged with congratulations and praise for his amazingly swift ride even allowing for henrys posting of fresh horses at his castles and abbeys for the use of royal couriers his was a remarkable achievement dol was more than one hundred fifty miles from rouen henry was delighted ordering wine for the messenger and promising a generous reward he broke the seal on william du hommets letter and began to read rapidly geoff had entered the hall after the couriers arrival and he was shoving his way through the crowd eager to learn what had happened catching sight of the earl of essex and the elderly earl of arundel he veered in their direction and when they told him that the earl of chester and the breton rebels were trapped in dol he gave a jubilant shout that was more often heard on the hunting field this accursed rebellion is in its death throes he predicted joyfully first the count of boulogne is struck down then the french flee from verneuil like thieves in the night and now hugh of chester is caught in a snare of his own making the men smiled at the enthusiasm of youth well not yet willem said but id wager hell be shut up in a royal castle by weeks end you mean by next week do you not we will not even reach dol till then and if the siege lasts geoff paused in surprise for the two men were laughing at him clearly you have never ridden with your lord father when he is in a hurry to get somewhere willem said with a grin and when geoff conceded he had not they laughed again ah you are in for a treat arundel was grinning too fortunately for these old bones ill be left behind for the king knows that i could never keep up with him as youll soon see lad it is the closest that men can get to flying i remember when he broke off then for henry was shouting for silence why are we wasting time he demanded and willem jabbed geoff playfully in the ribs before asking innocently when the king wanted to depart henry looked at him as if hed lost his wits when do you think man now the young earl of chester was baffled and heartsore that his luck could have soured so fast at first all had gone according to plan joining raoul de fougeres theyd launched a highly successful chevauchee burning and pillaging the lands of those bretons whod remained loyal to henry hugh had enjoyed himself enormously finding that his first taste of war was even more fun than a tournament but it had not lasted warned that the kings routiers were on the prowl theyd decided upon a direct challenge and both sides met on the battlefield on august the experience taught hugh why prudent commanders avoided pitched battles when at all possible for it turned into a debacle their lines broke and because men were never so vulnerable as when in flight the slaughter that followed was terrible retreating in confusion hugh and the breton lords found their only escape route blocked by the routiers and they had no choice but to withdraw back into dol the three days that followed were utterly wretched theyd watched helplessly from the battlements as the townsmen surrendered their city to henrys commander lord du hommet and to add insult to injury they then had to watch as other bretons joined in the siege for theyd alienated much of the countryside with their raiding and plundering hugh became so disheartened that raoul de fougeres had turned upon him in anger berating him for his lack of fortitude the siege would soon be lifted hed insisted those lowborn routiers were little better than bandits they knew nothing of true warfare lacked even the most rudimentary siege engines it would not be long until theyd lose interest and move on seeking easier prey hugh very much wanted to believe him but he was not encouraged when raoul then put the knights and garrison on halfrations if the siege was not going to drag on why did they need to worry about running out of supplies wishing that hal were there to bolster his sagging spirits hugh tried to ignore his growing chorus of regrets by getting thoroughly drunk he awoke the next morning feeling feverish queasy and utterly out of sorts as he stirred and groaned the bedcovers beside him rippled and a girls head popped out hugh looked at her blankly having no idea who she was he swallowed with a grimace becoming aware that his mouth tasted like vinegar the girl was gazing at him curiously do you want me to answer that my lord she asked and only then did he realize that the thudding noise in his head was actually a pounding on the door when he nodded she slid from the bed hastily pulling a chemise over her head he recognized her now as one of the castle kitchen maids although he did not remember her name concluding that he was still half drunk he lay back against the pillow hugh wake up grudgingly opening his eyes to slits he saw raoul de fougeress son juhel standing by the bed go away he mumbled and felt a dulled throb of indignation when juhel would not damn you to hell leave me be and then he gasped and shot bolt upright in bed for juhel had poured a basin of washing water over his head sputtering and cursing he lurched from the bed seeking to bury his fist in juhels belly he never even came close the other man sidestepped easily stop it you fool are you going to face judgment day as a drunken sot what are you babbling about i am trying to tell you that the english king is in the city making ready to assault the castle hugh decided that juhel must be mad i think youre the one whos drunk we fought on monday and this is only thursday there is no way in the world that he could get here that fast no suppose you tell him that juhel grabbed hughs arm and before he could protest propelled him across the chamber toward the window fumbling with the shutters he flung them open and pointed see for yourself hugh squinted against the sudden blaze of painful light his eyes focusing blearily upon the banner flying from the enemy encampment a gold lion emblazoned across a background of crimson holy mother of god raoul de fougeres awaited hugh in the great hall taking in the younger mans pallor he said coldly i hope you can sober up by noon youll make a better impression if your eyes are not so bloodshot and your hands are not shaking as if you have the ague hugh was secretly intimidated by the breton lord whod never shown him the deference he was accustomed to receive from his english vassals making an attempt at dignity he said i assure you my lord that i am quite sober what happens at noon we are surrendering the castle to your cousin the king hughs mouth dropped open we cannot do that if i fall into his hands i am doomed for hell never forgive me oliver de roche raouls seneschal gave a harsh laugh and raised his cup in a mock salute clearly hugh was not the only one whod been sampling the wine kegs if he puts rebels to death thered not be a lord alive in all of brittany he said in a slurred voice for us rebellion is a sport what man in this hall has not risen up against the english king more than once hugh glared at de roche who was not as formidable a figure as lord raoul it is different for me he snapped he forgives vassals because he thinks it is wise to do so keeping men from fearing they have nothing to lose and fighting to the death but i am his cousin his bloodkin hell not forgive me he will forgive you raoul asserted as long as we surrender but if he takes the castle by force he can do with us as he pleases king stephen once hanged the entire garrison of shrewsbury castle harry has never done anything like that has he ever faced a rebellion by his own sons how do you know what hell do if we give him the excuse to seek vengeance you do not know my lord earl and that is my point it is not a risk we are willing to take hugh shook his head stubbornly for at that moment he feared nothing so much as the thought of facing his cousin at noon you talk as if the castles fall is inevitable i say we hold out that we fight instead of shamefully surrendering there was a low angry murmuring and as he looked around hugh saw that the others agreed with raoul even his own knights seemed ready to surrender raoul was regarding him with unfriendly eyes and suddenly hugh was acutely aware of the great gap between them the bretons were like the welsh they did not truly trust those not of their own blood raoul was not known for his patience but he tried now to remind himself that this english earls rank deserved respect even if the man did not god save him from these callow youths who knew as much about war as a nun did about whoring as oliver said we bretons are well seasoned in rebellion we know when to fight and we know when to cut our losses which is why we have survived so long henry fitz empress is the most dangerous foe ive ever faced he never adheres to the conventions of warfare instead of laying waste to his enemies lands he strikes fast and hard at their castles need i remind you of the strongholds hes taken over the years chinon from his rebel brother chaumontsurepte from the french king and chaumontsurloire from the count of blois thourars was said to be impregnable he took it in three days castillonsuragen fell in less than a week the tally is even more impressive here in brittany he razed my great castle at fougeres to the ground captured josselin and auray from eudo de porhoet seized becherel castle from roland de dinan and just two years ago he descended upon the viscount of leon like a thunderbolt reduced all of his castles to rubble all of them so when you tell me we ought to hold out at dol i do not find that a convincing argument hugh was suddenly overcome with fatigue feeling as if his legs would no longer support him he sank down onto the closest bench there has to be another way beside surrender raoul de fougeres regarded him unblinkingly you have until noon to think of one the townspeople had gathered to watch the surrender and there was almost a festive atmosphere for they were thankful theyd been spared the horrors of a siege thankful the war was over for brittany most of them cared little for who ruled over them as long as they were left to live in peace and they were milling about in front of the castle laughing and gossiping buying fruitfilled wafers from street vendors ducking into nearby taverns to quench their thirst and staring with unabashed curiosity at the english king and his lords henry stood with the earls of essex and pembroke richard du hommet the constable of normandy and his cousin william the hero of dol they were watching with grim satisfaction as the castle drawbridge was lowered and forlorn figures trudged out bearing a white flag of truce the earl of chester was in the lead followed by raoul de fougeres his son juhel and his brother guillaume the bretons were stoical but henry was gratified to see that his cousin was as white as a corpse candle approaching henry hugh sank to his knees in the dusty street and the others did the same we surrender ourselves and the castle of dol into your hands my lord king he said hoarsely we know we have grievously offended you violated our oaths of fealty and homage and we are truly repentant and remorseful we humbly beg your pardon andand pray that you will show mercy even if we do not deserve it henry looked at them without speaking and when hugh could stand the suspense no longer he blurted out a plaintive cousin that he at once regretted for henry turned upon him the full force of those glittering grey eyes you would do better at this moment he said not to remind me of our kinship and when he added cousin he invested that simple word with so much raw emotionreproach and ragethat despite the hot august sun hugh began to shiver leaving the french kings palace on the isle known as the ile de la cite will marshal threaded his way through the maze of crooked streets until he reached the grand pont it was the finest bridge hed ever seen nigh on twenty feet wide and made of stone at a time when even londons bridge was wooden booths and stalls lined both sides of the bridge most of them occupied by moneychangers since wills pouch was already filled with deniers parisis he shouldered his way past the foreigners and travelers crowding around the booths to change their money and was soon sauntering along the right bank of the seine heading for the greve site of the weekly paris market there he had no trouble finding what he sought a small glass mirror with a lead backing it was a great improvement over the more common mirrors of metal and he was sure barbe would be pleased with the gift stopping to buy a loaf of bread and a pork pie from a vendor he ducked into the nearest tavern to eat it washing it down with a henap of raisin wine for he still had the robust appetite that had earned him the nickname of scofffood during his days as a squire once his hunger was satisfied he fed the leftover bread to a skinny stray dog and started back toward the grand pont goodnaturedly rejecting the overtures of several street whores attracted by his confident demeanor his height and the sword on his hip a good indication that he could afford their services returning to the ile de la cite he did not head for the palace instead turned onto the rue de la draperie the street of the parisian drapers barbes shop was doing brisk business with customers admiring a new shipment of silks from sicily but when will entered she turned the trade over to her assistant and he accompanied her abovestairs to her private chamber where she expressed delight over her new mirror and wasted no time in showing her gratitude in bed will had never been keen on relieving his male needs with whores and knew better than to seduce virgin maidens he preferred lusty young widows like barbe and because he was personable generous and blessed with a fine physique hed rarely had trouble finding worldly accommodating bedmates barbe was one of the best hed had and he knew hed miss her once his stay in paris was done their bedsport had left them both drenched in sweat and she soon rose padded barefoot to the window and opened the shutters wrinkling her nose at the rank smell of the river coming back to the bed she noticed for the first time the ripe bruise spreading across his ribs and was at once solicitous insisting upon rummaging around in a coffer until she found a goosegrease salve what did you do dearestget caught up in a tavern brawl will grinned shifting so she could better apply the salve worsei agreed to some swordplay with my lords brother richard he wanted to practice parrying an enemys blow but his enthusiasm left my old bones battered and bruised barbe put the salve down in the floor rushes and climbed back into bed beside him she loved it when he talked about court life for that was a world beyond her ken exotic and alien i thought you told me that your lords knights did not mingle with duke richards men as a rule they do not sharing their lords rivalry but my position is somewhat different for i once served in the queens household and spent many hours teaching richard how to wield a sword and aim a lance we remained on friendly terms even after the old king asked me to instruct lord hal they are both finelooking lads barbe said but even i can see how unlike they are lord hal always stops to wave and acknowledge the cheers when he rides through the streets and lord richard does not even seem to hear them i was talking with some of the neighborhood women last week and we agreed wed rather have lord hal as a lover for he never passes a beggar without flipping him a coin a man so openhanded would likely keep his leman draped in silks and pearls but which do you think would make the better king will will had indeed pondered that question he loved hal respected richard a pity hal did not have richards iron will or richard hals generosity of spirit his stay in paris had given him a chance to study the third brother too and hed decided that geoffrey might be the cleverest of the three hed always admired the old kings ability to remain dispassionate in the face of adversity only with st thomas had his sangfroid failed him with disastrous consequences he doubted that either hal or richard had inherited any of their sires uncanny selfpossession their emotions ran close to the surface quick to spill over if one of the kings sons had his coolly calculating brain it was likely to be geoffrey of course he was just shy of fifteen so only time would tell will knew barbe would have been fascinated by his musings about king henrys sons but discretion was both a habit and a natural inclination a man would not prosper at the royal court if hed not learned to govern his tongue so not even with his bedmate would he drop his guard and he began to speak instead of a subject that he knew shed find of interest a recent feast given for the king by the bishop of paris in honor of their victory at verneuil even as he delighted barbe by describing the rich menu and fine gowns of the french queen adele and the english queen marguerite will marveled that louis could celebrate such a shameful episode theyd done their best to put a favorable cast upon it bragging how theyd outwitted the english king and left verneuil in ruins but word had trickled out and will was soon hearing the rumors discussed in paris taverns the citizens of paris showed a surprising sympathy for their counterparts at verneuil but will realized that they were putting themselves in the places of the norman burghers imagining their own shops looted and their houses burned will had not often considered the suffering of citizens in war having been taught that civilian casualties were both unfortunate and unavoidable that was the way wars were waged with chevauchees that served a twofold purpose by devastating an enemys countryside denying his army muchneeded provisions and demonstrating to his people that he was failing a lords first duty unable to protect his subjects from harm what had appalled will about verneuil was the deliberate violation of louiss sworn oath both to henry and the townspeople and his refusal to honor his own truce will firmly believed that the world would descend into chaos and hellish turmoil if men did not obey those laws meant to govern their behavior and tame their more shameful impulses laws set forth by the holy church by the crown and now by the chivalric canons chivalry was the foundation stone of his life offering more than a code of conduct offering a map which would enable men of good faith to avoid those sinful temptations that might jeopardize their chances of salvation will was thankful that hal shared this conviction for it would have been very hard to follow a lord who did not he just wished hal had been strong enough to defy the french king and his evil advisors strong enough to have prevailed but hal was young he had time to develop that steel in his soul will assured himself so far he had resolutely refused to listen to the seditious inner voice whispering that age was no excuse that had king henry been faced with a verneuil at eighteen he would never have allowed it to happen with duskfall the days heat slowly began to ebb they could hear the sounds downstairs as barbes assistant ushered out the last customers and closed up the shop the noise from the street continued to waft through the open window though for people would not retire to their homes until curfew rang will and barbe made love again and then she fetched some cold chicken cheese and fruit for a bedside supper they were just finishing their apples when a muffled thumping sounded below will cocked his head is someone knocking at the door barbe paused to listen too whoever it is will go away but the pounding continued and then a voice shouted loudly will marshal if youre up there come to the window ignore him barbe urged but will recognized the voice swinging his legs over the bed he crossed to the window and peered down into the street where simon de morisco was standing hands on hips getting ready to shout again at the sight of will he heaved a sigh of relief thank god i was sent to find you straightaway and did not know where else to look hurry and dress will you have been summoned back to the palace entering the palaces great hall will was surprised to see hal and richard seated together for they did not often seek out each others company clearly the news from brittany must be grave indeed all simon could tell him was that a messenger had arrived with word of a calamity but no more than that hal and richard were sitting with raoul de faye marguerite the count of leicester robert beaumont and his wife peronelle as will approached richard and hal slid over on the bench to make room for him beside them he took his seat ignoring the disgruntled looks he was getting from several of hals knights he well knew that some were jealous of his privileged status and since he could do nothing about it he did his best not to let it bother him simon said there was a setback in brittany hal nodded and richard gave a short laugh that sounded uncannily like henrys to call it a setback is like calling the expulsion from eden a minor misunderstanding it was a disaster will last thursday hugh and raoul de fougeres and all their knights surrendered dol castle to my father the rebellion in brittany is over sweet jesu will breathed for this was far worse than hed expected i did not even know king henry was in brittany thought hed returned to rouen afterafter verneuil he did hal said glumly but as soon as he learned hugh and the bretons were trapped in dol he hastened west and once he arrived on the scene they panicked and ran up a white flag a disgrace the earl of leicester muttered shaking his head in disgust and hal richard and will exchanged glances all of them sharing the same thought that leicester had abandoned his castle at breteuil and ran for his life as soon as hed gotten word of henrys approach none of them voiced that thought though it would never occur to will to do so and the brothers were learning some hard lessons in diplomacy leicester was a valued ally even if they both thought he was a horses arse will diplomatically ended the silence that had followed leicesters accusation asking what happened to them after they surrendered it was raoul de faye who answered him actually they were treated rather leniently under the circumstances harry let most of them go once theyd sworn homage to him again and promised not to take part in further rebellions he even freed raoul de fougeres after hed offered up his sons as hostages for his good behavior and did not declare any of their estates forfeit to the crownat least not yet raoul did not sound particularly happy about the bretons good fortune and will understood why word of henrys forbearance would quickly spread reassuring other rebels that they could submit to the crown without fearing theyd lose their lands or their lives it was a shrewd tactic for a man fighting a civil war what of the earl of chester he was not as lucky hal frowned for he was fond of hugh my father sent him under guard to falaise castle where hell be held prisoner his words trailed off but will knew the phrase he was reluctant to say at the kings pleasure hugh of chester could be freed if henry won the rebellion he could also be held for the rest of his earthly days and for one as highstrung as hugh the uncertainty would gnaw at his nerves his every waking hour glancing at henrys sons will wondered if they feared their father might treat them as harshly as he had hugh he certainly did feared for queen eleanor too since hughs imprisonment showed that henry could not forgive family betrayal as easily as he could the disloyalty of vassals and liegemen poor hugh hal said softly and poor bertrada and cousin maud i cannot give them such sad news you do it for me uncle raoul but when you write offer them hope for his early release women are not meant to bear such heavy burdens will did not understand how queen eleanors son could make such a nonsensical statement and judging from the expressions on the faces of raoul de faye and richard neither did they but as will glanced over at marguerite whose hand was tightly clasped in hals he decided that hal was being protective of his young wife marguerite was just fifteen after all louis was badly shaken by the news hal said looking somberly at will and who can blame him in just a month our great alliance has fallen apart the scots king has fled back across the border the count of flanders has gone home too our invasion of normandy came to naught and now the breton rebellion has been quelled and so easily little wonder louis told me that he has begun to fear the almighty is no longer on our side that was such a tactless admission that will winced it was bad enough that the french king was having such dangerous doubts without hal letting others know of his misgivings another strained silence fell this one broken by richard the almighty he said is usually on the side of the best battle commander hal scowled at his brother for that sounded almost sacrilegious to him but before he could respond the countess of leicester spoke up shed been listening with obvious impatience and now took advantage of the break in the conversation to voice her opinion the french king ought not to mourn the loss of the bretons they always make unreliable allies skulk back to their own lands as soon as things start to go wrong and so do the scots england is the key to victory if wed invaded it as my husband advised we could have taken london by now will was offended by her meddling in these military matters it was one thing for a woman to express her opinions to her husband in the privacy of their bedchamber quite another for her to speak out so boldly in public he had no trouble reconciling his traditional views of the female sex with his admiration for the highly untraditional queen eleanor for in wills eyes she was unique not to be judged by the same standards that applied to lesser women glancing around the table he saw that peronelles views had not gone down well with the others either richard raoul hal and marguerite were all regarding her with disapproval her husband was smiling at her though confirming wills suspicions that peronelle was the master in that marriage he knew she was a great heiress but he did not like her any the better for it if arrogance was a male failing it was even more unseemly and unappealing in a woman we must hope that the count of flanders reconsiders his rash decision to abandon our alliance hal was saying when the door was flung open and the french king entered the hall they all jumped to their feet at his approach but he waved them back into their seats he looked surprisingly calm and peaceful for a man whod gotten dire news such a short time ago i know what must be done he told them with a certainty he rarely showed i have prayed for answers and the almighty has shown me the way henry had called a council meeting on such short notice that hed begun to think it would be dawn until they all straggled in but they were finally seated around a trestle table looking at him expectantly some smothering yawns for not all men kept henrys late hours and several had been roused from their beds by his summons henry waited until theyd been served a good quality gascon wine and then broke his news i have received a remarkable communication from the french king it seems that he now sees himself as a peacemaker and has generously offered to reconcile me with my sons as hed expected their response was explosive and incredulous he let them vent but when willem called louis the greatest hypocrite in christendom henry demurred no i think not louis has a rare gift he is able to entertain any number of contrary thoughts at one time moreover he has the dubious talent of believing whatever he wants to be true at any given moment and should i be churlish enough to remind him that he was the cause of this estrangement he is now eager to heal hed be deeply wounded by my ingratitude they did not dispute his sardonic assessment of the french king for most of them had experiences with louis stretching back more than two decades what will your answer be my liege the archbishop of rouen asked although he was confident he already knew what henry would answer i shall accept his invitation agree to attend his peace conference some of the men seemed surprised but most of them werent regarding the king pensively over the rim of his wine cup willem said what are your terms for peace i mean henry said to put an end to this needless war as soon as possible i would not offer louis so much as a stale crust of bread but with my sons i am prepared to be more generous how generous my liege the earl of arundel asked cautiously and when henry told them they stared at him in astonishment shocked that he could be so magnanimous after such a grievous betrayal by those of his own blood are you sure my lord willem thought he knew henry as well as any man did but hed not been expecting this sure that you can forgive them henry was amazed that the question could be asked of course i can forgive them willem they are my sons after that it was quiet in the council chamber for none doubted hed spoken from the heart and none dared to ask if he could also forgive his queen chapter eleven september gisors normandy henry agreed to meet his sons and the french king on september between gisors and trie in the norman vexin at a huge spreading elm tree that had often been the site of peace conferences accompanied by the earls of essex and pembroke the constable of normandy the archbishop of rouen his son geoff and his household knights henry arrived at noon the french were already there henry reined in his stallion but made no move to dismount it had been six months since hed last seen his sons in the past hed been separated from them for longer than that most recently during his sojourn in ireland but he was acutely aware now of the changes that those months apart had wrought richard seemed to have added a year or two to his age for his shoulders had broadened and his stubble had become a fullfledged golden beard a shadow on geoffreys upper lip and peach fuzz on his cheeks had not been there at christmas the sight of hal was the most painful the sunlight gilding his curly fair hair he looked regal and resplendent in a scarlet mantle and matching cowhide boots with gold turneddown tops a natural magnet for all eyesjust as on that night at chinon when hed saluted henry with a dazzling smile and a silver cup of drugged wine hal was standing beside the french king with richard and geoffrey close by proclaiming to the world that they were united allies and hetheir fatherwas the enemy henry fought back a wave of baffled hurt and anger waiting until he was sure his voice would not betray him ignoring louis he locked his eyes upon hal i am not here to negotiate with you and your brothers hal nor to bargain with you i have come to tell you what i am willing to offer to mend this rift between us and restore peace in our family you may choose between england and normandy if you choose england you will have half the crown revenues and four royal castles if you prefer normandy you will be entitled to half the ducal revenues plus all the revenues of anjou and three castles in normandy one each in anjou maine and touraine hals mouth had dropped open his eyes were as round as moons without waiting for his response henry shifted in the saddle so that he faced richard i am offering you richard half the ducal income from aquitaine and four castles richards reaction was more guarded than hals but his surprise was still evident and henry suppressed a smile thinking that they suddenly looked less like defiant rebels and more like lads getting an unexpected birthday treat turning his gaze upon his third son he said for you geoffrey i am willing to be no less generous as soon as the pope sanctions your marriage to constance you will come into the full inheritance of brittany a stunned silence fell broken at last by hal may we have time to think it over henry was disappointed that it could not be resolved then and there he truly did not see why theyd need to discuss his offer but he did not want to appear to be pressuring them you may give me your answers on the morrow and know this that i am willing to put the past behind us as if this foolhardy rebellion had never been whatever our differences you are my sons of my blood and nothing is more important than that henry signaled then to his men swung his stallion in a circle and rode away without looking back henry was staying at gisors castle and louis had chosen to lodge at chaumontenvexin a formidable royal fortress just six miles away not long after their return raoul de faye was standing on the steps of the great hall his eyes roaming the bailey when he finally saw his brother the viscount of chatellerault emerging from the stables he shouted hugh so urgently that the other man looked around in alarm by then raoul was halfway across the bailey he pulled hugh aside his fingers biting into his brothers arm but hugh did not protest for hed never seen raoul so angry so agitated have you spoken yet to richard or his brothers hugh shook his head nohave you i had just a few words with hal i did speak with louis though and that gutless weasel wants to accept harrys peace terms and skulk back to paris when i reminded him that harry had not said a word about eleanors fate do you know what he told me he said very piously that it was not for him to meddle in the sacrament of matrimony that what happened in a marriage was between a husband and his wife and the almighty he has no stomach for continuing the war and is willing to let eleanor pay the price for his blundering god curse his craven sanctimonious soul lower your voice hugh warned youre attracting attention what of hal what did he say enough to make me suspect he wants to take harrys bait did you see how his eyes lit up when harry offered him half the crown revenues id wager hes already planning how to spend the money he and louis are together in the solar now and if he has any doubts you may be sure louis will argue them away he does not have a brain in that handsome head of his does he hugh said bitterly does he not realize thatwait theres geoffrey geoffrey looked startled to see both his greatuncles bearing down upon him with such haste he hadnt realized men their age could move so fast when raoul demanded to know if he was willing to accept his fathers offer he did not answer at once he was learning to be wary even with family hed talked it over with hal and he was leaning toward acceptance for he knew that he could not hope for more than henry had offered not at fifteen he also knew that these men would not be happy to hear that and so he temporized saying only i admit it is tempting but i have not made up my mind his evasion did not work though for they began to berate him for his indecision but then raoul spotted richard coming around the corner of the mews they immediately called out his name hurrying to intercept him geoffrey was forgotten but he was accustomed to being utterly overshadowed by his elder brothers and he chose to overlook the slight and follow them sure that this would be a conversation he ought to hear richard had halted although he made no attempt to meet them halfway as soon as theyd reached him raoul put to him the question hed just demanded of geoffrey richard answered readily no i am not willing he offered money and much more than i expected but only money nor did he make any mention of my mother and the part she played in the rebellion raoul heaved a great gusty sigh thank god jesus that someone else noticed that his offer is a bribe a lavish tempting bribe but a bribe all the same it is a bribe though that your brother seems willing to take he and louis are meeting even as we speak laying their plans for the morrow where when raoul said the solar richard spun around and headed across the bailey so swiftly that the others were hard pressed to keep up with him the great hall was crowded and several intense discussions were going on the most heated one led by the count of dreux louiss volatile younger brother robert was gesturing emphatically his face a mottled shade of red and those gathered around him seemed to be in agreement for they were nodding and murmuring among themselves the earl of leicester was pacing back and forth by the open hearth as soon as he saw richard he swerved toward him richard we need to talk your father said nothing about your allies if you make peace with him what happens to me or hugh of chester richard brushed by him as if hed not spoken and plunged into the stairwell taking the stairs two at a time he did not pause before the solar door shoved it open with raoul and hugh on his heels and geoffrey a few steps behind louis and hal were seated at a trestle table with henri of blois the count of champagne his brother etienne the count of sancerre and louiss youngest brother the archbishop of rheims there were other men there too but richard did not know their names clerks and priests who labored anonymously for the french king since his chancellor had resigned the year before they turned startled faces toward the door as richard burst into the chamber i am sorry i am late the messenger you sent to fetch me must have gotten waylaid or lost surely you did send someone to find me for this is as much my decision as it is hals it did not take much effort for louis to imagine those barbed words coming from henrys mouth he was genuinely fond of hal but hed never warmed to richard and he realized now how easily that indifference could turn into active dislike forcing a smile he said come in richard i assure you that we were not trying to keep anything from you richard ignored him as completely as henry had done just hours earlier hal is it true you mean to accept the offer hal was irked by his peremptory tone he chose to let it go though for too much was at stake for their usual brotherly squabbles if hed made this offer to me at christmas id never have rebelled so yes i am accepting it why would i not i can understand that youd not want to be burdened with any real authority having to govern would interfere with your tournament time but did you spare even a thought for our mothers safety angry color scorched hals skin of course i did that was the first thing my fatherbymarriage and i discussed he pointed out that she has not taken an active part in the rebellion all that our father knows for certes is that she let you and geoffrey go to paris with me and that is easily explained if i assure him that she did not know of my plans that none of it was her doing i am sure christ on the cross i cannot believe we came from the same womb for you do not have the sense god gave a goat hal shoved his chair back coming quickly to his feet how dare you enough raoul shouted loudly enough to drown out hals outraged response if you do not want to hear it from richard hear it from me then hal you know i have a spy at your fathers court he has reported that harry does not believe you or your brothers would have rebelled if youd not been beguiled into it and he has no doubt who bears the responsibilitythe french king and your mother he does not just think she aided and abetted you he is convinced that she was the instigator for as long as he can blame eleanor he need not blame himself you exaggerate louis said sharply i have spies too at his court hal and they tell me something quite different hal looked from louis to raoul to richard then back to his fatherinlaw if my mother is to bear the blame for this he got no further for the door banged open again this time the intruder was louiss brother robert his suspicions flared as soon as he saw henrys sons and he glowered at louis what is going on up here why are we not discussing this in council louis louis glared back at him it is not for you to question me my lord count he said coldly making use of his brothers title as a pointed reminder of their respective status as sovereign and subject it was my intent to summon them once id spoken with my soninlaw robert was not impressed by louiss assumption of kingly authority i am gladdened to hear that he said and smirked i shall go back to the hall and tell the others that we are about to hold a council meeting and he exited the solar before louis could stop him louis was furious but robert had maneuvered him into a corner and he saw no other option than to hold a council rising he gathered his dignity about him as if he were donning robes of state and strode from the solar the others were quick to follow raoul lingered behind though and stepped in front of the count of champagne as he started toward the door henri of blois and his brother thibault were the most influential of louiss lords his sonsinlaw by their marriages to his daughters by eleanor marie and alix and brothersinlaw by his marriage to their sister adele raoul had not often crossed paths with them until the rebellion and hed been surprised to find that henri was quite likable his beautiful elegant countess had joined him in paris eager to meet her young half brothers and theyd developed an immediate rapport raoul was very taken with marie too for she reminded him of a youthful eleanor and as she was quite curious about the mother shed not seen since she was seven raoul had passed some pleasant evenings in marie and henris company it was henri to whom he turned now for the count knew louis far better than he did and he was desperate to glean insights about the french king to learn anything that might help him to avert this impending catastrophe you cannot approve of this socalled peace henri for what does france stand to gain by it he did not ask the count how he would benefit his brother thibault would get amboise castle should they win but rather remarkably henri had demanded nothing of hal in return for his support not much henri admitted if it were up to me id not be so quick to agree to terms with the english king but it is louis who wears the crown and as much as that galls his brother robert it is louis who decides if it is to be peace or war and as you saw he has chosen peace why i do not understand the workings of that mans mind why go to such great lengths to stir up a rebellion against harry and then call it off as if it were a game of campball halted by rain i know he wants to see harry humbled weakened so why will he not do all he can to make that happen ah raoul you do not understand louis at all do you you share the english kings view of him as somewhat simple easily swayed by others with sand where his backbone ought to be but he is more complicated than that he is very devout his great tragedy is that he was plucked out of that monastery when his elder brother died for hed have been far happier as the monk he was meant to be as a good christian he loathes war as a king he is forced to wage it but in his heart he believes that shedding blood is a mortal sin so when his campaigns go awry as they usually do he concludes that the almighty is punishing him for violating the commandment that states thou shalt not kill but he started this war not harry why goad harrys sons into rebellion if he were not willing to see it through to the end henri smiled faintly i said he was complicated not consistent louis hates the english king almost as much as he loves god for more than twenty years harry has bested him at every turn he could not keep harry from wedding his queen or from winning the english crown or from expanding his realm until it now rivals charlemagnes had he not been so starved for success hed not have let himself be talked into that farce at verneuil but you may be sure that any satisfaction he gained from it was all too fleeting a poisoned brew by morning for even if he does not always heed it louis is cursed with a conscience a most inconvenient virtue for a king the count paused as if deciding how candid he ought to be a man so beset with selfdoubts does not deceive himself about his capabilities he may not admit it but he knows he is an inept battle commander harry a brilliant one he thought thomas becket had given him the weapon he needed a way to defeat harry beyond the battlefield and when the archbishop was so foully murdered midst his grief there was satisfaction too that harry would finally reap what he had sown you can imagine his frustration when harry managed to avoid excommunication and then to make his peace with the church you have to feel some sympathy for him raoul he is like that figure in greek mythwhat was he called the poor king condemned forever to roll a stone uphill only to have it roll back down again well that is louis constantly struggling to thwart harry at something anything and constantly losing i might have more sympathy for the man raoul said tautly if he were not so willing to make my niece the scapegoat for his sins does that truly surprise you he has never forgiven eleanor for daring to wed harry rather than waiting dutifully for him to select a husband for her and he has never forgiven her for then giving harry five sons when she gave him only daughters but if you cannot muster up sympathy for louis neither can i find sympathy to spare for your niece she meant to use louis for her own ends so she can hardly complain once she discovers that he was using her too raoul felt resentment flicker but he did not allow it to catch fire hed long known that eleanors french allies were of two minds about her part in the rebellion they welcomed the aid offered by the duchess of aquitaine but they were not comfortable with the rebel queen the faithless wife raoul held his tongue though for hed not yet gotten what he needed from henri what if we could make louis believe that this was one war he could win that if he held firm he could have a great victory over harry if you can give him that certainty the king will prevail over the monk to borrow that memorable phrase coined by your niece but it will be no easy task i know that at times it seems as if he can be led by the nose like a bridled gelding but he can also be very stubborn his the stiffnecked obstinacy of the weak and between them robert and your young richard have him determined to make peace on the morrow if only to punish them for their defiance so it will not be enough to convince him that he can finally gain that victory over harry you will have to offer him a way to save face too to reverse himself without sacrificing his pride henri smiled then signaling that the lesson was over wed best go down to the hall whilst there is still time to change louiss mind i will be interested to see if you can put my advice into action upon his return to the great hall raoul joined his brother who whispered that robert had just stormed out after a particularly acrimonious exchange with louis the french lords were gathered around the dais save for the count of evreux who had withdrawn to a windowseat watching the proceedings with the detached amusement of one being entertained by minstrels or jongleurs louis was seated upon the dais and a chair had been provided for hal but hed not remained in it for long and was fidgeting like a horse about to bolt although he kept his gaze fastened upon the french king and his brother all the while richard was standing on the dais steps looking at louis with a hawks unblinking intensity you still have not answered me my liege how would my lady mother fare under this peace of yours raoul silently blessed richard for putting the question so bluntly for going right to the heart of the matter but as he glanced around the hall he could find little sympathy for eleanors plight and with a chill he realized that the only one standing between eleanor and disaster was her sixteenyearold son louis was finding it harder and harder to maintain a civil tone with this prideful young lordling who seemed to have inherited the worst qualities of both his parents i understand your concern for your mother lad but you must trust me that for richard the french kings patronizing smile was the spark that set his smoldering temper ablaze i am the duke of aquitaine not your lad and i do not give my trust freely it must be earned louis saw no further reason to humor this impudent brat you need to be reminded richard that you came to me as a supplicant and you and your brothers promised to be guided by my advice and that of my council richards upper lip curled but not all promises are kept my liegeare they this notsosubtle reference to verneuil hit its target and louiss face twitched as if hed been struck you are a foolish boy and youve said more than enough not nearly enough hear me on thisall of you richard swung around his eyes raking the hall i will have no part of this socalled peace louis had half risen from his chair then you will stand alone no hal said suddenly he will not coming down the steps of the dais he stood beside richard and looked at his fatherinlaw head high my brother and i do not often see eyetoeye but he has convinced me that he is right and it would be folly to accept our fathers offer richard and louis were staring at hal the former with gratified surprise the latter with angry disappointment when hal shot a meaningful glance toward geoffrey he hesitated briefly and then sauntered over to join them i will not be accepting the offer either and how do you expect to fight your father without french help louis demanded scornfully youll find that your words ring as hollow as your titles theyll have my help heads turned toward the count of dreux standing in the open doorway of the hall once he was sure that all eyes were upon him robert swaggered forward to stand beside henrys sons and they ought to have yours for they have sworn allegiance to you for normandy and aquitaine so you owe them a liegelords protection what would you know about a kings duties and obligations youve never worn a crown and that is your true grievance with me robertjealousy pure and simple paying no attention to roberts enraged reply raoul shoved his way over to the windowseat where simon de montfort was lounging i need your help i know how to get louis to change his mind but hell not heed eleanors uncle you have to be the one to tell him id like nothing better than to continue the war but louis will not heed me either he listened to you at verneuil yesand soon regretted it have you not noticed how coldly he has treated me since then it is a wonder i have not gotten frostbite by now no you need someone else someone he truly trustsand that has never been me raoul turned away searching the hall frantically for the right face one whom the french king truly trusts for a moment his eyes rested upon the count of champagne henri had nothing to gain though nor to lose whether it be peace or war but his brotherhis brother had long lusted after amboise castle and a premature peace would take that glittering prize from his grasp within moments raoul had drawn thibault of blois aside speaking quietly and urgently in the counts ear and then he held his breath as thibault strode toward the dais i am astonished he declared that our sovereign lord should be spoken to so disrespectfully the duke of aquitaine must be forgiven for he is young and has not yet learned to govern his temper or his tongue but you my lord count of dreux have no such excuse robert was quite willing to aim his rage at a new target but thibault did not give him a chance to retaliate may i speak to the council my liege mollified by his deference louis graciously gave his permission and thibault mounted the steps of the dais we can all agree that the english kings offer was surprisingly generous and this from a man not known for spending with wild abandon there were some chuckles at that and even louis smiled we need to consider what that means my lords henry fitz empress proclaimed his willingness to welcome his sons back with open arms as if their rebellion had never been and then to reward them lavishly for that very rebellion what does that tell us that he is desperate to make peace with his sons think about that my liege my lords think about the leverage that gives us if henry will offer so much in his opening gambit how much more will he concede if only we hold firm thibault paused saw with satisfaction that louis was listening intently this is a rare opportunity my lord king we have something that the english king very badly wants i say we take advantage of that deny him his peace until he is willing to pay the price we set upon it and he will pay it for as he said himself this morn nothing is more important than blood than his sons a hushed silence greeted thibaults words even robert had the sense to keep quiet louis leaned back in his chair and then nodded gravely as always you are the voice of reason my lord count the only one in the hall we would be fools indeed if we let this chance go by on the morrow we shall tell the english king that he will have to do better much better raouls first reaction was the exhausted relief that so often marked the end of a bloody battle too weary to celebrate he found an empty windowseat and slumped down upon the cushions closing his eyes not looking up until his brother was standing beside him asking if this was his doing indeed yes he said proudly and began to laugh how i love the way fortunes wheel tilts when we least expect it i daresay you remember what almost befell eleanor when her marriage to louis was dissolved and she was seeking to reach safety in her own lands of course i remember twice she was almost abducted by overly eager grooms and one of them was count thibault who was sorely disappointed when she was warned that hed planned to seize her in blois and force her to wed him i always thought it ironic that louis would then marry her daughter to him but it is even more ironic raoul said with a grin that thibault of all men should now be her unwitting savior as they rode from gisors to the meeting place under that venerable elm henry was in good spirits listening as willem boasted to geoff about their capture of louiss castle at chaumontenvexin six years ago it was a great triumph for your lord father brilliantly executed he says that because he was one of my commanders henry interjected and willem grinned modesty has never been one of my failings whilst your father tempted the garrison to rush out and engage him geoff his welsh routiers swam the river and got into the town the garrison was soon put to flight by our men and when they tried to retreat back into the town they found it was in flames chaumont was where louis was keeping his armys provisions so he was greatly grieved by its fall staying at chaumont last night must have given him a bad dream or two then geoff said gleefully and henry turned in the saddle to smile at him i hope so lad i surely hope so ahead they saw the towering branches of the elm and beneath its vast shadow the french had gathered henry was amused that theyd claimed the shade for that much he was willing to concede to them his sons were standing together at a distance from louis and he took that as a good sign although he did not feel much need to look for favorable omens so sure was he that their answer would be the one he wanted how could it not be he was offering forgiveness and substantial revenues and more independence than theyd ever had before and he was offering it despite the collapse of their rebellion what greater proof of his sincerity could there be than that upon dismounting he gave louis a terse greeting for it would be years if ever before hed forgive the french king for verneuil and then walked over to his sons youve had the night to think it over what is your answer hal seemed to have been designated as their spokesman for he was the one to step forward our answer is no we cannot accept this was one of the few times in henrys life when he was caught utterly off balance and his intake of breath was audible to hal he looked at this stranger who was his son and he could not understand how it had ever come to this out of curiosity he said at last would you mind telling me why hal was making a disquieting discovery that it was easier to defy henry when he was enraged and hurling threats for just a moment hed seen his fathers vulnerability seen his hurt and somewhat to his surprise he found he could take no pleasure in it it clearing his throat he said simply and with no hostility it is not enough not enough henry echoed incredulously again out of curiosity you understand just how much money will it take to buy back your allegiance stung hal cried out that was not what he meant but it was richard who now drew henrys attention we are not talking about money henry regarded his second son looking intently into grey eyes very like his own what then you gave us no assurances that hal will have any say in the governance of england or normandy nor have you said that i will be able to rule aquitaine as is my right henrys anger was diluted by a vast weariness for hed had this very argument so often with hal as ive told your brother more times than i can begin to count that is because of your youth and inexperience why do you lads find this so hard to grasp an aspiring goldsmith does not expect to become one overnight he knows he must first serve an apprenticeship why should it be any different for young princes you did not serve an apprenticeship richard pointed out coolly before your father turned normandy over to you and you were just seventeen hal chimed in fully a year younger than i am now henry wanted nothing so much at that moment than to grab them both and shake some sense into them that happened because i had proved myself by then and my father knew my judgment could be trusted yes but you will not give us the chance to prove ourselves this was an old and familiar argument of hals but before henry could respond to it richard stepped in front of his brother there is more even if you agree to give us a share in the governing of aquitaine and england or normandy there is another obstacle in our path to peace you said you were willing to forgive us i said it and i meant it henry glanced from one to the other geoffrey as usual was forgotten i will forgive you i swear it upon all i hold sacred richard raised his chin met his fathers eyes challengingly can you also forgive our mother henry stiffened and as he looked at his sons never had the gap between them seemed so wide to him so impossible to bridge so be it he said flatly we are done here as henry started to turn away there were startled murmurs from the french and he marveled wearily at their surprise for hed warned them from the first that hed not come to bargain with his sons hed only taken a few steps toward his horse though before louis hastened after him you are a fool harry fitz empress the french kings voice shook with fury as he confronted the man he blamed for most of his lifes disappointments do you not see what you are throwing away you are losing your sons do you truly value your pride more than you do them they were not lost henry snarled more than willing to turn upon louis the anger hed not wanted to let loose upon his sons they were lured away and if there is any justice in this world youll answer to the almighty for it you may not even have to wait till judgment day to atone for this particular sin you have a son too who knowsone day he might grow restless under your tutelage look elsewhere for advice and support if so i will most gladly return the favor you can rant and threaten all you want blame me your queen blame everyone but yourself it changes nothing you had a chance today to win your boys back and you trampled upon it it is not a chance that will come again do you know how we celebrated your son richards sixteenth birthday i knighted him harry i knighted him not you louiss taunt drew blood henry looked at the other man with loathing and then turned accusing eyes upon his second son my congratulations richard he said scathingly what an honor for you to be knighted by the victor of verneuil richards reaction was unexpected he grinned but then henry realized why richard had not been at verneuil felt none of the shame and as their eyes met they shared a moment of odd understanding one of mutual contempt for the french king it was very different though for louis and hal louis turned beetred and spun on his heel hal flushed darkly too and cried out that verneuil was not his doing henry turned back toward his son yes it was your doing hal all of this is your doing part of being a man is taking responsibility for your actions i hope you learn that one day but based upon what ive so far seen i doubt that you will hal went white humiliated hurt indignant he glared at his father sure in that moment that he hated henry that he would always hate him it will be war then he warned his voice hoarse and nonetoosteady and you may be certain of thisthat i will never offer you terms as generous as those you offered me if you want peace you will have to beg for it on your knees henrys eyes glittered what do you know of war boy it is not dressing up in scarlet boots and wearing a sword on your hip or promising half your kingdom to the scots and the flemings or swaggering about like the hero in a minstrels chanson you want to know about war you ask the count of boulogne the earl of chester and the burghers of verneuil but you cannot can you the count of boulogne is rotting in his grave the earl of chester is rotting in one of my prisons and the citizens of verneuil are too busy grieving for their dead and the french kings lost honor hal started to protest again that he was not responsible for verneuil realized just in time that hed only be proving henrys point as henry continued remorselessly i suppose you could ask the allies you have left but they are dwindling rapidly in case youve not noticed the count of flanders and the scots king have cut you loose so have the breton rebels who were only too happy to surrender to me at dol so who does that leave your brothers whove yet to bloody their swords your formidable fatherinlaw the fearsome earl of leicester indeed hal i am shaking in my boots at the very thought of facing such worthy adversaries that provoked a choked cry of utter outrage but it did not come from hal thrusting aside the french lords in his way the earl of leicester strode over to confront henry are you calling me a coward henry found it remarkable that his late justiciar a man of honor and integrity could ever have spawned such a worthless whelp as this id say your conduct at breteuil speaks for itself he said contemptuously the look leicester gave him was murderous i retreated in good order when i saw that i could not hold the castle that was so preposterous a claim that henry laughed in his face you bolted at the first sight of my banners i daresay i could have sent our camp laundresses to take the castle and youd still have run like a spooked sheep leicester saw henry through a red mist of rage i am not running now you angevin son of a whore he shouted and drew his sword there was instant pandemonium amazed henry dropped his hand to his own sword hilt making ready to defend himself but his men were already in motion willems blade caught the sun as it slid from its scabbard and geoff not as experienced but just as eager unsheathed his weapon almost as swiftly the others were no less quick to react though hal and richard were yelling at leicester the count of champagne had darted forward to get between henry and the earl and will marshal appearing from nowhere was there too but the french king was the most horrified of all have you gone mad he was staring incredulously at leicester as if the earl had suddenly sprouted horns and a tail how dare you draw your sword upon a king i have a right to defend my honor but as he glanced around leicester saw this was a cock that wouldnt fight hed managed to do the wellnigh impossibletemporarily unite them all in a common cause for there could be no greater crime in their world than to kill a man who was the christus domini the anointed of the lord jamming his sword back into its scabbard leicester shouted defiantly at henry this is not over when we next meet it will be on the battlefield in england whirling then he shoved his way through the press of men yelling for his men and horses the archbishop of rouen had taken it upon himself to lecture them all on the sin of spilling blood during gods truce and louiss brother the archbishop of rheims added his moral authority to rotrous both men uneasily aware of how contagious violence could be with that same thought in mind henrys men had brought over his stallion swinging up into the saddle he paused to stare down at his sons and the french king you wanted war he said then by god that is what youll get the lady beatriz one of eleanors attendants halted in surprise as she entered the queens bedchamber for it was dusk but the hearth had not been lit and no lamps burned on the table glad that shed brought a candle she hastened over to light the oil wicks intending to have some harsh words with the servants for being so neglectful as an oil lamp sputtered and ignited she caught movement from the corner of her eye turned and then recoiled in surprise oh my lady how you startled me i had no idea you were here moving toward the silent figure in the windowseat she gasped as her candle illuminated the queens face madame are you ailing shall i fetch a doctor i am well beatriz eleanor said but the girl was not convinced for the older woman was ashen her gaze darting from eleanors hollow eyes to the parchment crumpled in her lap beatriz dropped to her knees stretching out a hand in mute entreaty my ladyforgive me if i have overstepped my bounds but you look so troubled something is wrong i can tell is there nothing i can do eleanor looked down at the kneeling girl most of her ladiesinwaiting did not serve her for long eager to find husbands at the royal court but beatriz a young widow and distant cousin on her mothers side had been with her for more than four years her uncle raoul had recommended beatriz and at first eleanor had wondered if hed put the girl in her household to spy upon her but beatriz had passed every test shed set for her and eleanor had no doubts about her loyalty or her love shed only had two female confidantes in her life though her sister petronilla and maud the countess of chester and she was not about to confess her hearts pain to a sweet child young enough to be one of her daughters yet beatriz was right she was in great need of solace in need of one she could truly trust there is something you can do for me beatriz she said and managed a flickering smile fetch my constable as hed aged saldebreuil de sanzays eyes had begun to fail him and his vision was tolerable only at a distance these days it did not help that the letter was in raoul de fayes own hand for his scrawl was not as legible as a scribes uniform script he was too proud to ask eleanor to read it to him though and she was too distracted to notice his difficulties he eventually solved the problem by holding the letter out at arms length when he looked up there was an expression upon his face that shed rarely seen before one of fearfor richard for aquitaine above all for her fear shed not often had to deal with it for hers had been a privileged life shed been insulated from fear by her high birth her crown and her headstrong nature in her fortynine years on gods earth she could honestly say that shed rarely been afraid even during those times when shed been placed in physical perilthe assault by the saracens in the holy land the capture of her galley by pirates in the pay of the byzantine emperor the ambush by the de lusignansthered been no time to dwell upon the danger until it was over and then there was no need nownow there was nothing but time and as shed sat in her darkened bedchamber after reading raouls letter shed thought of the unforgiving wrath of the man shed married and could not deny that she was afraid of what the future might hold afraid that she may have made the greatest mistake of her life you were not told of this peace conference then saldebreuil asked quietly and she shook her head i knew nothing of it until raouls letter arrived she gazed down at her clasped hands noticing the golden glimmer of her wedding ring why was she still wearing it i expected the count of flanders to take charge of the rebellion had i thought the reins would be left in louiss hands id never have risked it he nodded bleakly it has gone wrong from the first my lady if hal had not fled from chinon when he did wed have had the time we needed to complete our plans to coordinate our strategy they ought to have attacked all at once on multiple fronts the assault upon normandy began promisingly enough but it all fell apart when the count of boulogne was slain and gave your husband the chance to quell the rising in brittany if the scots king had only persevered if theyd invaded england at the same time his words trailed off for he recognized his complaint for what it was a soldiers lament for lost opportunities and bungled choices raoul thinks i ought to have gone to paris with him and my sons but how could i do that how could i leave aquitaine what sort of a message would that have sent to my lords and vassals if id run away likelike a flighty fainthearted woman in all honesty madame i doubt that your presence in paris would have changed things much you have more common sense than any man ive ever known and more courage but we both know theyd not have heeded you youre crippled by your skirts and your lads by their years had he only been older richard could have again he left the thought unfinished for he was too much of a realist to embrace those most frivolous of regrets the ones rooted in the barren soil of what if and if only instead he said briskly well at least weve been granted a second chance i think it likely the count of flanders will soon rejoin the hunt for he is not a man to mourn for long not when all of kent can be his for the taking and when he does the french kings mishaps will not matter as much we must remember too that the scots king is still a player in this game and whilst he may not be your husbands equal on the field he has something the other rebels do notthe resources of a kingdom to draw upon yes she said but so does harry our spies tell us he has enough to hire twice as many brabancon routiers as he has now in his pay as shed spoken she was tugging at her wedding band until it slid from her finger clenching it tightly in her fist she said morosely i wonder how long it will be ere they come calling into aquitaine saldebreuil had no answer for her but then shed not expected one and after that they sat for a time in silence as the shadows lengthened and night came on chapter twelve october st edmundsbury england upon learning that the earl of leicester had sailed from wissant on september with a large contingent of flemish mercenaries the earl of arundel set out in pursuit landing at walton on the coast of suffolk there he learned that leicester had joined forces with the earl of norfolk at framlingham and that the kings justiciar and constable richard de lucy and humphrey de bohun had hastily signed a truce with the scots king so they could return to deal with this new threat the abbey of st edmunds was a celebrated pilgrim shrine for it held the holy bones of the martyred saxon king edmund geoff hoped that hed have time to do honor to the saint but for now he could think only of the coming bloodshed he had persuaded henry to allow him to accompany the earl of arundel but he was uncomfortably aware of his lack of military experience and was desperately determined that he not blunder and bring shame upon his father they were greeted cordially by abbot hugh who promised that his guestmaster would somehow find lodgings for their men no mean feat under the circumstances the justiciar and constable had gotten support from henrys cousin the earl of gloucester and his uncles rainald and ranulf so the abbey and town were already overflowing with knights and foot soldiers the earl soon excused himself candidly admitting that his old bones were in need of a rest having reached his biblical three score years and ten he no longer felt the need for bravado left to his own devices geoff gladly accepted the offer of a young novice monk to show him around his guide introduced himself as jocelin of brakelond and took geoff into the nave of the church to see the saints shrine located behind the high altar pilgrims came from all over england brother jocelin said proudly although honesty compelled him to admit that the crowds had fallen off in the past two years as more and more people chose to make pilgrimages to st thomas at canterbury in recent weeks most of the visitors had been local townspeople he confided praying that their saint would save them from the earl of leicesters flemings and praying too that the warfare would not keep them from holding their great fair in november geoff bit his tongue to keep himself from reminding the young monk that there was more at stake than lost fair revenues if they did not succeed in quelling leicesters rebellion england itself could be lost to the rebels after leaving the church jocelin escorted geoff through the cellarers gate into the great courtyard and then to the abbots hall rather than the guest hall for he knew that his abbot was a shrewd politician as well as a churchman and hed want to be sure that the kings son was treated as a privileged guest geoff hesitated in the doorway for he was shy with strangers to his relief he soon spotted two familiar faces his fathers uncles rainald of cornwall and lord ranulf of wales he did not know either man very well but they shared a common bondillegitimacyand he headed in their direction to his delight they welcomed him with genuine enthusiasm squeezing over to make room for him at their table they had spent the past three months fighting beside the justiciar richard de lucy first laying siege to the town and castle of leicester and then pursuing the scots king back across the border and geoff felt a surge of gratitude that these two men so loyal to their sister the empress maude were proving to be no less loyal to her son rainald would happily have entertained geoff for hours with stories of their scots campaign but ranulf deftly steered the conversation toward more urgent mattersthe threat posed by the earl of leicester and his ally hugh bigod the earl of norfolk geoff was familiar with bigods history for he was notorious for his doubledealing hed begun his career by committing perjury on stephens behalf falsely swearing that maudes father had repudiated her upon his deathbed stephen had rewarded him with the earldom of norfolk but hed soon proved that stephen could trust him no more than maude could and his unbridled ambition had even led him to join the infamous geoffrey de mandeville de mandeville had paid for his treachery with death dishonor and eternal damnation but bigod had somehow escaped retribution and seemed as indifferent to the passage of time as he was to the voice of conscience hed rebelled against stephen maude and then henry had been excommunicated by thomas becket for usurping the lands of a norfolk monastery and now at the vast age of eighty he was still actively engaging in his favorite pursuitsinsurrection perfidy and marauding geoff thought that an alliance between bigod and the earl of leicester was inevitable the damned seeking out the damned after he landed at walton that snake leicester slithered off to join bigod in his burrow at framlingham rainald reported grimacing as if hed tasted something foul but he soon wore out his welcome his flemings thought they could take anything that caught their eyefood livestock women and his countess had her nose so far up in the air that shed have drowned if it began to rain bigods wife decided shed rather entertain starving wolves as guests and there was so much tension that leicester and his wifewho fancies herself his chief military advisordecided that theyd march west to leicester castle we have to stop them geoff exclaimed with such intensity that the older men smiled and rainald could not resist teasing him a bit are you planning to ride with us lad i thought harry meant to make you a prince of the church as a priest your choice of weapons is somewhat limited i guess you could always put the curse of god upon leicester he deserves it if any man does geoff tensed hurt and offended but then he caught ranulfs wink and relaxed reassured that rainalds maladroit humor was not meant to wound i am not a priest yet he said adding ruefully and in no hurry to take holy vows my father believes that id make a far better cleric than i do but he did agree to let me receive a knights training i bloodied my sword when the french army fled verneuil so i am not such a novice as you think granduncle rainald jesu lad do not call me that that makes me sound downright ancient like a holy relic or one of those churchyard yew trees uncle rainald will do just fine and we will stop them geoff ranulf said you need not fret about that three days ago they took haughley castle they ransomed the knights but they burned the village to the ground haughley is just twelve miles east of st edmundsbury leicester will not dare an attack upon the town though and hell try to circle around us once he does well strike and with gods blessings geoff said emphatically although his nerves throbbed with the realization that a battle could be looming within days id risk the surety of my soul to see leicester called to account for his sins at gisors he actually dared to draw his sword on my father so that really happened we heard the story ranulf said shaking his head in bemusement but could scarce believe it and it is not as if leicester has youth as an excuse rainald pointed out not like my niece mauds idiot son hugh doing penance these days in a falaise dungeon leicester was born the year after the sinking of the white ship which makes him more than fifty i suppose leicester could plead madness geoff commented acerbically for nothing less than lunacy can explain his actions but what of his wife if peronelle is not welcome at framlingham where will she go when he heads for leicester shell go with him ranulf said with absolute certainty on the march to framlingham she rode at his side wearing chain mail and bearing a lance and shield geoff was dumbstruck but before he could respond rainald gave a short bark of laughter that must have been a sight to behold ranulf says there is a greek myth about women warriors and i suppose peronelle thinks she is one of thoseamazons was it ranulf not even eleanor ever dared to arm herself as if she were a man eleanors name sank like a stone in the conversational waters and an awkward silence fell for henrys uncles understood her conduct no more than he did rainald had been impressed by her beauty and her willingness to swap bawdy stories with him and shed won ranulf over by befriending his wife rhiannon she was now the enemy though for her glamour and past kindnesses counted for little against a betrayal of such magnitude it was ranulf who gave voice to their bitterness raimon st gilles warned harry at toulouse that he was nurturing a viper in his nest he did not believe it of course what man would believe that of his own wife no man would rainald concurred poor harry that clifford chit is said to be a pretty little thing but was there ever so costly a piece of tail not harrys fault though how could he have known eleanors jealousy would turn her into a madwoman geoff could not defend rosamund for in the eyes of the church she was a wanton having met her he did not like to hear her described so crudely though and since he did not feel comfortable taking rainald to task for it he chose to change the subject is it true that the earl of gloucester is here with you ranulf nodded and rainald explained cheerfully that gloucester did not seem happy about it but he had no choice he knows harry thinks he is weakwilled and since he is wed to leicesters sister harry would naturally wonder how susceptible hed be to the earls blandishments so he is here to prove that he is not as daft as his nephew hugh geoff did not like the earl of gloucester thought he was pompous and just as feckless as henry suspected but he felt an unwelcome prick of pity for the earl now it did not seem fair that he should be tainted by his wifes beaumont blood he was thinking that civil wars were the cruelest of all wars when a man stopped by their table he was of medium height with closely clipped brown hair and beard and looked to geoff to be in his midtwenties his familiarity with rainald and ranulf indicated to geoff that he was someone of substance but he was taken aback when the introductions were made for the newcomer bore a wellknown name sir roger bigod bigod are you kin to the earl of norfolk his query might have been tactless but it was not illintentioned hed never outgrown his boyhood habit of speaking his mind but sir roger bristled at the question the earl is my father he said defiantly what of it are you suggesting that we are trying to keep a foot in both camps and that is why i am supporting the king geoff blinked good lord no the thought never entered my head id be the last man in christendom to cast aspersions upon another mans family loyalties look at mine my half brothers could put judas to shame and whilst my lord father is willing to forgive them i doubt that i ever can roger was disarmed by his candor and regarded geoff with amused approval a few friends and i are going into town to get something to eat you want to come along afterward well show you the sightstaverns alehouses and mayhap a nunnery geoff grinned for he knew nunnery was slang for a bawdyhouse and knew too that this was rogers way of apologizing for his flare of temper what are we waiting for he asked pushing away from the table roger grinned too but then his gaze fell upon ranulf and rainald you are also welcome to come he said politely but not very enthusiastically ranulf declined with a smile and watched as geoff and roger headed for the door rainald watched too saying indignantly they think we are too old and decrepit for a night of drinking and whoring well ranulf said we are and after a moment rainald sighed yes i suppose we are he agreed somewhat sadly but then he brightened at least we are not too old to fight ranulf thought that was debatable for rainald was sixtythree and he was just weeks away from his fiftyfifth birthday hed much rather have spent these past months back in wales with rhiannon savoring their homecoming but his nephews need must come first there had been a time when hed briefly been estranged from his eldest son and he still remembered the pain of it how much greater must harrys pain be betrayed by his own blood by those he had most reason to trust we have a saying in wales dangos y cam ai faddau ywr dial tostaf ar elyn it translates as to disclose the wrong and forgive it is the severest revenge upon an enemy but when it comes to those involved in this rebellion rainald i find myself agreeing with geoff that there can be no forgiveness rainald signaled to a passing servant snared two cups of ale and passed one to his brother lets drink he said first to victory and then to retribution they were making their way up churchgate street having been warned by the watch that curfew had rung but in no hurry to return to the restrictive environs of the abbey geoff was in good spirits for hed enjoyed his outing with roger bigod and his friends hed had enough ale to feel mellow but not enough to suffer from it on the morrow and hed had a very satisfactory encounter with a young whore named eve was already looking forward to a return visit when he said as much though roger laughed id not count on that geoff chances are that well be leaving st edmundsbury in the dust within a day or two at most geoff turned to look at the other man you think it will be as soon as that i do our scouts are keeping a sharp eye on leicester once we know which road he means to take we can move to intercept him andwhat was that geoff had heard it too a muffled shout fulk de barnham one of rogers household knights pointed off to his left it came from that alley crossing the street they peered into the alley hands on sword hilts raising his lantern geoff saw enough to draw his weapon he did not know the rights or wrongs of the fight but he did not like the oddsthree to one as he moved forward roger and his companions followed they might not share geoffs strong sense of chivalry but they were not at all averse to ending the night with a brawl a young man had been backed against the wall bleeding and bruised he was defending himself with a wooden stick and getting the worst of it but his assailants broke off the attack as soon as they realized they were no longer alone one glance at the drawn swords and they fled toward the other end of the alley disappearing into the night their victim slowly sank to his knees gasping for breath all geoff could see of him was a thatch of bright hair as yellow as primroses are you hurt he asked leaning over to touch the others shoulder when he raised his head geoff saw that he was little more than a boy fifteen sixteen at most his words came out in a rush and geoff guessed they were being thanked but he had trouble understanding all that was being said for he had a rudimentary grasp of english and the boys east anglican accent rendered his speech all but indecipherable roger and his knights were far more fluent in english than geoff and they soon had the youths story he says his name is ailwin roger related and he was set upon by those cutthroats as he left the alehouse up the street they saw him as easy prey i suppose a lad alone fresh from the country look what he was using to fend them off geoff shone his lantern upon a long wooden handle with a shorter stouter stick attached at the end by a leather thong it seemed vaguely familiar to him and after a moment he recognized it as a flail a farming implement used to thresh wheat why would he be wandering around st edmundsbury with a flail the last time i looked there were no crops to be harvested in the center of town ailwin was struggling to get to his feet and fulk gave him a hand while roger put a few more questions to him he says he came here to fight the flemings the flail was the only weapon he had geoff almost laughed at the notion of this green farm lad going off to war with a flail but stifled it in time not wanting to hurt the boys feelings roger was speaking again to ailwin and when he glanced over at geoff his face was bleak leicesters flemings burned his village and killed his family they looked at one another and then at ailwin we cannot leave him bleeding here in the alley geoff said finally tell him to come with us back to the abbey at least hell have a bed for the night the shire is full of ailwins roger said leicester has much to answer for he did not add the words as does my father but the unspoken thought seemed to hang in the air between them and geoff could only hope that the day of reckoning would soon be comingfor all their sakes geoff could not dismiss ailwin from his mind though and the next morning while breaking his fast with his granduncles and the earl of gloucester he told them about the boys rash quest i cannot blame him for wanting to strike back at the men who killed his family he concluded but god help him if he should actually run into some of the flemish routiers gloucester looked at geoff blankly unable to understand why they were wasting time discussing the fate of a runaway peasant but ranulf and rainald were intrigued by the image hed conjured upa country ceorl wielding his flail in the interest of justice theres no use trying to talk the lad out of it rainald asserted spearing a large piece of sausage with his knife better he tags along after the army than to go roaming off on his own theres safety in numbers after all rainald is right ranulf helped himself to a chunk of freshly baked bread if he is set upon vengeance hell not be discouraged by anything you say he has a just grievance after all and a just grievance gloucester echoed in astonishment you are talking about a lowborn villein a drudge a he paused groping for words and finally settled upon nithing an english term of contempt he is no more capable of understanding the concept of honor or a blooddebt than my favorite lymer hound what you should have done geoff was report him to the sheriff for if he is bound to the land he has no right to run off like this and ought to be punished rainald and ranulf looked at the younger man marveling that their beloved brother robert could have sired such a son geoff had neither their patience nor their long experience in dealing with gloucesters bad manners and he set down his ale cup so abruptly that liquid sloshed over the rim that makes perfect sense he said with enough sarcasm to have done his father proud we are facing a rebel army that is far larger than ours an army made up of flemish routiers eager to turn all of england into a charnel house so of course our first priority ought to be tracking down and disciplining a lad who may or may not be a runaway villein gloucester scowled but when geoff showed no signs of being intimidated by his disapproval he decided it was not worth his while to engage in a public quarrel with this insolent stripling getting to his feet he made what he hoped was a dignified departure ruing the day that a kings sinful spawn must be treated as if he were lawfully begotten on equal footing with those born in holy wedlock and his contempt for geoff was not in the least diluted by the fact that his own father had been a royal bastard for gloucester had never been one to let his reasoning be undermined by facts as he walked away rainald leaned over and punched geoff playfully on the arm well done lad now we can enjoy our meal in peace our prospects are not as dire though as you made out it is true leicester has three thousand flemings under his command but they are more like a pack of hungry dogs than a true army but routiers are feared the length and breadth of christendom geoff protested look how easily my fathers brabancons overcame the breton rebels fortunately for us ranulf said leicesters routiers are not as battleseasoned as harrys soldiers he hired them on the cheap taking any men willing to sign on and he was in such a rush that he had no time to separate the wheat from the chaff a goodly number of his socalled routiers were weavers bedazzled by the prospects of rich plunder in england theyve been stealing anything that was not nailed down on their marches singing a cheery little ditty hop hop wilekin england is mine and thine but theyve not yet been battletested and it remains to be seen how theyll respond when they are although he would not have admitted it geoff had been troubled by the disparity in size between the two armies and he was heartened now to think leicesters flemings were not as formidable as people feared weve been lucky too he commented in the quality of the battle commanders weve been facing the french king and leicester whod fear either of those stouthearts on the field ranulf and rainald were expressing their amused agreement when there was a stir across the hall as they turned toward the sound they saw roger bigod hastening in their direction our scouts have just ridden in he reported breathlessly leicester is on the move he is making ready to ford the river lark north of the town roger bigod had been given the honor of bearing the standard of st edmund and as they rode out of the towns northgate geoffs eyes kept returning to that sacred banner flaring as the wind swirled it proclaiming to all that they were marching under the saints protection the sky above them was a brilliant blue a harvest sky and the october sun spangled the countryside in dazzling golden light burnishing the autumn foliage so that the trees seemed on fire ablaze with leafy flames of yellow and scarlet geoff had never been so aware of the physical world around him so grateful for the beauty that the almighty had bestowed upon them but if his senses had been honed as sharp as his sword his emotions were soaring like st edmunds banner he was caught up in the surging thrill of the hunt eager to test his prowess and his courage to make his father proud and see the rebel earl brought low his nerves were vibrating like welsh harp strings but there was no fear in him not yet on such a day defeat was impossible to imagine the earl of leicester had made a fateful decision to cross the river lark at the hamlet of fornham st genevieve just four miles from the royal army at st edmundsbury henrys commanders could not understand why hed chosen to take such a risk could only be grateful for it theyd been ready to move as soon as they received confirmation from their scouts of the earls whereabouts and they raced north with the stirring words of the aged earl of arundel ringing in their ears let us strike them for the honor of god and st edmund when they were within sight of the rebel force not a man among them doubted that the almighty was on their side theyd caught leicester in the very act of fording the river and while his knights had already reached the west bank his flemish foot soldiers were still massing on the east bank his army split in two by the rushing waters of the lark the attack began as a trot with lances held upright trumpets blaring and pennons fluttering in the breeze and the war cry of the english royal house erupting from countless throats dex aie it seemed to geoff that his heart was pounding in rhythm with his stallions thudding hooves this was the way combat was meant to be not the ugliness at verneuil the broken faith and slaughter of innocents this was a fight between equals knights trained in war matching skills and valor leveling his lance couched under his right arm so it was held steady against his chest he urged his destrier into a gallop as the enemy knights charged to meet them his target was a knight on a roan stallion as the distance narrowed between them he braced himself for the impact still more excited than afraid instinctively putting into practice the lessons learned in years of tiltyard drills his foe struck first but his lance hit the edge of geoffs shield sliding off harmlessly geoffs aim was better he was rocked back against his saddle cantle as his lance shattered upon his opponents shield and then he gave a triumphant shout for the force of his blow had unseated the other knight he hesitated then not sure what to do next it never occurred to him to kill the man sprawled in the trampled grass it would be dishonorable to slay a defenseless knight and foolish too for hed be forfeiting a profitable ransom but the battle still raged around him shouldnt he seek out another foe his dilemma was solved by fulk de barnham as he galloped past he yelled what are you waiting for take him prisoner or someone else will the enemy knight was struggling to sit up holding his arm at such an odd angle that geoff guessed hed broken a bone in his fall casting aside his damaged lance geoff unsheathed his sword do you yield the mans eyes locked onto that lethal naked blade i do he said hoarsely i am your prisoner sir geoff frowned down into that pale tense face hed heard it argued that it would now be his responsibility to escort his captive to a place of safety but clearly that was impossible under the circumstances he had no intention of leaving the battle and he decided he had no choice but to trust to his enemys honor you have pledged yourself to geoffrey fitz roy he declared and spurred his stallion away without waiting for a response he soon found another adversary a knight on a lathered chestnut they exchanged inconclusive blows but when he circled back to strike again he was shocked to see the other man had ridden on glancing around he saw that this was occurring all over the field men were down riderless horses milling about in confusion leicesters line was wavering his knights outnumbered and hardpressed giving ground before the onslaught and then the line was breaking and the survivors were in flight seeking only to save themselves leicester is getting away a knight galloped by geoff gesturing and shouting catching a glimpse of a streaming checkered banner in the distance he recognized it as the earls device and joined the chase urging his stallion to greater speed treacherous swine swaggering misbegotten whoreson well follow you into hell if need be no one could hear him of course but geoff continued to yell threats so outraged was he that leicester would try to save his craven skin by bolting the field leaving his men to die the rebel knights were being overtaken one by one for they were fleeing across marshland and they were soon blundering into bogs and sloughs a ditch loomed ahead but geoffs destrier did not break stride gathering itself it soared up and over and geoff gave a shaken laugh for there was a second horse down in the ditch one that had not been so lucky floundering on three legs he drew rein to catch his breath and heap praise upon his stallion caught movement from the corner of his eye just in time a man darted forward muddied and desperate and snatched at his reins geoffs stallion was well trained in the maneuvers of the battlefieldhenry had seen to thatand it reared up dragging the man off his feet hed come in from the left so geoff could not make use of his sword instead he bashed the knight with his shield and watched with satisfaction as his assailant reeled backward plunging down into the ditch with a resounding splash a horseman was approaching very fast and he spurred his stallion forward he was confident that this was not one of leicesters fleeing knights for he was going in the wrong direction and by now the rider was close enough for him to recognize the device on his shieldthe insignia of the constable humphrey de bohun the man reined in a few feet away he was splattered with blood whether his own or not geoff could not tell and his chest was heaving his face streaked with sweat and dirt do you have a wineskin he wanted to know and when geoff unhooked it from his pommel and tossed it over he drank in gulps then removed his helmet and poured the remaining liquid over his head god above it is hot it was a cool autumn day but geoff agreed with him between his mail and his exertions he felt downright feverish what is happening hed assumed de bohuns knight was acting as a courier and the man confirmed it now with a flash of white teeth as he replaced his helmet we caught leicester and as easy as snaring a rabbit it was too he did not even try to fight us off the milklivered mewling pisspot my lord sent me to get word to the earls of cornwall and gloucester his last words floated back on the wind to geoff for he was already galloping off geoff was tempted to continue on so greatly did he want to witness leicesters capture and humiliation but common sense reasserted itself and turning his horse around he rode after the courier the battle was not yet won for there were still leicesters three thousand flemish routiers to deal with hed not gone far though before he saw several horsemen gathered beside a waterfilled trench what drew his attention was their laughter not something hed expect to hear upon a battlefield they turned as he rode up one of them was a knight in roger bigods household and he assured the others that geoff was on their side it occurred to geoff that warfare would be easier if all the combatants wore identifying colors or devices a baron or lords knights would bear his insignia on their shields but not always and in the heat of battle mistakes could be made and sometimes were that was what had most surprised geoff about combat the chaos and confusion he started to ask the knights what was going on but by then he was close enough to see for himself a slight figure in chain mail was struggling in the water while on the bank one of the knights was removing his helmet and sword before sliding down into the trench it made sense to geoff that theyd attempt a rescue why not get wet for the chance of a goodly ransom he was puzzled though that the wouldbe rescuers companions were so amused by his efforts and even more puzzled now when the trapped knight lurched away refusing to take his outstretched hand whathed prefer drowning to capture he asked incredulously and oddly that sent the other men into further paroxysms of mirth not he one managed to gasp she geoffs jaw dropped once he understood what they were saying he swung from the saddle and hastened toward the ditch eager to see the earl of leicesters notorious amazon countess the other knights were still laughing cheering the good samaritan on with cries of go simon go so far simon was not having much luck come on my lady he said coaxingly youre getting in over your head surely you do not want to drown in a ditch like a dog yes she hissed i would rather drown than let you put your hands on me you lumpish poxy lout this sent simons comrades into hysterics one almost unseated himself he was laughing so hard the countess had gone under came up sputtering and coughing and when she did simon lunged forward but she was as slippery as an eel and slid out of his grasp this is crazy my lady he insisted edging closer to make another grab so youve lost war is always a question of losing and winning but if you kill yourself youll burn in hell for all eternity for the first time she seemed to be listening to him to hear what he was saying she looked from him to the watching men and there was such despair on her face that their laughter momentarily stilled when simon stretched out his hand she hesitated then began to splash toward him and hed soon pulled her to safety but when he was about to boost her up the bank she suddenly began to resist again tugging frantically at the jeweled rings adorning her fingers she slipped them off before he realized what she was doing and flung the rings out into the depths of the ditch there she cried triumphantly id rather the fish get them with that simon lost all patience bitch he growled shoving her up onto dry ground before plunging into the ditch again where he dove repeatedly into the murky water seeking in vain to recover the countesss rings geoff understood simons frustration for thered be no ransom for the countess of leicester it did not matter how much she might offer for her freedom she would be a prisoner of the crown not released until and if his father willed it peronelle had flung back the hood of her hauberk removing her sodden linen coif to reveal thick braids coiled neatly at the nape of her neck she was not at all what geoff had expected hed heard such stories of the influence she wielded over leicester that hed envisioned her as a jezebel thinking theirs was the classic case of an older man doting upon a young and beautiful wife but peronelle de grandmesnil was not a young woman not a new wife geoff guessed she might be as old as forty which meant that she was the mother of leicesters four children and indeed she did look more maternal than seductive even allowing for her present bedraggled state she caught him studying her and thrust her chin out glaring at him with a defiance that he found both admirable and exasperating what are you staring at knave she snapped and geoff felt a twinge of pity for her children with this shrew and leicester as their parents they were truly doomed by their own blood i was wondering he said coldly if you were curious about the fate of your lord husband mayhap not since he apparently was more concerned with saving himself than seeing to your safety it was hard to tell for sure but he thought that she blanched beneath her coating of mud you know what befell my husband geoff surprised himself by wishing he could tell her leicester was dead he hadnt known he had such a streak of malice he is safe enough he said adding ominously for now even though he knewand she surely did toothat leicester was too highborn to pay the ultimate price for his treason he was coming to realize that the guiltiest onesthe french king and his half brotherswere likely to escape any real punishment leaving their supporters to suffer for their sins there was only one of the conspirators who might eventually be held to accounthis fathers queen geoff found his granduncles on the bank of the river lark hed not needed to worry about the flemish routiers they assured him trapped on the wrong side of the river the flemings had watched helplessly as leicesters knights were ridden down and when the royal forces began to ford the river theyd confirmed rainalds scornful belief that they were better weavers than routiers and panicked they had sought to save themselves by fleeing into the marshy meadowlands beyond the tiny chapel of fornham st genevieve and what followed rainald reported gleefully was a slaughter it was over in less than an hour he told geoff we captured virtually all of leicesters knights including the lordly turd himself and his french cousin hugh de chastel as for his greedy flemings theyll get some english land out of thisenough to be buried in geoff laughed aloud amused by his kinsmans flair for creative cursing from now on he knew hed think of leicester as the lordly turd the flemings did not try to surrender they died fighting no ranulf said they died running and they were not offered a chance to surrender geoff knew that the chivalric code did not apply to lowborn routiers and he could not muster up much sympathy for the slain flemings not when he remembered young ailwin trying to avenge the slaughter of his family with a farmers flail so we killed them all then he said but to his surprise ranulf shook his head no not us lad the local people did it the peasants and ceorls they pursued the flemings with hayforks and clubs and flails whatever weapons they could find and when they caught one they wasted no time dispatching him to hell many of the routiers drowned too either in the river or in the ditches that cross these meadowlands well be digging grave pits for some time to come geoff whistled silently and then remembering that the slain routiers were still fellow christians he dutifully made the sign of the cross but roger bigods words were echoing in his ears the shire is full of ailwins the ways of the almighty were indeed mysterious at times whod have expected him to make use of villeins and ceorls as the instruments of divine justice the earl of norfolk will be quaking in his boots once he hears about leicesters defeat he said happily but before he could dwell upon the earls discomfort men were pushing forward pointing and shouting turning he saw the cause of their excitement the kings constable humphrey de bohun was returning to st edmundsbury in triumph but the bystanders had eyes only for his captiveshugh de chastel who bore the lofty title count of chateauneufenthimerais and his cousin robert beaumont earl of leicester what struck geoff first was that the linen surcoat leicester wore over his mail was still clean unstained by blood or dirt or mud he wondered uncharitably if the earl had even bothered to draw his sword thinking that his countess had put up more of a fight than her heroic husband leicester appeared oblivious to the jeers and catcalls of the spectators he was livid slumped in the saddle as if his spine no longer had the strength to hold him erect his the stunned disbelief of a man who could not understand how his god and his luck could have so forsaken him geoff suspected that the wily old earl of norfolk would have shown more spirit but he suspected too that norfolk would find a way to escape a reckoning as hed so often done in the past at least it is over he said thank god almighty for that ranulf gave him a searching look but refrained from commenting even though he knew better it was not over would not be over as long as the french king and the king of the scots and their allies were still free to continue the war for they would he had no doubts of that for now though he let geoff enjoy their triumph it was worth savoring after all the victory theyd won this october day at fornham st genevieve an unseasonable thunderstorm had rolled through rouen earlier in the evening and rosamund still heard occasional rumblings of thunder in the distance shed been embroidering another altar cloth for godstow priory while waiting for henry to come to bed but she was smothering yawns and finally laid the sewing aside she was tired all the time these days for henry was sleeping even less than usual shed always been awed by his vigor his ability to go to bed so late and rise so early and yet seem so invigorated so energetic lately though his sleep habits had gotten much worse and rosamund was often kept awake herself by his restlessness he would not admit it but she was sure she knew the reason for his current unease there had been no word from england only a foreboding silence rosamund was confident that leicesters rebellion would be quelled for her faith in henry was as deep as her faith in the almighty and if that was blasphemous so be it but she sensed that henry was beset with doubts for perhaps the first time in his life and she did not know how to help just as she did not know how to heal the festering wounds caused by his familys betrayal she curled up in the middle of the bed and was soon joined by a kitten the color of saffron cats were not usually kept as pets except occasionally by nuns but rosamund had a fondness for them it was only recently that shed confided this partiality to henry and much to her delight he was willing to indulge her in it joking that he wished hed known earlier that she could be satisfied with stable cats rather than costly jewels now when the kitten settled down on the pillow beside her she was soon lulled to sleep by its soft melodic purring she was not sure how long shed slept jarred back to awareness by a loud thud at first she thought it was another clap of thunder but then she heard henrys voice calling her name a moment later he pulled the bed hangings aside and enfolded her in an exuberant embrace wake up lass this is no time to sleep not when we have so much to celebrate youve heard from your justiciar she cried and he nodded grinning the rebellion in england is over that whoreson leicester is now a prisoner of the crown his knights pleading to be ransomed his flemings rotting in suffolk graves it was a brilliant victory love about as good as it gets he hugged her again then gave her a passionate kiss that took her breath away in part because he was holding her so tightly beloved that is such wonderful news when henry told her that the battle had been fought near st edmundsbury she resolved to make sure that its abbey benefited too from royal largesse henry was not as openhanded in his giving as she or the church would have liked but she knew she could coax him into showing greater generosity in the wake of such a blessed victory henry was pouring them wine and she sat up in the bed to watch unable to remember the last time shed seen him so happy what of the earl of norfolk harry did he take the field with leicester of course not that sly old fox prefers to let others do his hunting for him but he was alarmed enough by leicesters defeat to agree to a truce and even to dismiss his own flemish routiers there will be no further outbreaks of violence in england at least not this year taking the cup he was offering she gave him a radiant smile what will you do with the earl of leicester he is a wicked loathsome man harry ought to be punished severely for his treachery henry was amused and touched that the softhearted rosamund was so fierce when it came to the rebel earl shed been utterly unforgiving from the moment shed learned of his behavior at gisors richard de lucy dispatched leicester and his quarrelsome countess to southampton and from there theyll be sent to keep hugh of chester company at falaise when we return to england it would be a godly act to make a pilgrimage to st edmundsbury she murmured for shed just remembered that the suffolk saint was known to show favor to barren wives if you like he said absently joining her on the bed where he set about unfastening her long blond braids rosamund leaned back against him with a contented sigh thinking that this would be their first christmas together shed always passed them alone watching from afar as he celebrated his christmas court with his queen harryst edmundsbury is not the only pilgrimage we can make she ventured and he paused in the act of running his fingers through her hair to say dryly that he hoped she was not going to suggest canterbury i was thinking of mont st michel she looked at him hopefully for shed long yearned to visit the celebrated island abbey now would be the perfect time for such a pilgrimage beloved the breton rebels have been subdued and therell be no fighting elsewhere until the spring she stopped in midsentence feeling the sudden tension in the arm encircling her waist when he sat up she searched his face intently worrying that shed somehow offended of course by next spring i am sure peace will be restored and your sons will have come to their senses she said hastily i did not mean to imply that this wretched war will drag on into the new year henry did not seem to be listening and when he rose and began to move restlessly around the chamber she watched him in growing dismay shed always found his sudden mood swings to be disconcerting and never more so than now for his elation over leicesters defeat seemed to be vanishing before her very eyes harryhave i said something wrong she asked timidly if i did it was not meant hed begun to stir the hearth logs with an iron poker straightening up he was surprised to see tears welling in her eyes ah no love you did nothing wrong but i cannot take you to mont st michel now my war is not yet done for the year she was reassured by his use of an endearment proof that he was not angry with her as shed feared she was baffled though by what hed just said she knew little of military matters but even she knew that fighting ordinarily ended with the first frost not to be resumed until the return of mild weather you mean to continue your campaign i was waiting till i got word from england but i am free now to move south into anjou the count of vendome has been overthrown by his own son who then threw in his lot with hal and the french king doubtless hoping that theyd help him hold on to his illgotten gains i mean to reinstate the count and bring his ungrateful whelp to heel rosamund could understand why hed feel so strongly about putting down a sons outlaw rebellion that was so obvious that it needed no discussion she could understand too his determination to restore order in anjou for insurrection in the land of his birth had to be particularly galling the tone of his voice though alerted her that there was more at stake than the count of vendomes plight and when he glanced in her direction she was disquieted by the expression upon his face his eyes were the color of smoke and yet cold enough to send a chill up her spine reminding her that ice could burn and then she whispered shaken even though she knew that this smoldering implacable anger was not meant for her and then henry said grimly i think it is time i paid a visit to my loving wife chapter thirteen november poitiers poitou madame you are in grave peril the english kings army is poised like a dagger at the heart of poitou by weeks end he could be at the very gates of the city and we will not be able to hold out against him william de maingot was lord of sugeres brother by marriage of the powerful geoffrey de rancon and one of eleanors most trusted vassals at the moment though she was hard pressed to be civil to the man she expected such dramatic posturing from traveling players not from one of her counselors nor was she impressed by his overwrought portentous warning did he truly think she was unaware of her danger theyd all had their say by nowwilliam de maingot porteclie de mauze guillaume de parthenay her steward herve le panetier and sir nicholas de chauvigny the head of her household knights only saldebrueil had held his peace knowing that she would never be bullied into making a decision they were a pitifully small group but this war of attrition had scattered her lords to the four winds her uncles were in paris with her sons geoffrey de rancon and the count of angouleme were making ready to defend their own lands from her husbands routiers as were the wily de lusignan clan others like the viscount of limoges had deliberately stayed out of the fray doubtless watching to see whod prevail before committing themselves her inner circle was shrinking as was her margin of safety madame he is right porteclie de mauze exclaimed as soon as william de maingot had stopped speaking your husband has taken the castles of la haye preuilly and champigny and your uncles castle at faye le vineuse de maingot made such a sweeping theatrical gesture that he almost overturned his wine cup in nicholas de chauvignys lap fortunately the knight had good reflexes and caught the cup just in time oblivious de maingot slammed his fist down upon the table he razed it to the ground my lady left nothing but smoldering ruins we must be thankful that raoul is in paris i would to god that you were too madame but it is not too late there is still time to find safety at the french court eleanor said nothing nicholas de chauvigny glanced in her direction then scowled at de maingot and porteclie de mauze i fear it is too late he said better our lady should seek shelter with geoffrey de rancon at taillebourg it will not fall to the english king there is no more formidable stronghold in all of poitou both men began to argue with him insisting eleanors only chance lay in flight she appeared to be listening but it was a pose her thoughts had begun to wander for she knew how meaningless their argument was nicholas was right she had waited too long but she did not think taillebourg was the sanctuary that nicholas did yes it was said to be impregnable but shed lost track of the impregnable castles taken by her husband over the years once he learned where she wasand he would for she did not doubt his agents had her under surveillancehe would descend upon taillebourg like the wrath of god almighty her chances were better on the back roads of poitou if she could slip undetected from poitiers she ought to be able to reach safety in french territory it would be a stroke of incredibly bad luck to run into harrys men and luck had always been on her side but she did not want to flee not to the french court never there i will give you my decision on the morrow she said pleasing no one indifferent to their disapproval they withdrew with obvious reluctance only saldebreuil de sanzay dared to remainas shed known he would i understand why you are loath to leave poitiers is your capital city the very heartbeat of your realm yours has been a life in exile my lady now that youve finally come home it is only to be expected that you do not want to turn your back upon it eleanor turned regarding him with the shadow of a smile you know me saldebreuil mayhap too well scriptures say that the heart of kings should be unsearchable i know too madame that more than love of your homeland holds you here pride binds you as tightly as any chains could her eyes narrowed taking on a warning glint of green choose your words with care my old friend even you can misspeak by speaking the truth he asked gently and she was the first to look away unable to deny the abiding affection in that quiet query i understand why you do not want to seek refuge at the french kings court louis will make you welcome and his smile will be so smug that you might well choke on it it will be no easy thing to ask for his protection i know that but you must ask yourself what you have greater cause to fear louis capets condescension or harry fitz empresss wrath eleanor did not reply he had his answer though in the slumping of her shoulders in her silence i will make the necessary arrangements for your departure he said and if she could not bring herself to acquiesce neither could she gainsay him she did not move listening to the familiar sound of his footsteps as he limped toward the door only after hed gone did she sit down wearily upon the closest coffer damn you harry she whispered and damn you louis damn you both to hell everlasting constance had begun to drum her fingers on the table but it did nothing to stir alys into action she continued to stare down at the chessboard her brow furrowing when she finally reached out constance gave an exasperated sigh you cannot do that alys a queen can only move diagonally alys was unfazed by her error sorry she said pulling her queen back i forgot id rather play queek or tables anyway chess is boring chess makes you think since constance believed that alys thought as little as possible she was not surprised that the other girl should find the game so unappealing she kept the sarcasm to herself though she was only twelve but shed learned at an early age that candor was an indulgence she could ill afford alys resumed her interminable study of the chessboard and constance sighed again but the wait proved worth it as alyss eventual move placed her queen in peril constance hid a smile was making ready to pounce when the door opened and the fleshandblood queen entered alys jumped up and ran to greet eleanor fawning over her constance thought tartly as she rose and dropped a perfunctory curtsy eleanor came forward into the chamber her gaze sweeping past the girls to search the shadows i was hoping that joanna would be here she said sounding disappointed no one has been able to find her all afternoon do either of you know where she might have gone constance shook her head but alys was more helpful try the gardens the gardens have already been searched alys smiled did they search the yew tree joanna likes to climb into it and hide from the world eleanor smiled too for shed climbed her share of trees in her own childhood constance watched in disapproval as she thanked alys and departed alys reclaimed her seat at the chessboard then glanced up and saw the other girls face what why are you glaring at me like that why did you give away joannas secret hideaway alys looked at the other girl in surprise since when are you such friends with joanna you always say she is a pest too young to bother with constance shrugged adults were the enemy and children had so little power that their secrets were to be safeguarded at all costs but she did not expect alys to understand that it is my move she said and captured alyss queen alys did not seem to notice she was regarding constance with curiosity you do not like the queen do you she said unexpectedly why not shes always been kind to you constances temper flared and she had to bite her lip to keep the angry words from escaping kind only a fool like alys would think she should be grateful to the people whod stolen her birthright eleanors whoreson husband had made a puppet of her father duke conan then forced conan to abdicate in her favor so she could be betrothed to his son geoffrey they meant to make brittany an angevin fief staking their claims in her marriage bed there was nothing she could do about it but by the rood she did not have to like it alys was still staring at her you do not like any of them do you when constance did not reply she smiled such a pity then that you must marry geoffrey is it not constance stared back for there was unmistakable malice in the other girls sugared sympathy and she suddenly realized that alys did not like her any more than she liked alys a november garden was often a bleak place but the poitevin winter had been mild so far and there were still splashes of color flowers still blooming in defiance of the season eleanor moved quietly along the pathway one of her greyhounds trailing at her heels the yew tree had been young when her grandfather had ruled in poitou and reached proudly toward the heavens she had to tilt her head to see its top branches feeling a twinge of pride that her daughter dared to scale such heights she gazed up into the cloud of evergreen and said joanna it is your mother climb down so we may talk there was a moment of silence and she began to doubt alyss information but then joannas head poked out framed by lush greenery she was twenty feet off the ground she showed no unease though and nimbly scrambled down to lower branches landing on her feet like a cat her coppery curls were dusted with needles and there was a dirt smear across her nose another on her chin her eyes looked very green in the fading light as they searched her mothers face am i in trouble maman eleanor supposed she should be disciplined for risking broken bones and ripping her skirt but she hadnt the heart to scold the girl why should she be punished for having a boys spirit and daring no lass you do remember though that yew tree seeds are poisonous i know that joanna said and eleanor stifled a smile for that confident young voice could have been hers forty years ago leading the child toward a nearby bench she hesitated for shed been loath to have this conversation had been putting it off as long as possible i wanted to tell you joanna that i will be going away for a while where paris adding casually i want to see your brothers as if this would be a pleasure trip joanna was not deceived though keeping those green eyes on her mothers face she said you are running away from papa eleanor was momentarily at a loss shed tried to shield joanna from her involvement in the plot against henry warning servants and attendants and even constance and alys to guard their conversation in the childs hearing shed known it was unrealistic to expect her daughter to remain in ignorance but shed been stung by mauds accusations that shed turned their sons against henry and was determined that no such accusation could be made about joanna but even before she saw the reproach in joannas eyes she knew shed made the wrong decision i am sorry joanna for trying to keep the truth from you i ought to have been candid with you from the first but you are so young i am eight now maman yes you are but i know you love your father and i did not want you to feel that you had to choose between us you are very dear to us both and nothing will change that i know hal and richard have been unhappy with papa for a long time richard says he never listens that he is as stubborn as a balky mule joanna ducked her head staring down at her lap and eleanor resisted the impulse to brush the yew needles from her hair so youyou took their side maman yes joanna i did but your father has led an army into poitou and my council has advised me to leave poitiers for now the girl looked up then would papa hurt you she met eleanors eyes steadily but there was a quaver in her voice and eleanor reached out covered her daughters hand with her own no he would not she said choosing her words with care but he is very angry with me because i supported our sons in their quarrel and i prefer not to have a confrontation just yet we think it is for the best that i join your brothers in paris but i do not expect to be gone for long i will be back here ere you know it lass joanna had a disconcertingly direct gaze what will happen after that i expect that the french king and your brothers will prevail and your father will come to terms with them eleanor studied joanna closely unable to tell if she believed it but then eleanor was not sure if she believed it herself well eleanor asked what do you think she turned in a circle and saldebreuil smiled at her transformation she was dressed as a knight complete with sword and scabbard her hair pinned up under a cowled hood id not have recognized you he assured her thinking that she still had very shapely legs revealed now in closefitting bright blue hose eleanor was looking admiringly at her soft leather ankle boots we had trouble finding a mans boots small enough to fit my feet until i tried on an old pair of geoffreys she liked the freedom of her new clothes it was much easier to move unhampered by long skirts she would have to get used to the unaccustomed heft of the sword at her hip but she would be spared the weight of chain mail since most knights did not wear their hauberks while on the road saldebreuils smile had faded and his dark eyes were somber trying to reassure him she evoked a smile of her own saying playfully i think i make a rather handsome man do i not and this ought to be a foolproof way to sneak out of the city undetected by harrys spies theyll never expect me to don male disguise after all indeed not he affirmed striving to sound hearty and confident he did think her ruse would enable her to escape her husbands agents he wished she would have more men with her though theyd decided that it would be better to travel with a small escort in order to pass as ordinary travelers and he agreed that made sense but he would not be going with her as his joint evil had flared up again making riding painful and he knew he would worry and fret until he received word of her safe arrival in paris eleanor picked up a mirror to check her camouflage one last time satisfied she turned back to him with a smile and he said softly go with god madame they looked at each other and then eleanor said propriety be damned and gave him a quick hug before heading for the door saldebreuil went to the window thrusting open the shutters the dawn sky was the shade of soft pearl a few night stars still glimmering to the west the air was chill but dry it would be a good day for travel eleanors escort was below in the bailey waiting for her she soon emerged pausing to give her palfrey an affectionate pat on the nose before using a horse block to swing into the saddle glancing up toward the window she gave saldebreuil a jaunty wave he waved back but with a sense of foreboding and he remained at his post long after shed ridden out his vigil had begun eleanor was accompanied by nicholas de chauvigny and two of her household knights the rest of her bodyguards were porteclie de mauzes men as he had claimed the honor of escorting her to paris their pace was too swift for conversation but eleanor could see that they were nervous casting frequent glances over their shoulders measuring the progress of the sun on its westward arc swiveling their heads at every rustling in the underbrush she did not share their unease confident that the greatest danger was already past once theyd evaded her husbands spies and slipped out of poitiers the odds were very much in her favor that shed reach safety in french territory it was not the journey that troubled her it was the destination she loathed the very thought of being indebted to louis and she knew all too well how it would gratify him to give her refuge at his court for she had no illusions about their dubious partnership hers were allies of expediency and as eager as theyd been to join forces with the duchess of aquitaine they were likely now to see her as a frightened woman fleeing her husbands just rage by late afternoon they were deep in touraine eleanors men were showing signs of increasing strain for this was a land congested with castles most of them under henrys control and these fortresses must be given a wide berth going downstream to avoid bridore castle they forded the river indre in late afternoon and were soon swallowed up by the vast forest of loches they were not far now from their destination planning to pass the night at saintetrinite de grandmont villiers a small priory hidden away in the midst of loches forest theyd chosen it for its isolation but eleanor derived a secret satisfaction from that choice for the priory had been founded by henry hed always favored the austere order of grandmont a partiality eleanor did not share the grandmontines scorned females as sinful daughters of eve reluctant even to allow them to enter their churches and eleanor took malicious amusement in the knowledge that she would be sheltering at this male sanctuary outwitting both her husband and his womenhating monks as soon as they entered the woods they lost the light although many trees had been stripped bare a heavy growth of evergreens brush and entwined branches formed a canopy that the wan november sun could not penetrate and they rode into an early dusk the path was narrow and their horses hooves crunched upon a carpeting of brittle brown leaves squirrels darted along overhanging boughs and once they startled a fox as they rounded a bend in the road they caught just a blur of red fur as it faded back into the shadows men were usually skittish about such dark forest trails for many believed that demons ghosts and revenants lurked in the gloom and all knew that outlaws did but eleanors knights welcomed the camouflage feeling more vulnerable out on the kings roads knowing that henrys army was on the prowl they were less enthusiastic about their stay at the grandmontine priory for the order was renowned for its asceticism and selfdenial even forbidding the possession of livestock and the men knew that meant a meager meal awaited them listening to their glum speculation about that paltry supper eleanor had to smile she did not begrudge them their grumbling both men hadlike nicholasbeen in her service for years and had volunteered for this highrisk mission the monks hospitality would likely be an even greater privation for her accustomed as she was to the best their world had to offer but she did not care if they were fed bread and water wanting only to stretch out on a bed in the guest hall and ease her aching muscles shed ridden astride occasionally in the past but never for such a lengthy journey and although she would never have admitted it to nicholas or porteclie she was very tired gods legs riding at eleanors side porteclie de mauze swore suddenly and then signaled for a halt my horse has gone lame he exclaimed what wretched luck with us so close to the priory swinging from the saddle he began to examine his stallions right foreleg as the other men drew rein milling about on the pathway until he told them to dismount suppressing a sigh eleanor slid from the saddle too not waiting for nicholass assistance theyd stopped at a crossroads another winding trail snaking off to their left in a nearby copse of trees was a small thatched hut pointing it out to eleanor nicholas said that a celebrated recluse dwelled there an ancient known as bernard the hermit hed once earned his keep by guiding travelers through the forest although he was now too old to venture far from his hut but he was admired for his piety and godly way of life and local people saw to it that he didnt starve eleanor glanced over at that shabby little hut unable to comprehend why anyone of sound mind would deliberately choose to live like that alone and impoverished but when nicholas started toward the cottage she followed welcoming a chance to walk off her stiffness the door was ajar and after calling out politely nicholas pushed it open he came back out almost at once there is no one inside he reported sounding disappointed i hope he has not died porteclie was still examining his horses hoof and eleanor moved in his direction with nicholas trailing behind it was then that her palfrey lifted his head ears pricking and snorted gerard the elder of eleanors knights was listening too quickly giving the alert riders are coming he warned gesturing toward the second road that angled off toward the west they had not encountered many travelers on the road today prudent people tried to keep to their own hearths during times of war eleanor tensed instinctively before common sense reasserted itself annoyed that she should be susceptible to such phantom fears she nonetheless shifted so that she was halfhidden by her horse for she knew that her disguise would not bear close inspection nicholas had tensed too his hand dropping to the hilt of his sword as the riders approached he glanced toward porteclie waiting for the older man to take charge when porteclie neither moved nor spoke nicholas shot him an aggrieved reproachful look and then stepped forward to greet them good morrow his stomach muscles tightened as he saw how badly outnumbered they were by these new arrivals but he forced a cheerful smile saying as blandly as he could a fine day for travel no have you come far no not farfrom loches the speaker was a darkhaired man in his early thirties clad in a good wool mantle with a quick smile and a relaxed manner he looked eminently respectable and quite reassuring but nicholass queasy stomach lurched again for loches was one of henrys most formidable strongholds i am sir yves des roches plucking the names out of the air nicholas halfturned so that he could glare at porteclie who should have been their spokesman this is my lord porteclie de mauze were on our way to the abbey at cormery the strangers eyes flicked toward porteclie but without interest his gaze moving from face to face he did not pause until he found eleanor shed drawn her hood forward to shadow her face careful to keep on the far side of her palfrey but he did not hesitate welcome to touraine madame he doffed his cap in a deferential gesture that somehow seemed sincere despite the incongruity of the circumstances i am sir herve de monbazon the new provost of loches we have been awaiting your arrival since nones rang had begun to fear that youd chosen another route shock rendered eleanor speechless and then she swung around to confront porteclie even as her eyes swept from the hermits hut to his supposedly lame stallion her heart was unwilling to accept what her head was telling her for porteclie de mauze was one of her most steadfast barons a distant cousin on her fathers side of the family but as she looked into his face she saw the ugly truth written in his ducked head his averted eyes and his silence you judas nicholas had reached the same appalled conclusion and lunged for porteclies throat as they crashed to the ground eleanors two knights drew their swords urging her to flee when shed been ambushed by the de lusignans five years ago william marshal and his uncle the earl of salisbury had done the same offering up their lives for her safety the earl had died and will had been wounded and captured but their blood had bought her the time she needed to escape now though there was nowhere to run and even as she struggled with the enormity of this betrayal she saw the futility of resistance no she cried sharply ill have no bloodshed will have no men dying in vain lower your swordsnow they hesitated and then slowly obeyed porteclies knights stood rooted no one moving not even to come to their lords aid it was easy for eleanor to tell which ones had been in the know and which had not for the latter looked stunned and the former either grim or shamefaced the provost had swiftly dismounted and ordered two of the men to separate nicholas and porteclie who were rolling about in the dirt locked in a death grip when they were pulled apart porteclie stayed down gulping for air his throat scratched and bruised already showing clear imprints of nicholass clutching fingers nicholas was bleeding from a deep cut to his leg slashed by one of porteclies spurs when eleanor told him to surrender his sword he looked at her in anguish dark eyes glittering with blinkedback tears but he did as she bade offered his weapon to the provost before limping over to stand protectively at her side herve de monbazon passed nicholass sword to one of his men if you will madame he said politely it was a moment before she realized he wanted her own sword unbuckling the scabbard she handed it to him thank you nowmay i help you to mount he asked still so politely that she wanted to slap him did he think that his feigned courtesy could make this anything but what it was he might act as if she was his queen but she was his captive and they both knew it but if he could pretend that this was a perfectly ordinary encounter then by god so could she be sure to bring my sumpter horse she said in the brusque tones of one who never doubted her orders would be obeyed it carries my clothes when he cupped his hands she stepped into them and swung up into the saddle inclining her head in aloof acknowledgment of his help when he ordered her men to be bound before they mounted their horses she voiced no protest knowing it would be futile when he snapped a leather lead upon her palfreys bridle she kept silent staring straight ahead as if his action was of no interest to her and when they rode off she never looked back at porteclie de mauze standing with his men by the side of the road eleanor had never liked loches castle situated upon a rocky outcrop far above the river indre its stark rectangular shape was silhouetted ominously against the evening sky made of greywhite freestone it reminded her of the tower of londons great keep and shed never liked that stronghold either lochess ancient donjonmore than one hundred twenty feet high with walls nine feet thick its few windows not much bigger than arrow slitsproclaimed that this was a wartime fortress not a royal residence it had been built by one of henrys more infamous ancestors fulk nerra in the eleventh century and shed found it to be utterly lacking in comfort during her infrequent visits but if it had always seemed primitive to her there was something almost sinister about it now looming out of the darkness like some hulking beast of prey they entered the bailey through the porte royale gatehouse were soon being ushered into the great hall that occupied the second story of the keep unlike the provost the man standing by the smoking hearth was well known to eleanor maurice de craon was the same age as her husband he was of average height like henry and like henry he gave the impression of being larger than he actually was with a wrestlers wellmuscled build and stocky legs only in coloring did he differ from his sovereign for he was as swarthy as henry was fair eleanors heart sank at the sight of him for maurice de craon was one of henrys intimates a powerful angevin baron and a battle commander of some note his presence at loches showed how important her capture was to her wrathful husband raising her chin she moved toward him with all the hauteur at her command my lord de craon madame if eleanors voice had been coolly clipped his dripped with icicles his eyes were almost black they took in her appearance with a disdain he did not bother to conceal i am surprised that sir herve was able to recognize you you could hardly look less queenly could you when nicholas bristled eleanor shook her head almost imperceptibly but i am the queen she said and youd do well to remember that one of my men has a wound in need of tending i wish him to be seen by a doctor without delay do you indeed wellif wishes were horses beggars would ride turning he gestured toward two of his men take these prisoners down to the dungeon adding without delay with a mocking glance over his shoulder at eleanor id have thought you had better breeding than that my lord only a churl would not know that men of sir nicholass rank are to be well treated until their ransoms can be arranged ransom he echoed and laughed what a droll wit you have madame but if you are so fretful about their wellbeing mayhap you should join them in the dungeon so that you can look after them yourself eleanor caught her breath quickly reached out to still nicholass outraged protest but it was easier to control nicholass anger than her own temper for shed had little practice in biting back intemperate words she opened her mouth to throw down a challenge that might well have gotten her incarcerated with her men before she could defy maurice de craon though sir herve de monbazon stepped between them may we have a few words in private my lord he asked smoothly favoring maurice with the same disarming smile that hed turned upon eleanor maurice did not seem pleased by his intervention but after a brief hesitation he nodded and followed the provost toward the stairwell in the east wall eleanor gave nicholas a critical scrutiny her eyes flicking from his pallid face to his bloodstained chausses and boot come with me she said taking his arm and steering him toward the closest bench you too she directed her other knights gerard and guyon once the three men were seated she glanced around the hall finding what she sought when she noticed a plate of bread and cheese on a nearby trestle table bringing it back to them she directed nicholas to hold out his bound wrists and cut the rope with the bread knife then did the same for gerard and guyon she was watched all the while by the other men in the hall but while some of them murmured among themselves none attempted to stop her and whenever she met an individuals gaze he quickly looked away when the door opened she stiffened warily as did her knights but the man emerging from the stairwell was not maurice de craon the new arrival was an elderly priest who stared at eleanor with round eyes and open mouth like the others in the hall he seemed hesitant but after an irresolute moment he gripped his cane firmly and hobbled toward her madame you are truly here do you remember me like henry eleanor had been blessed with a remarkable memory and like him shed taken pains to cultivate the talent for a prince that was a survival skill now as she studied the priest it stood her in good stead father lucas she said and smiled of course i remember you you were very helpful when that baby was found abandoned on the loches road pleased color rose in his cheeks it was my pleasure to serve you my lady i need your help again father lucas this is sir nicholas de chauvigny a knight of my household as you can see he has a leg injury that ought to be cleaned and treated as soon as possible will you take care of that for me he did not answer immediately casting a revealing glance over his shoulder toward the stairwell but then he straightened his shoulders and nodded emphatically indeed i will madame while hed turned away to summon a servant eleanor snatched up the bread and cheese and passed it to her men hide this in your tunics she said i rather doubt that maurice de craon will prove to be a generous openhanded host the priest was soon back with a basin of water and a small jar of ointment nicholas was scandalized when eleanor reached for the salve and insisted that he could clean the wound by himself amused in spite of herself by his outraged sense of decorum eleanor turned the task over to gerard the priests unease was becoming more and more apparent his gaze straying often to the stairwell madame lowering his voice until it was barely audible he said hurriedly i was praying in the chapel must have dosed off for i was awakened of a sudden by voices it was lord maurice and sir herve i suppose theyd sought out the chapel for privacy they were arguing about you my lady the lord thought you ought to be treated as a rebel but the provost insisted it was wiser to treat you as a highborn hostage lord maurice said hed been with the king at rouen when he learned of youryour betrayal his words madame not mine he said the king was grievously hurt by your actions that he would want you punished not coddled sir herve said that they must not forget how unpredictable the king could be as changeable as the winds he advised lord maurice to tread carefully on such unsteady ground his last words came in a rush with another nervous look over his shoulder i do not know which of them will prevail my lady it will depend upon what they think the king wants done with you yes eleanor said softly that is the question is it not one not even she could answer as well as she knew her husband now that she was in his power what would harry do when maurice de craon led her toward the stairwell eleanor felt a surge of relief when they headed up not down so it was not to be the dungeon for all her bravado she did not want to be thrust into a damp dark cell when they reached the third floor maurice turned to the right not the left and a grim smile flickered across her lips maurice had deemed her unworthy of sleeping in the kings bed instead she was to be held in the smaller more spartan guest chamber theyd been preceded by servants who made haste to light an oil lamp and pulled back the bed hangings sir herve soon followed accompanied by another servant carrying eleanors coffer the sight of it was a welcome one for she wanted her own clothes shed not liked the way the men in the hall had stared at her legs and ankles but then maurice made a snide comment about her male garb saying that hed had her coffer brought up so she could change straightaway out of her unseemly attire and she immediately considered wearing her knights garments until they hung on her in rags does my appearance disturb you my lord alas i am desolated by your disapproval she said so sardonically that his mouth tightened and she could see the muscles clench along his jawline striding to the door he paused giving her a look of appraisal that was neither friendly nor flattering it is true you do not have to answer to me he said coldly but you are answerable to the lord king your husband not waiting for her response he closed the door with a finality that was almost as disquieting as his words had been a silence settled over the room the servants quickly and selfconsciously finished their tasks and fled leaving eleanor alone with the provost he seemed to be debating whether to speak or not at last said almost apologetically lord maurice is plainspoken but if he lacks the polished manners of a courtier he is a good man for all that my lady i hope you will not hold his rudeness against him eleanor was no longer so put off by his silken civility not after exposure to the angevin barons overt hostility as it happens she said i understand maurice better than you think i do sir herve he recently wed isabel of meulan and she is a first cousin of robert beaumont the rebel earl of leicester his engaging smile vanished you mean he feels the need to curry favor with the king now to prove that his loyalty has not been infected by the beaumont heresy you are wrong madame his outrage is bona fide and many share it he hesitated as if to say more instead bowed and made a discreet departure after a few moments eleanor inspected the room it lacked the fireplace and private latrine of the kings chamber but as prisons go it was not so bad theyd not provided a brazier for heat but winters in the loire valley were not severe and there seemed to be an adequate pile of blankets on the bed she wandered aimlessly from the bed to the small shuttered window back again and then started when a soft knock sounded at the door come in she said resolutely determined to keep up a bold front and a young man entered with a wooden tray he set the tray upon the trestle table sketched an awkward obeisance and hastily backed toward the door once he was gone eleanor moved to the table looking at her meal the food was plain nothing fancy not the sort of dishes to grace the royal table but it was plentiful shed not go hungry and she did not know if that would be true for nicholas and her knights although shed not eaten for many hours she could muster up no appetite picking up the wine cup she took a tentative swallow grimaced at the taste and set it down she froze then having caught the shuffle of footsteps in the stairwell holding her breath as she waited for the door to open it didnt the footsteps paused and then she heard the click of a key being turned in the lock it was not loud but it seemed to echo in the silence until there was no other sound in her world but that metallic clink and the thudding of her heart it was only then that the full reality of her plight hit home slumping down on the bed she buried her face in her hands and gave way to despair chapter fourteen december paris france when hals lashes flickered marguerite leaned over and kissed his cheek brushing his skin as lightly as a butterflys wings opening his eyes he smiled drowsily is it dawn yet the sun has been up for hours you are such a sluggard she chided fondly still in bed at this time of dayfor shame there are two of us in this bed he pointed out so you must be a sluggard too i could not get up she insisted you were sleeping on my hair propping himself up on his elbow hal saw that her long blond tresses had indeed been caught under his arm welli can think of several good reasons to remain abed despite the hour sliding his hand up from her waist he cupped her breast here is one ah and here is another marguerite sighed with pleasure but two could play that game i do believe youre right she purred reaching out to stroke his thigh i think ive found another one hals eyes half closed by god you have he said and rolled over on top of her just as a loud pounding began swearing he called for his squire thierry tell whoever it is to go away tell them im sleeping tell them im dead marguerite began to giggle until he stopped her laughter with his mouth they were too absorbed in each other to pay any heed to the sounds beyond their bed footsteps an opening door a murmur of voices and then a smothered protest my lord you cannot come in but they were rudely brought back to reality when the bed hangings were suddenly jerked open marguerite gave a squeak and dived under the covers hal sat up his temper flaring at the sight of his leastloved brother hellfire and damnation get out of here richard hes taken her some of hals annoyance ebbed in the face of richards agitation who what are you talking about our mother she has fallen into his hands is being held prisoner in one of his angevin strongholds hal blinked staring at his brother in disbelief that could not be true the lord god would never let that happen he was suddenly sorry hed quaffed so much wine the night before for his thinking was muddled that cannot be right you must have heard a rumor gossip use your head hal why else would i be in your bedchamber at such an hour for the pleasure of your company hal found himself at a loss for words and marguerite reemerged from the blankets pulling them modestly up to her chin even as she put her arm around his shoulders i am so sorry sweetheart but you must not despair my father will move heaven and earth to rescue her richard rolled his eyes thinking that they were a well matched pair both as simpleminded as sheep hal knew that marguerite was only trying to comfort him he did not have as much faith in her father though as hed had before verneuil he was still confused for hed been torn from his wifes arms into a waking nightmare without any warning it was not fair men should have time to come to terms with such calamitous happenings his brother was waiting impatiently and he threw the covers back swinging his legs over the side of the bed but then he paused richardwhat can we do it was a moment of odd role reversal as if he were the younger brother not the elder richard usually had answers for everything but not this time he hesitated and hal felt a chill realizing that richard did not know what to do any more than he did theyd gathered in the french kings palace were awaiting him in a private chamber overlooking the river seine raoul de faye had wandered restlessly to a window and when he opened the shutters he looked out upon a scene as bleak and cheerless as his mood the city seemed painted in shades of grey with looming storm clouds a sky darkening with an early dusk the river a dull leaden color its choppy surface pelted with icy rain drops hed let a blast of cold air into the room and when the others began to complain he closed the shutters and returned to his seat he was familiar with every man in the chamber for they were all pillars of the french kings court seated closest to the hearth was the elderly maurice de sully bishop of paris beside him sat louiss younger brother the archbishop of rheims while the youngest of the brothers the perpetually discontented robert count of dreux was sprawled on a bench by himself the kings two sonsinlaw henri count of champagne and thibault count of blois were whispering together across the table while their younger sibling etienne count of sancerre was slouched low in his seat looking bored simon de montfort count of evreux was amusing himself by flipping a coin in the air and trying to coax raouls brother hugh into wagering upon the outcome since de montfort was known for his sharp dealings hugh was prudently refusing his blandishments and sitting on a cushioned settle were raouls three greatnephews the ones most affected by the momentous news out of poitou raouls gaze focused thoughtfully upon them geoffreys face was unrevealing he was strangely guarded for one so young and raoul realized that he never knew what geoffrey was thinking that was certainly not true with hal whose face served as a mirror to his soul his dismay was evident to anyone with eyes to see and richard was smoldering a fire that had burned down but not out he kept casting aggrieved glances toward the door as if willing louis to make his appearance louis finally swept into the room flanked by his clerk and chaplain waving the others back to their seats as they rose he stopped by eleanors sons and squeezed hals shoulder in an affectionate gesture of support taking a chair at the head of the table he sighed audibly like a man with too many burdens to bear and then looked toward raoul this is indeed sorrowful tidings what do we know for certes and what is just conjecture the queens constable sent a courier to me late last night on the friday before advent she left poitiers heading for chartres and then paris she was waylaid near loches and taken into custody by the kings men she was being escorted by one of her poitevin barons porteclie de mauze and what we know comes from him he told saldebreuil that they were ambushed in the forest that they were taken by surprise and so greatly outnumbered that they could not resist so he says raouls mouth twitched in a mirthless smile that conveyed without words both his own skepticism and saldebreuils richard was more forthright i think his story stinks like threedayold mackerel he told saldebreuil that my mother must have been betrayed and even suggested a few likely suspects but in any hunt for the judas wed do well to start with him he lets his liege lady be taken without lifting a finger to stop it and then he and all his men are set free to continue on their way does he take us for utter fools a great pity louis said somberly may the almighty keep her safe in her time of travail i am sure the almighty will look after her my lord king raoul leaned forward his eyes locking upon the french kings face but prayers will not set her free we need to make plans to decide how best to accomplish that louis glanced around at his nobles as if seeking a consensus finding what he sought on their faces he looked at raoul and slowly sadly shook his head alas he said there is nothing we can do raoul felt no real surprise just a surge of outrage richard and hal shared it the former sprang to his feet as the latter cried out incredulously what are you saying that we leave her to rot in one of his dungeons i very much doubt that she is in a dungeon lad your father is not a brute is not likely to maltreat the mother of his children raoul was not impressed by louiss reassurances saw that neither were his young kinsmen but none of eleanors allies were going to rescue her most men even those whod been bedazzled by her beauty did not approve of her hed long known that to be true he suspected that eleanor knew it too shed never cared though what others thought shed never had tountil now i know this is not what you want to hear the count of champagne said quietly and with enough sincere sympathy in his voice to still their protests i was sorely distressed to hear of her capture for i know how it will grieve my wife it is true she has not seen the queen since childhood but she would never want to see her mother in such dire straits yet there truly is nothing we can do we do not even know where she is being held she could be at loches or have been moved to chinon by now she could even be on her way to england louis did not appreciate the reminder that his daughter marie was also eleanors flesh and blood or the suggestion that she might feel some emotional attachment to her mother for hed done his best to obliterate eleanors memories from marie and alixs lives hed been willing to marry marguerite to eleanors son if that would make her queen of england one day but that was statecraft this was personal and it hurt to learn that marie was still under eleanors infernal spell he welcomed count henris support though and he said quickly the count speaks true i would like nothing more than to ride to your mothers rescue would that it were possible it is not hal looked as if hed been slapped in the face i cannot accept that he cried i cannot and then he turned as they all did to stare at his brother for richard was stalking toward the door he jerked it open and then swung around when louis called out his name sharply demanding to know what he meant to do i mean he said to return to poitiers and take command of the rebellion there may be nothing you can do my lord king and in his mouth that respectful term of address sounded like the foulest of insults but i am going to win this war and free my mother and without waiting for the kings response much less his permission he slammed out of the chamber hal had started to rise then slumped back on the settle geoffrey kept silent watching them all with alert bluegrey eyes that gave away nothing color was staining louiss cheeks but he made an effort to conceal his anger lord save us from the foolishness of the very young he said with what he hoped was a wry indulgent smile and the other men began to murmur their agreement all but raoul who decided it was time to burn his bridges getting to his feet without haste he looked directly at the man once wed to his niece manhood is not measured in years my liege some reach it at an early age whilst othersothers never reach it at all and he turned then on his heel followed after richard without looking back eleanor had passed only two days at loches before being taken to chinon there she was lodged in an upper chamber of the tour du moulin instead of the royal apartments along the south wall her gaolers had apparently decided that she was to be denied luxuries but not comfort until they heard otherwise from the king soon after her arrival at chinon maurice de craon had ridden away presumably to consult with henry about her fate she half expected her husband to return with the angevin baron and was relieved when he did not but she was soon on the move again riding northwest under heavy guard she refused to ask maurice any questions just as she refused to complain about the rapid pace and long hours in the saddle from chinon to angers the next day on to laval then north to the great fortress of domfront where shed given birth to her daughter and namesake leonora twelve years earlier they were covering more than forty miles a day which was a considerable distance for winter travel and she suffered from blisters and saddle sores and cramped muscles all of which she endured in stubborn silence by now she thought she knew where they were heading either to falaise or to the port of barfleur the latter destination would mean that she was being taken to england and if that were so she could only cry aloud with job where is now my hope falaise was preferable to england but not by much chinon had been the repository of good memories happier times and it was less than forty miles from poitiers falaise was deep in the heart of normandy a royal castle but also a royal prison a fortress of war in a windswept inhospitable land where shed find few friends falaise too was not a place where hope could flourish from domfront they headed northeast and by dusk they were within sight of the towering twin keeps of the ancient stronghold of falaise looking as if it had been carved from the steep cliffs that overshadowed the marshes and ravines of the river ante as thankful as she was to have reached the end of her journey eleanor could not suppress a shiver as she gazed up at those grim foreboding walls at falaise she was once more treated with courtesy not deference she was being held in a small chamber in the keep lit only by a single shuttered window heated by a charcoal brazier it was not suitable accommodations for the queen of england but she suspected it was preferable to the lodgings of the other royal prisoner the hapless earl of chester she was neither hungry nor cold she was isolated though cut off from the normal rhythms and routines of castle life her only contacts with the servants who brought her meals and tidied up her room never before had she been deprived of women attendants to assist her in dressing and to keep her company she missed her dogs missed her books missed the music that had echoed throughout the halls of her poitiers palace she was left alone with her own thoughts and they were not pleasant ones at loches and chinon she had retreated behind her court mask showing her gaolers the queen never the woman aloof and remote shed dared them to breach the invisible wall shed erected around herself clothed in pride as men rode off to war in chain mail but at falaise she changed her tactics for now that the shock of her seizure was wearing off she realized that her selfimposed solitude was not serving her interests in her youth shed been an accomplished flirt her mirror had not yet become her enemy but she was no longer young after studying her guards with care she finally selected a lanky gangling boy not much older than her sons it had taken little effort to gain perrins good will required no more than a few smiles and the light teasing tone that she used with richard perrin was soon her unwitting accomplice and her conduit sharing with her his news gossip and rumors from perrin she learned that on the day of her capture her husband had entered the city of vendome in triumph having restored the count to power and vanquished his rebellious son she learned that the earl of leicester and his rebel countess had been sent from england and were now sharing her confinement at falaise but perrin could tell her nothing of what was happening in her own domains what had that whoreson porteclie told them did her poitevins know that she had been seized by harrys men did they think she was dead or had she just vanished her disappearance cloaked in mystery her fate unknown five days after her arrival at falaise eleanor awoke to find winter had laid claim to normandy during the night opening the shutters she stood at the window gazing down upon the snowcoated roofs and steep icy streets of the village the air was cold colder than in poitiers and the wind carried the damp chill of the sea for they were less than thirty miles from the coast she was still at the window when a deferential knock sounded and perrin entered with a traybread cheese and wine to break her fast she closed the shutters smiling to see a small branch of holly beside her wine cup the day before the boy had brought a fragrant sprig of winter marjoram doubtless stolen from the castle herb gardens the holly was a dark shade of emerald festooned with bright red berries a vivid flash of color midst the drabness of her confinement but her smile faded as she glanced over at perrin for he was visibly perturbed my lady he hesitated and then blurted out one of the sergeants told me that the king will be holding his christmas court at caen i see as their eyes met they shared the same understanding caen was twenty miles north of falaise her day of reckoning was coming sooner than she expected after perrin had departed eleanor went back to bed propping a pillow behind her she shut her eyes and tried to think calmly objectively she truly did not know what to expect her husband had been remarkably lenient with rebels in the past for he never seemed to take it personally because he saw their rebellions in political terms his detachment allowed him to forgive his adversaries in the interest of the greater good a stable peaceful kingdom the clemency hed accorded the breton lords was not unusual for him unlike most men he could be dispassionate about treachery the only time hed shown himself to be vengeful or vindictive was the one time that hed seen the betrayal as personalwith thomas becket eleanor had rarely been so cold she could feel goose bumps rising on her skin even after shed burrowed under the blankets few betrayals could be more personal than that of a wife and a queen she did not think her life was in danger it was true that one of henrys more notorious ancestors the brutal fulk nerra had burned his wife at the stake for the crime of adultery that had occurred almost two hundred years ago though and the unfortunate woman had not been a ruler in her own right as henrys wife she was at his mercy errant or unwanted wives could be banished to nunneries shut up in remote castles meet untimely convenient deaths and few would protest but the duchess of aquitaine could not just disappear her vassals her lords and barons would demand answers so would her sons logic told her that the worst she had to fear was imprisonment and judging by the conditions at falaise it would not be a harsh confinement when maurice de craon had returned to chinon and escorted her to falaise he was obviously acting under henrys orders if hed wanted her cast into a dungeon it would have been done already logic also told her that she need not fear the violence that so many women must suffer in silence theirs was a world in which both church and society sanctioned a husbands right to discipline his wayward wife a woman who is not under the headship of the husband violates the condition of nature the mandate of the apostle and the law of scripture the archbishop of rouens bitter rebuke had been a blunt summary of a womans subordinate role in the eyes of the almighty and she was wed to a king a man known for his fiery temper but in more than twenty years of marriage he had never raised his hand to her shed long ago concluded that she owed henrys forbearance to his family history his parents marriage had been as turbulent as it was wretched it had been doomed from the first for maude was twentyfive the beautiful and imperious widow of the holy roman emperor and geoffrey was fifteen a spirited spoiled youth used to getting his own way she had not wanted the marriage but her father had given her no choice after being an empress maude felt it was demeaning to be a mere countess and she was outraged to find herself yoked to a headstrong boy geoffrey was accustomed to females who were compliant and adoring for he was wealthy highborn and so handsome that he was called geoffrey le bel he was not prepared for a wife who was worldly alluring and disdainful and hed soon begun lashing out with his fists when he decided that hed had enough and sent her home to her father shed found no sympathy at the english court the old english king cared nothing for her bruises and humiliation blamed her for her marital woes and persuaded geoffrey to take her back theyd eventually reached a tenuous truce but henrys earliest memories were of turmoil and discord and those memories had left their mark so she should feel confident about facing him why then did she feel such unease because this was uncharted territory when had a king ever been defied by his own queen who could predict what he would do it was possible he did not even know that himself eleanor nestled deeper in the bed vowing to stop torturing herself with conjecture and supposition that served for naught shed know soon enough despite her determination though she could not sleep two days later perrin alerted her that a rider had been sent ahead to prepare for the kings arrival the next day though he was absent from his duties another man brought her meals and served her with a swagger a jarring familiarity shed not encountered before after years of dealing with prideful poitevin barons she had no difficulty in putting him in his place and he gave her no further cause for complaint but when he delivered her dinner that afternoon he watched her from the corner of his eye with a smug smile and she knew then that her husband was expected at any time for the rest of the day she did nothing but pace and keep vigil at the window darkness fell but she continued to watch and not long after the village churches rang for compline she saw the flare of torches in the distance she left the shutters open just enough to give her a view of the bailey without being seen herself and watched as the castle was caught up in the inevitable chaos and excitement that heralded the kings coming henry was astride one of his favorite stallions a bigboned grey with silver mane and tail riding at his side were william de mandeville and his brother hamelin but eleanors attention was riveted upon the slender figure of a woman clad in a furlined mantle of fine scarlet shed known that harry had been living openly with rosamund clifford since hed been told of her part in the rebellion but it had not occurred to her that hed flaunt his concubine at his christmas court stepping away from the window she closed the shutters upon her husband and his harlot eleanor bolted upright in the bed her breath coming in ragged gulps her pulse racing the dream had been terrifying shed heard muffled screaming and when she opened the window she saw flames engulfing the buildings in the bailey shed pounded on the door and shouted till she was hoarse but no one came to let her out shed been forgotten the dream still seemed so vivid so real that she shuddered but that was all it was a bad dream memory came back in a rush the long hours waiting for her husband waiting in vain shed not settled herself in bed until after midnight and shed stayed fully dressed but eventually shed fallen asleep throwing back the blankets she went to the window was startled to see that the night was gone a loud rapping spun her toward the door but almost at once she realized that henry was not likely to knock for admittance enter she said and felt a throb of disappointment at sight of the guard for it was the same churl from the preceding day where was perrin he kept his gaze down as he placed her tray on the table but he smirked when he saw that last nights meal had gone virtually untouched eleanor ignored him and as he picked up the second tray she reached for the wine cup took several deep swallows her back was now to the door and so she did not see henry come into the room as the servant departed when she finally turned and found him standing in the doorway she gasped and her hand jerked wine splashing onto the sleeve of her gown henry closed the door and leaned back against it your nerves are on the raw this morn so that was how he wanted to play it eleanor raised the cup in a mock salute id offer you some wine but the castellan has given me only one cup he does not seem to think ill be doing much entertaining he was still leaning against the door his pose deceptively casual for he seemed as taut to her as a drawn bowstring you are looking wan and careworn these days so are you she shot back and it was true his eyes were hollowed and bloodshot shed assumed that hed delayed their meeting to torment her but now she wondered if he could have been as loath as she to have this confrontation setting the cup down she said i am glad you are here we need to talk i daresay we do he said laconically but she noticed that he was clenching and unclenching one of his fists at his side evidence that his nerves were on the raw too sir nicholas de chauvigny and two of my knights are being held at loches by your provost i would hope that as a matter of fairness you will order their release they have done nothing to deserve such harsh treatment nothing at all aside from treason and rebellion they are loyal to me harry how can you blame them for that and you know so much about loyalty and without warning the ice cracked giving her a disquieting glimpse of the profound rage just beneath his surface composure when he moved it was so fast that she took an involuntary step backward id always heard that women could become fickle and flighty once theyre too old to breed but i never truly believed ituntil now although she tried to hide it she knew he could see that his words had wounded they were the most dangerous of adversaries intimate enemies who knew each others vulnerabilities knew how to draw the most blood she said nothing though watching him warily as he strode toward her did you truly hate rosamund as much as that enough to tear our family apart because i strayed you think this was because of rosamund clifford she shook her head incredulously and then startled him by laughing you are good in bed harry but not that good the expression on his face was one of disbelief what grievance could you possibly have other than rosamund aquitaine richard and aquitaine for the love of christ eleanor ive heard enough of that foolish babbling from our sons do not need to hear more of it now from you you may have heard but you did not listen you never do dear god harry you think youre an easy man to live with you suck all the air out of a chamber leave none for the rest of us to breathe hed begun to move and she moved with him holding her ground so that they seemed to be engaged in an odd deadly dance so you rebelled because i was not a good listener he jeered my sons are too young to know better but there is no excuse for your betrayal you were one of the very few people on gods earth whom i truly trusted raimon st gilles came to me at limoges warned that you were intriguing against me and i would not believe him i was furious that he dared to accuse you of such base treacherymore fool i he drew an uneven audible breath but if i was a fool what does that make you my lady duchess it makes you my prisoner for as long as i choose to hold you and all for what yes i have lost she said raising her chin and meeting his eyes without flinching but so have you you just do not know it yet indeed and who is going to defeat me that quivering mound of valor louis capet our disgruntled fledglings you may prevail on the field you probably will but it matters for naught you can win battles not the war youve already lost what you value almost as much as your kingdom youve lost your sons a muscle twitched in his cheek and his lips peeled back from his teeth in a snarl that may be so but youll not be able to enjoy it whatever happens with my sons youll get no more chances to poison their minds against me i will never forgive you he spat never you could beg for your freedom on your knees for all the good it will do you id rather die that could be arranged yes i suppose it could you need only return to the great hall throw one of your celebrated fits of temper and demand to know why your lords and barons let you be mocked and defied by your troublesome wife ah waityou did that already with thomas becket and it did not work out so well for you did it it may have been a trick of the light or his pupils may have dilated but suddenly his eyes looked black to her and she feared shed pushed him too far he grabbed her wrist in an iron grip and she felt a jolt of purely physical fear shed known that she was subject to his power but this was different this chilling realization that she could not hope to match his strength that he could do whatever he wanted with her in this chamber and shed not be able to stop him he was forcing her toward the window ignoring her struggles to break free holding her with one hand with the other he jerked the shutters open pain was shooting up her arm their faces were so close now that they both could feel the others hot breath on their skin there had been this passion between them from their very first meeting in the past it had always ended in bed but she wondered now if it would end in the grave determined not to let him see her fear she managed a taunting smile what are you going to do harry push me out the window do not tempt me he said through gritted teeth pulling her even closer he said look out at the sky look upon the sun for as god is my witness youll not be seeing it again she was still trying to free herself and when he suddenly released her she reeled backward would have fallen if she hadnt grabbed the table for support by the time shed regained her balance hed gone feeling as if her knees would no longer support her she sank down upon her coffer her mouth was so dry that she could not swallow but her hands were trembling too much to pour any wine jesus god how had they ever gotten to this day henry plunged into the stairwell so rapidly that he tripped and almost tumbled down the steps headfirst slumping against the wall he sought to catch his breath his chest heaving his fabled temper was much more calculated than most people realized one more weapon in a kings arsenal but what had just happened in eleanors chamber was different hed come so close to losing control that it frightened him for hed always prided himself on being in command scorning those men who could not master their own passions a king at the mercy of his emotions did not deserve to be one hed not been prepared for this neither his own blind fury nor her defiance just as hed expected his sons to accept his olive branch at gisors hed expected eleanor to seek his forgiveness for what defense could she offer his breathing had steadied yet his sense of unreality remained how had his life gone so dreadfully wrong what sins had he committed that his own family would turn upon him like this he slammed his fist suddenly into the wall above his head again and again stopping only when he saw a smear of blood on the stones he felt no pain but he brought his injured hand to his mouth sucked the blood from his scraped knuckles and then he straightened his shoulders adjusted his mantle and raising his head high emerged out into the pale winter sunlight of the bailey chapter fifteen may poitiers poitou wars were not usually fought during the winter months but on january hal and the counts of blois perche and alencon struck deep into normandy launching a surprise assault upon the town of sees if sees had been captured falaise would have been at risk and henrys road south into anjou would have been blocked but the citizens of sees fought back fiercely and repulsed the attack louis then negotiated a truce with henry to last until the end of march and a similar truce was struck in england with the scots king both sides set about preparing for the resumption of hostilities in the spring after easter the scots king crossed the border and laid waste to northumberland the pope sent two legates to paris hoping that they could persuade the french king to reconcile henry and his sons but they had no luck the count of flanders showed interest in rejoining the rebel alliance and on april henry left normandy for the city of his birth le mans from there he headed into anjou and then into the lands of his captive queen he met little opposition and on whitsunday eve he was admitted without resistance into eleanors capital city of poitiers torches flared in the night casting wavering shadows as the english king and his men dismounted in the bailey eleanors steward hastened down the steps of the great hall to bid them welcome sir herve henry said brusquely cutting off the mans obsequious greeting the steward had been secretly in his pay since the previous summer one of several poitevin lords whod put selfinterest before fidelity to their duchess and while he made use of them all henry had no respect for a man whose loyalty was for sale to the highest bidder not taking the hint the steward continued to fawn and flatter so unctuously that henry was hard put to maintain even a semblance of civility seeing the royal temper beginning to kindle the earl of essex intervened declaring that the king was eager to see his daughter and when sir herve assured them that joanna was waiting within the great hall henry pushed past the man and took the steps two at a time the steward hurried after him saying something about a surprise guest but henry was no longer listening his half sister emma was standing in the doorway with a smile so like his eldest sons that he felt a pang and then he came to a startled halt gazing over emmas shoulder into the hall marguerite as he strode forward the girl hastily made a deep submissive curtsy but he quickly raised her up what are you doing here lass ii came to take my sister and constance back with me to paris she said almost inaudibly noting her pallor and the tears brimming behind her lashes he smiled quizzically you do know that i am not going to cast you into a dungeon yes she whispered i know but i also know that you will not let me go no he admitted i cannot do thatnot until hal and i have made our peace she asked when that would be but since he had no answer for her he preferred to pretend he hadnt heard the question his younger sons future wives were standing nearby and he moved to greet them neither alys nor constance shared marguerites misery the former knew that she had nothing to fear from him and the latter was indifferent to this sudden change in her circumstances for she considered herself to be a hostage whether she dwelled in eleanors duchy or henrys domains johns plighttrothed little alice of maurienne was sitting on the steps of the dais clutching her favorite felt puppet as she yawned blinking sleepily up at him henry instructed her nurse to put her to bed and then glanced around the hall where is joanna emma had followed him inside over there she said in the windowseat the hall was so deep in shadows that henry had not noticed his daughter smiling he started toward her holding out his arms but he stopped abruptly when joanna drew back at his approach staring at her in disbelief surely you are not afraid of me child that stung her pride afraid no but i am not happy with you papa henry could only marvel at the damage wrought by the snake in his eden what in gods name did your mother tell you that you are angry with her but it has naught to do with me that you love me as she does that i do not have to choose between you the words themselves were not objectionable they were in fact so fair and impartial that henry could find no fault with them and that vexed him all the more joanna had always held a special place in his heart for hed imagined that she was much like eleanor had been as a child now as troubled as he was by her recalcitrance he could not help admiring her spirit moving forward he sat down beside her in the windowseat why are you not happy with me joanna joanna gave him the look that children bestow upon adults who are being deliberately obtuse you are holding maman as a prisoner yes i am but she gave me no choice lass she plotted with my enemies against me you do know that yesss she said drawing the word out reluctantly but i heardi was told that you are not treating her kindly yes i daresay you were he said grimly raking the hall with accusing eyes none of eleanors retainers met that icegrey gaze doing their best to become invisible or at least inconspicuous they were lying to you joanna your mother is being treated as a highborn hostage not a rebel she is being held in a comfortable bedchamber not a dungeon you have my sworn word on that she stared down into her lap twisting her fingers together he saw that shed begun biting her nails again a habit he thought shed outgrown where is maman she asked at last this was a question being asked throughout most of christendom and he heard the murmur that swept the hall knew that every ear was turned their way i will tell you he said but only you and leaning over he whispered in her ear joanna looked intently into his face maman has never liked it there she said but she was honored that he should entrust her with so great a secret may i see her not in this lifetime or the next henry vowed silently but those seagreen eyes were watching him so hopefully that he could not bring himself to hurt her with the truth yes he said once the war is over and that seemed to satisfy her for when he put his arm around her shoulders she did not pull away what now papa do you want me to stay here no lass i do not he said thinking that hed sooner see her thrust into a snake pit you and the other girls will be going to live in rouen for now i was thinking of having johnny leave fontevrault and join you there would you like that sweeping up the fragments of his broken family he thought bitterly but joanna looked pleased i would like that very much she said ive missed johnny she missed her other brothers too though she knew better than to confide that to him she wasnt sure if she should forgive him for imprisoning her mother but it was comforting to have him holding her like this comforting to remember that she was not utterly alone papa she ducked her head leaning into his embrace papai do not understand why this is happening henrys jaw muscles tightened neither do i lass he said softly neither do i richard strode into the nave of st pierres cathedral and beckoned to sir martin de jarnac one of his household knights martin hurried over rather nervously for he knew richard had been meeting earlier in the day with the bishop of saintes and the bishop was increasingly unhappy with richards occupation of his city my lord how did it go richard shrugged the bishop had more complaints than a dog has fleas he was particularly wroth that weve appropriated the cathedral for our own purposes their constant carping was taking some of the bloom off his pleasure in gaining control of the town his first command had not begun auspiciously for la rochelle had closed its gates at his approach refusing to allow him entry into the town boldly declaring that they were loyal to the old king not the young one richard had been mortified vowing that those overweening impudent churls would pay for that and pay dearly but he could do nothing at the time except retreat his ears burning with the echoes of their scornful laughter his only consolation was that his brother hals assault upon sees had failed too fortunately a fierce rivalry existed between la rochelle and saintes and if the former turned richard away the latter was then keen to make him welcome but the citizens of saintes were soon having second thoughts about their hospitality richards men had lost no time in fortifying the town throwing up a wooden castle to guard the roman bridge and using the cathedral for their headquarters as troubling as these developments were even worse was to come word had reached saintes that the english king was now encamped at poitiers only seventy miles to the north richard was not as alarmed as the citizens by his fathers arrival for he had confidence in the city walls his new fortifications and his own military instincts moreover he meant to make good use of the time remaining to him while henry celebrated whitsuntide in poitiers hed dispatched riders to geoffrey de rancon william de maingot and the count of angouleme urging them to join him at saintes without delay they had a chance to force a decisive battle to win a victory that would end the war and free his mother and he meant to make the most of the opportunity this morning i slipped out of the town and visited the ruins of the roman amphitheater he confided to martin it was an amazing sight so much of it still intact after all that time martin was vaguely aware that saintes had once been an important roman town for hed seen the huge arch of germanicus at the bridge supposedly built to honor a longdead emperor while he didnt share richards interest in the past he was a firm believer in humoring the highborn and he asked politely what this amphitheater was used for richard was surprised by his ignorance that was where the romans staged their games where their gladiators fought and felons died my lady mother would tell me the most wondrous stories about ancient rome when gladiators entered the arena they faced the audience and proudly proclaimed morituri te salutamus martin had never learned latin and looked so blank that richard translated we who are about to die salute you did you not study history when you he got no further having noticed the archdeacon hovering nearby waiting for a word with him richard sighed for he already knew what the cleric wanted to discuss saintes was on the route to the great spanish shrine of santiago de compostela and its citizens were worrying that pilgrims might stay away fearing theyd be trapped in a siege as much as he yearned to duck out a side door into the cloisters richard felt it was his duty to offer reassurances and forcing a smile he started toward the archdeacon just as all hell broke loose at least it seemed that way to richard heads were turning toward the sudden clamor coming from outside the cathedral richard spun around and ran for the door with his men at his heels as he emerged into the dusk he found a scene of utter chaos people were running in different directions cursing as they bumped into one another putting him in mind of an overturned ant hill hed seen panic like this only once before when a fire broke out in rouen and when he saw smoke billowing from the direction of the river it confirmed his worst fears stop you fools he yelled we need to get buckets and fight the fire none of the frightened citizens paid him any heed he was shouting orders at his own men directing them to find buckets and ropes and hooks so they could pull down endangered buildings if need be when he heard his own name being called rising above the din like the solitary cry of a seagull the sight of raoul was a welcome one and he hastily started toward his kinsman roughly shouldering his way through the crowds thronging the street were under attack we have to get out whilst we still can richard gaped at the older man what are you talking about there is a fire yes and your father set it hes come calling with an army richard and i do not want him to find us home that is not possible how could he get here so fast no sooner were the words out of his mouth than richard regretted them his enemies had been asking that question of his father for as long as he could remember and in any case it was irrelevant we can keep him out he insisted hold on until we get men from taillebourg and no raoul said sharply we cannot his men have already taken the castle we put up by the bridge and are breaking down the city gates even as we speak our only chance is to get out now no richard was indignant ill not run awaynever whilst we waste time arguing harrys men will be swarming into the city the whoreson caught us by surprise richard and it is too late to do anything but retreat when richard continued to shake his head stubbornly raoul swore under his breath do you miss your mother so much that you want to join her at chinon or falaise that got through to richard that and the changing timbre of the shouting it was louder now more urgent and closer coming from the city gates shaking off his shock he said with a composure that raoul applauded where do we go we can get out through a postern gate then head downriver to taillebourg harry was concerned about speed not a long siege and did not bring mangonels with him we ought to be safe enough with de ranconif we can reach him this was the first time that richard had been personally confronted with the unpleasant realities of warthat it was not all glory and blaring trumpets and swirling banners it was not a lesson hed ever wanted to learn looking around for as many of his men as he could find he said tersely lets go richard managed to escape from saintes as his father was sweeping into the town the rebels retreated into the cathedral held out for a day and then surrendered henry captured more than sixty knights and over four hundred archers plus all their supplies weapons and horses the cathedral of saintes and many of the nearby houses were badly damaged the acrid odor of smoke lingering over the town long after the fighting was done henry spent the remainder of the spring chasing rebels and fortifying his border strongholds the news from england continued to be bad as one after another of his castles fell to the ravaging scots army after taking and turning over the castle of ancenis to maurice de craon henry summoned his lords and bishops to a great council in normandy on the nativity of st john the baptist henry reached bonneville the site of the council on the evening of june the castle was neither comfortable nor spacious having been constructed in the eleventh century and many of his barons had been compelled to seek lodgings in the nearby port of toques henry was indifferent as usual to his surroundings and was soon settled in his bedchamber he was tired for hed been in the saddle since dawn but these days his thoughts raced and ricocheted around his brain so wildly that sleep was becoming a luxury one even a king could rarely afford stay for a while he said and willem smiled took a seat on a nearby coffer as henry dismissed his squires the earl made easy conversation for a time soon saw that henry was not really listening and fell silent waiting henry walked back and forth too edgy to sit still he was already regretting asking willem to remain and he was about to tell the other man that he could go off to bed when one of his squires hurried back into the chamber my liege men have just ridden into the bailey are seeking an audience with you straightaway i told the steward that they should wait till the morrow but when he told me who they were i thought youd want to see them it is the bishopelect of winchester and your uncle the lord ranulf henry nodded richard of ilchester was one of his most trusted officials as archdeacon of poitiers hed supported henry unwaveringly in the clash with thomas becket even enduring excommunication at the archbishops hands his reward for such loyal service was the bishopric of winchester and ranulf was known to be very close to the king bound as much by affection as by blood their presence here in bonneville conveyed a message in and of itself and it was not an encouraging one the two men were soon ushered into his chamber they both looked exhausted and as soon as greetings were exchanged henry told them to find seats ordering his squire to fetch some wine they waited until it had been served and they were alone again with henry and willem before revealing the urgency of their mission my liege we have been sent to entreat you to return to england as soon as possible the bishop sagged back in his chair never taking his eyes from henrys face if you do not you are in danger of losing your kingdom henry said nothing his gaze flicking from the bishop to ranulf who took that as his cue to speak up my lord king the bishop speaks true we have not been able to keep the scots from ravaging the border lands and theyve been raiding into england they have taken castles at appleby leddell and harbottle and robert de vaux has been so hard pressed that he was forced to seek a truce agreeing to surrender carlisle if you cannot relieve him by michaelmas the scots king then sacked warkworth and slaughtered many of the townspeople the bishop leaned forward his fists clenching on his knees we have naught but dire news my lord the rebellion has flared up again in the midlands they attacked and burned nottingham and the garrison at leicester is still holding out refusing to surrender and bandits and masterless men are taking advantage of the unrest to commit crimes of their own the kings roads are no longer safe it is as if we are back in the dreadful days when stephen ruled there was rioting in london my liegein london henrys continuing silence was beginning to unnerve them for they were accustomed to his taking command of a crisis taking decisive action just when the stillness in the chamber was becoming intolerable henry turned and looked at the bishop as if he were seeing him for the first time you are half dead on your feet richard go to bed you too uncle the bishop did but ranulf stayed sensing that henrys need for comfort was greater than his own need for sleep when he looked over at willem the earl raised his shoulders in a silent shrug for he too was at a loss they watched henry in silence neither one knowing what to say and both started when he suddenly spoke out ranulf did you know that the count of flanders has sworn upon a fragment of the true cross that he will invade england within a fortnight from tomorrow yes ranulf said i know he knew too that count philip had already dispatched an advance guard of three hundred knights but he could not bring himself to say anything about it not sure if henry had heard and not wanting to give him any more grief henry was staring down at the ashes in the cold empty hearth my french spies tell me that louis and philip and their lackeys hope to lure me to england so they can attack normandy once i am gone that may well be true harry ranulf said carefully but england is already in flames can you stand by whilst it burns i truly thought id won this accursed war last year with those victories at dol and fornham st genevieve but this rebellion is like a snake shedding one skin only to grow another does it ever end you will prevail harry willem declared i have no doubts whatsoever i know philip of flanders well and he is no match for you on the battlefield as for that fool on the french throne he is no more a leader than that beggar we passed on the road this noon men would not follow him out of a burning building and your sons here he paused his voice trailing off and henry gave him a ghostly grimace of a smile ah yes he said my sons my loyal loving sons ranulf sat up straight remembering that he did have news that might give henry comfort i can think of no better words to describe geoff have you heard what he did harry he called out the men of lincoln as their bishopelect and lay siege to roger de mowbrays castle at kinnardferry he captured rogers son and razed the castle to the ground he then joined forces with the archbishop of york and took de mowbrays castle at kirkby malzeard did he by god this time henrys smile was more convincing he is a good lad is geoff hed picked up his wine cup but now set it down untouched i thought i told you to go to bed uncle you too willem i need you both alert and awake for the council on the morrow willem did as he was bid but ranulf still hesitated i am not tired he lied if you want to talk no henry said i am going to bed myself shall i summon your squires nonot yet i want to be alone for a while ranulf looked searchingly into the younger mans face priests often spoke of life as a vale of tears warning that all is vanity and vexation of spirit reminding their flocks that man that is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble yet he doubted that most christians sinners though they be ever reached that dark desolate place where hope withered on the vine and the voice of the almighty was silent but he hadhed lost the woman hed loved a friend closer than a brother and all sense of purpose stricken by grief and guilt hed wandered alone in the wilderness caring for naught until he rediscovered divine mercy and his faith in a welsh mountain valley he had never forgotten though the pain of feeling forsaken by god pain he saw reflected now in his nephews eyes gods blessings upon you he said but no more than that for he knew harrys anguish was beyond his power to heal he could only pray that the almighty and jesus the only begotten son would take pity upon harry show him the path to salvation in his time of greatest need chapter sixteen july falaise normandy eleanor had not fully appreciated what a charmed life she led until it was taken away from her from birth shed had the best that their world had to offer never thinking to question her good fortune shed chaffed under the constraints imposed upon women by society and the church but shed not wondered why shed been so blessed people were expected to accept their lot in life as gods will which was easy to do for a woman born beautiful and a dukes daughter in the months since her betrayal in loches forest though the reality shed known had vanished leaving her a stranger in an alien land the most mundane tasks were now a challenge for the first time she faced the normal vexations and disappointments of daily life shed only brought a few gowns with her and shed lost so much weight that they no longer fit all that well moreover they would eventually become threadbare and worn if she could not replace them accustomed to having servants who heated her baths she now had to make do with a basin and cold water washing her long hair was a test of endurance in the past she had only to express a wish for a delicacy however exotic and it would appear upon her table as if by magic now the monotony of her meals had robbed her of her appetite and she found herself craving oranges from spain and wine from gascony and spices from cyprus and sicily but her physical privations were tolerable it was her emotional hardships that were scarring her soul theirs was a world in which only hermits and recluses scorned the company of others until her captivity shed never slept alone in a chamber before her concept of privacy went no further than being snugly cocooned behind bedhangings with her husband now there were days when she did not hear the sound of another human voice she was not a woman to thrive in solitude and the loneliness of her confinement was hard to bear so was the boredom when she remembered how glibly shed complained of the tedium of her life at the french court she winced for the young spoiled girl shed once been with nothing to occupy herself but her own thoughts she was unable to escape the misery of her plight reliving that harrowing confrontation with henry and seething at her abandonment by her craven allies at least anger provided its own energy far more frightening was what followedthe loss of hope as she reached two unwelcome milestones june marked her sixth month as a prisoner and in june shed observed her fiftieth birthday as a child that had seemed such a vast age to her now she saw it as a death sentence for how likely was it that shed outlive the husband who was nine years younger than she youll never see the sun again hed warned and she had no reason to doubt him in her time of greatest need her deliverance depended upon a spiteful former husband and her callow young sons how had she ever let it come to this that was a question she could not face and to avoid it shed turned to the almighty for support and solace her religious faith had been the conventional kind practiced but not pondered shed dutifully attended mass distributed alms made generous donations to abbeys like fontevrault and felt that shed kept up her end of the bargain shed rarely prayed for specific boons except during those unhappy years when shed been unable to give louis a son scorned by her critics as a barren queen and those prayers had gone unanswered at falaise shed asked the almighty to let her sons win this war knowing that nothing less would gain her release but as summer bloomed and her hopes withered shed begun to offer up a more desperate prayer beseeching god to end her confinement any way he chose for shed also begun to fear that in such utter despair lay madness july dawned with storms and high winds eleanor closed the shutters against the rain and spent much of her time trying to sleep the only means of escape available to her and so she was in bed on a wet dreary afternoon when she heard footsteps out in the stairwell it was pride rather than curiosity that induced her to sit up and straighten her clothing for she did not expect this to be a visitor she wanted to see it had been more than a fortnight since perrin had waited upon her a fellow guard had complained that he was unduly friendly with the royal prisoner and duties had been found for him elsewhere losing her only link to the outside world was the final straw and soon afterward shed spiraled down into a deep depression shed gotten to her feet by the time a brusque knock sounded and the door was pushed open to admit maurice de craon she greeted him coolly hoping shed managed to conceal her unease she very much doubted that his arrival heralded good news madame he said formally as a courtesy i am informing you that you should make ready to depart on the morrow we will be leaving at first light eleanor abandoned her attempt at studied indifference where she said sharply will we be going the angevin baron regarded her in silence for a long moment his dark eyes alight with grim satisfaction barfleur he said where you will be taking ship for england eleanor was surprised to find that shed have company on her journey to barfleur her fellow prisoners the earl and countess of leicester and hugh of chester they were just as startled to see her apparently unaware that she was sharing their confinement and she spared a grateful thought for her chatty young source perrin of the three imprisonment seemed to have left the lightest mark upon peronelle which made sense for shed known that as a woman shed have the best chance of regaining her freedom her husband appeared to have aged to have lost some of his bluster but the one most affected by captivity was the earl of chester hugh was thin and pallid always highstrung he looked almost haunted now and eleanor glanced away hearing mauds accusing words echoing on the wind it is not enough youve poisoned your own well no you must poison mine too it took nearly three days to reach barfleur for the downpour continued and the roads were deep in mud barfleur was the primary port for channel crossings and the largest town on that rockhewn peninsula but the royal castle was a few miles to the south and it was there that eleanor expected to pass her last night on french soil she was to get a shock though as the castle walls came into sight for a familiar red and gold banner flew from the keepsignaling that the king of england was in residence eleanors tired body tensed it had never occurred to her that shed be sailing back to england with henry the other prisoners had seen the royal standard too much to their dismay they exchanged nervous looks as they were escorted into the bailey for they were no more eager than eleanor to confront the king despite the chill dampness of the dusk sweat mingled with rain drops upon the earl of leicesters ruddy face as he remembered his last meeting with henry remembered with appalling clarity that hed drawn his sword upon his sovereign the nasty weather notwithstanding the bailey was crowded with spectators nudging and jostling one another as they sought to get a good look at the new arrivals eleanor knew she was the true attraction they were there to gape at the captive queen well if they wanted a show by god shed given them one my lord de craon she said imperiously waving aside a groom and waiting for the baron himself to assist her in dismounting he did with poor grace scowling as she took time to adjust the hood of her mantle and straighten the cuffs of her gloves he gestured toward a corner tower but just then the door to the great hall burst open and joanna came flying out heedless of the rain and mud she splashed across the bailey to fling herself into eleanors arms eleanors hood fell back and she was soon as wet as her daughter but she did not care and they clung together in a wordless embrace that ended only when she glanced up and saw her husband standing in the doorway of the hall hugh and leicester at once dropped submissively to their knees but henry never took his eyes from his wife and she shivered for if looks were lethal shed have died then and there in the bailey of barfleur castle eleanor was escorted to a small bedchamber on the upper story of the keep her reunion with joanna had been a brief one cut short when henry sent someone out to retrieve the girl using the bad weather as a pretext eleanor had assured her daughter that theyd meet again although she did not know if that were true or not it seemed the ultimate irony to her that she could lose her children twice in one lifetime and while she damned both louis and henry she cursed too a society in which fathers were given so much power and mothers so little after realizing that shed not heard a key turning in the lock she dared to open the door only to discover an armed guard he saluted her politely as if he were posted there for her protection and she puzzled him by laughing shrilly she forced herself to eat some of the meal brought by a silent servant but she kept listening for the sounds of footsteps in the stairwell when she finally heard a murmur of voices she watched the door open with mingled hope and dread not knowing if it would be her daughter or her enraged husband its me maman joannas pronouncement was superfluous her smile joyful eleanor had just gathered the girl into her arms when she added happily i brought you another visitor and to eleanors amazement her daughterinlaw stepped smiling into the room that was the best evening eleanor had known in months the girls were as delighted to see her as she was to see them eager to share their news to tell her of the fall of poitiers and marguerites illfated visit the capture of saintes and the return of the count of flanders to the rebel coalition theyd been living in rouen they explained until they were urgently summoned to barfleur by henry and they would all be going with him to england as soon as the weather cleared and as she listened eleanor felt hope beginning to spark midst the ashes of a dead fire this sudden change of plans could only mean that the war was going badly for henry in england joanna and marguerite had kept their visit short understanding that theyd lose the privilege if they abused it promising to return upon the morrow joanna had seemed surprised when asked how theyd managed to get permission saying airily that i asked papa as if his consent had never been in doubt eleanor knew better and grudgingly gave henry credit where due he could easily have kept joanna away just as louis had done with their daughters but once hed agreed it would not be that easy to change his mind which meant that shed be able to see joanna and marguerite again there would be opportunities for it was not uncommon to wait days even weeks for a favorable wind theyd been stranded in barfleur for almost a month as theyd waited to cross the channel for henrys coronation finally sailing in heavy seas when his patience ran out that was not a memory to give eleanor comfort it was painful to remember the jubilant woman shed been on that november eve twenty years ago willing to depart in a gale because she was so sure that god was on their side so confident that she and henry were masters of their own fate destined to rule over the greatest court in christendom and not to drown like those poor doomed souls on the white ship the next day was even more rainsodden and windy and eleanors faith was rewarded in midafternoon when joanna and marguerite were ushered into her chamber joanna brought wilted flowers from the castle gardens and marguerite with surprising practicality had herb packets agrimony for fever pennyroyal for cramps and chamomile for headaches adding shyly that chamomile was also said to be useful for melancholy she had apologies to offer too alys had wanted to come she explained but she had lost her nerve at the last moment she said she did not know what to say to you i told her that did not matter but she still balked saying shed come next time you cannot blame the lass eleanor said dryly her lessons in manners never included one on captive queens glancing over at joanna she said what of john did your father forbid him to come joanna looked uncomfortable nojohnny would not come with us he said papa would not be happy with him if he visited you eleanor looked away saying nothing she had no qualms about her older sons feeling that theyd been old enough to make up their own minds her conscience was not so clear when it came to her youngest two shed hoped that shed be able to keep john and joanna out of the fray and it was only after her capture that shed admitted what a frail reed that hope was she was sorry that john had felt the need to choose between them but it stung that hed chosen his father for henry had spent even less time with the boy than she had joanna picked up a wafer uneaten from eleanors dinner and when eleanor nodded she crammed half of it into her mouth i have a surprise for you maman she announced i am going to fetch it now will be back soon and before eleanor could object shed darted out the door past experience had taught eleanor that joannas surprises ought to be approached with caution but she welcomed this opportunity to speak alone with marguerite neither of them felt comfortable speaking too candidly in front of joanna whose loyalties were already bruised and bleeding as soon as the door closed eleanor leaned forward and touched her daughterinlaws hand in a gesture of encouragement how did you and joanna win harry over i truly would not have expected him to let joanna see me i could see that he was not happy about it marguerite confided once he decided he must return to england he dared not leave any of us behind i suppose he hoped that joanna would not find out you were sailing with us that shed hear no one gossiping about your presence at barfleur of course someone told her she said sounding so slyly satisfied that eleanor realized shed been that someone and she gave her daughterinlaw a look of startled approval until now shed seen only the sweet side of marguerites nature had not known the girl had spirit too once she was alerted she kept vigil for you marguerite continued and when she looked up at her father with pleading eyes and quivering lips he could not bring himself to deny him butbut he agreed only for joannas sake and not mine eleanor said flatly bitter that henry could declare forfeit all her rights as a mother what of you lass has harry been kind to you oh yes marguerite said without hesitation he was not long in poitiers though as he sent us on to rouen whilst he chased richard out of saintes we did not see him again until he summoned us to barfleur in such haste the threat to england must be dire if he thinks he needs to take command himself i would love to know what happened to force his hand i think i do know marguerite said surprisingly hal and the count of flanders are at gravelines waiting for favorable weather so they can invade england eleanor felt a surge of excitement for she had far more confidence in philip of flanderss military skills than she did in louiss if they could gain a decisive victory her chances of being freed would improve dramatically she well knew louis and philip would not bestir themselves much on her behalf but richard and hal would never abandon her and an english triumph would give them the leverage they needed there is a question i would ask you ere joanna returns does rosamund clifford sail with us marguerite was flattered that her motherinlaw would speak to her like this woman to woman no she said emphatically i think not he has been very open about their liaison since last summer so i do not think hed have her hidden away here shaking her head indignantly she said i think it is shameful that men cannot be faithful to their wives but if they must sin they ought to have the decency to do it in secret eleanor was taken aback for shed not realized that marguerite thought shed rebelled because of rosamund clifford she wondered suddenly if her sons were equally illinformed she felt confident that richard knew better for he understood her love for aquitaine if anyone did but what of hal and geoffrey marguerite why does hal think i joined the rebellion he knows you did it for him for his kingship he has often said how lucky he is to have a mother who would sacrifice so much for his sake marguerite did not doubt though that eleanors jealousy of henrys leman had played a part too and she searched now for words of comfort saying haltingly ive spoken to people whove seen the clifford wench and they say she is not even that pretty for certes not as beautiful as you my lady mother eleanor was both touched and vexed by the girls attempt to offer balm to a grieving wife she opened her mouth to assure marguerite that it was only her pride that had been wounded not her heart but it was then that the door opened and joanna rushed in again her cheeks were bright with windwhipped color her mantle splattered with mud she was clutching a woven basket to her chest looking so pleased with herself that eleanor suspected shed been up to mischief of some sort i have a present for you maman she said and carried the basket across the chamber to deposit it beside eleanor on the bed it was covered with a white cloth that looked like a napkin and eleanor reached out expecting fruit or cheese to her surprise she found herself looking at a tiny kitten one of the stable cats had a litter but then she disappeared joanna leaned over tickling the kitten under its chin this is the only one who survived i heard a groom saying he was going to drown her because she was too young to fend for herself and would likely starve so i had a wonderful ideato give you the kitten maman eleanor looked dubiously at the kitten which fit easily into the palm of her hand it was a pretty little creature dovegrey with gold eyes but shed never had a cat as a pet before i do not know joanna she said i doubt your father will agree joanna smiled he will she predicted confidently youll see henry had just returned from a trip to the harbor where hed had another frustrating talk with the ships captain who dolefully concluded that the weather was still too foul to risk sailing henry knew the man was right but his nerves were shredding under the strain common sense told him that if he could not sail neither could hal or philip but he was heeding other voices than logic these days a fire had been lit in the hearth for the relentless rain was making a mockery of the summer calendar after hed changed into a dry tunic and chausses henry tried to distract himself by playing a game of chess with willem but he soon abandoned the effort unable to keep his thoughts away from the darker corners of his mind willem and ranulf were watching him pace back and forth in sympathetic silence when one of his squires hastened over to answer a knock on the door he at once opened it wide for only two people had unrestricted access to the king at barfleur his son and daughter joanna was clad in a silk dress that seemed inappropriate for everyday use and her hair was neatly brushed for once hanging down her back in two reddishblond braids she looked very appealing but very solemn and after greeting the men politely she asked henry if she could speak with him about a serious matter of course lass he said guiding her toward the settle what do you want to buy now did you find another carved horse or spinning top in the marketplace this is more important than playthings papa did you know that maman does not have a lady to attend to her at first i thought shed been left behind at falaise but then i learned that shed not had a handmaiden at all sounding shocked joanna looked earnestly into her fathers face we have to do something about this papa men do not understand how much a lady needs help with dressing long hair like mamans is not easy to brush or wash or braid it is hard too to lace up a gown in the back i was going to ask you if i could go to stay with maman once we get to england so i could be of help henry stiffened but joanna did not seem to notice and continued on guilelessly but after i thought about it i knew youd not want me to do that not whilst you and maman are still quarreling so we need to get maman a handmaiden papa will you see to it i know you are too busy now but mayhap later when you have more time she was regarding henry so trustingly that he felt a rush of emotion love for this innocent child of his flesh warring with his need to punish her treacherous mother yes joanna he said at last i will see that it is done thank you papa thank you she threw herself into his arms hugging him gratefully i will not worry about maman so much if she is not alone as she embraced her father her face was not visible to him but it was to willem and he caught her triumphant grin why the little vixen he thought and when their eyes met he gave her a mock scowl that caused her to look at him in dismay he winked then and joanna relaxed giggled and winked back i will not keep you papa she said dutifully i know you have much to do these days may i tell johnny that you will be in to bid him good night when he nodded she smiled and slid off his lap heading for the door there she paused as if having an afterthought i almost forgot to tell you about the kitten papa she was going to be drowned by one of the stable grooms but i stopped him i know cats are not often kept as pets but i did not want the kitten to die so i gave her to maman and with a farewell wave she slipped out the door henry glanced up to find both ranulf and willem watching him and raised a hand in warning do not say a word either of you i know very well that we have just performed a puppet show with me playing the role of puppet and a fine puppet show it was too ranulf said with as much cheer as he could muster if the almighty had meant us to be able to resist the coaxing of our daughters hed not have made them so irresistiblenow would he willem laughed and henry smiled but it seemed to ranulf that he could see a glimmer of tears behind his nephews lashes and he felt a sorrowful rage that harry was being hurt so badly by his heedless selfish sons and his false coldhearted queen eleanor was having the most restful nights shed had in months lulled to sleep by the reassuring rhythms of the storm each blast of wind and torrent of rain giving promise of yet another day with her daughter she was not prepared therefore when she was awakened at dawn on the monday after her arrival by an apologetic guard who told her that she must make ready to depart as the king was sailing that morn eleanor could see nothing but chaos the bailey was crowded with men and horses servants were dragging large coffers toward the carts routiers carrying food from the great hall to eat on the run dogs barking madly and getting underfoot whips cracked the air as horses struggled to move carts mired in mud a stallion reared suddenly unseating his rider and nearly trampling those who tried to grab the dangling reins men were cursing and shoving shouting commands that went unheeded a priest was berating a castle page while a woman shrieked as her mule shied away when she was being assisted into the saddle the earls of leicester and chester were being prodded toward their waiting mounts while peronelle lagged behind complaining loudly to anyone within earshot trying to shelter herself from the rain with the hood of her mantle eleanor halted on the steps of the great hall looking about frantically but she could not find joanna john or marguerite nor was there any sign of henry when her guard nervously urged her on she turned on him in fury i told you i am not going anywhere until i speak with the king see to it damn you see to it madame ii cannot do that he stammered our orders were to escort you to the harbor much to his relief then he spotted barfleurs castellan and let out a yell pushing his way toward the man momentarily abandoned eleanor resumed her search for henry or her children to no avail and when her guard returned with the castellan that harried individual refused to listen to her protests you may want to see the king madame he snapped but i very much doubt that he wants to see you ordering the guard to follow his orders he moved on the guard and eleanor looked at each other in mutual frustration clearing his throat he was imploring her not to get him into trouble when she finally caught sight of a familiar figure tell lord ranulf i want to speak with him she directed the unhappy guard now man now as she watched tensely he did as she bade hurrying over to intercept ranulf henrys uncle had an easily read face his dismay and reluctance all too evident shed expected as much if henrys officials found it awkward to deal with her how much more uncomfortable it must be for his kinsmen but she was relying upon ranulfs innate good manners and she was not disappointed holding his mantle tightly against the gusting wind he strode toward her the guard following closely on his heels ranulf thank god youre here you can get through to harry if any man can you must convince him that it is too dangerous to sail in this storm i cannot do that she stared at him in disbelief you want to die i cannot believe youve forgotten the fate of the white ship of course i have not forgotten he said testily but i have already talked to harry and i could not get him to change his mind the winds have shifted are coming now from the west and he is determined to sail ere they shift again this is madness she said utter madness let harry go to the devil and drown for all i care but ill not have him risk my childrens lives i doubt that you are in a position to do anything about it he said so coldly that she was suddenly reminded that he was a kings son and the blood of the autocratic william the bastard flowed in his veins as it did in henrys abruptly changing her tactics she laid her hand on his arm and said in a calmer voice i know you are loyal to harry i know too that you are angry with me but you are a fair man ranulf and a sensible one surely you do not want to sail in such vile weather speak to harry again not for me do it for joanna and john and rhiannon who does not want to become a widow this day ranulf looked at her for a moment wanting to turn away but unable to do so whatever her other crimes she was still a mother seeing him hesitate she said harry will listen to you i know he will making up his mind then he grasped her arm and steered her back toward the steps they were like a small island in a sea of bodies as people surged past them on all sides not even glancing their way i have already tried to convince harry to wait so have willem and the ships master he told us that if his safe arrival in england will bring peace to his realm the almighty will guide him safely into port but if god has turned away his face and his favor may he never reach the shore eleanor was stunned i do not believe you i do not believe harry said that he is reckless yes but not foolhardy and he has never deferred to anyones will but his own not even the almightys most of the time he thinks they are one and the same ranulfs mouth tightened if you knew harry half as well as you think you do you could never have betrayed him he said and stalked away leaving her standing alone on the steps of the hall with her guard hovering nearby eleanor had sailed in storms before but nothing had prepared her for what awaited them as soon as their ships rounded barfleur point and headed out into open water the rain was being blown sideways by the force of the wind and the channel was churned into whitewater froth canvas tents had been set up to shelter the passengers and the stench was soon overpowering for even the most experienced travelers were fighting seasickness as eleanors ship sank down in a trough and then battled its way up people were flung about like childrens toys crashing into coffers and gunwale screaming as they slid along the wet deck all around her she could hear men praying with the fervor of the doomed entreating nicholas of bari the patron saint of sailors to save them from the perils of the sea she was too angry to pray though and chose to spend her last hours damning her husband to hell everlasting when she could endure the stifling stinking tent no longer eleanor got up and lurched toward the open flap two of her guards at once staggered after her crying out in alarm stumbling out into the storm she grabbed at one of the windlass posts for support as the ships master screamed hard on the helm the helmsman jerked the tiller to the left and the deck dropped under her feet the guards were beside her now panting and cursing but still loath to lay hands upon the queen go back inside they implored her petrified that she might be washed overboard leaving them alive to face the kings wrath eleanor ignored them never even heard them a searing bolt of lightning cast an eerie greenish light upon the slanting deck silhouetting sailors as they fought to tighten one of the shrouds giving her a terrifying glimpse of that heaving black sea the rain and clouds obscured the masthead lanterns of the other ships in their fleet they were alone in this devils cauldron the skills of these frantic seamen pitted against the savagery of the storm and she shuddered thinking of joanna and john out there in the darkness sick and wet and scared after a particularly rough channel crossing with his brother hamelin henry had confided to her that a kings chess games were played with the lives of other people it was a great and fearful power he admitted and did not bear close inspection for otherwise it could never be invoked she did not know how to reconcile that man with the one who was gambling with gods favor if ranulf could be believed what madness had infected harry that hed offer up their childrens lives as stakes in this accursed wager with the almighty the prevailing westerly winds drove henrys battered fleet across the channel in record time and they anchored safely in southampton harbor that night the weary passengers and crewmen sought lodgings in the castle and the town and slept like the dead ranulf was so tired that he could easily have stayed abed till noon that luxury was to be denied him though as he was rousted out of bed at daybreak with the unwelcome word that the king would be departing southampton within the hour the rain had finally stopped but the sky was still overcast a foreboding shade of grey ranulf paused long enough to search the bailey for henry and then hastened into the crowded great hall where he ran into a yawning rumpled earl of essex what is happening he asked helping himself to bread smeared with honey willem broke off a chunk of goat cheese and swallowed it in two bites were all on the move this morn leicester and chester are being taken to porchester the lady marguerite the lady joanna john and the other lasses are to be escorted to devizes castle and the queenthe queen is to go to sarum ranulf conjured up a mental image of that bleak moorland fortress it would not be a happy homecoming for eleanor what about us where does harry mean to head first i do hope hell set a reasonable pace the scots border is a long long ride from here he is not going to confront the scots kingat least not yet where then ranulf asked and to his surprise willem shook his head better you hear it from harry himself he said cryptically i am not sure youd believe it otherwise puzzled ranulf pushed away from the table and went to find his nephew henry was giving instructions to a man clad in mail his hard visage and guarded eyes giving testimony to years in royal service when he made a terse query about shackles henry nodded grimly and ranulf blinked wondering if that order could possibly be meant for eleanor but then the knight mentioned porchester and he realized the command was aimed at the unhappy rebel earls leicester and chester as soon as the man moved away he stepped forward to attract henrys attention even henrys inexhaustible well of energy seemed to have run dry his eyes were dull and there was such a hectic color burning across his cheekbones that ranulf suspected he was running a fever taking advantage of his status as one of the kings intimates ranulf said with troubled candor jesu you look dreadful this morn surely we can afford to rest a day longer in southampton henry didnt answer and ranulf yielded in a battle hed never expected to win and youll not listen to me i know you never do willem would not tell me where we are going i hope youll be more forthcoming henry gave him an odd look one that ranulf could not interpret canterbury he said and walked away without waiting for a response chapter seventeen july westminster palace england ranulf and willem were admitted to the kings antechamber but when they asked to see henry they had to wait while his chamberlain got permission for their entry he soon emerged from the royal bedchamber but not with the word they wanted he was sorry he reported the king had retired for the night although they doubted that they had no choice but to withdraw outside in the gardens they paused to review their options what now willem sounded disheartened and ranulf couldnt blame him since leaving southampton theyd tried repeatedly to talk with henry about his intent to do penance at beckets tomb to no avail theyd initially been disquieted by his plan simply because it seemed so wildly out of character for him but theyd soon had other reasons for concern hed been fasting on bread and water while pushing his body to the utmost riding as if racing his troubles and theyd begun watching him with the alarm of men trying to catch up with a runaway wagon i do not know ranulf admitted there is not much we can do is there no man can be forced to share what is in his heart least of all a king willem acknowledged the truth of that by bidding ranulf good night youd best get some sleep he warned for he will want to depart at first light ranulf remained in the gardens after willem went off to find a bed for the night although he was only fifteen years henrys senior hed always had a fatherly protective love for his sisters son and he felt that he was somehow letting henry down in his time of greatest need the rain had stopped and the air was cool he had just seated himself upon a wooden bench when he saw the bishop of london and his attendants coming toward him rising he greeted gilbert foliot courteously but he felt obligated to advise the bishop that if he hoped to see the king that evening he would be disappointed gilbert blinked in surprise but the king summoned me sending a messenger to tell me that hed arrived at westminster and wanted to see me straightaway ranulf apologized and then on impulse fell in step beside the bishop in the antechamber the chamberlain had obviously been briefed for he ushered the bishop into henrys bedchamber without first announcing him figuring he had nothing to lose ranulf entered with gilbert henry was still dressed although hed removed his boots he gave ranulf a sharp glance but he did not order him from the chamber and ranulf took that as tacit permission to remain interrupting the bishops pleased speech of welcome henry said bluntly i have need of your aid my lord bishop on the morrow i am going to canterbury to do penance for my part in the archbishops death i would like you to accompany me and speak on my behalf to the monks of christ church priory my liege i would be honored gilberts eyes shone he seemed about to embrace henry before thinking better of it the fact that henry had called him by his title rather than the more intimate gilbert indicated the kings wish to observe the formalities this night and gilbert was shrewd enough to catch it nothing would give me greater pleasure good we shall be departing at dawn so it might be easier for you if you spend the night at the palace my chamberlain will see to your needs gilbert seemed reluctant to leave obviously eager to discuss henrys spiritual epiphany but hed been dismissed murmuring his good wishes he withdrew leaving henry alone in the chamber with his uncle ranulf was expecting to be dismissed too but it did not come where are your squires he asked not sure how to ease into such an intrusive conversation for what could be more meddlesome than an inquiry into the state of a mans soul i sent them off to the hall to eat henry said inadvertently giving ranulf the opening he sought are you still fasting getting a brief nod he said carefully would it not be better to wait until you reach canterbury ere you fast if you deprive yourself too severely you risk becoming ill i thought the purpose of penance was to mortify the flesh henry said with a twisted smile have you forgotten that thomas not only wore a hairshirt and braies infested with vermin but he subjected himself to a daily scourging do you think hed be impressed just because i missed a few meals is that what you want harryto impress thomas i want henry began but then he stopped and shook his head like a man weary of talking after a few moments of silence he said did you notice that gilbert asked no questions nor did he assure me there was no need for such a pilgrimage it would seem that he considers my penance at avranches as flawed as roger does why does roger think that ranulf asked even though he already knew the answer my cousin the esteemed bishop of worcester thinks that the almighty has looked into my heart and found that i repented of thomass death for all the wrong reasons and what do you think henrys shoulders twitched in what was almost a shrug hed dropped down into a windowseat and ranulf crossed the chamber knelt in the floor rushes by his side harry are you sure you want to do this henry rubbed his fingers against his aching temples i suppose i could wait for more explicit signs of divine displeasure wait until the thames turns to blood or a plague of locusts comes up and covers the land you are not pharaoh henry raised his head looking ranulf full in the face for the first time can you honestly tell me uncle that you have not wondered if this rebellion was gods punishment for thomas beckets murder if not you are most likely the only one in christendom who has not entertained that thought what i think does not matter nor does it matter what roger or gilbert foliot think we are not the ones who must do public penance at canterbury cathedral reaching out ranulf put his hand on henrys arm you are a proud man you are a king i know that we are told there is no greater glory than to humble ourselves before the almighty but that is easier for some than others if as i suspect you mean to abase yourself utterly in atonement you must be sure that this is what you truly want to do otherwise i fear you will not gain what you seekpeace of mind peace of mind henry echoed and then laughed harshly i have a greater need than that uncle i mean to ask the almighty and the sainted thomas to save my kingdom not just for my sake for all our sakes the vultures are already gathering and god help him but hal will not be able to fend them off hell be a king in name only whilst the count of flanders and the french king and the scots king carve up my domains like a michaelmas goose you think the people suffered under stephen that will look like a golden age in comparison to the misery and anarchy that would follow my defeat ranulf could not argue with that bleak assessment of hals kingship he knew that men made pilgrimages for a multitude of reasons both pure and profane some were reluctant penitents ordered to it by an imperious bishop an irate priest some sought gods mercy for a loved one a frail child an ailing wife some saw pilgrimage as a way to honor god others were driven by guilty consciences memories of past sins he did not doubt that those who humbled themselves of their own free will those who asked no specific boons in return for their suffering were the ones who came away from a pilgrimage with that peace of mind his nephew dismissed so disdainfully what would harry do if he submitted to this ordeal and nothing changed if the victory hed prayed for was denied him what does a man do when he acts out of desperation and despair and even that is not enough i will entreat the almighty he said softly to hear your prayers and he tried not to think of a conversation hed once had with his other nephew roger had assured him that god always answered prayers but sometimes he said no on friday july henry and his companions were approaching the town of canterbury as they neared the lazarhouse of st nicholas in harbledown they had their first glimpse of the cathedral in the distance henry dismounted and the hospitals master came hurrying out to meet him several of the lepers emerged from their wattleanddaub huts but they kept their distance they were clad in long russet robes and scapulars the ravages of their disease hidden by hoods for the men and thick double veils for the women henry greeted the master and then accompanied him into the chapel to pray after some hesitation the bishops of london winchester and rochester dismounted and followed too most of the men remained on their horses though for even the bravest of knights was leery of entering a lazarhouse henry and the bishops soon emerged and after he told the priest that he was granting the hospital twenty silver marks a year to be paid out of royal revenues the master thanked him profusely promising that the lepers would offer up daily prayers on his behalf if anyone thought that those poor souls needed prayers more than the king did it remained unspoken when henry returned to the others he did not remount and seeing that he meant to walk the rest of the way his men made haste to dismount too theyd covered about half a mile when they saw the westgate looming ahead henry headed not for the gate though but for the church of st dunstans by the side of the road his squires scurried after him the other men waited puzzled and when the flustered parish priest arrived none of them had any answers for him they could see a crowd gathering just inside the westgate but the church bells that would normally peal out the kings arrival were silent for henry had sent word that he wanted no royal ceremony it had been raining lightly since midmorning but as they waited for henry to emerge from the church the heavens opened and canterbury was engulfed in a summer downpour when henry finally appeared they saw that hed stripped to his shirt and chausses and removed his boots one of his squires was holding out the green wool cape that he wore when hunting and the boy looked dismayed as henry waved him away hes going to cut his feet to ribbons by the time he reaches the cathedral willem muttered to ranulf who was more concerned at the moment with henrys intention to brave the rainstorm clad only in his shirt striding forward he spoke briefly with his nephew and to the relief of the spectators henry reluctantly agreed to don the green cape as he set out the bishops and knights fell in behind him but willem delayed long enough to ask ranulf how hed convinced henry to wear the cloak i told him ranulf said that if he caught a fatal chill in the rain and died at canterbury all of christendom would conclude that his sins had been too great for st thomas to forgive willem looked at him not knowing what to say ranulf had moved on and he hastened to catch up even though he was dreading what was coming as hed never dreaded anything in his life before escorted by the city reeve and aldermen henry passed through the westgate and entered the town as he walked along st peters street his feet were soon cut and bleeding but the rain washed his bloody footprints away people lined both sides of the street heedless of the weather for they knew they were witnesses to a spectacle that none would ever forgetthe sight of a highborn king gods anointed offering up his pride to make peace with their saint thomas becket had not been universally loved even in his own city but hed always been revered by christs poor and they turned out now in large numbers the towns merchants were quick to recognize what a blessing henry was conferring upon them for once word got out that the english king had prostrated himself before the blessed martyr canterburys shrine would become the most popular pilgrimage in all of christendom but their enthusiasm was tempered with uncertainty for they did not know what was expected of them should they cheer the king for submitting to st thomas or jeer him for his part in the martyrdom the result was that for the first time within memory a king passed by in utter silence even the children and beggars watching in awed stillness if henrys bloodied bare feet were giving him pain he did not show it nor did he seem to feel the drenching rain or take notice of the crowds followed by the bishops and his knights he continued on past the churches of all saints and st helens past the kings mill the guildhall and the pillory st peters street had become high street when he halted momentarily then turned into mercery lane a passageway so narrow that more than two men could not walk abreast ahead he could see the monks waiting by the cemetery gate the new archbishop was still absent having gone to rome to get papal approval of his election but henry recognized odo the prior and walter the abbot of boxley abbey in the past hed been welcomed by the chiming of the cathedral bells and the chanting of lauds by the choir now there was only the same eerie quiet that had settled over the city they came forth to offer a solemn subdued greeting and quickly ushered him into the cathedral precincts escorting him along the path through the cemetery for laypeople the storm had turned it into a morass and henrys feet and legs were soon caked with mud he could think of few sights more desolate than a graveyard in the rain the rest of the monks were waiting in the cathedral he could see curiosity and anxiety and excitement on their faces but little overt hostility oddly enough thomas had not been that popular with his own monks had been feuding with prior odo at the time of his murder it was only the discovery of his hairshirt and whipscarred back that had awakened them to the realization that theyd had a saint in their midst show me henry said and they knew at once what he meant holding a candle aloft prior odo led the way up the nave toward the northwest transept a small altar had been set up on the spot and candle flames glimmered on something silvery what is that those are fragments of the sword of richard le bret the prior said striving to sound matteroffact and almost accomplishing it another monk behind him an anonymous voice in the shadows volunteered that he was the knight who delivered the deathblow striking with such force that he split the archbishops skull and broke his blade upon the tiles this unknown informant did not repeat what the knight had cried as he stood over the archbishops body take that for the love of my lord william the kings brother there was no need for henry and every man in the cathedral knew what had been said thomas had refused to grant william a dispensation to wed isabella de warenne and when the twentysevenyearold william died suddenly soon afterward his friends had contended that hed died of a broken heart henry had blamed becket too for wills death but as he gazed at the pieces of that broken sword it seemed so long ago to him part of another mans life kneeling he prayed earnestly to god for forgiveness and then leaned over and kissed the ground where thomas died rising to his feet he looked over at the prior i would like to see his tomb now of course my liege the stairway to the crypt is right behind you with the prior again leading the way they all descended to the cathedral undercroft it was deep in shadows and henrys eyes had to adjust before he could make out the outlines of the archbishops tomb a wall had been built around the sarcophagus rising a foot above the coffin covered by a large marble slab in each side of the wall two windows had been cut so that pilgrims could lean inside and kiss the coffin henry knelt again and began to pray the bishop of london stepped forward to join henry beside the tomb it is my honor to speak on behalf of the lord king he orders me to declare his unreserved confession on his behalf which i and others have heard in private he declares before god and before the martyr that he did not cause st thomas to be slain but freely admits that he did use such words as were the cause of his being murdered he begs the saint to forgive his offense and he agrees to return all her holdings to this holy church he has already pledged to give the cathedral the sum of thirty pounds each year and he now adds an additional ten pounds per annum so that candles may always be kept lit at the archbishops shrine he asks you to pray to the true martyr lying here beseeching him to lay aside all anger the king has come here to make atonement when gilbert was done speaking henry gave him an approving nod thank you my lord bishop turning back toward the monks he said i hereby affirm all that the bishop of london has said i ask now for your forgiveness prior odo smiled gladly my lord king gladly and embracing henry he gave him the kiss of peace while many of the monks applauded there was a lessening of tension after that as most of the men assumed the worst was over as henrys eyes moved from face to face he saw that only two knew what was coming gilbert foliot whod been forewarned and ranulf who sometimes seemed gifted with secondsight i regret the blessed martyrs death more than words can ever say but actions speak louder than words it is for that reason that i restore to the cathedral and priory all of their rights and privileges it is my pleasure to offer to st thomas four marks of pure gold a silk pall and forty librates of land in kent i have asked the prior to send for the archbishops sister so that i may make amends to her as well and i pledge to found an abbey in honor of the archbishop and nowso that there may be no doubts as to the sincerity of my repentance i willingly submit to the punishment i deserve for my part in this tragedy and ask that i be scourged for my sins with that he unfastened his cloak and removed his shirt as they realized what he intended to do a loud murmur swept through the spectators expressions of shock and distress and satisfaction all mingling as one like a river fed by smaller streams ignoring these ripples henry glanced from the bishop to the prior i would have each of the bishops and abbot walter give five lashes and then three from each one of the christchurch monks prior odo hastily whispered to one of the monks who quickly fetched a penitential whip a leather thong attached to a short handle when he offered it to the bishop of london gilbert took it as if hed been handed a live snake seeing that hed have to be the one to initiate the scourging henry said tersely do it and then knelt by the tomb thrusting his head and shoulders into one of the wall openings it was an awkward position and his back began to ache before the first touch of the whip but it had the advantage of shielding his face from his audience one small indulgence that he hoped the almighty would not begrudge him with a murmured deus vult gilbert struck his kings bared back it was a light blow as were those that followed for all of the bishops seemed determined to make the scourging a symbolic one prior odo was no less gentle and the first few monks to wield the whip were either intimidated by the circumstances or were never partisans of the archbishop for their lashes barely touched henrys flesh in the beginning henry was trying to keep count of the blows but hed soon given it up there were at least seventy monks which added up to more than two hundred strikes and he decided that was enough to know when the first blow sliced into his skin and drew blood there were indignant protests from some of his men that subsided only when he demanded silence he discovered he could measure a monks devotion to st thomas by the strength of his blows most were cautious or prudent but occasionally one of the monks would employ the whip with enough enthusiasm to raise welts despite the care that the majority were taking his back was soon stinging from the sheer number of the strokes but his real discomfort came from his hunched posture and before long he felt as if his spine were breaking in two the trapped musty air of the tomb was bothering him too bringing on several prolonged coughing fits at the start of the scourging hed sought solace in prayer but it was difficult to concentrate when his body was anticipating the feel of the lash and eventually he stopped trying to think altogether just focused upon enduring the ordeal it actually came as a surprise when he heard prior odo declare that it was done it was not easy to straighten up so stiff had his body become for a moment he felt lightheaded and had to grip the tomb for support staggering over to the central pillar he squatted down upon the floor and refused those who would have offered water or wine my penance is not over he said hoarsely i shall stay here all night offering up my prayers to the almighty and st thomas after they hurriedly conferred prior odo announced that they would be honored by his presence and they would make sure that other pilgrims were kept away so he might pray in private when henry interrupted with a curt no let any enter who wish odo looked troubled but he assured henry it would be done he beckoned then to two new arrivals and henry watched as an elderly woman and a younger man timidly drew closer my liege this is mistress rohesia and her son john you sent for them the prior added and only then did henry realize they were thomas beckets sister and nephew she had none of her brothers innate assurance the poise and polish that had made it so easy for him to walk with kings and talk with princes of the church when henry had reacted with fury to beckets latest outrage and expelled all of his family and retainers from england this stooped shy woman was one of the chief victims of his vengefulness he was shamed now by that memory further disquieted by the recollection of a heated quarrel hed had with eleanor whod argued in vain against the expulsion claiming that this interminable feuding with becket has well and truly addled your mind you may approach he said as kindly as he could called her gentle sister and asked for her pardon and grace she stammered out something unintelligible and he realized that he was only frightening her all the more for she did not know how to treat a king like a supplicant i deeply regret the wrong ive done to you and your family i would make amends the only way i canby granting you the kings mill that stands by the river stour you ought to be able to collect at least ten marks a year in rental payments take it with my blessings rohesia looked dumbfounded but her sons smile was bright enough to light the darkest shadows of the crypt he began to declare their eternal gratitude but gilbert foliot accurately read the exhaustion on henrys face and tactfully steered them away my lord king willem was leaning over looking so concerned that henry somehow managed to find a smile for him what would you have us do now you may go willem there is no need for any of you to remain the earl frowned i do not want to leave you alone my liege i will not be alone henry said stifling a cough i will have st thomas to keep me company once willem would have been sure that was a jest now he no longer knew all afternoon and well into the evening pilgrims were admitted to the crypt where they made offerings to the monk keeping vigil by the shrine prayed to st thomas and watched the king of england do penance some were surreptitious about it others gawked openly but henry was always aware of their eyes upon him kneeling by the tomb of the man whod once been a beloved friend then a hated enemy hed silently entreated the almighty to forgive him interspersing these pleas with the latin prayers hed learned in childhood refusing to eat or drink or even to pass water he lay full length upon the cold floor of the crypt as he uttered the familiar words of the confiteor the other pilgrims did not share his knowledge of latin but they knew the responses to the mass and so when he whispered confiteor deo omnipotenti beatae mariae semper virgini beato michaeli archangelo beato ioanni baptistae sanctis apostolis petro et paulo et omnibus sanctis quita peccavi nimus cogitatione verbo et opere mea culpa mea culpa mea maxima culpa they understood that he was confessing to god the blessed mary the archangel the apostles and the saints that he had sinned exceedingly in thought word and deed hed begun by alternating pleas to god and st thomas but after a while hed stopped praying to thomas for he felt as if his words were falling into a void the archbishop did not seem to be listening his fatigue was beginning to affect his thinking when he recited the litany of the saints he found himself unable to remember who came first the patriarchs and prophets or the apostles after vespers the tide of pilgrims slowed to a trickle but a new monk had taken up the vigil and he was a talker introducing himself as brother benedict he informed henry that he was collecting accounts of st thomass miracles so that they might be saved for posterity pointing to a pile of crutches stacked in a corner he explained that they had been abandoned by cripples whod been healed by the saints mercy with his own eyes hed seen people cured of leprosy blindness the palsy a canon of oseney was cured of the falling sickness and a templar from chester was healed of a bowel ailment but he only included those miracles that could be verified he assured henry he did not intend to report one of his favorite stories alas for he could find no witnesses to confirm its accuracy he then proceeded to tell henry a preposterous tale of a starling that had been taught to recite a prayer to the blessed martyr the bird had been attacked by a hawka kite he believed it wasand invoked the prayer as it was caught in the kites talons the hawk was at once struck dead he recounted breathlessly henry did his best to block out that droning voice unwilling to give way to anger during his time of penance brother benedict was not making it easy however as the night wore on his body ailments were becoming more and more difficult to ignore his lacerated back was throbbing so was his head his gashed feet had begun to bleed again and his bladder felt full to bursting although hed eaten nothing but bread for almost a week he was not hungry but his thirst was wellnigh intolerable hed put his shirt on again it did little to shield him though from the damp chill of the crypt with a flicker of very grim humor he recalled ranulfs warning and entertained himself by imagining the great scandal should he be found dead on the morrow with an effort he came back to the here and now troubled that his thoughts were wandering like this he ought to be thinking only of his sins his muscles were cramping and stiffening so that he had to pull himself upright by holding on to the marble top of the sarcophagus brother benedict was still chattering on describing the drowning of a little boy of rochester hed fallen into the river medway in midafternoon had not been dragged out till vespers had rung but his mother refused to despair and measured his body with a thread and promised st thomas a silver thread of the same length if he saved her son and lo and behold the child moaned and stirred and vomited up a barrel full of river water even though theyd first hung him by his feet and not a drop did he spit out not that the blessed martyr is one to be trifled with there have been sinners who sought his aid and then did not fulfill their vows as promised and retribution was always swift i myself witnessed a sad case where a lame boy fell asleep with his head on the tomb he had a vision of st thomas who rebuked him for his disrespect and said go hence i will do nothing for you his parents pleaded but our saint would not relent henry began to recite the pater noster the first prayer to come to mind in hope of drowning the monk out fiat voluntas tua sicut in caelo et in terra he murmured the words coming from memory as his thoughts began to stray again was there a way to murder brother benedict and make it seem as if hed been smitten by the wrath of the unforgiving thomas a vengeful saint was surely a contradiction in terms but he alone seemed to think so he was no longer shivering and when he put his hand to his forehead it felt hot hed been running a fever intermittently for days now and he supposed neither the drenching nor the hours spent on his knees had done his aching body any good focusing again upon prayer he began to repeat the litany almost at random agnus dei qui tollis peccata mundi miserere nobis and to his great relief the son of god heard his plea and showed mercy for brother benedict rose from his post and excused himself saying that there would be no more pilgrims that night and he hoped to get a few hours sleep before matins gathering up his offerings he politely wished henry gods peace and shuffled off to bed leaving henry alone in the crypt with the dead and the ghost of the murdered archbishop at least it seemed that way to henry he had not been able to invoke the saints presence but it was easier to imagine thomass earthly spirit lurking in the shadows watching his abasement with sardonic amusement for thomas had once had a quick wit a playful humor a droll sense of mockery hed lost that humor though as soon as hed put the sacred pallium about his neck yet another mystery that henry could not fathom had the man hed known and trusted and loved ever truly existed or had he been a fiction from the very first a chimera conjured up out of cobwebs and moonbeams henry desperately wanted to know the answer an answer only thomas becket could give him it is just the two of us now thomas no one else can hear our secrets so why not talk to pass the time we have hours to go till dawn time enough for honesty if nothing else pushing himself away from the tomb he walked toward the center of the crypt noting with bemusement that he left a trail of blood and mud ranulf said something once that ive never forgotten he thought that his welsh friend hywelyou remember the poetprincesaw you with the clearest eye saying that you reminded him of a chameleon changing your color to reflect your surroundings the perfect clerk the perfect royal chancellor and then the perfect archbishop was he right thomas he cocked his head hearing only the silence of the grave i suppose youd rather talk about the killing fair enough i never wanted your death i swear this to you upon the lives of my children but you know that already why am i so sure because roger showed me a letter written by your subdeacon william fitz stephen ive restored him to royal favor by the way in fact he and his brother ralph are cosheriffs of gloucestershire now life goes on what was i saying ah yes the letter fitz stephen wrote that you told the killers that you did not believe they came from the king from me so there really is no reason to swear my innocence upon holy relics is there you know the truth of course roger knew the truth too and was the one man with the ballocks to say it straight out to my face i may not be guilty he pointed out but neither am i innocent i daresay you agree with him no he waited heaving a sigh that echoed in the stillness come thomas hold up your part of the conversation you need not do anything dramatic like loosing a thunderbolt or performing one of your miracles but at the least you could extinguish a few candles to show me you are paying attention surely that is not too much to ask he was feeling lightheaded again and sank down upon the floor slumping back against one of the pillars i sound like a drunkard or a madmanmayhap both but just between you and me talking to a ghost makes as much sense as talking to a saint what else do you want to know thomas did i grieve for you no i did not my grief was for myself for i knew at once that youd trapped me well and truly for you are not innocent either my lord archbishop you sought your martyrdom you craved it even lusted after it for all i know you could have escaped thomas had so many opportunities to evade your killers but you did not did you you had to confront them had to taunt them was it true that you called fitz urse a pimp henry laughed unsteadily ending in a cough they went unpunished you know you insisted that only the church could punish its own so i could do nothing to them and the pope could only send them off on pilgrimage to the holy land with a stern warning to mend their evil ways christ almighty thomas surely you see the irony of that the lunacy for i will not lie to gain your pardon i was right to want to try degraded priests in my courts your way turned justice into a farce and i will never understand why you could not see that henry leaned forward rested his head upon his drawnup knees he was either burning up with fever or losing his mind sancte thoma he mumbled requiescat in pace but there was as much pain as mockery in his voice and when he looked up he saw the crypt through a haze of hot tears do you know why i did not grieve for you when you died thomas because id already done my grieving i trusted you i had faith in you i loved you more than my own brother and then you turned on me but it need not have been that way you could have served both me and the almighty and what a partnership we could have forged what we could not have done together getting to his feet with difficulty he had to hold on to the pillar for his head was spinning when i told you that i would raise you up to the archbishopric you said you would not want to put our friendship at risk and i assured you that it would not happen that i was not so prideful that i saw god as a rival do you remember what i said that the almighty and i would not be in contention for your immortal soul why could you not believe me thomas his tears were falling faster now but there was no one to see them i am truly and grievously sorry that our path led us to this place this night i do mourn you thomas but do i think you are a saint gods truth i do not know you are the only one who can answer that question my lord archbishop we both know you could never resist a challenge so take it up prove my doubts are unfounded prove me wrong dropping to his knees he winced at the pain that action caused his fevered battered body st thomas he said in a low husky voice guard my realm henry heard mass at daybreak the next morning warned the citizens of canterbury that there was danger of a flemish invasion and advised them to move their goods beyond the river medway he set out for london then reaching the city the following day where he was welcomed enthusiastically by the citizens who escorted him through the streets to his palace at westminster by this time he was running a high fever and utterly exhausted body and soul he took to his bed henry had been bled by his physician earlier in the day and advised to rest until he regained his strength but even when he was ill he found it hard to stay abed and by the afternoon he was up and dressed conferring with his court officials and getting reports from his scouts who were watching for the flemish fleet the soles of his feet had been badly bruised and cut by the canterbury cobblestones and so he made one concession to his bodys needs and remained on the settle in his bedchamber while he conducted affairs of state he was still awaiting word from the north where the scots king was menacing the royal castle at alnwick but he was finding it difficult to recapture his sense of urgency he felt numb depleted of all his reserves as if hed gambled everything on one roll of the dice and lost soon after vespers the arrival of the bishop of worcester was announced roger swept into the chamber like a summer wind dark eyes glowing as elated as henry had ever seen him striding forward he engulfed henry in an exuberant embrace behavior so unlike roger that henry voiced no complaints although his cousins hug was pressing painfully against his injured back releasing him at last roger sank to his knees and kissed henrys hand i have never been so proud of you cousin he said i know what courage it took to humble yourself like that whatever else you may accomplish in this life i truly believe friday was your finest hour so you are saying that from now on it is all downhill henrys attempt at humor could not disguise the pleasure that rogers words had given him his cousin had never been one for lavish effusive or fawning praise retaking his seat he gestured for the other man to join him on the settle and signaled for wine roger had fully intended to discuss henrys penance at length wanting to hear all the details of this blessed reconciliation but as he looked more closely at his cousin he was startled into blurting out tactlessly jesu you look like youve been camping at deaths door id heard you were ailing but i did not realize how ill you truly were you have seen a doctor i trust when henry brushed off his concern with predictable impatience that reassured roger somewhat ill not stay long he said for you ought to be in bed ere i go though what is the news from the north has alnwick fallen yet he realized at once how pessimistic that sounded as if he expected defeat but it was too late to call his words back to his surprise though henry did not react and he did not take that to be a good sign the last i heard henry said william de vesci is still holding out at alnwick i suppose you know that the rebels have seized norwich northampton and nottingham you may not know that my son and the count of flanders have been waiting at gravelines intending to launch their invasion once the weather clears for all i know they could be landing on english beaches even as we speak he delivered this alarming news with an eerie lack of emotion almost as if he were relating another mans troubles and roger felt a chill that seemed oddly out of place on a summer evening when had harry ever sounded listless or fatalistic ill go now he said so you may get some rest but ill be back in the morning henry had not meant to ask but as roger reached the door he heard himself saying suddenly rogerdo you think thomas forgave me roger turned with a surprised smile i know he did he said and henry whod never had reason to envy other men felt a sharp pang wishing that he shared rogers utter certainty his steadfast faith and his serene acceptance of gods will henry was stretched out upon the settle dozing one of his squires was sitting in the floor rushes beside the settle gently rubbing ointment into the wounds on his kings feet others moved quietly around the chamber making as little noise as possible it was still early for one who kept nightowl hours but henrys weary body was asserting itself after days of abuse and neglect as he drifted down into sleep the last sound he heard was the distant chiming of church bells when he awakened he had no idea how much time had elapsed candles still burned and warin was still tending to his injured feet he propped himself up on an elbow and it was then that he heard the voices the clamor that had chased away his sleep what is it someone wanted to see you my liege warin explained and when the chamberlain said you were sleeping and he must wait till the morrow he began to argue i am so sorry that you were disturbed who is it henry called out and the chamberlain came into his line of sight it is a messenger my lord from the north i told him to come back but he is most insistent he says you know himbrien one of sir ralf de glanvilles men let him enter henry commanded his voice even more raspy than usual sitting up he swung his legs over the side of the settle but warin was close enough to see that hed lost color his feverish flush fading into an ashen pallor as he watched the door the man ushered into the chamber was indeed known to him he looked as haggard and gaunt as his king and he dropped to his knees like one thankful for a moments rest forgive me sire but ive scarcely eaten or slept these four days gone so urgent was my news henry closed his eyes for a heartbeat tell me he said grimly hold nothing back brien had been given a wine cup and drained the contents in several swallows when he lowered the cup and looked at henry there was such blazing joy upon his face that henry caught his breath my liege i bring you wondrous news as good as you could wish the scots king has been taken captive by my lord de glanville and with him all his barons one of henrys squires let out a jubilant shout and the other men in the chamber began to exclaim and praise god henry was not yet ready to believe though is this true brien swear to me it is so yes sire by my faith it is so soon after dawn on saturday we surprised the scots king in the meadows before the walls of alnwick castle my lord de glanville and the sheriff of yorkshire met william de vesci at newcastle on friday last where hed gone to seek aid for alnwick he told us that the scots king had sent the bulk of his army off to ravage northumbria and he had remained behind with only sixty knights we set out at once had ridden more than twenty miles before the sun had risen a thick fog settled in during the night but we continued on sure that god was with us when we emerged from the mists we saw the scots king breaking his fast with his knights at first he thought we were his own men returning and by the time he realized the truth it was too late gods bones henry breathed what proof have you of this brien grinned my lord knew that was the first question youd ask my liege i bear a letter from sir ralf attesting to all that ive told you and on the morrow you ought to receive further confirmation from the archbishop of york for he was dispatching a messenger too he was not as fast a rider as me though henry snatched up the letter brien was holding out but he made no attempt to read it tell me the rest he said and brien needed no urging i have to admit sire that he fought valiantly spurred his stallion into our midst once he realized he was trapped between us and the castle but one of our men speared his fine grey destrier and the kings legs were pinned when the beast fell he surrendered to my lord de glanville and was taken under guard back to newcastle and then on to richmond that traitor roger de mowbray fled like a hare before hounds but none of the scots knights would abandon their liege lord and surrendered when he did brien was not happy at having to compliment his scots foes but he was a fair man and he added they acquitted themselves well my liege brave men all he was being offered more wine which he accepted happily you are indeed favored by god my lord king i am honored to be the one to bring you such glad tidings henry laughed ah brien you will want for nothing for the rest of your born days he promised land gold it will all be yours for the asking brien laughed too for now my lord i ask only for a bed and a meal to fill my empty belly others were crowding into the bedchamber now drawn by the uproar and in the ensuing pandemonium it was left to henrys squire warin to realize the full significance of briens message my lord he cried tugging on henrys sleeve in his urgency to be heard brien said that the scots king was captured on saturday around dawn my liege that was when you were completing your penance at st thomass tomb there were exclamations of wonder and most of the men made the sign of the cross henry stared at the squire and then sat down abruptly on the settle you are right warin he said in awe this is indeed his doing word was spreading like wildfire throughout the palace and henrys bedchamber was soon thronged with celebrants both jubilant and reverent willem and ranulf had pushed their way through to henrys side and gilbert foliot had also succeeded in reaching the king my lord he cried should we ring the bells to awaken the city no henry said let them sleep the morning will come soon enough glancing around he knew that none of these blissful boisterous men would get a wink of sleep neither would he for his exhaustion was magically vanished his fever forgotten we might as well move these revelries over to the great hall he said grinning when his declaration was met with raucous cheers he knew these men would have cheered if hed announced they must all take holy vows i do want to awaken my cousin the bishop of worcester he said send someone to fetch him gilbert and once he gets here i want to go to the abbey church and give thanks to st thomas for our victory for his miracle for his twohundredseventymile dash brien was rewarded by henry with ten liveries of land and an estate in norfolk hal and the count of flanders had decided to send their fleet on ahead of them and their ships had sailed into the same storm that had inundated canterbury during those hours that henry did penance for his sins their fleet was scattered by the high winds and the threat of invasion was over just as people gave credit to the martyred archbishop for the capture of henrys greatest enemy they saw the dispersal of the flemish fleet as yet another proof of st thomass favor chapter eighteen july northampton england ranulf halted on the steps of the great hall watching as a large group of horsemen rode into the castle bailey when he recognized their leader as henrys illegitimate son he hastened over to bid geoff welcome and as soon as the latter dismounted they embraced with the euphoria that all of henrys supporters shared these days ive brought seven hundred knights with me geoff said proudly can we find beds for them all well manage ranulf assured him your men are going to be disappointed though for the fighting is done geoff blinked in surprise all done he asked trying to conceal his own disappointment i heard that the garrison at huntingdon castle surrendered but what about hugh bigod and the earl of derby hugh bigod skulked out of his lair and pleaded for the kings mercy two days ago and on tuesday we will be receiving the submissions of the earl of derby the earl of leicesters constable roger mowbray and our disgruntled bishop hugh of durham geoff could only shake his head in amazement then the rebellion in england is truly over i think that happened the moment the scots king was taken at alnwick for all the talk of rats deserting a sinking ship they have nothing on rebel lords trying to save their skins they damned near trampled themselves in their rush to make peace with the king speaking of kings you missed quite a spectacle this mornthe arrival of the scots king i would have enjoyed seeing that geoff said with vengefulness that he knew did not befit a bishopelect but he did not care wanting to savor every moment of their victory over henrys enemies was he taken before my lord father in shackles no but he arrived with his feet tied under his horse an affront not usually inflicted upon kings for all that he calls himself william the lion he seemed more like a docile stable cat to me he managed to cling to his dignity but there was no bravado none at all he is going to have to pay a huge price for his freedom and he well knows it leaving the castle steward to figure out where to lodge these new arrivals they started across the bailey youll be a sight to gladden your fathers eyes ranulf said he was right proud of your triumphs in the north who knew you had the makings of a firstrate battle commander he joked amused when geoff actually blushed i should warn you though lad that your father is hobbling about with a crutch and he is as bad a patient as youd expect him to be was he wounded in the siege of huntingdon geoff asked sounding so alarmed that ranulf hastened to offer reassurances explaining that henry had been injured the day before when the templar tostes de st omers horse had lashed out suddenly striking the king in the leg that allayed some but not all of geoffs concerns for he knew how easily wounds could become infected hed never forgotten the fate of a boyhood friend whod died in agony after stepping on a rusty nail once they entered the great hall he headed for the dais so eager to see his father that he barely heard the greetings and congratulations trailing in his wake henry was just as delighted to see his son and waved geoff up onto the dais so they could talk with a modicum of privacy he brushed off geoffs concerns for his injury saying wryly it is downright embarrassing getting kicked by a horse at my age and it was not even my horse ordering chairs for geoff and ranulf he did his best to get his aching leg comfortable on a cushioned footstool and then made his son very happy by asking to hear all about geoffs military exploits geoff needed no further urging and launched into a detailed account of the captures of roger mowbrays castles at kinnardferry and kirkby malzeard and his success in penning up the rebel garrison at thirsk henry listened attentively asked all the right questions and waited until geoff was done before sharing his own news with his son a messenger reached me this morn with unwelcome word from normandy after learning that id sailed for england the french king recalled hal and the count of flanders and they are now laying siege to rouen youll be returning then to normandy geoff exclaimed his eyes alight may i go with you it may be our only chance to fight side by side henry had never understood the appeal that war held for other men even in his youth hed not been bedazzled by dreams of glory had always looked upon war as a necessary evil a kings last resort youre sounding rather bloodthirsty for a bishop lad he teased speaking of that we will have to get the popes approval of your election once the rebellion is finally over would you fancy going to rome yourself let me know if so and ill make the necessary arrangements geoffs face shadowed and he glanced away saying nothing henry did not notice ranulf did though he knew most people would share henrys view that he was bestowing a great honor upon his son especially one born out of wedlock but ranulf had learned a hard lesson with his own eldestthat sons did not always share their fathers aspirations and he understood as few others did that an unwanted honor could be a heavy burden giving the reluctant bishop a sympathetic look he sought to change the subject before the silence could become awkward and admitted that he hoped to go home to wales now that the rebellion in england was won i wish there were a way to lure you and lady rhiannon to my court and keep you here henry said but i know i cannot compete with the siren songs of wales go with my blessings uncle youve more than paid your dues as have your welsh countrymen turning to geoff he lavished praise upon his welsh ally rhys ap gruffydd not only has he kept the peace along the marches rhys even led a contingent of welshmen to fight for me in england laying siege to derbys stronghold at tutbury geoff was impressed the welsh are usually ones for taking advantage of english strife at once regretting his candor he glanced apologetically at ranulf no offense uncle how will you reward rhys for his loyalty papa by giving him what he most wantsa free hand in wales i wish it were so easy to reward your rogue prince ranulf davydd ab owain has been no less steadfast for me than rhys but now he is asking for a boon in return one id rather not bestow upon him what does he want ranulf asked curiously horses cattle gold surely not a border castle i doubt even davydd would be that brazen what he wants henry said is my sister did you notice that benedictine monk over there ranulf that is brother simon sent from basingwerk abbey to ask for emmas hand in marriage davydd wants to be able to boast that he is the king of englands brotherinlaw i suppose he also knows that shed bring a few english manors as her marriage portion i daresay hes heard that she is a beauty too and that never hurts id as soon tell him nay i liked hywel the brother he killed and i agree with your dismal view of his character but i will probably have to give my consent if i hope to keep the peace along the border as thinskinned as davydd is hes like to take a refusal as a mortal insult yes ranulf agreed reluctantly he would he did not know emma well at all remembered her as very fair and rather prideful but he sympathized with any woman yoked to davydd ab owain what will emma think of this henry shrugged she probably will not like it much at first my family seems cursed with strongwilled women and emma is definitely one of them but it is a good match for her whatever his other failings davydd is a prince if she bears him sons they can expect to rule over most of gwynedd one day geoff did not know the welsh prince at all and barely knew his aunt emma so he did not have any real interest in whether they wed or not do you know what i find most miraculous papa that the scots king was captured at the very same hour that you were concluding your penance at canterbury henry laughed a laugh geoff had not heard in quite a while thomas was ever one for showing off he said with a grin and he always had a flair for drama he wanted there to be no doubts whatsoever that he and the almighty had forgiven me not even louis capet can argue otherwise now glancing from his son to his uncle he surprised them then by offering a rare unguarded glimpse into the depths of his soul saying quietly it is a blessing to be at peace with god againand with thomas i shall honor st thomas for the rest of my days geoff promised and henrys gaze lingered upon his face you are my true son geoff the others they are the baseborn ones the bastards geoff was speechless swallowing with difficulty he blinked back tears which henry and ranulf tactfully pretended not to see looking from one to the other ranulf felt a deep and abiding gratitude that harrys wounds no longer bled god willing mayhap now they might begin to heal you asked me once if i thought thomas was a saint he said smiling who could have guessed that it would be thomas himself whod answer you once he was satisfied that the english rebellion was quelled henry turned his attention to ending hostilities in france and landed at barfleur on august exactly one month since hed sailed for england hed brought back with him the earls of leicester and chester and the unfortunate scots king and after depositing them safely at falaise he struck out for rouen by the night of august he was within fifteen miles of the city and ordered his men to make camp for the night intending to enter rouen on the morrow lifting a smoldering oil lamp henry leaned over to illuminate a parchment map take a look at this he directed and rhys ap gruffydds son hywel crossed the tent to study the map rhys had dispatched hywel as a gesture of solidarity at the start of the rebellion and since henry now had one thousand of rhyss welshmen at his disposal it made sense to put them under hywels command this is rouen here it is not an easy city to besiege protected by the river seine on one side and by hills on the other ive been told that the french did not have enough men to surround the city and they have concentrated upon the east they are employing their soldiers in eighthour shifts so that they can continue bombarding rouen day and night with their siege engines and crossbowmen but because the townsmen still control the bridge to the west they have continued to bring in supplies and need not fear being starved into submission so we can march right into the town through the west gate hywel said marveling at the ineptitude of the french commanders it sounds like a waste of time effort money and men what is the point of laying siege to a city unless they are cut off from reinforcements youd have to take that up with louis capet henry said cheerfully as for me i am just thankful that my foes are conducting this campaign with the military skills of a mother abbess look over here hywel this area east of rouen is heavily wooded i well remember the havoc you welsh wreaked upon my men on my last incursion into wales it was like fighting phantoms forest demons whod strike without warning then fade back into the shadows ere we could retaliate what i propose is turning your men loose upon our french friends can you circle around behind their lines and cut off their supply wagons hywel grinned i thought you were going to offer us a challenge that will be too easy henry grinned too i promise to find you something more perilous next time he said and then turned as one of his men ducked under the tent flap my liege a man has just ridden into camp bold as you please and asked to see you he said to tell youthis is going to sound daft but he said planta genesta he sounded so puzzled that henry burst out laughing i will see him straightaway he said and dismissed the other men in his tent allowing only willem to remain as they awaited the mysterious stranger i am not going to ask willem said at last and henry took pity on him saying with a smile planta genesta is the latin name for the broom plant my father liked to wear a sprig on his cap and when i was thinking of a code word that just came to mind i take it i am about to meet one of your spies one of the best willem one of the very best henry said as a young man was ushered into the tent he was as dark as a saracen with unfashionably long hair and slanted black eyes that laughed up at henry as he knelt before the king willem henry said meetwell you may call him luc gesturing for his visitor to rise he pointed toward the table there is a flagon of wine help yourself why are you not at the siege with louis luc rose as lithely as a cat and then strode over to pour himself some wine the french king heard an alarming rumor that youd sailed for normandy i kindly volunteered to ride to barfleur and keep vigil for it occurred to me that would be an easy way to pass on my report once you arrived it was a surprise and a pleasant one to find you almost within hailing distance of the city walls your eerie ability to appear in a puff of smoke has saved me a twoday ride glad to oblige henry said so louis does not know for certes that i left england the way his agents serve him it is a wonder he even knows about the sinking of the white ship luc grinned he is already out of sorts sure that st laurence is sorely offended with him wait till the morrow when he finds you in the city hell think hes died and gone to hell we can only hope henry had been in the saddle since dawn and his injured leg was throbbing sitting on his bed he swung the leg up and propped a pillow under it why does louis think hes affronted a saint what did he dohear mass only twice in one day instead of his customary three times no my liege the saint has a greater grievance than that luc finished his wine went to pour more louis has always revered st laurence and so he proposed to the citizens of rouen that both sides observe a truce in honor of the saints day they quickly agreed and this morning they opened the gates and the townspeople began to venture forth they were soon playing games and dancing and some of the knights from the garrison staged a mock tourney all within sight of the french army many of the younger men and women gathered by the riverbank and began to shout insults across the water the count of flanders was enraged by their mockery and he and a few other lordsthe counts of dreux and blois and evreuxsought out the king and urged him to catch the townsmen off guard and launch a surprise attack henry had lain back on the bed sitting upright at that he said with a tight smile let me guess what happened next louis was horrified by the very idea of such sacrilege refused to consider breaking the truce and then let himself be talked into it youd have made a fine prophet my liege lucs smile held no more humor than henrys that is exactly what happened obviously something went amiss though or louis would not be back in camp brooding over the wrong done st laurence why did their surprise attack fail st laurence was not pleased with their doubledealing two monks had gone up into the bell tower which offered a clear view of the french camp they saw the stealthy preparations under way and began frantically ringing the bell if not for their warning rouen might have been lost as it was the citizens fled back into the town and by the time the french reached the walls with their scaling ladders the gates were barred and men were ready for them there was fierce handtohand fighting on the walls but the french were driven back when louis sent me off to watch for you they were going at it like stags in rut trading accusations and blame for the blunder louis seems to go stark raving mad in august willem observed last year it was verneuil and now this henry nodded but he was not fully listening he opened his mouth stopped and then said abruptly what of my son did he approve this attack no my lord king he was not happy with it argued that it was dishonorable to violate their own truce his knights were disapproving too especially will marshal they truly believe in the chivalric code may god pity their innocent young souls but lord hals protest was brushed aside theythey do not pay much heed to his opinions henry scowled taking umbrage that these men should dare to disrespect his son the irrationality of it did not escape him but that awareness did nothing to assuage his indignation hal had been ill served by those he had most reason to trusthis fatherinlaw the french king his maternal uncles and his mother above all his mother rousing himself he expressed his thanks to luc suggesting that the young spy might want to claim his reward now rather than continuing his clandestine activities he was not surprised when luc declined insisting that he was not at risk that hed tell the french king he was captured by henrys men henry did not argue for hed encountered men like luc before men who thrived on danger who needed it as others needed air and food it was easier to understand the porteclie de mauzes those who acted only out of selfinterest going to a coffer he drew out a pouch heavy with coins and luc smiled tucking it safely away in his tunic before he accepted willems offer to find him a meal and a bed henry bade them good night pleased with willems action the other man had learned to read his moods well sensing that he was distracted and wanted time alone once theyd departed henry dropped to his knees ignoring the discomfort of his painful thigh his thoughts of hal had sent his spirits into a downward spiral forcing him to dwell upon memories and regrets that served for naught just as hed prayed at canterbury st thomas guard my realm he lowered his head now and whispered st thomas save my son the french king had suffered a restless wakeful night and stayed abed the next morning exhausted and disquieted and reluctant to face the day hed finally fallen asleep only to have his dream disturbed by an insistent voice crying out my lord king opening his eyes he saw one of his squires bending over the bed forgive me but you must wake up my liege louis sat up with a groan smothering a yawn over his squires shoulder he could see other men crowding into the tent recognized his sonsinlaw the count of blois and hal and behind them several bishops and flemish lords they all looked so somber that he yearned to go back to sleep not wanting to deal with the troubles they were about to thrust upon him what is it he asked irritably i was not to be disturbed and what is that infernal noise church bells the archbishop of sens said sounding just as vexed as louis every church bell in rouen is pealing chiming to welcome the english king into the city hes here louis rarely cursed but those closest to the bed thought they heard him mutter something that sounded very much like an obscenity fully awake now the french king winced at the joyful sound of the bells knowing it was the death knell of his hopes to capture rouen the day after he rode into rouen henry sent his welsh to harass the french supply lines they were highly successful capturing and destroying more than forty wagons loaded with food and wine the following day henry took the offensive opening the city gates and sending out men to fill in the defensive ditch that separated the foes making it possible for a charge by his knights when he led his army out of the city the french scrambled to meet them and in the clash that followed the french took the worst of it some were taken prisoner and the count of flanders saw another of his brothers struck down peter whod renounced the bishopric of cambrai after matthews death in order to become count of boulogne was seriously wounded that night louis sent the archbishop of sens and the count of blois to henry seeking a truce so he could withdraw his army to malaunay promising to meet with the english on the morrow when henry agreed louis pretended to set up camp at malaunay but under cover of darkness he fled for the safety of french territory he then requested a conference at gisors on september and once more henry agreed chapter nineteen september gisors norman vexin when he reached the conference elm at gisors henry saw that the french were already there louis was flanked by his bishops and barons while the count of flanders was standing apart with his own men and henry wondered if there were cracks showing in their alliance what interested him the most though was that hal and geoffrey had also distanced themselves from the french king he reined in before louis who waited for him to dismount and looked perplexed when he did not welcome my lord king louis said once it was apparent that henry was not going to speak first it is our hope that we may agree to a truce in order to put an end to this unfortunate war henry was staring at the sons hed not seen in a year hal looked no different cutting a handsome figure in a crimson tunic decorated with gold thread and a furtrimmed mantle casually thrown over his shoulder he did not meet henrys eyes glancing away when he realized his father was watching him geoffrey had experienced an impressive growth spurt was taller than henry remembered but he was still some inches shorter than hal and richard he was more composed than his elder brother returning henrys gaze with a respectful nod of acknowledgment henry swung back to the french king where is richard louis smiled sympathetically one father to another alas richard is balking at taking part in the council when we summoned him he refused to come he is young and hotheaded as were we all at his age stepping forward he gestured expansively shall you dismount so that we may talk if richard is not here what is there to talk about louis did his best to ignore henrys brusque tone whilst richards absence is regrettable it need not prevent us from reaching an accommodation come and we shall discuss it further i think not henry said tersely and the count of flanders strode over casting louis a glance of poorly concealed impatience we are willing to agree to a truce that specifically excludes richard you may deal with him as you see fit that is no concern of ours i see henry looked from one to the other then back at his sons i will grant you a truce of three weeks we shall meet again at michaelmas i will notify you where the council is to be held when they realized that he was about to depart louis and philip exchanged troubled looks and the fleming said sharply wait my lord we need to talk over the terms of peace henry pricked his stallion with his spurs and the animal leaped forward as philip jumped out of the way he glanced over his shoulder you will learn my terms at michaelmas his men followed and willem soon spurred his horse to ride at henrys side what now he asked do we go into poitou to rein richard in yes henry looked over at the other man and then slowly shook his head richard will long remember this birthday what do you mean today henry said richard turned seventeen richard and his men were encamped by the river vienne southeast of poitiers morale was low for theyd been retreating steadily from the angevin forces under maurice de craon they did not have sufficient numbers to meet henrys commander on the field dusk was beginning to darken the sky as raoul de faye stormed out of richards tent the head of his household knights came quickly to his side but when raoul angrily shook his head the man asked no questions come and eat my lord he said instead gesturing toward an open fire where a group of men were clustered around a large pot raoul shook his head again for his latest quarrel with richard had taken away his appetite but the air was redolent with the enticing aroma of venison stew and he was about to change his mind when a sudden shout heralded the arrival of riders to raouls vast relief the lead horseman was a familiar figure and he hastened over to bid saldebreuil de sanzay welcome once greetings had been exchanged and saldebreuils men sent off to share the supper raoul grasped the constables arm and drew him aside thank god you are here mayhap you can talk some sense into richard ive been unable to convince him that we must surrender we never recovered from our losses in saintes and our numbers have been dwindling daily it was bad enough when we were running from de craon but our scouts report that the english king has now joined the hunt too is encamped less than ten miles away richard still refuses to yield though that boy could teach a mule about stubbornness take me to him saldebreuil said once raoul had run out of breath i have news he needs to hear and he fell in step beside raoul as the two men headed toward richards tent richard was alone staring down at a crudely drawn map of poitou as he grimly plotted out lines of retreat he glanced up with a surprised smile that quickly faded as he studied the constables face i am not going to like what youve come to tell me am i no my lord richard you are not id come to warn you that your lord father is on your trail it seems you know that already but you do not know what happened at gisors a fortnight ago that craven council of theirs richard said scornfully what of it your brothers and the french king and the count of flanders have served you up as a scapegoat to the english king they struck a truce with henry that excludes you in other words lad you are on your own can expect no aid from your socalled allies richards intake of breath was sharp enough to be audible raoul indulged in a flare of temper calling henry various colorful names that were not flattering calling louis even worse saldebreuil waited patiently until he was done and then limped across the tent coming to a halt in front of eleanors son it is over richard he said softly it is time to go to your father and seek his forgiveness richard reacted as if hed been stung recoiling violently no i will not do that i will never abandon my mother listen to us richard raoul entreated eleanor is my niece and i love her dearly but there is nothing more you can do for her the war is lost no saldebreuil reached out and caught richards arm in a grip too tight to shake off his voice though was kind even gentle as he said you can no longer hope to save your mother now you must save yourself she would expect no less from you do you truly believe shed want you to sacrifice yourself for her sake richards mouth contorted and he jerked free of the older mans hold rot in hell he cried all of you can rot in hell raoul started after him as he plunged out of the tent but halted when saldebreuil said no raoul he needs time let him go richards flight from his tent had not stopped there so great was his need to get away that he did not even wait for his stallion to be saddled instead took the horse of one of their scouts leaving the man staring after him in astonishment once he was out of the camp he gave the horse its head and urged it on racing the wind and his own doubts common sense told him that saldebreuil and raoul were right but he still saw surrender as shameful as a betrayal of the person he loved most in the world how could he do that to her he knew she was relying upon him to gain her freedom if he gave up what hope would she have he diverted some of his pain into rage dredging up memories of the worst curses hed ever heard his father utter the french king was a fainthearted misbegotten weasel not worthy to wear a crown the count of flanders was a selfseeker of the worst sort one whod pawn his honor for the mere promise of profit the french lords were spineless lackeys the flemings no better his brothers were beneath contempt hal a swaggering emptyheaded puppet and geoffrey a backstabbing sneak he could almost believe they were foundlings for how else explain their treachery and now what he was cornered trapped with no way out hed gone up against the aquilon the north wind and had been found wanting what mercy could he expect from his father hed be publicly humiliated shamed tethered like a ladys pet spaniel he was a man grown but his father would never see that the years would go by and nothing would change aquitaine would not be his as long as his father drew breath and his mother would grow old in an english prison her exile ended only by death twilight had given way to full night but he hadnt noticed it was not until he saw the glow of campfires in the distance that he realized how much time had passed and how far hed ridden halting his mount he gazed down at those flickering fires in his fathers camp during the course of this wild wretched ride hed swung back and forth between anger defiance and despair spitting out curses and blinking back tears that he blamed on the winds edge whispering prayers only god could hear but he understood now where the almighty had been leading him for an endless time he sat there absently patting the neck of his lathered mount as he watched the soldiers move about below him and then before he could repent of it he spurred the horse down the hill sentries rode out to block his advance alarmed by the sudden appearance of this lone youth in their midst richard reined in his stallion before them i am richard duke of aquitaine and count of poitou he said in a loud clear voice i am here to see my lord father the king richard was ushered into henrys tent by startled guards he had a quick glimpse of the menhis father the earl of essex maurice de craon and richard du hommet the constable of normandyall of them looking no less astonished than the guards at the last moment his courage failed him and he looked away not wanting to watch their triumphant faces as he humbled himself fumbling with the belt of his scabbard he unbuckled his sword it was his prized possession a gift from his mother on that day two years ago when hed been invested as duke of aquitaine fashioned by the best bladesmith in bordeaux with a thirtyinch doubleedged blade an enameled pommel inlaid with silver for that was thought to prevent blunting engraved in latin with the words in nomine domini the ultimate symbol of knighthood hed called it joyeuse said to have been the name of charlemagnes celebrated sword which flashed lighting in the heat of battle hed never expected to surrender it and giving it up now was as painful as any physical wound coming forward he carefully placed the sword and scabbard on the ground then sank to his knees before his father i am here to seek your forgiveness my liege he said hoarsely you may do with me as you will to his horror tears filled his eyes and he angrily swiped at them with the sleeve of his tunic before nerving himself to look up at henry to his amazement he could see tears shimmering in his fathers eyes too henry reached down holding out his hand of course you are forgiven he said and when richard took his hand he was raised to his feet and then gathered to the older man in a tight embrace richard was not sure what hed expected but not this warm welcome this genuine and manifest joy his fathers companions seemed to share it too treating him as if his was the return of the prodigal son not the surrender of a beaten rebel wine was brought out and then food venison like the meal being served back in his own camp richard held his plate awkwardly not sure if he could swallow a morsel i ought to send word to my men he said hesitantly raoul de faye and saldebreuil de sanzay are there amongst others need ineed i fear that they will be punished for my sins henry reached for another piece of bread unable to remember when hed been so hungry no he said i mean to issue a general pardon for all who took part in the rebellion richards shoulders slumped so great was his relief thank you he mumbled for that seemed expected of him all around him the other men were laughing and talking gesturing with their wine cups and his sense of unreality grew ever stronger could it truly be this easy we will return to poitiers on the morrow henry declared and ride into the city together so that all may see peace has been restored and at michaelmas we will meet your brothers and the french king put all this foolishness behind us he shifted so that he could look directly into richards face i mean to do right by you and your brothers the provisions will not be as lavish as the terms i offered last year but i think you will be pleased thank you richard said again the words coming automatically to his lips with a calm that belied his inner turmoil he knew it would be wise to keep silent to do nothing to threaten this rare moment of harmony but he could not do that may i ask you a question henry nodded ask he said with a slight smile and richard drew a deep bracing breath you have forgiven me for taking up arms against you you have said that you do not mean to imprison or disinherit the others who joined the rebellion you have been more generous than i dared hope but there is this i must know can you not find it in your heart to forgive my mother the mood in the tent was transformed as soon as the words had left his mouth he saw the other men stiffen in the way hed seen people react when caught out in a storm listening uneasily to the rumble of thunder and scanning the skies as lightning flashed overhead henry did not speak for a time struggling against the tide of raw emotion unleashed by the mere mention of eleanors name hed not wanted to make joanna choose between them for she was a child an innocent who could not be blamed for loving unwisely hed not intended to extend that privilege to his sons for surely theyd forfeited that right by swallowing her poison so willingly but as he looked now at richard he realized that it would not be that simple that easy he saw emotions in richards face as conflicted as his ownfear and defiance and confusion and love love for the woman whod betrayed him so cruelly he was going to have to learn to live with that with richards misplaced loyalty at least until the boy came to see the truth about his mother that took courage he said at last and youve earned an honest answerthis one time i will not speak of this again richard i know this is not what you want to hear but it cannot be helped no lad i cannot forgive your mother not now not ever on september henry met the french king on the riverbank of montlouissurloire not far from tours the day was overcast and dark clouds were gathering ominously along the horizon henry and richard arrived at the same time as the french and after an awkward exchange of greetings they moved into the village churchyard so they could take shelter in the church if the storm broke before we discuss terms for peace louis said earnestly your sons wish to express their remorse and grief that it ever came to this henry frowned not sure if he could long endure louis at his most sanctimonious and selfrighteous as if he were a good samaritan who wanted only to heal this lamentable family feud but hal and geoffrey had taken their cue and were coming forward to kneel respectfully before him hals distress seemed genuine henry could not help wondering though what he regretted mostthat hed rebelled or that hed lost he did not want to let such suspicions mar their reconciliation and he did his best to put any doubts aside as hal and then geoffrey expressed their sorrow their contrition and their resolve to make amends to be the dutiful loving sons that he deserved when their penance was done henry played his part and offered them absolution raising them up for the formal kiss of peace and then quick paternal hugs whats past is past he said and it is forgiven beaming louis then embraced hal and geoffrey too but when he took a step in richards direction he was warned off by the expression on the youths face and contented himself with declaring his joy that this breach was mended quoting from scriptures to prove his point honor thy father as the lord thy god hath commanded thee that thy days may be prolonged and if some noticed that hed diplomatically edited the holy writ by excising any mention of thy mother none were tactless enough to comment upon it hal and geoffrey now offered strained greetings to richard who was even more laconic in reply hal then took henry aside seeking a moment alone withdrawing into the cemetery that bordered the churchyard they walked among the wooden crosses and flat gravestones as henry waited with rare patience for his son to speak not the most auspicious of settings is it hal said wryly gesturing toward the mosscovered grave markers making peace in a burial ground is like getting wed in a whorehouse but i do want there to be peace between us papa that i swear to you upon the surety of my soul henry was as moved by the tears in hals eyes as he was by his words and he felt a surge of gratitude that the almighty and st thomas had given him this second chance an opportunity to make things right with his sons i also want that hal he said and when they embraced he truly believed that theyd made a new beginning from the way hals eyes were shining he could see that hal believed it too as much as i enjoy watching louis wriggling on the hook he said wed best rejoin the others so i can end the suspense about my intentions hal was one of those anxiously awaiting henrys judgment for all knew this was not a genuine peace conference as the victor the english king would be the man dictating the terms of that peace and they would have to swallow his brew however bitter they found it he could only hope that his father would be lenient as he followed henry back into the churchyard henry wasted no time on preliminaries i mean to issue a general pardon to all those who took part in the rebellion he said before adding a proviso there are four exceptions however four men who will not be included in the pardon the scots king the earl of leicester the earl of chester and the breton lord raoul de fougeres they will have to bargain for their freedom and only after i feel they can be trusted to honor their oaths there were murmurings of relief for all who owed homage to henry had been well aware that he could have charged them with treason hal edged over toward will marshal to murmur sotto voce see i told you that there was no cause for concern i knew my father would not punish you for being loyal to me will hadnt been so certain of that and he was savoring his reprieve pray god that hed never again be forced to choose between his king and his young lord we were lucky my lord he said softly so very lucky hal thought that remained to be seen for his father had yet to announce what provisions hed make for his sons the first thing i want to do is send for marguerite i am sure she was well treated but my bed has been cold without her i am not used to sleeping alone will was not fooled by the flippancy for he knew how upset hal had been by his wifes gilded captivity hal was still talking about marguerite and will nudged the younger man saying your lord father is about to speak again henry waited until the audience fell silent until he was sure all eyes were upon him last year i offered what i felt to be generous terms to settle this conflict sadly they were rejected circumstances have changed since then he said dryly unable to resist reminding louis and the count of flanders of the respective reality of their positions this was a costly war how costly he was not going to admit to these menmore than twenty percent of his yearly revenues had gone toward the protection of his crown and kingdom alas i can no longer offer the same terms that i did last september addressing his sons directly now he said i think though that you will not be displeased with what i am offering i realize now that i was remiss in not providing incomes commensurate with your titles that was an argument hed often had with eleanor a memory he hastily pushed away my lord king he said to hal i will be endowing you with two castles in normandy and an annual income of fifteen thousand angevin pounds to be spent as you choose hal swallowed thinking of how much more hed been offered last year at gisors half the crown revenues of england or normandy plus four english castles or six strongholds in their continental domains reminding himself then that this was still a very generous offer from the victor to the vanquished he smiled and made a graceful acknowledgment of his good fortune and his gratitude i have already discussed this with my son richard henry continued he is to receive two unfortified castles in poitou and half of my revenues from that province to my son geoffrey i offer half of the income of brittany and all of it once he weds the lady constance richard and geoffrey expressed their appreciation in appropriately formal terms and henry smiled to see the three of them standing together thinking that this was the first step toward the restoration of his fractured family nowthere is the matter of my youngest sons inheritance i regret to report that i have recently received very sad news from england alice of maurienne my son johns betrothed was taken sick last month and the doctors were unable to save her we gave orders for a funeral befitting her high birth distributed alms to christs poor in her name and this sweet child of god will not lack for prayers that she may soon depart purgatory for the glory of life everlasting the men had not heard of the little girls death and they were quick to offer conventional expressions of sympathy with many repetitions of may god assoil her there was little surprise though for all knew how fragile life was in those early years of childhood some considered it remarkable that eleanor had given birth to ten children in the course of two marriages and only had to bury one hal felt a quick stab of pity for the little girl thinking how sad it was to die so young so far from her family and homeland that was followed by great relief as he realized that alices death rendered johns marriage settlement moot which meant there was no longer any need to surrender his castles at chinon mirebeau and loudun the proximate cause of the rebellion but he felt then a twinge of shame that he could find reason for rejoicing in the death of a child naturally henry continued i hope to make another favorable marital alliance for john i have decided however that he ought to have lands of his own i am therefore giving him the english castles of nottingham and marlborough as well as five castles in normandy anjou touraine and maine this will require of course the consent of my eldest son but i am confident that he will find it acceptable now that we have restored harmony in our family and our domains hals gasp was loud enough for geoffrey to jab him warningly in the ribs that reminder alone would not have been enough but his gaze happened to alight upon his brother richard who was watching him with malicious satisfaction richards smirk acted as a lifeline to pull him back from defiant disaster if it pleases my lord father he mumbled it pleases me henry had not expected any other response ere we commit these terms to writing i think it advisable to renew acts of homage as for my sons i will gladly accept homage from richard and geoffrey but i waive this act from my eldest son in recognition of his rank as a crowned king hed thought that hal would be very pleased by this boon this public recognition of their status as peers hal showed no enthusiasm though he was staring at the ground his face hidden by a sweep of fair hair turning his eyes away from his son henry looked coolly at the count of flanders i believe my lord that you have a charter to relinquish one that gave you a claim to my castle at dover and the county of kent after receiving count philips assurances that it would be forthcoming henry decided then to give them food for thoughtan example of what he could have demanded had he been vindictive or vengeful from here i expect to return to falaise to continue negotiations with the scots king i am willing to grant his freedom but after such savage raids against my english subjects i understandably feel the need to demand proof of his future good will he will not be released from confinement until he acknowledges himself as a liegeman of the english crown and agrees that the scottish church shall be subordinate to the church of england i shall require also that the scots earls and barons do homage to me against all other men and if king william should default in his fealty to me his liege lord the scots lords and bishops will hold to me against the king of the scots and in such an event the scots bishops shall place scotland under interdict until the scots king repents of his disloyalty lastly to guarantee the safety of my borders i will take possession of the scots castles at roxburgh berwick jedburgh edinburgh and sterling with the costs of garrisoning them to be paid by the scots treasury there was utter silence when he was done speaking as his adversaries pondered the sad fate of the scots king and the fearful consequences of defying the man who was king of england duke of normandy and aquitaine count of anjou poitou touraine and maine lord of ireland and wales liege lord of brittany now restored to the good graces of the church and the favor of st thomas of blessed memory after this chilling revelation of what could have been henry was soon surrounded by men eager to show their good will and it was not long before he found himself cornered by the french king no less eager to mend fences and banish the hounds of war hal had backed away from the chaos and after a moments hesitation he walked over to his brother richarddid you speak to him about maman richard scowled accurately interpreting hals words to mean he would not be raising that dangerous topic himself of course i did and when richard slowly shook his head hal bit his lip and for a brief moment their hostility forgotten they looked at each other in perplexity and mutual misery salisbury plain was a vast marsh fed by six rivers a barren windswept area of chalk hills and grassy downs on a promontory north of the river avon a castle had been erected in the eleventh century unusual in that it shared the precincts with a cathedral the inner bailey contained the keep several towers and a palace built by a bishop of salisbury for the use of henrys grandfather the cathedral was situated in the western half of the outer bailey with the bishops palace buildings for the canons and three cemeteries eleanor had never passed much time at sarum castle both she and henry preferred clarendon palace just four miles distant she for its greater luxury and henry for its hunting park so her spirits had plummeted at her first sight of the stark stone keep rising up against a bleak wiltshire sky few areas in england were so desolate the winds were constant so brutal that the first cathedral had been destroyed in a gale only five days after its consecration the canons complained that the winds drowned out the sounds of the divine office and they suffered from the joint evil and vision maladies caused by the blinding glare of the sun upon the chalk hills as shed ridden through the gatehouse into the inner bailey of the castle eleanor was morbidly certain that sarum would be the death of her it was a great surprise therefore to discover that she actually preferred sarum to falaise shed dreaded being penned up in one of the cheerless cold chambers of the great keep or even worse in herlewins tower along the north inner wall but shed been escorted to the royal palace and taken up to the private quarters on the second floor she had a fireplace here and access to a privy chamber and she was even able to attend mass through a private entrance in st nicholass chapel best of all she was permitted to walk in the inner courtyard to pick flowers in the garden if she chose she thought she understood why she was no longer being guarded so zealously the castle at sarum was escapeproof so secure that she could be given a few more liberties she learned that she was in the custody of a man she knew ralph fitz stephen one of the kings chamberlains and sheriff of gloucestershire shed had only one awkwardly polite encounter with him since her arrival for he was rarely at sarum it was the constable of the castle robert de lucy who was responsible for her daily care and hed treated her with distant but impeccable courtesy she knew her neighbor too jocelin de bohun the bishop of salisbury who dwelled on the western side of the outer bailey but hed so far paid her no visits this was not a surprise for he was not the most resolute of men and wary of incurring the kings disfavor hed sided with henry over becket most likely because he feared the king even more than the archbishop his loyalty had come at a great cost for hed been excommunicated twice by the irate archbishop and he was destined to be remembered mainly as the man whod offended a saint so eleanor had no expectations of aid from that quarter although shed found no cause for complaint in her treatment by the constable the chaplain servants or guards shed so far had no luck in cultivating another perrin and until an unexpected event in midaugust shed known nothing of what was occurring in the world beyond the walls of sarum this changed however when she was granted the privilege of having a visitor the man ushered into her chamber was also familiar to her reginald fitz jocelin the bishopelect of bath a cleric whod been unwillingly caught up in the becket conflict through no fault of his own reginald had a dubious background for he was the son of bishop jocelin his father had doted upon him naming him as his archdeacon and thus setting him upon the path toward a church career hed been for a time in beckets household but that had ended badly when hed been lured away by the chance to serve the king becket had never forgiven him bitterly assailing him as that bastard son of a priest born of a harlot and some felt that the archbishops increasing animosity toward jocelin was actually rooted in his anger with the son eleanor never knew what prompted the visit by bishop reginald hed offered no explanations she could only surmise that he was in his way striking a blow at becket for hed said enough to indicate that his rancorous memories of the man did not lend themselves to an easy acceptance of the archbishops sainthood but she cared little for his motives what mattered was that under the guise of offering spiritual solace hed opened a window briefly to the world from him she learned the astonishing news of henrys penance at canterbury and the equally astonishing results hed not stayed long but when he left she knew that the rebellion in england was dead and her only hopes rested with her sons and the french king then besieging rouen as disheartening as it was to learn of her husbands triumphs she still preferred knowing bad news to not knowing any news at all eleanor was not having a good day the weather could not be faulted it was a sunsplashed mild october morning but shed begun keeping track of her time at sarum by marking the wall with charcoal and shed suddenly realized that this was joannas ninth birthday she was sure that marguerite would make much of her sure that shed not lack for either affection or attention it was hard though missing yet another milestone in one of her childrens lives even harder not to know how many more would be denied her she was sitting in the windowseat watching a small bird flit from bush to bush in the courtyard below morosely trying to make sense of bishop reginalds story of her husbands dramatic mea culpa at beckets tomb that sounded so unlike harry that it baffled her whatever had possessed him to humble himself like that her first impulse had been to assume it was a cynical political ploy a way to gain the churchs good will and keep the rebels from appropriating becket for their own ends but he already had the support of the pope and the english bishops and he could easily have performed a public penance that did not involve baring his back to the lash could he truly have been that desperate if so mayhap ranulf was right mayhap she did not know him as well as shed thought she had her musings were interrupted by the arrival in her lap of a small whirlwind as she started the kitten leaped down and scampered away but soon returned and began to stalk the hem of her gown eleanor could not help smiling at its antics shed not really expected to take the cat with her into english exile but joanna was very singleminded shed carried the kitten onboard ship with her and presented it to her mother in a travel basket as eleanor made ready to depart for salisbury eleanor was still dubious assuming it would run away or her new gaoler would confiscate it once she reached sarum the constable had not even lifted an eyebrow though at the sight of the cat and had ordered a servant to provide the queen with a box of dirt as if that was an everyday occurrence nor had the kitten absconded to the contrary it seemed quite content to share eleanors confinement and within a fortnight eleanor was startled to realize how much this little ball of fur had begun to matter to her she was luring the kitten closer with the fringed end of her belt when a knock sounded and sir ralph fitz stephen entered he greeted her courteously explaining that hed returned to sarum the preceding night too late to pay his respects i wanted to ask if there is anything you need madame eleanor did her best to conceal her surprise for in nigh on a year no one had asked that before with nothing to lose she said nonchalantly as a matter of fact there is sir ralph bishop jocelin is known to have an excellent library time hangs heavy on my hands these days would it be possible for me to borrow some of his books to her astonishment he agreed at once i am sure he will be pleased to be of service i will send a man to the bishops palace this very afternoon thank you she murmured not wanting him to see how much that meant to her books they would be such a blessing a way to maintain her sanity rolling the dice again she wondered aloud if the bishop would mind if she made some specific requests and once again she won i cannot imagine why he would object madame you are very kind sir ralph very kind indeed why as best she could see it he had nothing to gain and quite a bit to lose by coddling his royal prisoner why would he risk angering harry i have received a message from the lord king he said almost as if hed read her mind he has instructed me to provide you with a handmaiden madame if it meets with your approval i thought i would see if i could find someone suitable in the village god in heaven she whispered he has won that is it he has won and so he can afford to spare me a few crumbs from his table when he did not answer she said with sudden vehemence tell me the truth i am entitled to that much surely yes my lady you are right the king has prevailed over his enemies won a great victory after he routed the french from rouen they sought a truce both sides met near tours and signed a peace treaty at michaelmas the king was very magnanimous to the rebels madame forbore to punish them as severely as he could have done he provided most generously for the lord princes your sons and they have fully reconciled the young king is to get a stipend of fifteen thousand angevin pounds a year lord richard is to be given half the revenues of poitou and lord geoffrey may draw upon the resources of brittany the king also issued a general pardon for all the rebels save only the scots king the earls of chester and leicester and a breton lord raoul de fougeres eleanors mouth had gone dry and what of me she had her answer in the look he gave her now one of unmistakable pity i am sorry madame he said but there was no mention made of you in the treaty i see her voice sounded strange even to her own ears flat and toneless he must have said something before he withdrew but she did not hear it once she was alone she moved like one sleepwalking to the bed sank down upon it ill never forgive you never look upon the sun youll not be seeing it again the king provided generously for your sons and they have fully reconciled ill never forgive you never chapter twenty february le mans anjou on the day after candlemas richard and geoffrey once again did homage to their father hal was still exempted because of his status as a crowned king afterward a lavish feast was planned but before the meal and the entertainment began henry summoned his sons to the castle solar they entered to find him already waiting for them come in lads he said cheerfully ere we go back to the great hall i want to tell you of my plans for this coming year they exchanged guarded glances for experience had taught them that they were not always in accord with his plans he was standing by the hearth and they quickly joined him by the fire for the chamber was chill and damp with drafts seeking entry at the shuttered windows and winter cold seeping in from every crack and fissure it is time you started to earn your keep henry said with a smile no more lolling about like pampered princelings his gaze lingered fondly for a moment on his second son for richard had come to full manhood in the past year at seventeen he was taller than most grown men even taller now than hal come the morrow youre off to poitou my scouts tell me that the poitevin barons are champing at the bit again i want you to rein them in to richard that sounded almost too good to be true ill have a free hand to restore order he asked warily and when henry said that he would he grinned do i have to wait till the morrow i could be ready to leave within two hours henry grinned too remembering how eager hed been at richards age to prove himself tomorrow will be soon enough he turned then toward geoffrey saying and youre to go into brittany lad to deal with eudo de porhoet and the rest of those breton bandits roland de dinan will accompany you i know his loyalty has been suspect in the past but that is only to be expected of a breton lord they play at rebellion the way other men play at dice he has been steadfast for the past nine years which counts as an eternity in brittany i can trust him with your safety and youll learn much from him geoffrey glanced from henry to richard back to his father why do i need a wetnurse if richard does not id not call roland a wetnurse to his face lad hed not like it and the reason you need more guidance than richard is simple hes a twelvemonth older than you and passed much of last year on his own in poitou where by all accounts he acquitted himself well richards face flushed with pleasure but almost at once he felt a twinge of guilt how could he take pride in his fathers praise as long as his mother remained entombed at sarum geoffrey was not satisfied with his fathers response but unlike his brothers he never wasted time or energy in arguments he was sure to lose and he subsided with a shrug and a neutral as you wish hal had been a silent observer until now no longer able to conceal his impatience he interrupted when henry began to expand upon the unreliability of the bretons what of me you may be sure ive not forgotten you lad henry assured him youll be spending the coming year as a king in training i have to venture into anjou but i expect to be back in normandy within a few weeks then we will take ship for england you and i hal struggled to hide his dismay together he said glumly his hopes dashed hed known that his father was planning to return to england and when he listened as richard and geoffrey were given authority and commands his own expectations had soared why should he not be entrusted with normandy or at the least anjou instead he was to be his fathers shadow at his beck and call day and night with no more independence than an indentured apprentice where was the fairness in that this time together will give us a chance for a new beginning hal whilst being a learning experience for you henry said with such enthusiasm that hal mustered up an unconvincing smile and tried to ignore his brothers who were laughing at him behind henrys back let them mock all they wanted for the last laugh would still be his he was the one who was king even if it did seem like an empty honor more often than not the earl of essex reached the coastal city of caen in late march and headed for the ducal castle he was at once ushered into the kings solar where henry was occupied in confirming to montebourg abbey the chapel of st maglorius on the isle of sark he looked up with a smile as willem entered then reached for his great seal a number of men had gathered to witness the charter but once it was done they exited the chamber leaving henry with a handful of his most trusted inner circle the archbishop of rouen maurice de craon his english justiciar richard de lucy his norman constable richard du hommet the abbot of mont st michel his natural son geoff and the newly arrived willem returning from a diplomatic mission to the court of the count of flanders willem had just begun his report though when they were interrupted by a message from henrys eldest son presently at rouen henry at once ordered the man to be admitted explaining to willem that he and hal would soon be sailing for england he was somewhat surprised by the identity of the messenger for hals letter was delivered by his vicechancellor adam de churchedune not the sort of errand normally undertaken by men of rank take a seat adam he said for the cleric was not a young man and then broke hals seal began to read his missive almost at once he looked up his expression so blank that the other men knew at once something was very wrong hal refuses to accompany me to england he said and he sounded so shocked that the normally eventempered earl of essex felt a stab of hot rage fury that the kings ungrateful whelp was once more giving his father grief i do not understand henry confessed when we parted last month all was well between us what new grudge can he be nursing now does it matter willem said youve been more than patient with him my liege if it were me id command him to come to caen straightaway and nip this nonsense in the bud as willem glanced around he saw that his words were well received by the other men several were nodding in agreement and geoff was muttering under his breath too outraged by his brothers antics for circumspection but hals chancellor was shaking his head emphatically my lord king that would be a great mistake leaning forward he said earnestly i offered to take lord hals message myself so that i might speak with you in confidence none of the others were surprised by this revelation theyd taken it for granted that henry would have put men he could trust in hals household men whose loyalty would be to the sire not the son henry looked down again at hals letter so terse and succinct so brusque and defiant glancing up at the chancellor he said i hope to god you can explain this adam too shaken to pretend he was not angry perplexed and hurt by hals latest transgression i thought wed put all this lunacy behind us last september my liegeit grieves me to say this but the young king your son is as constant as wax i do not doubt that he has a good heart he is easily swayed though swings like a weathercock in a high wind and of late he has been listening to the wrong men again to those who wish you ill they have planted a poisonous seed in his mind warning him that you want to lure him to england so that you may then imprison him like the queen henry was stunned and he believed that adam nodded somberly alas he did my lord they played skillfully upon his doubts his resentments and stirred up his fears by suggesting that there was something sinister in your decision not to demand homage from him they argued that homage is an act of mutual obligation claimed that you did not want to accept his homage because you did not want to be held accountable as his liege lord proof that you must be plotting treachery once he was in england and utterly in your power that is ludicrous i waived homage to honor hal i know that my liege but now you see why i say it would be a mistake to command his presence at caen that would only confirm his suspicions convince him that his socalled friends had spoken true henry slumped down in his seat suddenly as weary as if hed spent a full day on the hunt what would you suggest he said at last and when the chancellor urged gentle persuasion words of reassurance rather than rage he agreed to take that approach but he felt defeated even before he began christ on the cross were they to start the madness all over again wolves were usually hunted only from septembers nativity of our lady to marchs annunciation but upon henrys arrival at his hunting lodge the villagers of bures asked him to track down and slay a lone wolf that had been killing their sheep he set out early the next morning his lymer hounds had no luck in picking up the rogue wolfs scent though and men horses and dogs returned tired and disappointed at days end where he found hal and marguerite were waiting for him hal greeted him effusively apologized for the misunderstanding and announced that they were ready to depart for england whenever he wished greatly relieved that adams gentle persuasion had worked henry welcomed his son and daughterinlaw warmly thankful that theyd avoided a confrontation the lodge was neither large nor spacious ill suited to accommodate the retinues of two kings and a queen but henrys servants did their best to provide a more elaborate meal than henry would otherwise have expected and after the dining was done hal held court in the great hall laughing and jesting and charming with his usual ease basking in the attention he was attracting he did not notice when his father withdrew ceding him center stage henry slipped out of a side door stood for a time staring up at the starlit april sky his initial pleasure had slowly ebbed away as the evening wore on leaving him with an edgy sense of unease was this to be the pattern for years to come hal would balk be coaxed into compliance and all would be welluntil the next time he took offense how could the thinking of his own son be so alien to him how had they ever gotten to this road that led nowhere it was a mild night and others were outside too as he was recognized several men would have approached him but he waved them off impatiently but then he saw one man he did want to speak with and he moved to intercept william marshal as he ambled from the direction of the latrines marshal he said stepping from the shadows into the knights path beckoning he led the younger man away from their audience of eager eavesdroppers will followed but his stiff posture and ducked head conveyed his discomfort as clearly as words could have done he showed no surprise when henry launched into a lowvoiced angry reprimand for hed been anticipating his sovereigns displeasure i expected better from you will you are one of the few men of hals household who has a grain of common sense and a speaking acquaintance with honor why have you failed so dismally to protect my son my liegewhat would you have me say i told you at avranches that i could not spy upon him i am not asking that of you henry snapped but i do expect you to give him the benefit of your maturity and your good judgment and i see precious little evidence of that when his legion of lackeys and drones and leeches seek to poison his mind against me what do you do do you stay silent or do you join in with the rest of the baying hounds sire that is not fair i would never speak against you to the young king i have always encouraged him to mend this rift between you but mine is not the only voice he heeds that was not what henry wanted to hear he needed to believe there was at least one rational voice to counsel his son for his own words seemed to be falling upon deaf ears then what good are you to me he said harshly and turned on his heel before will could respond heading back toward the great hall will trailed unhappily after him but knew better than to try to plead his case when the king was in one of his tempers hal was encircled by his knights and they were applauding and cheering so enthusiastically that henry wondered sardonically if hed just ordered another winekeg broken open gesturing to will he said tell the young king that the old one wants to speak with him upon the dais hal soon sauntered in his direction an arm draped around marguerites waist his face flushed with wine his eyes bright with laughter you wanted me papa i am going to my own chamber will leave the festivities to your keeping enjoy yourselves but remember that men bed down in the hall at night so if you carouse till dawn theyll get no sleep hal promised to keep that in mind then turned as one of his knights approached fervently expressing his eternal gratitude and loyalty hal sent him off with a laugh and a quip then explained for henrys benefit that giles had suffered a stroke of bad luck his palfrey had gone lame on the ride to bures and the village farrier had given a dread diagnosis that the horse had foundered and must be put down giles has barely two deniers to rub together and a tightfisted father whod see him mounted on a goat ere hed help out so i offered him one of the horses in my stable hes a good lad is giles so why not why not indeed henry agreed dryly for he knew that hed end up getting the bill for the stallion hal would buy to replace the one hed so magnanimously bestowed on giles but he reminded himself that generosity was a virtue lauded in a prince and he asked hal if hed like to join the hunt on the morrow for the elusive sheepkilling wolf id like nothing better id ask a favor of you thoughthat i be given the wolfs pelt to make a mantle henry blinked in surprise why you know how difficult it is to get rid of the stink of wolf hal grinned and dropped his voice conspiratorially you know adam dyquebeuf he said naming one of the most sycophantic and fawning of his knights hes not a bad sort but sometimes i think that if my boots got muddied hed offer to lick them clean henry understood for that was always a risk of kingship a crown too often drew the servile and obsequious as well as the capable and confident so you are going to give that poor sod a fur cloak that is likely to reek to high heaven he said knowing hed wear it day and night if it came from you hal laughed and marguerite giggled even as she pretended to disapprove of his mischiefmaking but hal looked thoughtful when henry then pointed out that since dyquebeuf was so often in his company hed be exposed to the rank wolf smell too before bidding them good night he offered hal one final boon seeking to ease his mind by removing any doubts about the dual obligations of homage and told his son that he would receive hals homage ere they sailed for england but he was taken aback by his sons reaction hals face shadowed and he glanced away no longer meeting his fathers eyes a pile of correspondence had been heaped on the table in his bedchamber and henry had planned to tackle it before he went to bed but he was too restless to concentrate and instead of summoning his scribe he began to root through a coffer for something to read the recipient of an excellent education he never traveled without books the first one he picked up was waces roman de brut a history in verse of the english people wace had dedicated it to eleanor though and that reminder was enough for him to put it aside he flipped through geoffrey of monmouths historia regum britanniae next a mythic history of the english kings and the legend of king arthur and eventually settled upon commentarii de bello gallico but even caesars own account of the conquest of gaul could not long hold his attention and he sent one of his squires to fetch his son hal did not look pleased to be dragged away from the revelries in the hall and did not seem reassured when henry dismissed his squires so they could speak in private help yourself to wine henry said and hal quickly drained a cup almost as if he needed to fortify himself for this interview for a fleeting moment henry was assailed by a treacherous memory from his past the day hed awakened his winebesotted father to confide that he would be marrying eleanor as soon as she could shed the french king geoffrey had cursed him freely and loudly for this unwelcome invasion of his bedchamber and when henry had laughed and said he had a great favor to ask hed grumbled quit whilst youre ahead harry whilst youre still in my will henrys news had sobered him of course and he was soon marveling that marriage to eleanor could make you master of europe one daychrist jesus harry caesar might well envy you hed later warned henry though that he should save his passion for his concubines not his wife offering the cynical counsel that the best marriages are those based upon detached good will or benign indifference but unfortunately for you the one emotion you will never feel for eleanor of aquitaine is indifference the memory was troubling any remembrance of eleanor was painful especially recollections of those early years but recalling the easy camaraderie and barbed banter hed enjoyed with his father he also felt a deep sense of loss of regret and bafflement that he did not have the same close relationship with his own sons where had he gone wrong papa hal was regarding him in perplexity why did you summon me you pulled me away from a game of hazard when i was winning hali know that others sought to convince you i had a nefarious motive in not demanding homage from you as i did your brothers you need not look so surprised lad nothing travels faster than gossip i daresay at least half of these boon companions of yours are in the pay of the french king and i expected no better from them but i never imagined that youd be taken in by such slander jesu lad how could you believe that of me hal had stiffened but by the time henry was done speaking hed been disarmed by the naked pain in his fathers voice hal hated discord and quarrels could not understand people like his brother richard who seemed to thrive on strife and controversy he truly wanted to be at peace with his father truly regretted their constant clashes of will i am sorry papa he said as contritely as he could i ought not to have doubted you it will not happen again hal words are cheap and easily offered actions are what count and when i told you tonight that youd do homage after all i saw the expression on your face you liked it not whatever i do it seems to displease you if i do not demand homage you see that as some sort of devious scheme if i do your royal dignity is affronted gods bones lad what do you want from me hal looked at him unhappily i guess ii want your respect respect cannot be demanded or given hal it must be earned there are wounds still to be healed but this i can assure you that i love you as my life surely you believe that yesi do and i love you too hal added quickly even though there were times when he was no longer sure that was true then whywhy in christs name are we always at odds like this why can you not come to me when you have a grievance instead of letting it fester why do you pay more heed to that fool on the french throne than your own father louis listened to me said what i needed to hear i ought not to have had such faith in his good will i know that now things were never the same after that shameful trick he pulled at verneuil but hal hesitated pinioning his lower lip with even white teeth how honest can i be papa speak your mind henry said ill not get angry hal smiled faintly can i have that in writing he rose suddenly went to the table to pour another cup of wine and finished half of it before he could nerve himself to take his father at his word i said i love you papa butbut i am not sure i can trust you henry drew a sharp breath this from the stripling whod played him for such a fool at chinon that betrayal lay between them like an imperfectly healed scar for theyd never discussed it prevented first by circumstances and then by caution but hed promised to hold his temper and so he said only why not becausebecause i know the king will always prevail over the man over the father henry started to speak stopped himself that may be true he said at last but all that i am doing i do for you hal i want only to secure for you a peaceful and prosperous kingdom nothing matters more to me than that why must we be at crosspurposes about this our interests are one and the same why can you not see that hal had never been one for the unexpressed thought rarely curbed a jest in the interest of prudence or even good manners he almost made a dark joke now about the flaw in his fathers grand schemethat the only way two kings could contentedly share power was if one of them was dead but he sensed that henry would find no humor in the gibe for there was too much truth in it for comfort he studied henrys face intently wondering how honest he could be dare he confess his resentment that his father meant to bestow his english castles upon that unwanted afterthought johnny when there were sons to spare in most great families one would be destined for the church why would papa not pack the little tadpole off to a monastery or if he was bound and determined to reward the boy beyond his station in life let him look to richards lands or geoffreys all of this remained unsaid though for he was not a fool knew better than to trust his fathers assurance that thered be no anger no recriminations if he dared to defy papas will hed be tossing a torch into a hayrick it had always been so nothing had changed in the future he promised i will come to you first with my grievances and the evening ended upon a note that satisfied neither father nor son chapter twentyone november sarum england that year was not a good one for england the weather was severe and there were outbreaks of plague and famine in the outlying areas the summer was hot and dry withering crops in the field and autumn was cold and rainsodden november had been a month of galeforce winds and black ice and winter was promising to be particularly harsh on the exposed marshlands of salisbury plain eleanor was curled up on the settle with a book and a blanket she was not reading though her thoughts wandering far from the page open on her lap edith her maid was sitting by the hearth as she mended one of eleanors gowns humming a cheerful little song as she stitched cleo her cat was stalking prey in the floor rushes eleanor preferred not to know what was being hunted the rain had ceased earlier in the day but the wind still sought entry at the shuttered windows rattling the latches and testing the hinges although it was not yet midday the chamber held enough shadows for night poorly lit by an oil lamp and several tallow candles that sputtered and filled the air with smoke and the pungent odor of burning fat eleanor had never used any candles but the expensive ones made of beeswax and she wrinkled her nose at the smell wondering how the queens allowance of a penny a day for lamp oil was being spent now the cat froze in the rushes ears flattening and then darted under the bed eleanor had learned to take her cues from the little creature and listened for the sound of footsteps approaching her door there was soon a discreet knock and she said enter grimly amused by the charade they enacted every day her door was no longer locked as at falaise but it was mockery to pretend she still retained the right to refuse admittance to her chamber it was too early for dinner and she closed her book hoping it would not be that tiresome father ivo the castle chaplain shed have been more amenable to his attempts to save her soul if hed been a better source for news but either he knew nothing of the world beyond his chapel or he was that rarity a man of god who truly knew how to practice the cardinal virtue of prudence at least when bishop jocelin had finally gotten around to paying a call hed spiced up his sermon with a dose of gossip madame an elderly servant poked his head into the room you have a visitor he announced lugubriously eleanor was convinced that if he ever smiled his face would crack but when he stepped aside to admit her guest she jumped to her feet so swiftly that the book fell forgotten to the floor rhiannon is it truly you in two quick steps she was at the welshwomans side taking her arm to guide her into the room there is a coffer just to your right but the settle is straight ahead once they were safely seated she leaned back to marvel at this unexpected appearance of ranulfs wife you are my first visitor who has not taken holy vows she said and laughed how did you gain entry ah of course ranulf theyd not gainsay the kings uncle rhiannon started to remove her mantle then changed her mind when she realized how chilly it was in the chamber no ranulf did not accompany me it was actually emma who got me permission to see you and she launched into a surprisingly accurate impression of emma at her most imperious i am the sister of the king consort of the prince of gwynedd how dare you question my authority in no time at all they were wilting before her like flowers in the noonday sun eleanor was thoroughly confused by now emma harrys sister what in the world you do not know rhiannon exclaimed as always turning her head unerringly toward the sound of eleanors voice but how could you the king married emma off to prince davydd last year ranulf and i are attending the kings christmas court at windsor and when she learned of our plan emma asked to accompany us it is a bit awkward what with her husband and mine loathing each other but we could hardly refuse her for she is ranulfs niece after all and it turned out to be bread cast upon the waters for when we reached clarendon and i found out it was only four miles from sarum she was willing to come with me after ranulf she let the words trail off but eleanor had no trouble finishing the sentence for her after ranulf refused she said and smiled to show it did not matter before remembering that smiles were wasted upon rhiannon that was kind of emma for i am delighted to see you butbut why are you this far south if harry is holding his christmas court at windsor why are you so deep in wiltshire rhiannon did not answer right away alerting eleanor that the answer would not be welcome the king is at winchester now she said we will be catching up with him there and then going on together to windsor eleanor fell silent sarum was only about twentyfive miles from winchester bishop jocelin had told her that hal had returned with henry to england so this was the closest shed been to one of her sons in more than two years why had hal not tried to see her richard would have even if it meant scaling the castle walls in the dead of night rhiannon was looking troubled and she roused herself saying lightly of course you are not really riding all the way from wales to visit with harry are you your son morgan is still in his household no rhiannon laughed youve caught us out she admitted morgan is the lure she stopped suddenly head cocked to the side what was that noise are we alone no not exactly that was edith my maid we can speak freely in front of her for she speaks no french only english eleanors smile was wry she is useful at times but as a companion she leaves much to be desired i have wine rhiannon would you getting a polite refusal she leaned over and covered the other womans hand with her own tell me of my children rhiannon did joanna was still at devizes with constance and alys but she was sure the girl would be at windsor for the christmas court and so would john hal and marguerite would be there too of course richard and geoffrey would be holding their own courts in poitou and brittany they had both enjoyed considerable success in the field she reported knowing how proud eleanor would be richard had captured the rebel stronghold of castillonsuragen that past august after a twomonth siege and the countess of chester had written to ranulf that geoffrey had eudo de porhoet on the run the countess of chester eleanor said softly is she well and when rhiannon affirmed it she forced herself to ask even though she dreaded the answer what of her son is hugh still being held prisoner no rhiannon said he was freed last year in october i believe although his lands have not been restored to him yet gratia dei eleanor whispered closing her eyes for a moment and rhiannon who was as perceptive as her husband squeezed her hand affectionately i do have some sad news though she said ranulfs brother died in july rainald i am sorry to hear that eleanor said and she was shed always had a liking for henrys cheery brash uncle was he long ill no it was sudden hed been with the king at woodstock a fortnight earlier and seemed quite well he was no longer young of course none of us are eleanor said with a sigh somy sons have truly been forgiven are back in harrys good graces and she felt both relief and a prickling of resentment when rhiannon assured her that family peace had indeed been restored rhiannon i will never forget your kindness in coming to see me especially since you had to defy ranulf to do it i hope to god i have not caused harm to your marriage you need not worry my lady rhiannon said with a quick smile it is true that ranulf was not pleased with me but he knows full well that welshwomen are not as submissive and docile as our english sisters we have minds of our own and i was not going to let him stop me from visiting you you spoke of my kindness well i am only repaying yours to me during those months when i was stranded at your court whilst our husbands were chasing about france ah yes eleanor said i remember i was with childgeoffreyso that was seventeen years ago when we got word that harrys brother geoff had died of a sudden harry and ranulf hastened over to rouen to comfort maude they were supposed to return within a fortnight but it was nigh on four months ere ranulf came back to england and another month after that ere i was reunited with harry for our christmas court she was quiet for a time remembering the men had trooped into the solar at winchester castle muddied and boisterous and jubilant after a days good hunting for a moment she thought she could actually hear echoes of their raucous laughter on the wind henry had pulled her into his lap as he told ranulf of thomas beckets recent spectacular entry into paris vastly amused by his chancellors flair for the dramatic when shed asked for a cushion for her aching back hed obliged with a grin saying to the others imagine how shed order me around if i were not a king rhiannon was sorry shed reminded the queen of a time when her marriage was a source of joy not misery hoping to distract eleanor from memories that served only to hurt she said hastily i was so homesick for wales missing ranulf and feeling like a stranger in an alien land if youd not been so good to me i truly do not know how i would have endured those wretched months your visit today eclipses any kindnesses i may have shown you eleanor assured her rhiannonmay i ask you about your blindness but if youd rather not talk about it other people are the ones who have difficulty speaking of it not me you were not born blind were you eleanor asked hoping that her memory was not playing her false no i was not i lost the sight in one eye when i was eight after i was hit by an iceencrusted snowball but within a year i lost the sight in my other eye too my father consulted every physician in wales and they all said the same they did not know why my other eye should also fail but it was often the case with such injuries and nothing could be done my mother would have wrapped me in soft wool coddled me till her last breath but my father bless him would have none of that he insisted that i defy the dark live my life as if i were still sighted i learned to play a harp to sew and do household chores even to ride a horse finding ways to compensate for my lack of sight it was not easy but i was so lucky my lady that my father was so stubborn a fleeting smile touched her lips the blind are often hidden away from the world as if they are a cause for shame eleanor had listened intently and was quiet for a few moments ive met few people as calm as contented as you rhiannon you always seemed to me like a serene small island in a turbulent sea i often wondered how youd achieved that sense of peace given how severely youd been tested by the almighty by now rhiannon had grasped which way the wind was blowing acceptance of lifes setbacks is never easy my lady for me the hardest time came when i reached marriageable age when i realized that few men would be willing to take a blind wife but my father never let me wallow in selfpity and his own life was so beset with tragedy that hed earned the right to speak on the subject eleanor knew very little of rhiannons father save that hed been crippled some years ago when hed been trampled by a runaway horse what losses did your father suffer his brothers and sisters had all died ere their time he found great contentment in marriage to my mother but he lost her too and of the six children shed borne him three were stillborn or died in the cradle only my brother cadell my sister eleri and i survived childhood cadell died at twenty thrown from his horse and when my father wed again his new wife proved barren but he was too fond of her to put her aside even though he no longer had a male heir and his lands could have been forfeit to his prince when he died eleanor agreed that rhodri ap rhys had been visited far more than he ought by the grim reaper thinking the man might better have been named job than rhodri she said so how did he cope he dealt with his disappointments as hed dealt with his blind daughter by seeking to change what could be changed and accepting what could not he taught me to acknowledge my mistakes to learn from them and then put them aside he never let me forget that the morrow might bring greater glory than yesterdays ills for none of us know the divine plan of our saviour in that we are all blind and see through a glass darkly rhiannon smiled again a smile that spilled sunlight into the dimly lit chamber and indeed good did come with the bad ranulf came back to us filling the hole left in our hearts by cadells death when we least expected it my father found a male heir to save his lands and i found joy beyond imagining and ranulfhe found what he most needed a way to heal to escape a past weighted down with regrets and remorse and guilt not a day passes that i do not thank the almighty for his blessings but not a day passes that i do not thank my father too for teaching me that there is a time for every purpose under the heaven and the greatest gift we can offer our lord god is to pray with a loving humble heart not what i will but what thou wilt eleanors eyes searched the other womans face but she felt letdown hoping for more than that you make it sound so simple she said and rhiannon shook her head so vehemently that her veil swung from side to side oh no she said it is not simple at all indeed it may be the most difficult task you ever undertake in this life my lady but think upon this what other choices have you if eleanor had been surprised by rhiannons unexpected visit she was dumbfounded by the identity of her next visitor on a cold overcast day in late december that same mournful servant announced the arrival of the lady emma sister of the english king emma had taken one disapproving glance at eleanors accommodations and sent the plump moonfaced edith to the great hall the wench does understand the word for wine she asked seating herself beside eleanor with a rustle of silken skirts or is she likely to come back with verjuice or buttermilk no wine was one of the first words i taught her eleanor said with a smile whatever are you doing here in wiltshire emma rhiannon said you were attending harrys christmas court at windsor i was but i chose to leave earlier than id first planned it was not as entertaining as id hoped eleanor studied her sisterinlaw with curious speculative eyes theyd always gotten along well enough although theyd never been confidantes the twentyfiveyear gap in their ages had not been conducive to greater intimacy shed always thought emma was one of the most beautiful women shed ever seen like hal shed inherited geoffrey le bels striking good looks she was fashionably fair with cornflowerblue eyes and sunlit flaxen hair hidden now by wimple and veil blessed with good bones deep dimples and an ethereal delicate appearance that led people especially men to miss the steel in her spine now she busied herself in placing a cushion behind her back before saying nonchalantly i brought you a new years gift a tame magpie in a wicker cage alas though a clumsy servant let it escape i thank you for the thought eleanor said although she was not disappointed for she did not fancy keeping a captive bird as a pet unable to soar into the sky as god intended but if you are returning to wales surely sarum is greatly out of your way it would be if i were going back to wales but i intend to take ship at southampton by weeks end assuming the winds are favorable i want to visit my son eleanor remembered that emma had a small son born of her first marriage as the young lord of laval hed not been able to accompany her into wales yet another reason for emma to begrudge her marriage to davydd ab owain i am gladdened to see you she said but ill admit to some surprise most people seem to fear that the kings disfavor is contagious emmas shoulders twitched in a graceful shrug i doubt that rhiannon had much gossip to share with you whereas i have enough scandals and rumors and idle talk to entertain you for months to come consider it my good deed for the year they were interrupted then by ediths return carefully balancing a tray with wine cups and wafers she was a goodhearted girl and beamed when eleanor thanked her in her own tongue motivated as much by boredom as anything else eleanor had begun to learn a few phrases of english on her bad days she feared that she might be fluent in english by the time her captivity ended either by release or death i am assuming that you are as innocent of recent happenings as a cloistered nun emma declared taking a swallow of wine and grimacing at the taste harrys son geoff is now the bishop of lincoln as the holy father approved his election and he was formally welcomed into his city in august but harry then decided that he should continue with his schooling ere he is actually consecrated and will be sending him to tours for further study much to geoffs relief eleanor had always had a good relationship with geoff but she was sure that was one more casualty of the rebellion as badly ruptured as her friendship with ranulf she thought it a pity that her husband had not found a destiny for his son that was a more comfortable fit but she refrained from commenting not wanting to risk alienating emma with criticism of her brother i imagine rhiannon told you of rainalds death and that richard and geoffrey had some success against rebels in poitou and brittany it looks as if marriage negotiations for joanna are on again and the king of sicily is sending envoys to the english court in the spring eleanor frowned saying nothing shed approved of the match which would give joanna a crown and a husband likely to treat her well but now she could think only that if her daughter were sent off to sicily she might never see the girl again as for the clifford slut harry makes no secret that she shares his bed but he has so far refrained from flaunting her at court when he needs a woman to grace his table or act as hostess he relies upon marguerite most likely in a vain attempt to mollify hal rosamund clifford was the least of eleanors troubles a vain attempt she echoed are you saying that harry and hal are at odds again it was my understanding that theyd made peace and all was well between them on the surface it is emma said pausing to sip more wine they were together day and night this year past riding the length and breadth of england as they dealt with the duties of kingship they made a pilgrimage to canterbury to give thanks to st thomas held forest courts in nottingham and york forced the earl of gloucester to yield bristol castle met with the welsh princes this summer then traveled north to receive the allegiance of the scots king and his barons i suspect harry is trying to keep hal so busy that he does not have time to collect new grievances but if so it is not working as well as hed hoped eleanor thought it interesting that emma had dismissed her husband with that casual phrase the welsh princes but she was far more intrigued by the possibility of dissention between father and son what are hals grievances the usual complaintsnot enough money not enough time to himself not enough authority of his own as long as they are yoked together hal is going to be utterly overshadowed by his sire and he likes it not lately he seems to be looking for reasons to disagree with his father although he does have the right of it in their squabble about the forest courts but i find it hard to believe that he is truly so concerned with the injustice of it think he is just using the issue as a way to assert his independence what do you mean the injustice of it eleanor asked and emma smiled thinking that she sounded more like the prideful duchess of aquitaine at that moment than a royal prisoner resigned to her fate during the rebellion harry had proclaimed free hunting in the royal forests but hes had a change of heart and he is now amercing stiff fines against those who took him at his word even his justiciar protested producing the royal writ authorizing such trespasses harry would not be dissuaded though and ordered both barons and clerics into his court as he traveled around the country not a popular move for certes one that has stirred up resentment against him he must be in great need of money eleanor said thoughtfully to resort to such drastic measures the cost of putting down the rebellion must have been higher than hed anticipated i daresay youre right emma agreed but i think he also sees it as a way to reassert the authority of the crown reminding his subjects and vassals that the lax days of the past are gone for good he has always been strongwilled but he is less amenable to compromise now than he once was less concerned about the fairness of his decisions his seizure of the earldom of cornwall is a good example of that rainalds earldom eleanor paused for a moment to recall the late earls family circumstances hed claimed the vast earldom through his wife a great heiress whod also been unstable of mind theyd had three daughters and a sickly son whod not survived his father leaving him with a natural son rico who was barred from inheritance by his outofwedlock birth but even lacking a male heir the earldom should have been divided among his daughters and their husbands that does not sound like harry she said god knows he could be stubborn once he made up his mind but he was rarely arbitrary and the only time he was truly unjust was when he exiled beckets kin and household in a fit of fury emma shrugged again well if he has indeed changed for the worse you must bear some of the responsibility for that no shed halfexpected eleanor to flare up and was surprised when the other woman nodded yes i suppose i must good heavens she said faintly mocking but without real malice has captivity caused you to examine your conscience sister this time it was eleanors turn to shrug it helps to pass the time she said composedly and as their eyes met emma was suddenly glad that shed followed this inexplicable impulse and detoured to sarum i promised you scandal too she said but alas it is not one youll take pleasure in for it involves your niece your sister petronillas elder daughter isabelle what has happened it seems she took those troubadours tales about courtly love too much to heart or at least her husband thought so flanders was apparently not fertile ground for notions of romance and besotted swains and unrequited love philip caught isabelle with one of his knights in compromising circumstances she swore that they were not lovers as did the man but philip was not convinced he ordered the knight to be beaten nigh onto death with a mace then hung by his heels over a cesspit until he suffocated jesu eleanor breathed what did he do to isabelle well he would not end the marriage for then hed lose her inheritance vermandois so he somehow persuaded her to assign her rights to him emma dropped all pretense of insouciance and said with a hard edge now to her voice better we not know how he managed that indeed eleanor said just as grimly god help the girl it does not matter if she was guilty of adultery or not does it the mere appearance of impropriety was enough to damn her emma nodded and they both fell silent for a time contemplating the bleak future of isabelle of vermandois and the sad fate of her alleged lover i never thought id say this eleanor said finally but i am glad that my sister is dead shed be half mad with fear for her daughter whilst knowing there was little she could do emma decided to overlook the unsatisfactory quality of the wine and drained her cup there is something else you need to know eleanor last month harry met with cardinal ugo pierleoni a papal legate hed invited to england harry sought the cardinal out eleanor was astonished for no papal legate had set foot on english soil during the twentyone years of her husbands reign it did not take her long to guess why henry wanted to consult a papal legate and she said with a thin smile so he wants to see if the pope would be agreeable to the dissolution of his marriage well ostensibly the cardinals mission was to settle the interminable feuding between the sees of york and canterbury but i think you can safely assume that the question of your marriage came up in conversation hed have no trouble finding grounds for annulment eleanor conceded louis and i made use of that reliable pretext consanguinity and harry could invoke it too for we are actually more closely related by blood than louis and i were or if he wanted to break new ground i suppose he could raise the specter of treason but then hed find himself in the very same predicament that faced louis once our marriage was ended hed lose any claim to aquitaine somehow i cannot envision harry being quite as trusting as louis bidding me farewell to return to my own duchy knowing how happy the french king would be to come to my defense how eager to fulfill his obligations as my liege lord i agree emma said however much harry might want to rid himself of you hed not be willing to yield up aquitaine either to you or richard it is a tangled coil for certes a gordian knot but this i know if there is a man capable of escaping that maze it is my brother yes eleanor said reluctantly you may well be right at least i will not be taken by surprise now thank you emma for the warning you are welcome emma rose without haste smoothing her skirt and adjusting her wimple there is one more matter she said one more good deed i can do for you rhiannon told me about the milkmaid her gaze flicked toward the oblivious edith an expression of disdain turning down that lovely mouth i think i can do us both a good turn for one of my ladiesinwaiting has been pining away in wales id send her back to normandy but she has no family there shes thrice a widow but barren and she is too proud to impose upon cousins why not speak with her if she suits you ill be spared her sulks and complaints and at the least youll have an attendant who speaks french would she be willing it could be argued that serving me is a form of captivity in and of itself since shes not taken vows i assume the quiet of the cloister holds no appeal for her emmas smile was dismissive trust me shell thank god fasting for the chance to escape from wales eleanor let her reach the door before she spoke again emmai have to ask if only out of curiosity why did you come to see me why did you warn me that harry is pondering an annulment emma paused silent for so long that eleanor decided she was not going to answer lets just say she said that it was a gesture of good will one unhappy wife to another amaria de torigny was a stillhandsome woman in her forties with wideset dark eyes strong but comely features and more curves than were fashionable she bore eleanors scrutiny with equanimity and answered readily enough when she was asked of her history yes she was indeed kin to the abbot of mont st michel a second cousin she believed and yes she had been wed three times and thrice widowed first as a lass to a neighbor old enough to be her grandfather then to a norman knight and lastly to the steward of the breton lord andre de vitre adding that shed entered the service of the lady emma after her last husbands death and you have no wish to try matrimony a fourth time eleanor queried both curious and wanting to be sure amaria could be content in the seclusion of sarum it would take a brave man to take me to wife given my sad marital history to be widowed twice is not so out of the ordinary but when you lose a third husband people start to take notice amaria said so matteroffactly that eleanor almost missed it the faintest gleam of very dry humor and you have no close kin yesi do madame amaria corrected sounding surprised i have several brothers and a sister who is a nun at fontevrault abbey and of course my laval cousins i must have misheard the lady emma eleanor said for i thought she said that you had no children or family back in normandy the lady emma misspoke i bore my second husband two babes one who died when we overlay her in our bed and one who was stillborn and the laval cousins i mentioned are kin to lady emmas late husband eleanor was quiet for a moment assessing what shed so far learned this was a strong woman strong enough to have buried two children and three husbands and survived yet there was something that did not ring true about the entire matter emma was not particularly interested in the personal lives of others and may well have forgotten that amaria had lost two babies in infancy assuming that shed even known but how could she have forgotten that amaria was kin to her husband you are wondering what pieces are missing from this puzzle amaria said unexpectedly may i speak candidly madame i wish you would the truth is that the lady emma had her own reasons for her offer to you i have been with her for a year and a half now and i think i have worn out my welcome but i am her late husbands cousin and so she would not want to dismiss me out of hand if i entered your service my lady my family back in laval would feel that shed done right by me it is true you are in disgrace but you are still the queen of england and that would not fail to impress my brothers what have you done to displease emma eleanor asked although she thought she already knew the answer to that i have my share of failings madame as do we all but the one that seems to vex the lady emma the most is my unfortunate habit of speaking my mind too forthrightly ive never learned the art of dissembling and it seems that is highly valued in a ladys maid apparently too much candor can become tedious or so lady emma tells me i suspected as much eleanor said suppressing a smile any woman whod tell a queen to her face that she was in disgrace would not flourish in the artificial mannered society of the highborn the art of dissembling was more than a virtue in the corridors of power it was a survival skill amaria was watching her intently i suppose ive ruined my chances she said sounding resigned but not apologetic i did not think it was likely youd take me on in truth thank you my lady as she started to rise eleanor waved her back you are too hasty lady amaria as it happens i think youll do very well truly amaria hid neither her surprise nor her pleasure id never have wagered on that outcome my lady she said and grinned if my outspokenness did not put you off i feared you might be suspicious wondering if this was not a plot concocted by lady emma and the king to place a spy in your household eleanor laughed outright the thought did cross my mind but i could see no profit in it you see amaria the victor rarely bothers to spy upon the vanquished she rose then indicating the interview was over you may tell the lady emma that i will be pleased to have you join my household such as it is amaria had gotten to her feet as soon as eleanor rose you will not be sorry my lady well at least i hope not she amended and curtsied before moving toward the door there she paused madamei would not pretend to know the kings mind have only seen him briefly but at windsor he seemed surprisingly tense and troubled for a man you call the victor and then fearing shed overstepped her bounds before shed even entered eleanors service she curtsied again and backed out the door eleanor sat down again on the settle there was some satisfaction in the image conjured up by amarias words as wretched as she was she wanted harry to be miserable too and yet she was aware of an underlying sense of sadness theirs may have been the first war in which there were no winners only losers c hapter t wentytwo february woodstock england meliora watched from a distance as the king emerged into the manor bailey he did not look happy and her spirits sank it must not have gone well with rosamund she waited until hed entered the great hall before making her way to the royal bedchamber there she found rosamund huddled on the bed weeping as if shed never stop ah lamb scrambling up onto the bed she gathered the younger woman into her arms the king would not agree then no rosamund looked up blue eyes swollen to slits her face streaked with tears i tried so hard to make him understand meliora i told him how much i wanted to retire to the nunnery at godstow that i could no longer live in a state of sin but he became very distraught he asked if i still loved him and of course i had to say that i did and i do he insisted that was what mattered and we could find a way to ease my mind he said he could not bear to lose me she sobbed again seemed to have so much trouble catching her breath that an alarmed meliora slid off the bed and brought her a cup of wine urging her to drink rosamund obediently took a swallow and then wiped her face with her sleeve tell me what to do meliora i cannot bear to cause him such pain but this is the kindest wayi know that if i cannot convince him of this though meliora found herself blinking back tears of her own you may have to tell him the truth lamb she said softly but as she expected rosamund shook her head vehemently no i will not do that to him i will not make him watch me die meliora did not know what to say and rocked rosamund in her arms until her sobs subsided and eventually she fell into an exhausted sleep only then did she get her mantle and leave the chamber outside she halted in confusion unsure what to do next she considered the idea of going to the king herself but not for long she could not betray rosamunds confidence nor had she the courage to confront the king to argue without the one weapon that might sway him who in christendom did an icy rain had fallen earlier in the day it was dry now but the bailey was still muddy and windswept as she started toward the chapel intending to beseech the almighty to aid his daughter rosamund in her time of travail shed only gone a few steps though before she came to an abrupt halt staring at the man whod just exited the great hall the lord god had answered her prayers for there was one at woodstock with the courage to tell the king what he did not want to hear and the moral authority to prevail without revealing rosamunds illness my lord bishop as roger turned she hastened toward him would have sunk to her knees in the mud before him had he not stopped her i am dame meliora your grace handmaiden to the lady rosamund can you spare a few moments for me it is a matter of the greatest urgencythe state of my ladys immortal soul why did you insist upon dragging me out to the springs roger henry cast a pessimistic glance at the overcast sky were likely to have to swim back to the manor roger decided theyd come far enough and slowed his steps i wanted to speak with you in privacy he said with no fear of prying eyes or pricked ears about what sin henrys brows shot upward you do remember cousin that you are not my confessor i am not jesting harry this is too grave a matter for that i need to speak with you about the lady rosamund clifford indeed henrys voice had hardened roger could see the tightening of the muscles along his jaw rosamund is none of your concern my lord bishop harryyou must let her go she spoke to you about thisabout godstow henry sounded incredulous and then defiant as i said this is none of your concern let it be roger i cannot do that my lord king for the stakes are too high if you love herand i think you dothat is why you must let her withdraw to the nunnery at godstow priory i do love her henry said and that is why i will not let her go this is but a whim of hers a fancy that will pass i know her roger you do not roger was silent marshaling his arguments regretting his promise to meliora that hed say nothing of rosamunds suspicions the recurring pain in her breast henry was scowling but roger took heart from the fact that hed not stalked away in a royal rage he hoped that meant his cousin was not as free of misgivings as he claimed i am willing to risk your anger he said quietly for royal favor means little when balanced against eternal damnation it is my concern for her immortal soul that bids me be so bold with you she gave up much for your sake cousinher maidenhead her honor marriage and motherhood would you have her give up her chances of salvation too damn you henry said low voiced hed backed against a nearby oak a massive tree barren of leaves gnarled and ancient damn you he said again even as his shoulders slumped and the color drained from his face the benedictine nunnery of st mary and st john the baptist had been founded in the year of henrys birth situated on an island between two streams of the river thames just north of oxford it had always been a haven for rosamund shed been educated there and still had a deep and abiding love for the convent and the nuns whod schooled her in her youth standing in the familiar priory precincts to bid farewell to the king rosamund experienced a sense of utter unreality was this a dream or had her long love affair with harry been one they had exchanged their private farewell the night before at woodstock and so they were formal now in the presence of prioress edith and the other nuns henry kissed her hand and she made a respectful curtsy even though she knew that the nuns were well aware of their scandalous liaison i have to attend a great council with the papal legate next month in london henry murmured too softly for any ears but rosamunds and then ill be holding my easter court at winchester i will stop to see you on the way go with god my lord she whispered seeing him through a blur of tears come prioress edith said briskly as soon as henry and his men had departed we have prepared a guest house for you rosamund was honored that the prioress herself had chosen to escort them shed known they would make her welcome the kings favor would be a great blessing for the priory but she was touched to find so many of the nuns waiting for her at her new lodgings as her anxiety about her reception had increased the pragmatic meliora had pointed out that shed been very generous with the convent since becoming the kings mistress to rosamund that counted for little against the shame of adultery so far though shed encountered no hostility or disdain neither overt nor implied nuns who had taught her in her youth greeted her warmly as a former pupil not as a wanton seeking redemption seeing the exhaustion etched into rosamunds face and posture the prioress sent the other nuns off to their duties leaving rosamund alone with meliora the older woman hovered nearby not wanting to smother her with too much attention too much solicitude it was not easy though for shed learned to love rosamund as one of her own daughters you will consult with the infirmarian this afternoon dearest i will meliora rosamund promised dutifully she sat on the bed watching as meliora set about unpacking their coffers still feeling as if she were sleepwalking she could feel the tears welling up in her eyes again as she thought of her last night with henry his pain was so much harder to bear than her own rising abruptly she announced she was going for a walk slipping out before meliora could protest prioress edith had said dinner was served in the guest hall and the position of the sun told her that noon was nigh there were several widows living at the nunnery and she could imagine theyd be avidly curious about the kings concubine she had no appetite was never hungry these days and she decided to forgo the meal not yet ready to face an audience instead she headed for the church inside all was serene shadowed and still nothing had changed it was like going back in time moving into the nave she approached the high altar kneeling she began to pray for her royal lover that he would not grieve for her too much shed expected to fall apart once she was alone giving way then to the heartbreak shed been stifling for his sake but her tears soon dried and as she prayed she realized that some of her sorrow was easing there was comfort in these familiar surroundings there was comfort in the invocations of childhood this was the first time in years that shed been able to bare her soul to the almighty without being in a state of sin her confessor had never been able to absolve her for they both knew shed continue sleeping with the king now she could repent without reservations she could accept the penance laid upon her could atone for her transgressions and die in a state of grace and kneeling there in the church of godstow priory she rediscovered what shed long ago lost and thought forever denied herthe promise of inner peace a keen march wind was gusting and winters chill still lingered even though easter was less than a fortnight away eleanor did not mind the mercurial weather though so pleased was she to be riding in the open air under a sky the color of bluebells her mare seemed to have been infected with her high spirits and was fighting the bit eager to run glancing over at amaria mounted on a more docile gelding eleanor was tempted to challenge her to race thinking of sir ralphs panicked reaction should his royal prisoner suddenly gallop off into the distance she laughed aloud amaria smiled at the sound of that laughter she did not know what awaited them sir ralph had told them only that hed received orders to move the queen from sarum to winchester but it was enough for her that the queen was so happy on the journey however it ended amaria was convinced that the queen found confinement so oppressive because shed always enjoyed far more freedom than most women she was a wild bird caught in a net unlike her tamer sisters bred in captivity at the very least winchester would offer novelty a change from the predictable dreariness of days that were indistinguishable one from the other it was dusk before they saw the walls of winchester in the distance as they approached the westgate amaria glanced toward the adjoining castle and cried out at the sight of the banner flapping in the march wind my lady look the king is here eleanor did not share amarias surprise shed quickly concluded that this trek to winchester was connected to her husbands annulment plans why else would sir ralph have said shed not be returning to sarum what was harry up to now well shed soon see she was not as nervous about this meeting as shed been before their confrontation at falaise for she had more than two years of experience as his prisoner to draw upon now knew where hed set the boundaries for himself she need not fear physical punishment or abuse or even deprivation to any great extent he might even free her for the sake of their children if he could find a way to clip her wings or blunt her talons that was such a mixed metaphor that she could not help laughing again but it was as apt as it was incongruous if she saw herself as a caged dove harry saw her in far more predatory terms as a bird of prey by the time they passed into the outer bailey of winchesters great castle the sky was the shade of lavender dismounting first sir ralph hastened over to assist eleanor from her mare and she hoped her next gaoler would be as conscientious shed learned that courtesy mattered the most to those with no right to demand it maman the cry rang out across the bailey as clear as a harp chord eleanor spun around at the sound just in time to catch her daughter to her in a close embrace joanna was hugging her so tightly that her mantle brooch was being pressed into her skin but she did not care any more than shed cared about the driving rain when theyd been reunited at barfleur this reunion was different from the first one though for it was not being held under her husbands glowering baleful gaze henry was nowhere to be seen eleanor noted with ironic amusement that she had not been put in the queens chamber but she had no complaints about her lodgings the room was freshly painted hung with decorative wall hangings to shut out the cold the floor covered with fragrant rushes and the candles were made of costly beeswax not the malodorous tallow thank you dearest she said warmly for she was sure this was joannas doing the chamber is a fine one joanna was sprawled on the bed playing with her mothers cat as it cautiously ventured from its travel basket she glanced over her shoulder with a smile tell me what else you want maman and i will persuade papa to get it for you you sound very sure of yourself regina eleanor teased with a smile of her own and joannas throat constricted for it had been a long time since shed heard that affectionate pet name bestowed upon her by her brothers when talk had first begun of marriage to the king of sicily she could no longer remember who had first used it hal or richard but it brought back memories of those days when her parents were not at war with each other and her family was still intact papa rarely says nay to me she admitted and he is being even more generous now for the king of sicily is sending envoys to the court this spring and if all goes as planned i could sail for sicily ere the year is done so that is why i am at winchester joanna nodded i told him that nothing mattered more to me than having you with me ere i wed i explained she added with a grin that a girl needs her mother at such a time she was a confident clever child but a child nonetheless only in her eleventh year and soon to be a wife eleanor had accepted the practice for it was all she knew confinement had caused her to question many of the tenets shed once taken for granted though and regret caught at her heart now as she thought of sending joanna off to an alien land an unknown husband a fate to be determined by factors beyond her parents control sitting crosslegged on the bed joanna had lured the cat into her lap pronouncing herself satisfied with the name eleanor had chosen cleopatra in recognition of the little creatures haughty elegance and queenly will did i tell you maman that i got my first letter she sounded so proud as if this were a milestone toward adulthood and eleanor felt another protective pang wishing she could keep this fledgling in the nest for a little longer it was from tilda joanna revealed obviously flattered that her elder sister had thought she was old enough to receive her own correspondence she wrote to papa too she had another baby a second son who has been named lothair the sound of that odd german name sent her into a fit of giggles but she soon grew serious again tilda is distraught by what has happened to our family maman she says she does not understand i do not know what to tell her for i do not understand either ah child eleanor sat beside her on the bed put an arm around the girls shoulders it occurred to her then that joanna had yet to mention hal an odd omission unless he was no longer at his fathers court what of your brother will hal be permitted to see me too hal is gone maman he has been very restless of late and none too happy he decided he wanted to go on pilgrimage to the shrine at santiago de compostela papa was loath to consent did not seem to think that was a good idea at all but hal persisted he can be very stubborn you know and at last papa compromised agreed to let him go to normandy for a time hal and marguerite left a few days ago for porchester such a shame you missed him for i know how dearly hed have loved to see you indeed a shame eleanor said very dryly if joanna thought hals absence was due to coincidence well and good she knew better joanna appeared in eleanors bedchamber early the next morning reluctantly leaving later only for dinner in the great hall eleanor was served her meal in her own chamber although she had to admit the quality of the lenten food was no less than what was being served at the high table in the hall it was clear to her that henry did not want to give joanna any cause for complaint about her mothers treatment and she grudgingly gave him credit for putting their daughters wishes above his own shed dressed that morning in the best of her gowns for she was anticipating a royal summons and it was not long in coming once dinner was done the castellan came to escort her to the king the solar was still shuttered for the day held none of the longedfor warmth of spring it was well lit though with oil lamps and a large iron candelabrum henry was alone walking back and forth before the fireplace this was the first time shed seen him in almost two years and she was startled by the change in his appearance although his ceaseless activity had kept him fit hed always had a powerful stocky build he was noticeably thinner now his face so drawn that it almost looked gaunt and his closely cropped reddish hair was showing traces of grey she suspected that these past months had been no kinder to her but the fashionable wimple framed her face in a flattering way concealing any signs of aging and her own grey hairs were covered by the graceful folds of her veil they regarded each other in silence for a few moments eleanor content to let him set the pace if youll have a seat he said coolly we have matters to discuss eleanor sat in the chair hed indicated noting that hed provided wine for them both so this was to be a duel conducted with civility as he took a seat across the table from her she said as if they were resuming an interrupted conversation so will you accept the king of sicily for our joanna taken by surprise he said yes i think so ill put his proposal before my council in london but i do not expect any objections to be raised it will be a good match for her one she seems content with yes she does eleanor agreed claiming a small victory by compelling him to acknowledge that she still had the right to voice her opinions about their daughters future what dowry is he proposing to give her the same that was discussed when the issue of marriage was first raised he will grant her the county of st angelo the cities of liponti and viesta and various castles and towns henry was not comfortable with the direction their discussion had taken this could have been any idle intimate conversation between husband and wife we need to talk about the future he said abruptly retreating into his public personathe dispassionate king detached and distant that was a part eleanor had often played herself but she had no intention now of submerging the woman in the queen whether he liked it or not hed have to deal with his wife smiling she raised her cup and took a sip of wine how is the annulment progressing she had to admire his control only the narrowing of his eyes told her that her thrust had hit home i expect he said very evenly that you are as eager as i am to end this mockery of a marriage if only for the sake of our children we need a resolution a way to put the past behind us and move on i am certainly in favor of that eleanor said lightly to her surprise she was beginning to enjoy herself but there is that awkward little problemaquitaine we both want it and i actually have a blood right to it a right the french king would be only too happy to recognize if you set me free i can promise to be guided by you in all matters of importance to be good her smile came and went so fast that he could not be sure hed seen it could you trust me though henry took the bait id sooner trust in the honor of the lowest southwark whore he snapped he at once regretted the flare of temper hed sworn that hed not let her provoke him not like that wretched morning at falaise you want your freedom and i am willing to grant it to youunder certain conditions do you care to hear them i am waiting breathlessly she assured him what is the price i must pay i will never let you loose in aquitaine again that big a fool i am not that was not one of louiss better decisions was it even if it did rebound to your benefit so what do you propose then do not leave me in suspense i entreat you you agree to the annulment you agree too to relinquish your rights to aquitaine and what do i get from that devils deal i am free to do whatto beg my bread by the side of the road youll have to do better than that my lord husband you did not let me finish he said coldly you take the veil and enter fontevrault abbeyas its abbess it is one of the most renowned abbeys in christendom one of the few where the abbess rules over monks as well as nuns you could have a very comfortable life with enough authority and influence to satisfy even a former duchess i would retain my overlordship over the duchy but richards status as heir would not be affected he would still be recognized as the count of poitou and eventual ruler of aquitaine i think it is a reasonable solution far more than you deserve if truth be told you get your freedom and enormous prestige as the abbess of a great abbey i get peace of mind and richard still gets aquitaine which is what you always wanted eleanor leaned back in her chair for a moment her face was noncommittal he had no idea what she was thinking and then she startled him by clapping aloud ah well done harry i knew youd find a way once you put your mind to it an ideal solution for certes you no longer need fear that i am becoming too friendly with louis or philip of flanders you can still meddle in aquitaine whenever you get the urge and you can continue to spend my money of course whilst keeping richard on a tight rein for an heir and a duke are not quite one and the sameas you learned to your cost with hal best of all fontevrault is in anjou so you can make sure that id not do more plotting than praying henry found her flippancy very irritating there was too much at stake to yield to it though as i said it will be beneficial to us both moreover it will please our children if we reach an accord do you need time to consider this i would think the advantages would be too obvious to require much thought but if you no that is kind of you but quite unnecessary i do not need any time to consider my answer is no henry was on his feet so fast that his chair toppled over into the floor rushes may i ask why he said measuring each word with deadly calm eleanor smiled i do not think i have the vocation for the religious life harry id not make a very good nun i was doing you a courtesy by asking madame your consent is but a formality that is not what the church says you cannot force me to take holy vows do you care to wager your freedom on that i offered to make you the abbess of the richest abbey in my domains it can just as easily be an impoverished irish convent so remote and secluded that not even god could find you do you truly think it would be as easy as that to make me disappear i am not just your unwanted wife i am the duchess of aquitaine she stood now too took her time in positioning her mantle about her shoulders you need not see me out dearest i am sorry to disappoint your little trifle but surely she could not have been so stupid to think youd marry her once you were rid of me she was taken aback when he went ashen shed intended only a glancing blow had not meant to hit a vital organ get out he said tonelessly and the very lack of emotion in his voice was what she found most disquieting she moved toward the door keeping her eyes upon him all the while pausing outside in the pentise to catch her breath the silence from the solar was ominous it was with relief therefore that she heard the sudden sharp thud the sound of his wine cup striking the door behind her only then did she walk away a faint smile playing about her mouth it took willem some time to track henry down finally finding him in the stable examining his new white palfrey henry had told him hed be broaching the subject of fontevrault abbey with eleanor that afternoon and he wanted to make sure it had gone well he could not imagine why it would not but if all women were capricious creatures of impulse harrys disgraced queen was downright perverse and even as a prisoner dangerous one look at henrys grim profile was enough to give him his answer she balked he asked in astonishment she said she does not think shed make a very good nun hours later henry was still seething the bitch all but dared me to force her into a nunnery as god is my witness willem i swear i my liege willem said warningly for hed seen what henry had not the appearance of joanna in the doorway of the stable there you are papa ive been looking everywhere for you she chided hurrying toward the stall where she paused to admire his new stallion he is a beauty papa may i name him for you henry did not think that was a good idea hed heard some of the names that joanna bestowed upon her pets but he found it almost impossible to deny her anything these days shed become even more precious now that he was so close to losing her if you insist lass he said making an effort to swallow his anger do not embarrass him though by giving him a name better suited to a mare horses are not embarrassedare they momentarily distracted she pondered that for a moment you are just teasing me papadid you speak with maman yet about becoming the abbess of fontevrault i did joanna she refused the offer willem blinked he hadnt known that henry had discussed this with his daughter but when he saw the look of disappointment that crossed her face he understood that was shrewd he thought getting the lass on harrys side it was to be expected that shed like the idea from a childs perspective it must seem like the perfect solution her mother would no longer be a prisoner instead would rule an important abbey it would have to be easier for the girl to leave england for her new life in sicily if she could believe that her mother was beginning a new life too ill talk to her joanna said mayhap i can get her to change her mind she frowned lost in thought and then smiled i know who could persuade her papa hal could hal is most likely in normandy by now henry reminded her but she was shaking her head no he is still at porchester i heard men talking in the hall at dinner they said the winds were still blowing the wrong way allowing ships to sail from normandy but keeping porchesters ships in port hal is very unhappy with mamans confinement i think it would ease his mind greatly if she became the abbess and he can be most convincing when he wants to be papa willem stayed silent curious to see how henry got out of the trap but to his surprise henry seemed to be giving it consideration telling joanna that she might be right he restrained himself until after the little girl had gotten bored and wandered off and then said are you serious about summoning hal back to talk to the queen it is not a bad notion henry conceded i cannot keep them apart forever however much id like to willem he has asked me twice if he may visit her and sooner or later i must agree or hell not forgive me jesu how that lad can cherish a grievance and i think joanna is right he probably would favor the idea yes willem said he probably would leaving unsaid the rest of his thought that hal was always one for the easy way hed likely be relieved if he did not have to fret about his mothers welfare he glanced at henry as the other man reached for a brush and began to curry his horse wondering if hed also seen that flaw in his sons character most likely he had that would explain why he so often watched hal with such troubled eyes by the first saturday in april winchester was overflowing with highborn guests barons and princes of the church come to pay honor to their king and the king of kings upon the solemn festival of easter with the archbishop of canterbury the bishops of winchester exeter bath and ely present the castle cooks were already anticipating the end of lent planning the great feast they would serve the king and his guests once eastertide began henry was enjoying a frank political discussion with the bishops of ely and bath for he need not weigh his words with either man geoffrey ridel and reginald fitz jocelin had been his agents before being rewarded for their loyalty with mitres from the corner of his eye he saw that his daughter had sidled up onto the dais and seated herself in his highbacked chair obviously practicing for the day when she too would wear a crown and he felt a surge of affectionate pride soured by anxiety ten suddenly seemed such a tender age and sicily at the back of beyond seeing the direction of his gaze the bishops smiled willing to indulge the father until the king turned his attention back to them it was then that the steward hastened into the hall headed straight for henry my liege the young king has just ridden in he announced he hesitated then and decided to let lord hal be the one to tell him the rest of the news for he suspected the king would not be pleased this development could only complicate his tenuous truce with the queen hal had never learned the royal skill of dissembling in public and as he strode into the hall he seemed to trail storm clouds in his wake henry had known hed be disgruntled at being summoned back to winchester like this for hed fear that his normandy jaunt was imperiled he knew too that once hal learned the reason for his return hed be flattered that his father had sought his aid and delighted to see his mother but as he looked at his sons handsome sullen face henry could not suppress a sigh why did he have to work so hard to keep the lad in a good humor as a boy hal had been sunnynatured and full of fun given to pranks but not tantrums how had he changed so much in such a few short years my lord king hal said giving a formal salutation appropriate to their distinguished audience but then joanna squeezed through the encircling guests to greet him with a pert brother youre back hal abandoned protocol and gathered her into a fond embrace joannas brothers had always vied with one another to see who could spoil her the most where is marguerite henry asked coming forward to welcome his son she stayed behind at porchester that made more sense as i assumed i would not be long at winchester hal said delivering a veiled warning as well as an explanation letting his father know that he was still set upon departing england you once told me you were stranded at barfleur for six weeks awaiting favorable winds my lord father i do not know how you endured the wait weve been bored unto death in porchester youll want to send for her joanna predicted when you hear the reason for your return we have a special surprise for you do you now imp hal grinned down at his little sister as it happens i have a surprise too guess who landed yesterday at southampton henry felt a sudden premonition before he could confirm his suspicions the door banged open and his sons richard and geoffrey entered the hall they started toward him looking far more pleased to be at winchester than hal but joanna was faster with a gleeful cry of richard she met him in midhall henry could only watch as the scene played itself out to its inevitable conclusion maman is here joanna gasped so excited she was almost hyperventilating here in winchester hal looked dumbfounded geoffrey no less surprised richard grasped joannas arm demanding where show me come on she said and they headed for the door hal and geoffrey caught up with them in a few strides acutely aware of the utter silence in the hall henry followed after them halting in the doorway richard and hal and joanna were strung out across the bailey running as if their very lives depended upon speed geoffrey trailed in the rear his a more measured pace and as he watched them henry could hear again with haunting clarity his wifes bitter taunt youve already lost what you value almost as much as your kingdom youve lost your sons c hapter t wentythree april winchester england in her girlhood eleanor had learned to play the harp for that was considered a social requisite for young women of high birth she had not continued with the lessons though and so she was quite pleased to learn that amaria was an accomplished harpist after a word to joanna a harp was delivered to her chamber and she was watching intently as amaria played a plaintive melody wait let me see you play that chord again she said for shed determined to revive her rusty musical skills during this enforced idleness amaria was complying when the door was thrust open without warning and her sons burst into the chamber splendor of god she whispered not believing her own senses until she was being embraced by richard and then hal then richard again as geoffrey and joanna waited impatiently for their turn and amaria who had a secret sentimental vein shed so far hidden from eleanor smiled through tears as she watched her ladys reunion with her sons with the innocent selfabsorption of the young theyd asked few questions so far about their mothers confinement instead richard and hal were vying for her attention each one seeking to impress her with his exploits and adventures in these past two years richard had the advantage here for he had military deeds to brag about and hal had only accounts of forest court sessions and diplomatic missions which even he would concede lacked the panache or verve of castle sieges and raids that did not stop him from seeking to regain control of the conversation every time richard paused for breath joanna was just as rapt an audience as eleanor but amaria noticed that geoffrey had soon stopped competing with his brothers and was slouched in the windowseat conceding them center stage feeling amarias gaze upon him he smiled and said softly rather like watching two dogs fighting over a bone no that so eerily echoed her own thoughts that she gave him a surprised smile although later she would think the comment was too cynical for a lad of seventeen richard was dwelling again upon his triumph at castillon assuring his mother that arnald de bonville sang a very different tune the day he surrendered than when the siege began hed claimed it could hold out till judgment day but that came much sooner than hed expected hal heaved an audible sigh and shifted in his seat stretching his legs out so joanna could lean against him he wondered how long his brother was going to hold forth about the capture of one paltry castle he made it sound like the most significant military accomplishment since the days of caesar he suddenly remembered then that he had news of a sensational nature to share news richard wasnt likely to have heard yet and he wasted no time in cutting richard off in midsentence i have astonishing news maman concerning that clifford harlot she has withdrawn from court and our fathers bed and entered the nunnery at godstow as hed hoped that ended any interest in his younger brothers boasting they were all staring at him exclaiming in surprise even richard looked interested in this dramatic revelation are you sure hal eleanor asked doubtfully for that did not seem very likely to her i swear it is so maman last month papa escorted her from his manor at woodstock to godstow where he made a generous contribution to the nunnery it has been the talk of the court ever since no one seems to know why though some think papa was growing tired of her others that she was ailing ive heard people insist that she was stricken with guilt and wanted to repent for sinning as papas concubine but ive also heard it claimed that she is with child and hopes to have the babe in secret the truth is that no one knows the real reason for no one has been brave enough to ask our father and yes he conceded with a wry grin that includes me too has she taken vows and when hal admitted he did not know eleanor fell silent to ponder this amazing bit of news she did not have any great animosity toward the girl for she knew how beguiling her husband could be when he put his mind to it she knew too that it would be no easy thing to refuse the king her anger had always been aimed more at henry than rosamund not for the infidelity itself but for the emotional attachment that shed seen as a betrayal far more than any sins of the flesh it was then that she remembered the strange way hed reacted to her barb about rosamund earlier in the week whatever the reason for rosamunds nunnery retreat it was not because harry had tired of her a man does not grieve for a woman who no longer holds his affections just then a timid knock announced a servant with a message for the young lords hed been sent by the steward he explained to remind them that the hour was growing short and the easter eve feast was soon to start eleanors sons rose reluctantly surprised when she remained seated it was left to joanna to tell them that shed been eating her meals here in her own chamber not in the hall with their highborn guests that is absurd hal said indignantly as richard snatched up his mothers mantle and held it out eleanor took it without hesitation and then linked her arm in hals as he made a gallants bow richard glowered at hal but recovered quickly and made joanna laugh when he asked for the honor of escorting her in the exaggerated courtly style made popular by jongleurs and troubadours that left geoffrey to offer his arm to amaria which he did with that quick smile of secret amusement amaria was nervous though as they emerged into the bailey and headed for the great hall shed heard so many stories of the kings notorious tempers had no wish to witness one firsthand the odd intimacy of their circumstances had encouraged a bonding that would not normally take place between a queen and her attendants in the few months since shed entered eleanors service amaria had come to see them as allies even friends and she had no desire to return to the welsh court of the discontented lady emma and her unscrupulous braggart of a husband but it occurred to her that king henry might well look around for safer targets for his rage turn upon her the fury he could not turn upon his queen catching the hesitation in her step geoffrey gave her a curious glance and she decided to take him into her confidence saying quietly my lord we both know the king will like it not when the queen enters with the young king do you think he will react with anger or make a scene no dame amaria i do not geoffrey said at once most likely he suspects this will happen but even if he is truly taken by surprise he will save face by acting as if this were planned to do otherwise would be to admit before all his bishops and barons that my mother outwitted him he seemed to read her mind then for he added nor will he dismiss you in disgrace in fairness to him he has never been one to chase after scapegoats prefers to hunt more challenging quarry youve eased my mind kind sir amaria said playfully and hoped that he knew his father better than henry seemed to know his sons their arrival stopped all conversation created just the sort of commotion that theyd hoped it would as the highborn guests forgot their dignity and crowded closer to gape at henrys rebel queen henry himself seemed to take eleanors dramatic appearance in stride and came down the steps of the dais to meet her madame he said composedly kissing her hand and then taking her arm to escort her to the high table eleanor played her part with no less aplomb pausing to acknowledge the greetings of her husbands guests as they made their way toward the dais henrys selfcontrol never faltered but the arm she held was as hard and unyielding as granite once she was seated beside him she did her best to hide her jubilation behind a demure demeanor but after their wineglasses had been filled she could not resist a gentle gibe raising her cup she favored henry with her most loving smile as she murmured i trust ive no need of a food taster the smile he gave her in return was not in the least loving poison is your weapon of choice not mine madame he shot back just as softly though it is true that you prefer to poison minds rather than wine her smile did not waver and she clicked her cup lightly against his as all eyes in the hall fastened avidly upon them but she had the uncomfortable feeling that hed gotten the last word in that exchange the tavern was located in goldstret in the goldsmiths quarter close by st clements church richard had been waiting long enough for his simmering impatience to reach the boiling point he was fidgeting restlessly drumming his fingers on the scarred waxsplattered table waving away a serving maid whod approached to see if he wanted more wine finally the door was shoved open and his brothers swaggered in geoffrey was accompanied only by a squire but hal had his usual entourage of household knights and they made such a noisy entrance that all heads turned in their direction what took you so long richard demanded as soon as they approached his table i told you by compline blame sir bountiful here geoffrey said pointing his thumb at hal he had to stop and give alms to every beggar within a halfmile of the castle even chasing one across the street to press coins upon him charity is a virtue hal responded jostling geoffrey goodnaturedly but then youd not know much about virtues would you sit down richard said quickly before geoffrey could retort in kind we need to talk hals knights were milling about nearby and he added alone with a pointed glance toward the other men hal dismissed them with an airy you heard my little brother go off and debauch yourselves ill pay for your wine but not for your whores there youre on your own as they grinned and obeyed he looked around at the other tavern patrons and said ah why not ill buy drinks for everyone his generosity won him enthusiastic cheers from all but his brothers and the tavern keeper richard saw hals magnanimous gesture as shameless grandstanding and geoffrey laughed out loud at the look of horror on the tavern owners face pulling up a stool to the table he said the poor sot knows he has a better chance of sprouting wings than collecting so much as a farthing that is not so hal protested i always pay my debtseventually he and geoffrey both laughed and looked vexed when richard waved the serving maid away again i did not ask you here to drink this swill we need to talk about fontevrault abbey maman says that i already know all about it hal interrupted with a hint of smugness papa told me last night well no one bothered to enlighten me geoffrey said testily so suppose one of you lets me in on the secret richard looked around to make sure the other customers had gone back to their drinking and gambling he wants maman to agree to an annulment and then retire to fontevrault abbeyas its abbess as bribes go that is not a bad one geoffrey allowed and hal grinned saying that was his thinking too richard glared at his brothers she does not want to enter a nunnery hal shrugged is she sure of that it is a generous offer would give her far more influence than she is enjoying these days maman could make of it what she wanted were not talking about life as a recluse or an anchoress for pitys sake shed be abbess of fontevrault and there are queens who might well envy that is your hearing faulty i said she does not want to do it hal hal returned richards scowl in full measure and geoffrey could see another of their squabbles brewing before hal could respond he said sharply enough they looked at him in surprise and he glanced over his shoulder to see if theyd attracted attention as usual hal you see only what is right in front of your nose as for you richard even when youre right youre right for all the wrong reasons neither one of you has fully considered the consequences of this annulment temporarily united in their irritation with geoffrey they launched a joint attack hal insisting that he understood the situation quite well and richard wanting to know what he meant by the wrong reasons keep your voices down geoffrey warned tell me this how old is papa i do not know richard said snappishly fortytwo no fortythree hal corrected remembering chinon and his fathers march birthday what of it to us that seems as old as god but it is not he could easily wed again and have sons with his new queen think about that for a moment hal was already shaking his head he would never disinherit me richard did not look so sure you truly think we could be put at risk geoff i do not know geoffrey admitted but i am not willing to take that chance are you look how he has begun to dote upon johnny even giving him the earldom of his uncle rainald i am just saying that if he had a few more sons we could become superfluous at the very least it would give him a formidable club to hold over our heads now if you both have utter faith in his good will there is no cause for concern sodo you neither hal nor richard answered him but words were not needed they regarded one another in silence in a rare moment of mutual understanding and total accord henry glanced toward his scribe are you ready simon write as follows to william by the grace of god the illustrious king of sicily the duke of apulia and the prince of capua henry by the same grace king of england duke of normandy and aquitaine and count of anjou greetings and the enjoyment of health inasmuch as we expect that he got no further for it was then that his sons sought admittance to his bedchamber henry immediately gave them permission to enter and dismissed his scribe telling him theyd resume on the morrow when they asked if they could speak with him alone he readily agreed surprised to see them together for he was unhappily aware that they rarely sought out one anothers company as soon as the other men had exited the chamber henry bade his sons help themselves to the flagon of night wine on a side table saying with a smile it is good that you are all here for i have plans to share with you richard you requested further aid in subduing the poitevin rebels and you wanted the same for brittany geoffrey your requests are granted you will be provided with the funds that you need ere you depart winchester his gaze shifted then to his eldest son i know you have been restless of late hal i daresay that was behind your sudden desire to go on pilgrimage so i am sending you back to poitou with richard to assist him in restoring peace in that troublesome land hal was very pleased richard less so for hed wanted men and money not to be saddled with his brother he joined hal in expressing his gratitude though thinking that hal would soon lose interest in the drudgery and tedium of a siege and go off in pursuit of pleasure hal was reconsidering the timing of their mission not wanting to jeopardize his new command and as soon as henrys back was turned he mouthed a message to his brothers that they ought to delay discussing fontevrault richard and geoffrey would have none of that though neither one trusting hal to remain resolute if their fathers inducements were sweetened enough we have come to talk with you about our mother and your intent to make her abbess of fontevrault richard said so abruptly that his brothers both winced it is only fair that i tell you at the outset that i am adamantly opposed to this scheme henry had been about to pour wine at that he swung about with a frown before he could speak geoffrey hastily interceded actually it is a sound plan fair to both you and maman and if she were willing id gladly support it alas she is not as you know and since it concerns her most directly we have to be guided by her wishes in this henry studied his younger sons and then looked toward hal what of you hal do your brothers speak for you too hal bridled i can speak for myself but i happen to agree with them do you passing strange for you seemed much more receptive to the idea when we discussed it last night yes that is true but once i had a chance to think about it i changed my mind hal smiled snidely the way you changed your mind about the forest laws henry was quiet for so long that his sons began to shift uneasily i understand he said at last and i will give your opinions the consideration they merit eleanor was holding up a mirror while amaria brushed her hair even in the candlelight she could see the sprinkling of silver and she grimaced remembering how shed once taken her beauty for granted not realizing what a potent weapon it had been until it was slipping from her grasp should i bother to hide the grey she wondered aloud and amaria at once volunteered to go into winchester to purchase the needed ingredients i cannot count all the sermons ive heard priests give over the years amaria said with a grin railing at female vanity and the sinful use of dyes and face paints but women will always do whatever they can to hold the years at bay and to make themselves look attractive to men why go to all that trouble though eleanor mused after all none but you can see the grey it is not as if my husband is going to be demanding his conjugal rights any time soon and i cannot say that i have plans to take a lover amaria chuckled women rarely plan to take a lover it just happens not for queens the one essential for love affairs is privacy and royal palaces have even less privacy than nunneries amaria had heard of course of the scandalous stories of the queens youth and would have loved to know the truth of them she would not have blamed eleanor for cuckolding the french king thinking that he deserved horns if any husband did outspoken though she might be she was not foolhardy and that was not a question shed have dared to ask instead she decided to broach a subject that had been causing her some unease of mind madameyou do not think the king would truly force you into taking holy vows do you he might if he thought he could get away with it eleanor said sounding much too nonchalant for amarias liking but whatever harrys failings slowness of wit is not amongst them he knows his grand scheme would work only if i agree to cooperate glancing over her shoulder at amaria she smiled coolly i am not as quick to gamble as i once was though so i told richard to appeal to the archbishop of rouen on my behalf amaria sighed with relief i am so glad to hear that she admitted and then spun around with a gasp as the door banged open she backed away hastily as henry stormed into the chamber he was in such an obvious rage that her first instinct was to flee but she was reluctant to leave eleanor alone with him for that very reason and so she stealthily retreated into the shadows trying to make herself as inconspicuous as possible she need not have bothered henry never even noticed her so focused was he upon the object of his angerhis infuriating conniving wife setting down the mirror she regarded him with provocative calm saying do come in my lord husband as if he were the one in the wrong i thought youd like to know that your latest scheme was highly successful your sons gallantly rode to your rescue tonight proclaiming themselves your champions it is a wonder you did not give them tokens of your favor to flaunt so that all would know they were your knights however little you like it harry they are my sons is it truly so surprising that they are protective of me what did you tell them precisely that i was going to load you down with chains and haul you off to a nunnery in the dead of night as a matter of fact i did not mention your threat you expect me to believe that as if youd pass up any chance to portray me as the knave and you as the innocent sacrificial lamb the damsel in distress i did not tell them because i did not take your threat seriously i know how you rave and rant when you lose your temper i also know that once you cool down you rarely if ever carry these threats out so i saw no reason to share them with our sons not unless you forced me to it more strife is the last thing our family needs st eleanor of aquitaine he mocked so wise and forbearing it is rather difficult though to reconcile that angelic image with the woman who urged my sons to rebel against me that was a mistake he stared at her in disbelief a mistake you destroyed our family and you call it a mistake yes damn you a mistake are you going to tell me that youve never made a mistake harry no he growled i made a great one on may in gods year and with that he turned and stalked out slamming the door resoundingly behind him amaria leaned weakly against the wall for a moment to her surprise the queen did not seem as distraught as she ought to have been after such a blazing row deciding though that they both needed wine she went over without being asked and poured two cups bringing one back to eleanor she made an attempt to sound blase as she said may i ask what happened on may in my lady harry and i were wed in poitiers eleanor took a swallow of the wine before saying usually he could never remember our anniversary amaria did not know what to say so she busied herself hunting in the floor rushes for the brush which shed dropped when henry barged into the chamber eleanor drank in silence seemingly lost in her own thoughts when their eyes met though she smiled a smile that somehow managed to be wry and rueful and bleak all at the same time harry and i have more in common than quick tempers she said we rarely make mistakes but when we do they tend to be spectacular amaria could not argue with that not when she considered the consequences of those mistakes the queens rebellion had cost her dearly might mean imprisonment for the rest of her days the kings rash angry words had resulted in a martyrs death upon the floor of canterbury cathedral she could only hope that the kings decision to crown his son would not prove to be a mistake of the same magnitude for all their sakes chapter twentyfour july poitiers poitou the bishops clerks smiled at the sight of the two men walking in the gardens for they were a study in contrasts john aux bellesmains bishop of poitiers was a tall willowy and elegant figure towering over the diminutive john of salisbury their history went back more than twenty years begun in those distant days when they and thomas becket had been clerks together in the household of archbishop theobald of canterbury john aux bellesmains had been elevated to his bishopric at the same time as thomas and now john of salisbury would have his own see too having been elected by the chapter of chartres on july he was on his way to sens for consecration but hed detoured to poitiers to see his old friend and on this muggy afternoon in late july they were making up for lost time sharing confidences both personal and political as the sun rose higher in the sky and the city sweltered under the summer heat once theyd seated themselves in the shade and accepted wine and fruit from the bishops attentive servants john of salisbury raised his cup in a mock salute to your military exploits my lord bishop you are a man of many talents for certes you did remember to use a mace though and not a sword salisbury was indulging in some canonical humor for warlike bishops had been known to carry a mace into battle as a means of avoiding the stricture against priests shedding blood on the dubious grounds that scriptures said nothing against battering an enemys brains into mush his companion smiled somewhat sheepishly for hed never expected to garner military acclaim actually he said all i did was raise the local levy providing the men for the defense of poitou when the rebels sought to take advantage of count richards absence in england i did not take the field against them so credit for the victory at barbezieux must go to richards secondincommand theobald chabot i know salisbury admitted with a grin i could not resist teasing you old friend how goes the rebellion id heard that the king sent richard and his brother hal back to poitou with enough gold to hire half the routiers in hell richard has been very successful since his return hes clearly inherited his fathers flair for command after winning a battle near bouteville he took the viscount of limogess castle at aixe then the city of limoges itself he is currently laying siege to angouleme where the counts of angouleme and the viscounts of ventador limoges and chabenais have taken shelter when the castle falls hell have captured all of the main rebels in one fell swoop not bad for a lad not yet nineteen salisbury was not acquainted with richard he did know hal though from his days in beckets household and asked now and hal surely he deserves some of the praise too bishop john smiled thinly id not suggest that in richards hearing hal went off to paris to visit his fatherinlaw did not even make an appearance in poitou until midsummer he finally joined richard in besieging the castle at chateauneufsurcharente but once the castle was taken he lost interest hes been holding court here in poitiers for the past fortnight salisbury knew his friend well enough to catch the unspoken echoes of disapprobation since the bishop would hardly fault hal for not displaying enough warlike fervor or bloodlust he assumed there was more involved than hals lack of enthusiasm for siege warfare ive not seen hal since last year when he and the king made a pilgrimage to canterbury thomas was always fond of the lad it hurt him when hal refused to see him in those last weeks of his life what has he been doing in poitiers to incur your disapproval what he does best bishop john said dryly which is charming every man woman and child who happen to cross his path the poitevin barons not in actual rebellion have been drawn to poitiers like dogs to vomit they have been fawning over hal as if he were the blessed archangel michael telling him how much they wish he were their liege lord rather than richard salisburys jaw dropped are you saying hal is seeking to subvert his brothers vassals hed insist he has no such intention but he does nothing to discourage such seditious talk i cannot tell if he truly wants to undermine richards authority in poitou or if he merely enjoys hearing his brother belittled either way it does not bode well for the future no it does not salisbury agreed and then sought to lighten the conversation by sharing the latest gossip from england the bishop of st davids had died that past may and there were rumors that the malcontent earl of norfolk had died in the holy land where hed gone to expiate his many sins the almighty truly worked in mysterious ways he observed for few men deserved such a sanctified death less than hugh bigod but then he made john laugh by saying cheerfully that at least the miscreant earls stay in purgatory would surely last an aeon or two my lord bishop one of johns servants was coming up the garden walkway the queen has just arrived your grace and asks to see you straightaway by all means have her join us here in the gardens milo and see that refreshments are brought out as the man retreated bishop john glanced toward salisbury with a smile i wonder if a time will ever come when we hear the words the queen and do not think of eleanor salisbury knew eleanor too although not as well as poitierss bishop not in our lifetimes he predicted watching with alert interest the young woman just entering the gardens noting that marguerites attendants had lagged behind the two men exchanged thoughtful looks for that indicated her visit was not a routine social call madame this is an unexpected pleasure bishop john said hastening to meet her may i introduce an old friend john the bishopelect of chartres marguerites eyes flicked uneasily to salisburys cherubic face then back to bishop john your grace i have an urgent matter to discuss may i rely upon your utter discretion and that of your friend of course whatever you tell us will be kept as secret as anything wed hear in the confessional marguerite let them seat her upon a wooden bench do you know adam de churchedune my husbands vicechancellor the bishop nodded i believe he was a clerk to the prior of beverley ere joining the young kings household what of him my lady it seems he has been serving two masters my husband and his father he was caught trying to send a confidential message to king henry in england marguerite dropped her eyes to the hands clenched in her lap adam was concerned that my husband had taken up with what he called highly suspect company he particularly objected to the presence of the de lusignans and several lords whod taken part in the last rebellion against king henry men whom he suspected of aiding and abetting what he called the current crop of rebels itit was not a letter that portrayed my husband in a favorable light ahi see and the young king is irate more than that your grace i have never seen him so angry he says that adam has betrayed him and he is set upon punishing him severely for his lack of loyalty he and his household knights are trying adam for treason even as we speak and i greatly fear that he may well do something hed regret for the rest of his life has he forgotten that adam de churchedune is a cleric and not subject to the kings courts bishop john spoke calmly although his composure was belied by the sudden taut line of his jaw surely there were men there who dared to remind your husband of that salient fact yes several spoke up including baldwin de bethune and will marshal but my husband is listening to others to men who are urging him to make an example of adam they have made it sound as if my husbands honor his very manhood is at stake marguerites voice faded away and when she looked up at the bishops tears were brimming in the corners of her eyes your grace you were the only one i could think of the only one who might stop this madness ere it goes too far when i left they were clamoring for the death penalty despite the summer sun she shivered i may not know much of political matters not like queen eleanor but even i know how outraged the holy father would be how angry king henry would be i entreat you my lord bishop do what you can for poor adams sake and for my husbands sake too as they were admitted to the royal palace john gave his companion a searching look are you sure you want to accompany me this could get very ugly salisbury nodded emphatically you know i was a witness to thomass slaying you may not know that i was amongst those who ran from his killers the monks and his clerks fled leaving him alone to face those brutes only one man a monk who did not even know him dared to come to his aid and he paid a grievous price for his courage had his arm all but severed thomas would not have wanted others to die with him did he not warn the killers that they were not to harm any of his people he may not have asked it of me but i asked it of myself and was found wanting i swore upon the rood that it would not happen again deus vult the other man said quietly and then turned to a hovering servant take us to the king he commanded in a tone that would brook no refusal they were led across the courtyard toward the great hall where a large crowd had gathered under the open windows jockeying for position putting the bishops in mind of those eager multitudes who would turn out for a public hanging their own attendants cleared a path aided by shouts of make way for the bishop inside they were hit by a blast of hot humid air so many men had squeezed into the hall that they were trampling on one anothers feet elbows jabbing into ribs necks craning toward the dais bishop john moved forward with a ruthless will that would not be denied the much smaller salisbury slid into the space he created and followed feeling with an incongruous flash of humor like a little skiff bobbing in the wake of a war galley hal was seated on the dais surrounded by knights and barons of poitou he looked very handsome and very regal his good looks enhanced by his anger giving him high color and a smoldering intensity that riveted all eyes upon him most of the men seemed to share his agitation they looked either indignant or excited or both the bishop did find a few somber faces but not many he wasted no time scanning the spectators his gaze searching out the man at the center of this storm the unfortunate adam de churchedune adam had the stunned expression of a man unable to understand what was happening to him the dazed disbelief of one realizing he was going to drown within reach of shore my lord he pleaded i am truly sorry if i have offended you for that was never my intent but you do not want to do this yes hal cut in i do your treachery deserves nothing less the sentence of death stands that is a grim jest the bishop of poitiers said loudly but i assume it is a jest nevertheless for you cannot pass a death sentence upon this man all heads swiveled in his direction adam spun around stretching out his arms toward the bishop like a man grabbing for a lifeline your grace i beg you to help me hals reaction was no less dramatic he jumped to his feet stood watching as the bishop moved toward the dais his head high his shoulders squared feet planted apart every line of his body communicating tension and defiance my lord bishop he said curtly what are you doing here apparently stopping you from making a grave mistake my lord king the bishop said with equal coldness and as hostile murmurings swept the hall salisbury felt a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach why had john taken such a harsh approach would they not have been better served by more conciliatory tactics with all due respect my lord bishop you do not know what is occurring here what this man has done he has betrayed me has been spying upon me and reporting back to my father what could be more despicable than treachery like that i am not here to defend what he has done my liege the bishop said and adam seemed to shrink before their eyes as the hope stirred by johns appearance was snatched away hal was momentarily thrown off balance well he said i am glad to hear that john had reached the dais by now whether he is guilty of a betrayal is not the issue it would seem to me that this is a matter best taken up with your lord father but again that is beyond my purview my only concern is with the punishment you are threatening to inflict upon him as i said that cannot be hal began to bluster again that is not for you to say yes it is adam de churchedune is not subject to the jurisdiction of your court he is in minor orders and can be judged only by holy church hal scowled he is not a priest has never taken holy vows that is irrelevant the churchs position has always been quite clear upon this subject it matters not if a man is in minor orders or if he be one of the popes own cardinals in either case he is to be judged by the church and only the church the mutterings were becoming louder now the antagonism needing only a spark to burst into flame salisbury moved over to stand beside his friend wondering if the church was to get two new martyrs hal knew the sentiment in the hall was with him and that realization was both encouraging and daunting i say he is to be judged here and now and by me the liege lord he wronged go home my lord bishop you are not needed here john looked around the hall his gaze so piercing that not all of the men could meet his eyes have you forgotten that bloodstained floor at canterbury cathedral he demanded st thomas died for the very principle that you would violate his quarrel with the king began because he would not agree to let clerics be judged in royal courts do you truly think that i could stand aside whilst you defy the church and defame the blessed martyrs holy memory i tell you that you shall not harm this man he said thrusting his arm toward adam in a gesture reminiscent of an old testament prophet if it is gods will that i die in his defense so be it the image hed called up of the archbishops mangled and bleeding body had a sobering effect upon the men even those most eager to see adam suffer for his sins were starting to have second thoughts salisbury took heart from the sudden silence and decided it was time for the voice of reason to balance his friends splendid defiance approaching the dais he addressed hal with all the polite persuasion at his command my liege i remember you well from your time in archbishop thomass household you are a good son of the church would not want to bring upon yourself the shame and infamy that engulfed your lord father after the archbishops murder one of the de lusignans saw that hals resolve was weakening and shoved his way toward the young king do not heed them sire your house has a proud tradition of holding your ground against the churchs encroachments remember what befell an arrogant bishop of seez who dared to defy your grandfather count geoffrey of blessed memory the counts men deprived him of what no priest needshis manhood but hed gone too far hal did not want to be associated with so brutal a deed my grandfather denied that they were acting upon his orders he said turning some of his frustration and thwarted fury upon the de lusignan agitator will marshal always warned me that you de lusignans were an untrustworthy lot i ought to have paid more heed to him the de lusignans were as known for their fiery tempers as for their sharp doubledealing and the man gave hal a look now that was murderous but marshal had shouldered his way over to hals side and he did not want to be challenged to a duel by combat for wills lethal skills and enduring grudge against the de lusignan clan would make him a very deadly foe indeed hal glanced at will appreciating his silent support and remembering that will had argued against this from the beginning wishing hed listened he came down the steps of the dais putting a swagger in his step as he halted before the bishop of poitiers i like it not he said coolly but i will spare that wretch out of the respect i have for you my lord bishop adams gasp was almost a sob he sank to his knees like a man whose body no longer had the strength to support him his breath wheezing like a broken bellows salisbury reached over and put a hand on that heaving shoulder giving it a reassuring squeeze but the bishop of poitiers had yet to take his eyes from hal do i have your word upon that my lord king there were more resentful mutterings at that hals brows drew together his mouth tightening but the bishop continued to look at him expectantly challengingly and at last he gave a grudging promise that he would not seek to execute adam for his treachery glaring at the quaking figure of his vicechancellor he warned i will not forget though nor will i forgive it was one of those rare perfect summer days splashed with golden sun cooled by errant breezes the sky the brilliant shade of blue more often seen in september than midaugust the gardens at winchester were in full bloom and eleanor and amaria were enjoying the fragrant scents the flight of gossamerwinged butterflies and the antics of the spaniel that was henrys recent gift to joanna melusine amaria called seeking to stop the puppy from digging in a raised flower bed of scarlet peonies when the little dog ignored her warning she bent down and scooped it up into her arms where it began to chew contentedly upon the lacings of her gown what an odd name for a dog what made your daughter choose it madame melusine was the name of the demon countess of anjou eleanor said smiling her husband was very happy with her but he became suspicious when she rarely attended mass and always left before the consecration of the host so one day he ordered four of his knights to step upon her mantle and hold her there whereupon she gave a fearful scream revealed herself to be the devils daughter and flew out a window never to be seen again harry has such interesting ancestors speaking of the devil amaria said with a grin is that not your lord husband amongst those riders whove just passed through the gatehouse eleanor was not surprised by henrys arrival for joanna had told her that hed arranged to hold a church council at winchester in order to spend time with her before she departed for sicily eleanor was surprised though by what henry did once hed dismounted after glancing across the bailey toward the gardens he handed his reins to a groom and walked in her direction as he entered the garden gate amaria took melusine and discreetly withdrew out of earshot eleanor seated herself on a turf bench and watched him approach coming to a halt a few feet away he gestured toward amaria and the puppy is that the dog i sent joanna eleanor nodded it was love at first sight guess what she named it melusine henrys mouth curved at the corners i knew it was a mistake to tell her that story where is she inside at her lessons no she went into the city it seems that one of the nuns of st marys speaks tuscan and has agreed to teach her a few phrases i explained that each region of italy has its own dialect and what they speak in tuscany might not be understood in sicily but you know joanna once she gets an idea into her head you did remind her that william is of norman descent and his first language is french i did but she has her mind set upon being able to speak to my people as she puts it henrys smile was touched with sadness i hope the sicilians appreciate how lucky they are he hesitated and then sat beside her on the bench is she nervous about the marriage of course she is even though shed never admit it she did confess to some unease though when the bishops of troye and capua arrived at winchester to make sure she was pretty enough to satisfy their king henry felt a flicker of resentment even now i never heard of such a thing he said indignantly royal marriages are matters of statecraft a means of forging alliances yet william would have his men inspect joanna as if she were a prize filly he is fortunate i did not end the negotiations then and there i assured joanna she had no cause for concern and indeed they were bedazzled by her in truth though i can understand williams concern he may be allying with england but hell be living with a fleshandblood woman is it so surprising that hed prefer a pleasing bedmate he is said to be quite handsome himself so he and joanna ought to have beautiful children henry could think of few subjects less appealing than envisioning his tenyearold daughter as a mans bedmate and he was irked with eleanor for discussing it so nonchalantly joanna is a child herself he said sharply i just pray to god that her husband remembers that eleanor understood then this was the father here in the garden with her not the king harryjoanna will become his wife but not his bedmate not yet you know that the church frowns upon consummation of the marriage until the girl reaches a more suitable age at the very least until she has her flux that sounds well and goodin theory but how can we be sure that it prevails in practice we cannot she said with unsettling candor but from what we know of william he does not sound like a man whod enjoy deflowering a little girl we have to remember that we judged him to be a worthy husband for joanna we should remember too that selfinterest encourages men to follow the churchs teachings in this matter a very young wife is more likely to die in childbirth and the babe too princes and kings know that and do not want to put their heirs or their alliances at needless risk i know i know he said impatiently before admitting the husbands of our older girls seem to have taken their ages into account for a moment they thought of their absent daughters tilda had been wed at age eleven to the duke of saxony and bavaria a man more than twentyseven years her senior a man older than her own father shed become a mother three times already but shed not had her first child until she was sixteen her sister named after eleanor but known now by the spanish leonora had wed the king of castile at an even younger age than tilda or joanna shed been just nine she was only in her fifteenth year now and so far theyd heard nothing of any pregnancies eleanor was astonished that they were actually having a conversation that was not only civil but easy and unforced even intimate we have to trust him harry to do right by joanna unable to resist adding playfully after all he is called william the good surely that is a cause for reassurance hes called that because his father was known as william the bad henry said with a faint glimmer of sardonic humor it is just thatthat joanna is so fair ah i see you fear that he might be tempted by her beauty tempted enough to ignore the realitythat she is still a child are you saying it never happens he challenged id wager that louis consummated the marriage on your wedding night and you were all ofwhat thirteen eleanor blinked in surprise well yes she conceded how did you know for gods sake woman no man would sleep chastely in your bed not even a born monk like louis he was on his feet now beginning to pace as she watched him in amused amazement careful harry that sounds suspiciously like a compliment she was at once sorry for the gibe not wanting to spoil this unlikely rapport he shot her a sharp look but surprised her again by not stalking off was he that troubled by joannas marriage or had he something else on his mind she decided to take advantage of the fact that they were still talking see if she could extract some information from him about their sons i hear that richard has been very successful since he returned to poitou she said waiting to see if hed respond yes he has done well i had a message from him just four days ago telling me that hed taken angouleme and was sending the captive counts to me for judgment eleanor was delighted she hadnt known that richards triumph had been so sweeping we have a son to be proud of she said and their eyes met and held for a heartbeat or two before he glanced away you have not heard though about hals latest lunacy no she said cautiously what has he done he caught his vicechancellor adam de churchedune sending me a warning that he was consorting with rebels and riffraff and he flew into a wild rage lost all reason ah harry what did you expect but the words never left her lips for she very much wanted to hear what had happened if he felt the need to discuss it with her it must truly be dreadful what did he do he charged adam with treason and sentenced him to death eleanors eyes widened shed not been braced for a blow like this holy mother mary she whispered are you telling me he executed a man of god no but that was due only to the fortuitous arrival of the bishop of poitiers he faced hal and his lackeys down and god bless him for it hal reluctantly agreed not to proceed with the death sentence henry paused gazing up at the sky as if searching for answers slowly shaking his head but once the bishop had gone he took a harsh vengeance upon adam he had the poor man whipped naked through the streets of poitiers preceded by a herald who proclaimed that this would be the fate of all who betrayed the trust of their lord he then had adam cast into prison christ jesus is he still confined can you not intervene on his behalf i did as soon as i learned what happened i arranged to have him released and taken to a monastery in england henry stopped pacing running a hand absently through his unruly hair as shed seen him do so many times over the years but then he turned back toward her with narrowed eyes and set mouth well is this not when you charge to hals defense make excuses for what hes done and place all the blame squarely at my feet nohis actions cannot be excused or justified mayhap only understood he gave a bleak laugh i would to god i did understand i tell you eleanor i am at my wits end with the lad i could almost believe him possessed at least that would explain his folly i am at a loss what to do next i tried keeping him with me last year tried to get him interested in governing to no avail so then i gave him the freedom he demanded sent him into poitou to aid richard and this is how he repays me ah harryi do not know what to tell you hal has gone so far astray that i am not sure we can get him back onto the right road would you even bother to try why not just sit back and enjoy the bloodletting this is what you were aiming for when you urged our sons to rebel was it not she was taken aback by his sudden flare of hostility shed been lulled into unwariness by the genuine giveandtake of their conversation god no she said softly i never wanted that you say that with such sincerity almost enough to make me believe youalmost he reached out grasped her arm and pulled her to her feet you do not get to shrug your shoulders and wish me well this is as much your doing as mine at the least you can try to repair the damage youve done you owe me that much and you owe it to hal his fingers were digging into her arm but she did not protest for she did not think he was aware of it i would if i could and that is gods truth harry but i do not know how to heal hals wounds to heal any of our wounds he looked down into her face and then abruptly released her and stepped back so what then we just watch as hal gallops headlong for the cliffs edge what am i supposed to do eleanor how do i reach him she found herself blinking back tears you must let him go harry even if he goes over that cliff you have to set him free what does that mean set him free to do what to make his own mistakes no matter how costly i know that would not be easy for you but you have no choice not any longer you made hal a king and now we must live with it live with it he echoed incredulously is that what youd have told adam de churchedune i regret what happened to adam de churchedune as much as you do but if youd not set him to spy upon hal here it comes i am only surprised it took you so long hal nearly executes a man nearly causes a dangerous rupture with the church and of course it is somehow all my fault i did not say that but surely you must see now that you made a mistake that putting a spy in hals household was not the approach to take what i see is that i was right to worry about him that i was right to think he needs supervision that he is not to be trusted with a kings authority or with mens lives henry was flushed bitterly disappointed that this was her response that hed turned to her in his despair and shed used it as a weapon against him i should have known better he said and swinging about on his heel he strode from the garden not looking back on september joanna sailed from southampton for barfleur accompanied by her uncle hamelin the archbishops of rouen and canterbury and the bishops of ely evreux and bayeux henry had provided for her so extravagantly that it took seven ships to transport her and her party upon her arrival in normandy she was met by her brother hal who escorted her into poitou where richard was waiting he accompanied her through aquitaine to the port of st gilles where she was formally turned over to the bishop of siracusa and bade farewell to her brother uncle and most of the english prelates on november she sailed for sicily c hapter t wentyfive december nottingham england a storm was threatening and the bishop of worcester and his companions were relieved to reach nottinghams great castle before it broke they hastened to dismount in the middle bailey glad to turn their mounts over to waiting servants upon being told that the king was in the great hall they headed in that direction roger noticed though that his sisters steps were lagging and gave her a curious glance you are not nervous maud now why ever would i be nervous she said tartly well i can understand your unease he commiserated especially after the dire fate of the poitevin rebels maud came to an abrupt halt dire fate i thought harry pardoned them realizing then that she was the victim of brotherly humor she jabbed roger in the ribs with her elbow very amusing i thought so he said cheerfully you are being foolish to worry sister harry has been remarkably merciful to rebels forbearing to charge them with treason as he well could have done instead he chose to follow the teachings of our saviour and offer forgiveness not to eleanor maud thought knowing that the queen was celebrating christmas alone at winchester her anger toward her former friend had cooled mitigated by her sons reprieve and her sense of fair play she did not think it right that eleanor alone should be the one to suffer for that illadvised rebellion she said nothing though knowing that roger did not share her sympathies and followed him into the hall it was overflowing with highborn guests and princes of the church all eager to display their loyalty and enjoy the splendors of the kings christmas court henry was upon the dais but not seated a hardship on his less energetic subjects since they could not sit unless he did he turned as roger ushered maud toward him and for an uneasy moment she could not tell what her reception would be but then he said welcome cousin maud and gathered her into a quick embrace maud had not feared being penalized for her sons treason for roger had been able to convince henry that shed played no part in it she had feared though that their friendship might have been irretrievably damaged and she was greatly relieved to find it was not so i wanted to thank you again she said warmly for the kindness youve shown hugh he told me that he has been fully restored to favor and you even plan to entrust him with a mission to ireland in the spring some people might argue that sending a man to ireland is hardly a mark of royal favor henry said dryly you owe me no thanks cousin whats past is past maud didnt agree but she knew he did not like profuse expressions of gratitude and after a few moments of idle talk she graciously excused herself so that she could discover where she and her ladies were being lodged roger stayed on the dais with henry asking who else was expected at nottingham the bishop of norwich is due any day now from sicily id sent him ahead of joanna to convey gifts and good will to william i got word this week that she will be celebrating christmas in naples for the poor lass was so seasick during the voyage that it was decided she needed time ashore to regain her strength henry who was never seasick sounded both sympathetic and bemused once she feels up to it they will resume the journey to sicily but theyll be traveling by land to make it easier for her henry waved away a servant who was offering wine but roger snared a cup willem is here though not for long he has taken the cross and plans to accompany the count of flanders to the holy land come the spring hamelin is here and johnny of course and geoffrey too but richard is in bordeaux and hal and marguerite are holding their christmas court in normandy at argentan oh and geoff just arrived yesterday henry said and when roger asked how geoffs studies were progressing in tours he grinned well enough he says i can only hope he is spending more time in the university library than in the town taverns roger grinned too hed done his own studies at tours and he remembered the secular attractions quite vividly seeing that they were relatively alone none within immediate earshot he said quietly how is the lady rosamund faring i have not seen her since october when i stopped at godstow on my way from windsor to meet the scots king at feckenham she looked very frail to me roger although she insists she is well and in good spirits henry paused it is not easy to admit but she seems content there at peace i am glad to hear that roger said hed spared more than a few prayers in the past nine months for the soul of rosamund clifford a sinner whod repented before it was too late i hear you are holding a council at northampton next month shall i attend i think youll want to cousin amongst other matters i plan to restore their lands to your nephew hugh and his irksome ally the earl of leicester saving a few strategic castles of course that is good news indeed maud will be delighted why did you not tell her that earlier henry shrugged you know how women are shed have squealed and kissed me you are not going to do that are you no although of course id want to roger said gravely paying henry back in his own coin which he acknowledged with another grin roger was debating whether he ought to make any mention of hal and his outrageous treatment of a man of god when henry was informed that a messenger had just ridden in from the nunnery at godstow send him in henry ordered before saying to roger how is that for timing cousin he recognized the man being escorted toward the dais one of prioress ediths servants whod delivered letters from rosamund in the past hed always had an excellent memory for names and faces and it stood him in good stead now recalling that the courier was called edwin you need not hurry back to godstow edwin he said expansively you might as well linger for a few days and enjoy the festivities i expect that he cut himself off so abruptly that roger turned in his direction henry read faces well and the man approaching was a study in utter misery kneeling before henry he mutely held out his letter never meeting the kings eyes henry glanced down at the seal it was not rosamunds belonged to the prioress he froze making no attempt to take the letter roger glanced from one to the other and then reached for it himself surprised by the depth of sadness he felt he looked at his cousin in silent sympathy waiting until henry could bring himself to take that letter and get confirmation of what he already knew so far his stay at nottingham had been a great disappointment to john hed been looking forward to it eagerly for his tenth birthday would occur two days after christmas best of all his father had told him that nottingham castle was his he hadnt been sure what to expect but it seemed to him that the lord of nottingham would be the center of attention or at least the object of more deference than he usually received that did not happen his father remained the focal point of all eyes and any leftover honors were claimed by his brother geoffrey newly returned from a successful campaign in brittany once more john was overlooked forgotten worse was to come yesterday his father had gotten bad news john did not know what it was for hed not dared to ask hed tried to eavesdrop on other peoples conversations thinking they might know but they would fall silent as soon as they caught sight of him he feared that his father would not be in the mood for celebrating the christmas revelries much less his birthday hed been promised a surprise but now he wondered if his father would even remember nottingham had been a huge letdown what he found most disquieting though was his fathers withdrawal hed made few public appearances and when he did he was remote and aloof johns world had suffered such dramatic upheavals in the past three years that he often felt as if he were a leaf borne on the wind hed not liked the abbey of fontevrault very much but at least it was familiar and there he felt safe john never felt safe anymore too much had changed too fast his mother and father had gone to war his brothers all siding with her after that she was in disgrace a prisoner whom hed not seen in more than three years if a queen could fall so far anyone could shed been a glamorous stranger to him but hed been proud that she was his mother and he missed her even though he did not understand how he could miss someone hed seen so infrequently he did not miss richard and geoffrey hed not spent much time with them and when he did theyd teased him mercilessly hal had been kind to him once on those rare occasions when they met tousling his hair and calling him sprout but not in a mean way a few times hed even played with john that had all changed since his fight with their father now when he saw hal his brother was brusque dismissive like geoffrey and richard hal seemed angry with him but he did not know what hed done joanna had been more than his companion at fontevrault shed been his rock but now shed gone away and he might never see her again without joanna he had only his father and ever since his father had gotten his bad news hed been there and yet he was not there john could not explain it could only sense it and it frightened him his feelings for his father were complicated he was very proud to be the son of henry fitz empress but he never felt that comfortable with henry hed watched his fathers fits of rage watched other men cower before him hed never yelled at john but john was always afraid that he would joanna was the only member of his family with whom he felt completely at ease and he missed her very much hed been wandering about all morning like a lost soul trying to find some way to entertain himself in late morning hed ventured up to his fathers chamber in a tower of the inner bailey but hed lost his nerve at the last moment and started back down the stairs it was dark and the stone steps were slick well worn by countless feet for this part of the castle was over a hundred years old john was carefully making his way down when he heard the voices below him it was a man and a woman and he caught his breath when he recognized the male voice it was his brother geoffrey he could guess what they were doing by the way they were laughing but he had no idea who the woman was she could be a serving maid of the castle or a maid servant of one of the guests or a ladys handmaiden or even a lady he supposed most of the barons had brought their wives and theyd all brought large entourages he hesitated not sure what to do next if geoffrey caught him hed get his ears boxed for certes but the temptation to eavesdrop was irresistible a chance to learn more about the things men did with women and mayhap even their fathers bad news for geoffrey must surely know the girl giggled saying breathlessly that they must stop for someone could come along at any moment geoffrey murmured something too softly for john to hear then suggested they go to his chamber where they could be assured of privacy she protested that she could not risk it startling john when she mentioned her husband it had to be someplace safe she insisted and after mentioning several places and then rejecting them as too dangerous she announced in triumphant tones that she knew where they could meetin the stables when the grooms went to their midday meal in the hall geoffrey seemed less than enthusiastic pointing out that it would be colder than a witchs teat and hed likely freeze the body part she was most interested in but she laughed huskily and murmured shed warm him up soon enough there was more laughing low and intimate and then john heard their footsteps descending fading away hed sank down upon the steps but now he came quietly to his feet his eyes shining for an idea had come to him a daring idea that was as appealing as it was scary before he could think better of it john trudged through the snow of the outer bailey to the stables and waited until no grooms were about to clamber up the ladder into the loft there he burrowed deep into the hay making himself a secure hidden nest he thought it most likely that geoffrey and the girl would choose to come up into the loft too but even if they stayed below in one of the empty stalls hed still be able to watch he knew what a risk he was taking shivered to think of his brothers anger if he were found spying on them but he could not resist this chance to watch while they did it whatever it was that men and women did he had a fairly good idea having watched dogs humping but imagining was not the same as actually seeing for himself the thought even crossed his mind that this might be something to hold over his brothers head that if ever geoffrey threatened to give him a thrashing he could make a threat of his own mentioning the girl geoffrey had been groping in the stairwell the one with a husband it was warmer beneath the hay than hed expected and he began to feel so comfortable that he was soon yawning the nights storm had awakened him well before daybreak and hed been unable to go back to sleep listening to the eerie wailing of the wind and thinking it sounded like a pack of hungry wolves curling up like a cat he yawned again feeling drowsy he hoped theyd come soon he must have fallen asleep after that for he awoke with a start not remembering for a moment where he was it all came back to him though when he heard their voices peering from his hideaway he could barely make out their figures for the loft was filled with shadows as dark as night in the far corners as he listened he realized that theyd already done it and he felt a sharp pang of disappointment angry with himself for sleeping through it he could not go anywhere though until they did so he settled down to wait consoling himself with the thought that they might do it again seethis was not such a bad idea the girl murmured and geoffrey agreed that shed more than kept her word had kindled enough heat to burn the barn down she giggled and they talked for a while of matters that john found very boring mainly of people he did not know he was dozing again when he heard the girl mention the queen and his eyes snapped open is she as beautiful as men say well geoffrey said sounding as if he were yawning now she is old of course but yes when she was young she was very beautiful i remember her coming into the nursery to bid us good night her skirts would rustle and she always smelled so good even better than freshbaked bread were you often with her when you were young a fair amount of the time boys stay in their mothers care only till they are seven or so and after that we did not see her as much of course obviously she could not travel with all of us but she usually had a couple of us wherever she went god knows we saw more of her than our father fathers are never underfoot are they mine only noticed his children when one of us got into trouble and then he would roar and rant but he never hit me or my sisters my brothers nowthat was another story he would thrash them till they were as raw as uncooked beef and my mother was just as strict she had the makings of a fine lady abbess gods truth were your parents strict with you and your brothers geoffrey he laughed softly lord no we got away with holy hell our father was rarely around and when he was he could always be coaxed into giving us whatever we wanted i suppose he was loath to discipline us when he saw us so seldom our mother was not as easy to fool but she did not care much if we got up to mischief oh shed scold us if we were caught in the act but her heart was not in it we could tell what i most remember is that she was fun shed chase fireflies in the garden with us or let us bring our dogs into bed at night and when we fell out of trees she would shrug and say it was lucky she had sons to spare could afford to lose one or two no she was not like other mothers he laughed again i remember one time when richard and i found a snake we were trying to decide what to do with it and i do not recall which one of us had the idea but we ended up smuggling it into our mothers bed then we hid outside her chamber that night waiting to hear all the shrieking and carrying on we were not sure shed scream but we figured her ladies would we heard nothing at all though and crept back to our bed very disappointed not a word was said about it the next day either so we decided the snake must have escaped wed forgotten all about it by that nightuntil we climbed into bed and found something warm and slick and slithery under the covers with us the girl joined in his laughter john stifled a laugh himself thinking of his brothers yelling and bolting from the bed in panic geoffrey was telling her that they decided to play her game and say nothing about it the next day but as soon as theyd met her eyes all three of them had begun to laugh helplessly while everyone else watched in bafflement not knowing what the joke was but after a while it no longer seemed as funny to john it occurred to him that he did not have any memories to match richards and geoffreys no recollections of playing games with their mother or sharing jests or having her sit up with him at night after hed caught poison oak as geoffrey was relating now why not why was it different for him when geoffrey and the girl finally departed john waited till it was safe to venture out and scrambled down the ladder just as two of the grooms sauntered into the stables they looked surprised and he knew they wanted to ask what he was doing up there but he raised his chin and reminding himself that this was his loft he walked past them as if hed not seen them he was at a loss what to do next hed missed dinner and he wondered if anyone had noticed his absence once he was back in the middle bailey he decided to go to the kitchen and get something to tide him over till supper that evening but then he happened to glance across the bailey toward the chapel and he had another idea even better than his notion to spy on geoffrey last night hed heard his cousin morgan and two other boys in the royal household discussing the magical properties of holy water according to them it was supposed to burn sinners if it was splashed upon them and they were eager to make the test theyd decided to try it out upon a culprit in the towns pillory but their scheme had been thwarted when a priest caught them trying to dip water out of the chapel font if he could obtain a vial of holy water theyd be sure to be impressed they were all several years older than he was so that would be quite a coup darting into the kitchen he snatched a clay cup when no one was watching then hurried toward the chapel at least it was not as dark here as up in the loft for candles burned in wall sconces and on the high altar best of all there was no sign of the chaplain hoping that his luck had changed for the better john approached the stone font and filled the cup to the brim but then he paused what if they did not believe this was holy water it was johns experience that the world was not a trusting place and they were likely to be skeptical of his claim especially since hed succeeded where theyd failed after pondering the problem he moved quietly up the aisle toward the high altar there were two silver chalices upon it if he put the holy water in one of them they could not doubt him but taking a church chalice was not the same as filching a kitchen cup what if there was a hue and cry over its disappearance well he could return it afterward anyway how could it be stealing if it was his to begin with he poured the water from the cup into one of the chalices and smiled pleased with his handiwork it was then that the door to the chapel swung open he ducked down behind the high altar holding his breath footsteps were echoing up the aisle of the nave risking a glance he caught a glimpse of a priests cassock to his relief the footsteps soon receded but he decided to stay where he was until he was sure the priest was not loitering outside sitting crosslegged on the floor he stuck his finger in the chalice relieved when the water did not burn a pity he could not figure out a way to spill it on geoffrey he was surely a sinner guilty of adultery and fornication this very day to john those were the least of his sins having brothers so much older than he had been a trial for when they were not ignoring him they were amusing themselves by playing pranks on him and making him feel foolish his most vivid christmas memory was of such an episode hed been very young four he thought it was one of those rare times when hed been summoned from fontevrault with joanna to his fathers christmas court at bures it was only a hunting lodge and there was not enough room to accommodate so many people both of his parents were shorttempered and edgy not showing any taste for the revelries years later he would realize that this was the infamous christmas court when his father flew into such a rage and doomed thomas becket with a few illchosen words at the time though hed known only that no one seemed to be paying him much mind he had dim memories of playing with joanna in the great hall chasing each other around and being scolded by their mother but the memory hed have liked to forget continued to burn brightly in the back of his brain hed been disappointed to find that hal was in england he was still drawn to richard and geoffrey though for at thirteen and twelve they seemed very grownup to him and so hed trailed after them much to their annoyance one day hed followed them into the village cemetery where hed fallen into an open grave and was trapped there for what had seemed like hours theyd later sworn that theyd not heard him crying for help but he had never believed them after that he no longer tried to be included avoided them whenever he could hed just risen intent upon sneaking out when the door opened again he dropped down again so hastily that he spilled some of the holy water upon his mantle the priest was back he did not enter though saying i will remain outside my lord make sure that you are not disturbed footsteps now sounded a heavier tread than the priests and john peeked from behind the altar cloth saw to his horror that it was his father henry moved toward the high altar and john shivered for they were now separated only by a length of embroidered cloth his father had knelt began to pray john caught random words but not enough to make sense for his latin studies were not that advanced he stayed very still hoping henry would soon go away he made no move to leave though murmured a name rosamund and john stiffened for he knew that was his fathers leman he risked another look saw that henry had buried his head in his hands and was stunned to realize that his father was weeping the sight frightened him hed never imagined grown men cried and for certes not his father not the king knowing that this was a scene no one was supposed to see he panicked and decided to creep toward the sacristy where there were more places to hide if he were very quiet his father ought not to hear him but his fear made him clumsy and as he rose to a halfcrouch the chalice slipped from his grasp tumbled onto the tiles with a sound loud enough to be heard in heaven henrys head came up sharply outraged that even here in gods house he could not have privacy to grieve for rosamund he got swiftly to his feet and strode toward the high altar who is there how dare you spy upon me he was shocked to find his youngest son huddled behind the altar his eyes enormous in the white blur of his face eleanors eyes although hed never seen in them what he now saw in johnssheer terror johnny i am sorry the boy mumbled so sorryi was not spying i was not i know johnny i know it is all right lad i am not angry not with you you just took me by surprise henry was appalled to see how the boy was trembling christ jesus was he afraid of his own father kneeling so that he could look into johns eyes he said i am sorry i yelled at you lad john did not know what to say so he kept silent for hed learned silence was usually the safest way i had grievous news yesterday henry said softly one very dear to me has died id been deluding myself refusing to admit how ill she really was grown men ought to know better but we can be as foolish as children that way as if denying what we fear will somehow make it any less true john had not thought his father feared anything on gods earth i am sorry he said again feeling as if the very ground were shifting under his feet there is nothing to be sorry for johnny i am glad that you are here john blinked you are yes henry said and gathered the boy into his arms i was feeling very alone today i needed to be reminded that it is not so that i have you i still have a son john did not move even though his father was holding him so tightly that it hurt his cheek was scratched by henrys beard and he inhaled the scent of wine and sweat and horses he still did not know what to say but his father did not seem to require any words getting to his feet he held out his hand john took it and followed him from the chapel chapter twentysix june paris france marguerites bedchamber was shadowed and still although outside the morning sun was bathing paris in blinding white light as hal entered one of his wifes attendants rose from her seat by the bed and came to meet him most of her ladies were highspirited pretty girls but agace was well into her forties for shed been with the young queen since the latters childhood and they often seemed like mother and daughter to hal he was thankful that shed been with marguerite during her delivery and he was heartened now by her vigil sure that no evil would befall marguerite as long as the formidable agace was on guard how is she this morn he asked softly and smiled when she assured him that marguerite had passed a peaceful night our lad he said is doing well too his wetnurse said she got him to take a little more milk and that is surely a good sign no agace regarded him somberly wondering if he was truly so oblivious of his sons danger marguerites labor had been long and difficult and at one point theyd been terrified that her life was bleeding away shed finally given birth to one of the smallest babies agace had ever seen his skin so red he seemed badly sunburned shed been so sure he was stillborn that she burst into tears the midwife had breathed life into his little lungs but she was not sanguine about his chances of survival telling agace privately that the baby had many battles ahead of him three days had passed since his birth and agace saw no great improvement in his condition no one had told marguerite of their fears but agace knew she shared them each time she cradled her son she seemed spellbound by his every breath mesmerized by the feeble sound of his heartbeat the midwife had been far more candid with hal than marguerite to no avail agace now realized he could not face the fact that his son might die and so it was not going to happen hals reality was whatever he wanted it to be she felt honorbound to warn him nonetheless that he ought to be braced for the worst as it was not for mortal men to understand the mysterious workings of the almighty my lord the midwife said that babies born early are hal marguerites voice came sleepily from the bed and he hastened to her side agace and her forebodings forgotten i am right here my heart leaning over he kissed her gently i have something for the new mother he said producing an object swathed in silk marguerite unwrapped it to reveal an ivory box and inside a delicate opal ring set in gold filigree sliding it onto her finger hal kissed her again opals are said to be lucky she smiled praying that he was right for their son needed all the luck he could get how is he this morn fine all agree he is a handsome little lad bearing a strong resemblance to his father except that he is as bald as an egg of course go and fetch him for me agace marguerite said and the older woman was happy to obey she did not have far to go for marguerite had insisted that the babys cradle be placed in the antechamber she would have had it beside her bed if hal and agace had not objected fearing that a newborns wailing would rob her of the sleep she so desperately needed she had reluctantly acquiesced but now she said resolutely i am going to keep him with me tonight i feel much stronger hal and it will ease my mind to have him close at hand through the open doorway they heard agaces voice and the answering murmur of the wetnurse if you insist hal agreed pretending to admire her new ring so he could press a kiss into the palm of her hand he does not cry much is a very good baby so far no trouble at allonce again taking after his sire the scream was like the slash of a sword splintering their last moment of peace into an infinity of pain it was followed at once by another choked cry and then weeping hal swung toward the sound his expression one of denial and disbelief but marguerite knew better and she began to sob eleanor and amaria were playing a desultory game of chess for it was too hot to concentrate theyd opened the windows of their bedchamber in hopes of attracting an evening breeze but the air still simmered with the days heat offering no relief muted sounds came drifting in the arrival of late riders a barking dog the tolling of distant church bells eleanor glanced again at the chessboard and then sat back with a sigh lets keep this till the morrow amaria smothering a yawn amaria rose and stretched shall i pour you some wine madame eleanor nodded and then they both turned hearing the sounds of footsteps in the stairwell there was a soft knock and the door swung open almost simultaneously harry eleanor stared at her husband in surprise what are you doing back in winchester as henry stepped forward into the circle of light cast by the candles eleanor frowned thinking he looked exhausted shadows lurking like bruises under his eyes his mouth so tautly drawn that she could not imagine those lips ever curving in a smile dame amaria he said politely i need to speak with my wife in private and eleanor was suddenly frightened once amaria had departed henry moved toward eleanor and seated himself across the table from her he seemed to be favoring his left leg and she said youve hurt yourself its nothing an old injury that has flared up again he did not speak for several moments but she did not urge him sure that she did not want to hear whatever hed come to tell her there is no easy way to say this he said at last on june in paris marguerite gave birth to a son the baby came before his time was too frail he only lived for three days eleanors eyes filled with tears oh harrythose poor children a wound like that will never heal i know she dried her cheeks with the back of her hand i will want to write to them he nodded and for a time there was only silence when he got to his feet he moved as slowly as an old man and she realized that his pain was physical too his limp was much more pronounced now thank you for telling me she said and he nodded again he hobbled to the door and then paused searching for words of comfort even though he knew there were none he was baptized ere he died at least there is that theyll know his innocent soul has gone straight to gods embrace what was he named he seemed reluctant to answer and when he finally murmured william she understood why that had been the name of their firstborn the son whod died two months before his third birthday their eyes met and held and for an anguished moment they were grievingnot for the grandson theyd never seenbut for the son whose death had left such a ragged gaping hole in their lives the son whose death seemed even more tragic as the years went by and hals follies mounted what if their will had lived if he and not hal had been the heir that was not a question either of them had ever asked aloud but it was one that occurred to them both on those nights when sleep wouldnt come and they lay awake in the dark trying to understand how things had gone so terribly wrong for their family after leaving winchester henry passed a week at stanstede in sussex waiting for a favorable wind to cross to normandy during this time he gave the church at wicumbe to the godstow nunnery in rosamunds memory and he learned that the french king had gotten a papal legate to threaten an interdict against his domains unless he stopped delaying the marriage of his son richard to louiss daughter alys but his leg injury was not healing as hed hoped and he returned to winchester until his health improved the summer heat wave continued august was even hotter than july eleanor and amaria had taken a wooden embroidery frame out into a secluded corner of the gardens and they were frowning over their handiwork let me show you again how to make a couched stitch madame amaria said hiding her surprise that the queen handled a needle so clumsily she had assumed that everything came easily to eleanor let me try eleanor knotted a length of silk thread did her best to imitate amaria and stabbed her thumb with the needle damnation neither one had heard the soft footsteps and they were startled now by laughter amaria turned to find they were being watched by a slender woman about eleanors age fashionably dressed in a sapphirecolored bliaut girdled at the hip with a jeweled belt her dark eyes agleam with amusement she sauntered forward saying i never thought id see eleanor of aquitaine with a needle in her hand amaria was startled by the familiarity but when she glanced at eleanor she saw that while the queen was surprised by this strangers appearance she was also pleased shall i fetch a thimble my lady she said assuming that if eleanor did not want time alone with the other woman shed say so when she didnt amaria made a tactful withdrawal do sit down eleanor said gesturing toward the other end of the bench what are you doing here maud maud sat i was disquieted to hear that harry had delayed his return to normandy id never known him even to acknowledge a physical infirmity much less change his plans because of one and i feared that he must be at deaths door no but he has been in enough pain to make him loath to ride a horse much less make a channel crossing what ails him he did not tell you you know how difficult it is to pry an answer out of harry he muttered some foolishness about taking one misstep too many did he have an accident and if so why did i not hear about it because eleanor said it happened three years ago when he was kicked in the thigh by an unruly horse ah yes i remember that maud was not surprised that henry should be troubled by an old wound for that often happened in their world poor harry she thought it must be an infection of the bone i am so sorry about hals baby eleanor thank you eleanor said simply acknowledging mauds sympathy at the same time that she indicated the hurt was still too fresh to probe does harry know you are here with me she asked with just the hint of a challenge maud took it up without hesitation yes he does i got his permission ere i sought you out answering the question that eleanor had not asked she said had he refused i would have respected his wishes that was a diplomatic declaration of loyalty a discreet warning that she would not be putting herself or her family at risk for eleanors sake eleanor did not blame her though i am gladdened to see you maud she said and smiled youve always had an ear for choice gossip and i hope youve a scandal or two to share a few but you must be hungry for word of your children shall i begin with them actually harry has been good this past year about keeping me informed of family matters he notified me when joanna came ashore at naples and when she reached palermo at candlemas he sent me an account of her spectacular entry into the city it was night and there were so many torches flaring that the city seemed on fire joanna was mounted on a white palfrey clad in her best robes with her hair loose about her shoulders a magnet for every eye she and william were wed less than a fortnight after her arrival and that same day she was crowned by the archbishop of palermo maud knew her own daughter would have been overwhelmed by such splendor and ceremony but joanna was made of stronger stuff and she suspected that eleanors daughter would have enjoyed being the center of attention the brightest star in the firmament she hoped that the fates would be kind to joanna that she would find contentment in her new life and her new island home harry has also informed me whenever richard or geoffrey have won a victory over poitevin or breton rebels eleanor continued and he even kept me apprised of johns prospects telling me that he plans to make john lord of ireland and letting me know last summer when he plighttrothed john to your brother williams daughter avisa so you know of that too harry is certainly determined to make sure that none ever call john lackland again the proposed marriage could make john earl of gloucester one day since william did not have any male heirs but the earl did have two other daughters and maud knew their husbands were very disgruntled by the marriage settlement for under normal circumstances the earldom would have been divided between all three daughters the viscount of limoges had been so outraged when henry refused to allow rainalds earldom of cornwall to pass to his wife and her sisters that hed been in rebellion ever since maud hoped that the earldom of gloucester would not prove to be as disruptive she hoped too that john appreciated how lucky he was few youngest sons were so lavishly provided for well she said lightly i did promise you some good gossip im sure youve heard that hugh bigod died on pilgrimageproof that the almighty has a sense of humorand his son roger is feuding fiercely with his stepmother hughs widow there are rumors that louis is considering wedding his youngest daughter agnes to the emperor of byzantiums son the earl of essex is in the holy land with the count of flanders and harrys sister emma is in wales with child eleanor wondered if emma had welcomed the news of her pregnancy the pressure to produce a male heir could be intense as she well remembered from her years with louis but a child also sealed her fate a barren wife could hope for the dissolution of her marriage all that is interesting maud but hardly scandalous or shocking this next story is both one of your vassals the count of la marche suspected his wife of infidelity he repudiated her and had her supposed lover put to death on easter of all holy days but his only son died suddenly soon thereafter and he is said to be in despair stricken as much by guilt as by grief it seems his proof of adultery was not as conclusive as he first thought and now he fears that god took his son as punishment for executing an innocent man she paused then almost imperceptibly and rosamund clifford died last december at godstow nunnery ah eleanor said i see that explained the mystery then why shed withdrawn from the court harry has not been very lucky of late has he id say not maud agreed noting eleanors apparent indifference to rosamund she wondered if she should make any mention of harrys latest leman and decided to be circumspect for once eleanor seemed to have read her mind though so tell me maudwho is harry swiving these days somehow i doubt that hes been living like a monk just because rosamund wanted to live her last days as a nun maud grinned no not harry hes had bedmates of course this past year and ive heard talk that hes taken up with the daughter of the lord of conches but her name escapes me at the moment most likely it escapes harry too eleanor said but she sounded cynically amused not bitter maud studied the other woman thoughtfully i must say that you seem to be faring much better than id have expected better than id have expected too eleanor admitted the first two years were the hardest and not just because i was so cut off from the rest of the world i still had hope then you see and hope can be both a blessing and a curse but it has been much easier for me at winchester it helped greatly to be able to spend so much time with joanna last summer and to see my sons again of course and as you can tell harry is a more gentle gaoler these days we had one dreadful storm at falaise and several lesser tempests after that but lately the weather has been almost peacefulalmost yes i can see that harrys wounds are not quite as raw but neither are yours and that surprises me you are still his prisoner after all good of you to point that out eleanor said dryly trust me i am not likely to forget rising she said come walk with me they moved from the sun into the shade halting under the spreading branches of a medlar tree when emma came to visit me eleanor said after a silence she expressed surprise that i seemed to have been examining my conscience and i told her that it helped to pass the time time is a prisoners worst enemy maud suddenly there are so many empty hours to fill endless days to get through so yes i have been thinking a great deal about my past and my future i even came to understand why harry and i misunderstood each other so fatally and what did you decide harry has always seen me first and foremost as his wife but i have always seen myself first and foremost as the duchess of aquitaine maud had reached that same conclusion but she hadnt expected eleanor to see it too so if you had it to do over again i would have paid more heed to your sound advice eleanor said with a slight smile and i would have listened more to the mother less to the duchess i did not realize how grievously joanna would be hurt and i should have nor is joanna the only one to suffer for our family mistakes and misjudgments i am sure my older daughters have been sorely troubled too and john maud said thinking of the wary little boy shed seen at the nottingham christmas court yes and john eleanor agreed say what you will of us maud harry and i do nothing by halves i still think that i was in the right and he was in the wrong you cannot treat a mettlesome destrier the way you would a plodding sumpter horse not without goading it to defiance or utterly breaking its spirit and i fear that the mistakes he has made and continues to make with our sons will haunt him till the end of his days but when i look back upon the scorched barren battlefield that our marriage has become i can take no pride in being right maud had cocked her head regarding eleanor with something almost like awe by god she said you truly have changed nonot yet eleanor said with another ghostly smile but i am trying eleanor was surprised when henry did not appear for dinner in the great hall for it was filled with highborn guests including three bishops taking his steward aside after the meal she got from him a reluctant admission that the kings leg was worse as she and amaria made their way back to her chamber she came to a sudden halt sent amaria on ahead and impulsively headed for henrys bedchamber the antechamber was crowded as always but henrys brother hamelin was guarding access to the inner sanctum and he reacted to eleanors entrance with outrage barring the door with his own body oh for the love of god hamelin eleanor snapped stop acting like a damned fool and let me by indeed i will not the king is ailing and he does not need to be vexed by unwelcome visitors especially those who might prove injurious to his health i do not have time for this nonsense over hamelins shoulder she could catch a glimpse of her husband and called out harry will you tell this dolt to admit me to her annoyance he took his time in thinking it over let her pass hamelin he said at last i promise to be on my guard when hamelin grudgingly gave way she swept by him disdainfully then slammed the door in his face thank you my lord husband she said with sarcasm that henry pretended to take at face value glad to be of service you must miss being able to order men around moving to the table he poured wine for himself why are you here eleanor i want to talk to you my lucky day he muttered but he poured a second cup for her if i promise to be on my best behavior she said can we conduct this conversation sitting down when he hesitated she scowled at him a scowl hed seen hundreds of times over the years jesu harry must you be so stubborn does your doctor have to tie you to a chair to get you off that bad leg he threw up his hands in mock surrender no he just has to set you on me limping across the chamber he sat down heavily upon his bed eleanor followed with their wine cups pulling a chair closer to the bed she studied him critically your fever has returned else youd not look so flushed harry how do you expect to heal if you will not get the rest you need enough he said impatiently she noticed though that he settled back against the pillows with a sigh of relief sowhat do you want to talk about i heard something very interesting in the hall todaythat you and louis are locking horns again this time over richards marriage to alys and no it was not maud who told me i overheard your justiciar talking with ralf de glanville is it true that you are facing the threat of an interdict not a serious one louis complained last year to the pope that i was unduly delaying the marriage to placate him the pope agreed to send a legate with a papal bull that would lay my lands under interdict but he gave the legate no instructions to publish it for the holy see does not want another breach with england louis has been making such a pest of himself though that the legate insisted that i meet with them to discuss the matterwhich ill gladly do if this blasted leg ever heals when you meet them what then i know youre not keen on the marriage why should i be you think i want to hand another son over to louis trussed up like a martinmas stoat that worked out so well with hal after all and the girl brings no marriage portion to speak of i must have been mad to agree to the betrothal eleanor knew why he had of course hed been eager to get louis to acknowledge his sons as his heirs hal for england and normandy and anjou richard for aquitaine and geoffrey for brittany shed often thought it was ironic that one of his purest impulseshis desire to protect the succession for halhad been such an unmitigated disaster so what will you tell louis and the legate that i am quite willing to have the marriage take placeonce louis fulfills his side of the bargain and turns over the dowries he promisedthe french vexin for marguerite and the city of bourges for alys eleanors eyes widened at the sheer audacity of the demand harry louis did turn over the norman vexin to you and we both know he never promised bourges for alys the norman vexin was mine by rights why would i settle for that and i am sure louis would have offered bourges if it had occurred to him at the time what father would want his daughter to go to her marriage bed as a pauper louis would sooner give you every drop of blood in his body ere hed surrender bourges so what are you really after he shrugged you tell me very well clearly you are seeking to put louis on the defensive if he backs off from insisting upon the marriage you are then free to look for a more profitable bride for richard if he agrees to provide a dowry you still win my guess is that you are simply trying to make the problem go away mayhap beguile louis into making a peace that will allow you to meddle in the auvergne and berry where you and the french have competing claims henry had forgotten how sharp she could be had forgotten how much hed once enjoyed talking to her about the stratagems subterfuges and feints that were such an important part of a kings arsenal reluctant to admit that shed read him so easily he did not reply eleanor sipped her wine while she mulled over the implications of this latest clash between henry and louis what does richard think of all this since alys is his betrothed i assume you did mention it to him he surprised her then by saying as it happens i did we talked about this ere he returned to poitou last summer he showed very little interest in the subject was much more interested in discussing the aid id provide against the poitevin rebels that rang true to eleanor she knew richard had never indicated the slightest desire to wed alys she doubted that hed ever given much thought to the girl at all so you are saying that richard is indifferent cares little whether he weds her or not that sums it up rather well for certes he is not burning to take a wife unlike geoffrey who keeps dropping hints heavier than anvils reminding me that he is in his nineteenth year now and constance is sixteen more than old enough for the holy state of matrimony that rang true too for richard had nothing to gain by wedding alys and geoffrey had a great deal to gain by wedding constance their marriage would validate his claim to brittany and hed no longer be dependent upon henrys good will would have power of his own eleanor suspected that the very reasons which made the marriage so attracttive to geoffrey were why henry seemed in no hurry for it to happen but that was a worry for a later time and more geoffreys concern than hers the hardest part of confinement was accepting the fact that she could no longer influence the course of events or even the interactions in her own family it sounds she said as if you have the situation well in hand he shot her a suspicious look and that sounds as if you are actually supporting me in this why would i not i agree that we can do better for richard than alys and id like nothing better than to see louis discomfited and humbled he proved to be an even worse ally than he was a husband as you ought to have known he pointed out and she acknowledged the truth of that with a rueful smile he had propped himself up on his elbow and was regarding her so impassively that she realized she had not the slightest idea what he was thinking so he said after a brief silence youd raise no objections if i disavowed the plighttroth but what if richard truly wanted to wed the girl in that case i would fight for the marriage till my last breath she murmured and saw that shed finally managed to startle him your honesty is commendable if rather reckless for youve hardly reassured me of your good faith should i set you free could you ever trust me again harry he did not even pause for breath no never exactly she said so what would be the point of telling you what i thought youd want to hear i know marriage is not usually fertile ground for the truth but mayhap a little truthtelling might have helped us avoid some of the grief of recent years he was openly skeptical are you saying that youre going to forswear lies from now on speak only gods truth ill believe that when unicorns roam the english countryside go ahead she challenged ask me a question then but i ought to warn you that the rules of the game apply to you too he considered it but she knew he was never one to refuse a challenge very well do you regret the rebellion you can do better than that harry of course i do ask me something less obvious what do you regret that you set my sons against me or that you lost better she conceded both nowyour turn answer me honestly if id demanded that you put rosamund clifford aside would you have done so no and if id asked it of you that gave him pause i am not sure he admitted i just do not know eleanor fair enough your turn shed expected a question about rosamund for she knew he still thought jealousy was at the root of their estrangement but what he asked was far more dangerous that day at falaisewhy did you not seek my forgiveness she exhaled a soft breath ah harry we are getting into deep waters here an honest answer your rules remember very well i did not want your forgiveness not then and now yes i would ask your forgiveness now but only if you asked mine in return are we back to rosamund again he said wearily so if i said i was sorry for taking her to my bed that would have satisfied you that would have been enough indeed not if you truly think i would rebel because you had a sugarsop on the side you do not know me at all and you never have he frowned but kept to the rules of the game saying honestly then i do not understand but whatever answer you offer for your betrayal it can neither explain nor justify your treachery you were my wife you owed loyalty to me above all others obviously i did not see it like that she said coolly and if youd wanted a meek little dormouse for a wife you ought to have married your rosamund you cannot have it both ways harry you wanted aquitaine enough to overlook that i was nine years older than you and had not given louis a son and had a reputation that was frayed around the edges you used my lands as a steppingstone to the english throne it seems hypocritical to bemoan the fact that i was not and would never be a docile gentle creature without an independent thought in her head you knew what you were getting with me i was never one for sailing under false colors yes i wanted aquitaine but i also wanted you and you know it do not make our marriage sound like such a onesided bargain you got what you wanted too madame i gave you a crown and a better life than ever youd had with louis capet and you repaid me with the worst sort of betrayal my sons would never have rebelled against me if not for you and you wonder why i did not seek your forgiveness because you blamed me for all and yourself for nothing the mistakes were always mine never yours and nothing has changed has it you still see yourself as the innocent one the victim well i have just one last question for you my lord husband come december it will begin my fifth year as your prisoner when you are forced to face the fact that our sons are still chafing under your stranglehold what then who will you blame when they rebel again harry and they will for you seem utterly unable to learn from your mistakes henry started to swing off the bed grimaced in pain and fell back against the pillows i want you gone from this chamber would to god i could have you gone from my life infuriated at being dismissed as if she were a servant eleanor got to her feet without haste defiantly taking her time i never thought id be saying this but you are a fool harry fitz empress as much of a fool as louis you are the one who is alienating our sons not me i said you could not learn from your mistakes worse than that you cannot even acknowledge them ill acknowledge one mistake right now i ought to have pressured the pope to annul our marriage ought to have insisted that i would no longer tolerate you as my wife or queen had i done that youd be cloistered in some remote irish nunnery today and id be rid of you for good eleanor strode to the door then turned back to face him you are not only blind to the truth about our sons you are equally blind to the truth about us weve been wed for twentyfive years have shared a bed for more than twenty of those years i bore you eight children and we buried one together weve schemed and fought and loved until we are so entangled in hearts and minds that there is no way to set us free god help us both harry for we will never be rid of each other not even death will do that and confident that shed had the final word for once she walked out and closed the door quietly behind her chapter twentyseven august winchester england eleanor was playing the harp and amaria working on her embroidery when turold sought admittance to their chamber surprised by his appearance for it was not mealtime eleanor gave him an encouraging smile although the youth had been at the castle only a fortnight she felt confident that she could mold him into another perrin for he was cheerful innocently cheeky and always eager to please turold was panting hed taken the stairs three at a time madame he gasped men just rode into the bailey and a groom said one of them is your son eleanor came hastily to her feet which one turold flushed i forgot to ask he said i wanted to tell you straight away he looked so crestfallen that eleanor hid a smile it does not matter turold ill know soon enough reassured turold promised to find out more and bolted from the chamber amaria lay down her sewing and moved to eleanors side who do you think it might be my lady i am not sure amaria as far as i know john is the only one presently in england and we can safely say it will not be him they did not have long to wait soon there were footsteps followed by a perfunctory knock and then eleanors third son entered geoffrey eleanor came quickly toward him the warmth of her greeting fueled by a twinge of guilt her initial reaction had been a muted sense of disappointment that it was not richard sorry geoffrey murmured it is only me and she gave him a startled look of appraisal did he have second sight you are more than enough she insisted and embraced him affectionately this is a delightful surprise i had no idea that you were back in england geoffrey kissed her on the cheek and then sauntered over to kiss amarias hand with a gallant flourish that would have done hal credit papa and i crossed from normandy last month he explained as he moved to the table and poured wine for them he knighted me on sunday at woodstock accepting a cup eleanor studied him carefully you do not seem all that pleased about it a man hungering for meat is not likely to be satisfied with bread geoffrey sprawled in the windowseat with the boneless abandon of youth i asked him again to let me wed constance instead he gave me a knighthood she was clearly being invited to join in his criticism but she resisted the temptation it would serve none of their interests to prolong their familys strife welli grant you that a knighthood is not worth a duchy but youve the right to half the revenues of brittany no no not the right geoffrey corrected her quickly the privilege and privileges as we know maman can be revoked at any time he paused expectantly and when his mother did not comment he heaved a theatrical sigh hal and i have a wager going how many more years can he postpone the wedding i just hope that when he finally relents i am not too old to totter to the altar eleanor decided it would be best to change the subject for she truly did not want to worsen henrys estrangement from his sons winchesters castellan had kept her informed about much of the political happenings in henrys domains for hed assumed that her greater visibility meant she was no longer in such deep disgrace she knew therefore that henry and louis had forged another tentative truce when theyd met with the papal legate both kings had pledged to take the cross and henry had grudgingly agreed that richard and alys would eventually be wed although hed refused to commit himself to a specific date but shed not seen henry for almost a year and she took the opportunity now to interrogate geoffrey about family matters how is your father faring these days does his bad leg continue to pain him he said nothing about it and is no longer limping so id say hes well enough his temper is as quick to kindle as it ever was though and he is starting to go grey i think he is beginning to feel his years for hes been fretting that his hair is thinning and hes taken to cutting it even shorter than usual geoffrey grinned at that for he was still a month from his twentieth birthday and had a handsome head of luxuriant brownishblond hair eleanor was not as amused for she too was feeling her years and what of your brothers i did not see john ralf de glanvillethe one who captured the scots king rememberhas taken charge of his education richard is off spilling blood somewhere in poitou and hal is chasing after glory on the tournament circuit in fact i will be joining him upon my return to normandy for why should he have all the fun brittany is reasonably quiet at the moment so i might as well enjoy the peace whilst it lasts eleanor knew of course about hals abiding passion for tourneys i thought that he had not been very successful at first he was not but will marshal noticed a ruse that the count of flanders was employing at tournaments he would hold back from the first assault wait until the other participants were milling about in small groups wearied battered and bruised then he and his men would rush in and take advantage of the confusion sweeping all before them marshal confided this to hal who adopted the same tactics and since then he has been winning more often than not then why was harry grumbling so about the expenses of hals tourneys if he is winning hal must be reaping a goodly profit from the ransoms and captured horses geoffrey laughed true enough but hals spending could put a drunken sailor to shame he outfits his knights in the very best armor and weapons using his largesse to lure skilled fighters into his service and he buys the finest horses of course and he loves to lavish gifts upon marguerite and he never refuses a friend and his almsgiving is openhanded and eleanor held up her hand laughing too enough do you have any other family news for me indeed i do tilda had another son last year they named the poor lad otto but that is not as bad as the name they burdened his brother withlothair eleanor felt a pang remembering how joanna had laughed too at lothairs name the last shed heard joanna was faring well in her new land and her new life but sicily seemed so far away geoffrey was regarding her with an enigmatic expression i am not sure if i ought to tell you this maman papa has sired another bastard ida de tosny the lord of conchess daughter gave birth to a son last year eleanors shrug of unconcern was not feigned i am pleased to hear that he has acknowledged the child as his not all men do sad to say what name did harry bestow on the baby but when he told her it was william her indifference ebbed away replaced by a prickle of resentful anger why must harry choose the name of her dead son their will had been cheated of so mucha long and healthy life a kings crown love and lust and sons of his own he ought not to have to share his name with one of harrys byblows geoffrey got to his feet and stretched i am loath to go maman but i hope to reach southampton by dark ive been told the winds are favorable and i want to take advantage of them ere they shift there is something else though that you need to know it concerns your vassal the count of la marche eleanor already knew what he was about to tell her for maud had shared the story of the counts scandal not wanting to deprive geoffrey of the pleasure of relating such lurid gossip she smiled innocently what has audebert done now he thought he had reason to suspect his wife of infidelity with his usual rashness he acted upon the suspicion without waiting for proof the wife was cast off and the unfortunate lover was put to death but then his son and heir died of a sudden and the count began to fear the almighty was punishing him for slaying an innocent man he plunged into a deep melancholy vowing to do all he could to make amends and regain gods grace somehow i doubt that involved taking back his wronged wife eleanor said tartly has he taken to sackcloth and ashes forsaken the world for the serenity of the cloister she was being sarcastic but to her surprise geoffrey nodded close maman close he decided to take the cross to expiate his sins by a hallowed death in the holy land but ere he departed on his pilgrimage of atonement he sold the county of la marche to papa for fifteen thousand angevin livres he did what eleanor had not raised her voice but there was something in her tone that attracted the attention of amaria whod retreated across the chamber to give them the semblance of privacy one glance at the queens glittering green eyes burning all the more brightly against the sudden pallor of her face and amaria jumped to her feet in alarm madame are you ill what is wrong eleanor did not appear to hear her count audebert geoffrey said is the vassal of the duchess of aquitaine liegeman of my lady mother and my brother richard at least he was until my father snatched la marche from under their noses eleanor was on her feet now too stalking to the window and back before whirling to face geoffrey again in a flurry of silken skirts does richard know this he knows papa struck this deal last december boasted of it to richard hal and me when we gathered for his christmas court at angers he was right pleased with the bargain hed made and well he should be for la marche must be worth three times what he paid for it his pleasure be damned what did he say to richard about his piracy oh he explained it as too good a deal to pass up and assured richard that there was no need for concern that he could still consider la marche as part and parcel of aquitaine geoffrey had been fighting back a smile but at that it broke free richard found that very reassuring eleanor said something under her breath but amaria did not catch it for she did not speak the lengua romana of the queens homeland she needed no translation though not after looking at the other womans face might not the king have spoken the truth she ventured cautiously wanting to offer comfort but well aware of the shakiness of her footing mayhap he truly does mean to pass it on to richard again it was left to geoffrey to respond mayhap he does dame amaria but just like my marriage to the lady constance la marches fate depends now upon my lord fathers whim upon his mood at any given moment and as we well know his moods can shift faster than those channel winds i need to catch moving to his mothers side he kissed eleanor in farewell i must be off maman have you any words of advice for me any suggestions how to stay in papas good graces and mayhap even pry my bride from his talons yes eleanor said as it happens i do geoffrey you need never doubt that your father loves you and your brothers but never make the mistake of believing you can trust him my thoughts exactly he said and smiling made his departure to eleanors joyful amazement henry chose to hold his christmas court that year at winchester richard had remained in poitou where he was planning an unusual winter campaign but hal marguerite geoffrey and john were there as were roger and maud even ranulf and rhiannon had made the long trip from wales in order to visit with morgan what followed was eleanors best christmas since chinon six years ago henry shook his head when he was offered more wine and then glanced inquiringly at his wife madame no my lord i have had enough she said blandly they were sharing dishes as was customary and henry was conscientious about making sure that eleanor received the best portions for men were expected to look after their female dinnermates good manners demanded as much and henry had taken care to treat eleanor with impeccable courtesy at the christmas court she in turn had been no less polite showing deference and decorum whenever they met in public there had been no private encounters and she was content that there were not for what would it serve to raise the issue of la marche with him if hed not heeded her when their passion had burned at whiteheat he was not going to listen now that their marriage lay in smoldering ruins eleanor had been bothered by a headache all afternoon but she was determined not to miss any of the festivities shed taken an herbal remedy and was now returning to the solar where an informal gathering was in progress unlike the feasts held in the great hall this one was confined to family and friends when she reentered the solar she was not surprised to find that hal was still the center of attention slipping into her chair next to henry she discovered that hal was no longer passing on gossip from the french court but was entertaining with some of his experiences on the tournament field the tourney was held this past spring along the norman border between the towns of anet and sorel knights had come from all over from flanders and brittany and anjou and poitou and champagne even from england hal added with a mischievous look in his fathers direction for henrys disapproval of tournaments was well known he considered them a waste of time and a threat to public order hal had been talking so long that his throat had gone dry and he paused to accept a fresh wine cup from will marshal the tourney was held on the level ground by the river eure two of the french companies had already clashed and were fighting when we came upon the scene we hit them with such force that they soon gave way and then fled the field our men chased after them so eagerly that they left me behind only will stayed by my side hal said with a fond glance toward the knight who smiled and sought to appear modest and unassuming with limited success he was understandably proud of his prowess will and i followed after the others riding downhill into anet the knights both the hunted and the hunters had already raced through the town but the french lord simon de neauphle was still there with three hundred foot soldiers hed ordered to protect the lists they saw us at the same time that we saw them and will bless him declared there is nothing for it but to charge them and so we did that provoked an admiring murmur from his audience hal grinned disarmingly i know we were quite mad but damned if they did not scatter like a flock of chickens i was glad enough just to avoid capture but will saw his chance and snatched the bridle of simon de neauphles horsehis favorite method of capturing enemy knights so we galloped through the town towing simon along behind us for without his reins he had no control of his mount but then we happened to pass under a lowhanging gutter and simon grabbed it as neat a trick as ive ever seen poor will never looked back so he did not know hed lost his prisoner not until it was too late and of course you never thought to warn me will complained mildly and hal grinned again hellfire will i was laughing too much to talk laughing so much i damned near fell off my own horse throwing an arm around the knights shoulders he acknowledged that will was a good sport about it though laughed as heartily as any of us afterward hal was about to launch into another tournament tale but just then a servant entered with a platter of wafers some filled with cheese others with honey henry and eleanor watched with amusement as hal and geoffrey and their friends pounced upon the platter and gobbled up the wafers like starving wolves rising eleanor crossed to her daughterinlaw and gave marguerite a quick hug the young woman smiled but she seemed very fragile to eleanor as if she might be bruised by a breath and eleanors heart ached for her across the solar maud and rhiannon were talking quietly together and when eleanors eyes caught mauds the countess sent her a silent message curious she strolled over to see what maud wanted we need to talk to you maud said and steered eleanor and rhiannon toward a windowseat rhiannon and ranulf are fretful about their son morgan is old enough now for the next stage of his education and hal has kindly offered to take the lad into his household eleanor glanced from one woman to the other and rhiannon looked so unhappy that maud realized it was up to her rhiannon is loath to speak frankly fortunately ive never had that problem the truth eleanor is that ranulf and rhiannon are not sure that this is best for their son morgan is at an impressionable age and easily influenced especially by someone as charming and beguiling as hal see for yourself she said jerking her head toward morgan eleanors gaze came to rest upon rhiannons son he was a handsome youngster with his fathers dark eyes and his mothers thick chestnut hair and he was listening to his cousin hal as raptly as a young novice monk eager to pledge himself to the greater glory of god i see eleanor said her first reaction was displeasure a mothers indignation that maud and rhiannon should dare to disparage her son to imply that hals flaws were a cause for concern but it soon passed she owed rhiannon a great deal for the welshwoman had given her support when she most needed it she owed her an honest answer and as much as it grieved her to admit it she knew in her heart that her eldest son was not the best role model for a lad like morgan she loved hal but she was not blind to his faults he was goodhearted generous engaging and dashing he was also irresponsible impulsive fickle and malleable it might not be for the best she said at last to place morgan in hals household he is not likely to give morgan the supervision a lad of his tender years needs what a pity richard is not here he took rico rainalds natural son as one of his squires last year and i am sure hed have been willing to take morgan under his wing too no one spoke for rhiannon was dismayed that eleanor had confirmed her misgivings shed hoped for reassurance and maud had the heretical thought that morgan would be no better off with richard than he would with hal no one would ever accuse richard of being flighty or irresolute but he was gaining a reputation for recklessness for the sort of mad courage that other men found so irresistible and mothers of squires found so alarming she was not about to say that to eleanor though and so she said instead that her son hugh would be happy to accept morgan into his household but she feared that the lad was so bedazzled by hal that hed see the earl of chester as a great letdown eleanor considered the problem and then smiled i have the solution ill ask geoffrey to accept morgan as one of his squires he takes part in enough tournaments to satisfy morgans craving for excitement and hes proving himself to be a capable commander in his campaigns against the breton rebels rhiannon was vastly relieved that would be so good of you my lady how can i ever thank you it is my pleasure eleanor said and indeed it was for this was the first time in five years that shed been able to do a favor for a friend to dispense the patronage and largesse that was expected of those who wielded royal authority rhiannon soon excused herself and a few moments later she had joined ranulf and was murmuring in his ear eleanor smiled when ranulf glanced in her direction while rhiannon and maud had embraced her warmly during this christmas court shed gotten only cool civility from ranulf and roger she knew ranulf would feel honorbound to thank her for placing his son in geoffreys household and she was looking forward to gaining the upper hand however petty it might be maud had remained by her side but now she gave an audible sigh and eleanor saw that her gaze had fastened upon her son hugh in animated discussion with willem whod recently returned from his pilgrimage to the holy land id better rein him in ere he gets sloppy drunk and makes a fool of himself maud said grimly and eleanor realized that hugh had been drinking a lot since his arrival at winchester is he developing too much of a fondness for wine she asked quietly and maud shook her head only when hes in the kings presence youve not noticed that he gets as nervous as a treed cat around harry as the countess went off to take charge of her wayward son eleanor felt an envious itch wishing that she could be as pragmatic about motherhood as maud the other woman had long ago made a cleareyed unsentimental assessment of her eldest son accepting his weaknesses but loving him wholeheartedly anyway that was no easy feat for affection and expectations invariably colored most parental appraisals of their offspring eleanor hoped she was able to see her sons as they truly were but all she could be sure of was that she saw them more realistically than her husband did some of her earlier high spirits had faded and she suspected it was because shed been forced to pass a judgment upon her eldest son weighing hal in the balance and finding him wanting as her eyes lingered upon his golden head she sought to assure herself that it was not too late for him jesu he was not yet twentyfour surely he had time to sort himself out she was intending to speak to geoffrey about his cousin morgan when her eye was caught by a movement in one of the windowseats with casual nonchalance she began her approach not wanting to scare her quarry off and she slid into the windowseat beside her son before john could retreat i have not seen much of you this week john thinking that was an understatement her youngest had been as elusive as a ghost during the christmas court so far the boy sprang to his feet reluctantly reclaiming his seat only when she gestured for him to sit madame eleanor took this opportunity to study him he was just a few days from his twelfth birthday but looked younger for he was undersized henry was of average height although hed always appeared larger due to his powerful build both hal and richard were taller than he geoffrey shorter unless he sprouted up like a weed in the next few years she thought john would likely be closer to geoffreys height than his other brothers it was disconcerting to see her own eyes in that thin little face this was a child of her womb so why did he seem like such a stranger she decided not to waste time with superficial chatter for such a chance might not come again it occurred to me she said that you and i have never talked about the rebellion or my part in it when he did not respond she prodded gently surely youve talked about it with your father yeshe said it was all your fault he said slanting her an oblique glance through surprisingly thick lashes and she thought she caught a glimmer of humor most of christendom agrees with him she conceded lightly but i thought you might have questions that only i could answer ask whatever you want john and i will try to be as honest as i can john gnawed his lower lip and she saw his eyes dart across the solar where his father was talking with hal and marguerite i do have a question he said just when she was about to give up hope of cracking that turtles shell did youdid you really put a snake in richard and geoffreys bed eleanor blinked in surprise i was not expecting that query she confessed so they told you about that did they alas i must plead guilty in my defense i can say only that your brothers were born hellions lord the trouble they could get into smiling at john she said i will make a deal with you lad if i tell you about some of their more hairraising mischiefmaking will you promise not to try any of these tricks yourself john ducked his head his face hidden by a tumble of unruly dark hair but then he shot from his seat as if fired from a crossbow i am sorry madame i think my lord father has need of me and before she could protest he fled eleanor watched as he threaded his way among their guests finally surfacing at henrys side henry stopped in midsentence slipped an affectionate arm around the boys shoulders before he resumed his conversation with hal marguerite also gave john a welcoming smile but eleanor could not help noticing how brusquely hal treated his younger brother barely according john a nod and she frowned it was true that johns castles in england and normandy had come at hals expense but it was not fair to blame the lad for that it was not johns fault that his mere presence conjured up unpleasant memories for hal her frown deepened for she was suddenly thinking of her own unpleasant memories those connected with johns birth warned by her sister shed made a foolhardy winter crossing of the channel stubbornly set upon determining if the gossip was true if harry had really dared to install rosamund clifford openly at their woodstock manor shed been feeling ungainly and clumsy in the late stages of a difficult pregnancy feeling every one of her fortytwo years only to come facetoface with a radiant young girl young enough to be her daughter shed told herself it was her pride that was bruised not her heart and during those painfilled hours as she struggled to give birth shed vowed that she would not die so harrys child might live john had finally been brought into the world as the midnight hour drew nigh a small feeble shadow of the robust sunkissed children whod come before him eleanor she was so focused upon the awful night of johns birth that she started at the sound of mauds voice and the other woman said with a smile i did not mean to startle you so you have such an odd look upon your face are you all right i was just thinking that you may have been right maud must you sound so surprised by that i am always right about what shaking off the past eleanor returned mauds smile that i may have changed after all c hapter t wentyeight may taillebourg aquitaine perched on a steep crag overlooking the river charente the castle of taillebourg seemed to be scraping the clouds so high above the valley was it protected on three sides by sheer cliffs its one accessible approach was so well defended that none had ever dared to lay siege to it for its fortifications boasted no less than three deep ditches and triple walls within those bastions nestled a small town now filled with the inhabitants of the nearby villages whod taken shelter there as word spread of an advancing army despite the crowding their mood was calm for the town and castle were well provisioned with enough supplies to endure a long siege the castle garrison was even more confident than the townspeople and villagers for more than a thousand men patrolled those battlements and ramparts answerable to one of the greatest barons of aquitaine geoffrey de rancon and none doubted that their lord was more than a match for the angevin kings cub richard had laid siege to de rancons stronghold at pons early in the new year and made so little progress that after three months hed given up and gone looking for easier prey hed had better luck than he had at pons taking five castles in less than a month but pons still held out defiantly and taillebourg was even more formidable so safe that de rancon himself had chosen to defy richard from within its redoubtable defenses upon being told by his scouts of richards approach geoffrey de rancon had laughed and his knights began to wager how long it would be until the foolhardy stripling crept away with his tail between his legs richard had ridden ahead of his army with a handful of his household knights and as they gazed upon the rebel lords rockhewn citadel their spirits plummeted and their cockiness ebbed away as they exchanged glances the same thought was in all their minds that taillebourg made pons seem as exposed as a nunnery only richard and his young squire rico were not disheartened for rico was convinced that richard could walk on water if he put his mind to it and richard would not admit that failure was possible not even to himself he knew hed been damaged by his inability to take pons and he knew too that he needed a dramatic victory if he hoped to prevail over de rancon and the count of angouleme and their allies there was no way on gods green earth that he would slink back to england and confess defeat to his father no if he could not take taillebourg then better he die in the attempt at least there was honor in that noticing that his squire had drawn up beside him he glanced at the youth with a sidelong smile well what do you say rico shall we give it a go ricos eyes were shining indeed my lord the past year had been the best one of ricos young life he knew his half sisters and their husbands were embittered by the kings refusal to let them lay claim to rainalds earldom but rico had always known it would never pass to him the son born out of wedlock and so hed been indifferent to its disposition hed jumped at the chance to learn the arts of war from richard and reality had exceeded all of his expectations he was utterly convinced that his twentyoneyearold cousin was the most valiant man ever to draw breath and would soon bring these disloyal contemptible rebels to heel while the knights shared ricos appreciation of richards courage they did not have his starryeyed faith and could muster up no enthusiasm for an assault upon taillebourg they would not be getting a vote though and so they girded themselves for the worst as richard turned back toward them glancing at theodore chabot the captain of his routiers richard wasted no time declaring what he wanted done send men out to forage he instructed chabot check every barn and chicken roost and be sure to search the woods for thats where the peasants will have hidden their livestock it will be done my lord chabot said matteroffactly the knights thought hed have sounded as imperturbable if richard had ordered him to make a lone assault upon the castle walls guillaume de forz and andre de chauvigny were young poitevin lords whod been with richard since his illfated rebellion and it never occurred to either of them to question his decision for it had long been a joke between them that it would be easier to teach richard to fly than it would to get him to back down once hed made up his mind theyd expected his order to forage for armies lived off the land it was what came next that troubled them how could taillebourg be taken after we gather whatever food we can find andre said with a brave attempt to sound as nonchalant as if they were discussing a days hawking what then richard knew they were uneasy but he did not fault them for it although he did not understand the fear that surged through other mens veins he asked only that they not give in to it for hed come to realize that few shared his utter contempt for danger or death then he said we show them what hell is like chevauchee was the term used for the most common tactic of warfarethe ravaging of an enemys lands but the people of taillebourg had never seen a raid as deadly or destructive as the one launched by richard that may church bells sounded the alarm as his routiers spread out across the countryside those whod not already taken refuge in taillebourg fled in panic the slow and the old and the ill were cut down like sheaves of wheat the sky was soon smudged with dense black clouds as villages barns and manors were put to the torch cattle were butchered for richards men and those not needed were still slaughtered to deny them to his enemies oxen were slain and ploughs broken fruit trees were uprooted and crops were burned in the field vineyards were trampled wells were salted horses were taken sheep gutted chickens either eaten or killed the horrified townsmen and villagers watched helplessly as their world went up in flames the fires were still burning when richard brought up his siege engines and began to bombard the town mangonels launched heavy rocks and stones and even the carcasses of dead animals the men working in eighthour shifts so that the assault continued both day and night from the castle battlements geoffrey de rancon and his men seethed with rage vowing vengeance but panic was spreading in the town as people realized that withstanding the siege would not bring victory when richard gave up and retreated nothing would be left to them but scorched fields the bloated bodies of their slain livestock and the fearful specter of famine richard had set up their camp so close to the town that dust from the battered walls was soon coating their tents and when his knights grumbled that the nonstop bombardment was robbing them of sleep he smiled grimly it will not be long he assured them until they take the bait on may the castle garrison sallied forth in a dawn attack such surprise assaults were often successful but richard had been expecting this one sure that de rancon would not be able to resist their tempting proximity the fighting that followed was brutal with richard in the very thick of it and his men were so inspired and emboldened by his utter fearlessness that they soon had the garrison retreating back toward the town this was the moment richard had been waiting for now he shouted after them and as de rancons knights plunged through the town gates richard and his men fought their way in too a wild melee broke out as the garrison fled for the safety of the castle geoffrey de rancon and many of his knights were able to reach it but richard and his men were hot on their heels and they saw at once that theyd never be able to hold the bailey they raced for their last refuge the stone keep flinging a torch onto the wooden stairs just as their pursuers got there and tumbled bruised and bleeding into the hall all of the windows were tightly shuttered so they were half blinded as they escaped from sunlight into shadows blinking owlishly in the semigloom of the hall they slumped against the walls collapsed in the floor rushes and for a time the only sound was the harsh gasping of men fighting to get enough air into their laboring lungs stunned by how swiftly the tide had turned against them de rancon buried his head in his hands and wept the soldiers who had not made it into the keep were quickly struck down and richard dispatched men to patrol the castle ramparts and the town walls leaning against the inner bailey well to catch his breath he gratefully accepted a bucket from a grinning routier yanked off his helmet and poured it over his head the water quickly turned pink as it splattered onto the ground but none of the blood was his it was here that theobald chabot found him can my lads have their sport now he asked and when richard nodded he raised his arm high signaling to one of his sergeants that the town was theirs for the taking his men jubilantly claimed their reward plunder was mothers milk to the battleseasoned routiers who lived and died by the sword smoke was soon spiraling up from the narrow unpaved streets and the sounds of their citys suffering were not long in reaching the miserable men trapped within the dark sweltering keep reminding them what their fate would be if they tried to hold out a town or castle taken by storm was fair game for by their stubborn resistance the besieged forfeited the right to be treated with leniency and could be slain without violating chivalric codes of honor squires were not supposed to take part in actual fighting and it took rico a while to make his way into the town he found he had to step over bodies in the street had to keep jumping aside to avoid being trampled by celebrating bands of routiers as they surged from looted taverns in search of more wine men bumped into him as they emerged from ransacked shops and houses their arms filled with booty while others were on the prowl for bedmates willing or otherwise again and again he heard a dogs barking become shrill yipping and then silence goods were raining down from open windows caught by laughing passersby whores painted and powdered had emerged from their bolt holes to mingle with the soldiers in the streets rico saw sights that shocked him to the marrow of his bones had to watch his footing lest he step into puddles of congealing blood but by the time he reached the castle he was no longer flinching every time he heard a screaming woman or a wailing child richard was conferring with several of his knights as they appraised the keep defenses rico waited patiently till his lord had time for him noting that his sword needed a good cleaning and so did the tunic hed worn over his hauberk for it was soiled and torn even his lords boots had bloodstains on them hed have much to do noticing the boy at last richard beckoned him over you are looking a little greensick cousin he joked if you are going to spew try not to aim in my direction he was surprised when rico did not laugh or at least acknowledge the jest rico had proven to be an excellent squire in great part because he was so eager to please but also because he was so invariably cheerful but now rico was looking at him very somberly like a sinner about to confess to his priest i have never seen a captured town before he confided hesitantly i guessguess i did not know how bloody war can be my lord richard considered what the boy had said and then nodded in agreement yes war can be bloody and brutal and disquieting rico but there is also aa kind of glory in it rico did not understand but he nodded too for if richard said it it must be so henry had sent willem to the flemish court for negotiations with the count of flanders and he was unable to return until june taking ship at wissant he landed at dover and then began the tedious task of chasing down the king he finally found henry at his woodstock manor as he entered the great hall willem saw that most of the men and some of the women were clustered at one end he knew hal was spending some time at his fathers court and he assumed that the young king was the attraction he was surprised therefore to notice hal standing on the dais his arms folded across his chest wondering who was stealing hals thunder willem took a closer look and when he caught a glimpse of a reddishgold head he understood both the commotion and hals obvious discontent the hero of taillebourg was here and hals tournament victories had been put in the shade by richards dramatic capture of a castle said to be impregnable joining henry upon the dais he was warmly welcomed by the king and courteously by hal henry was beaming every time he looked over at richard and wasted no time in bragging of his exploits telling willem that geoffrey de rancon had surrendered two days after richard took the town he also yielded pons and ten days later count vulgrin ended his rebellion and surrendered his castles at angouleme and montignac a number of our highborn rebels were so shaken by richards conquests that they have taken the cross and are making plans to leave for the holy land as soon as they can get away henry grinned aquitaine has not been so peaceful in years seeing how much pleasure richards triumph was giving his father willem was happy to indulge his paternal pride and began to ask questions thus giving henry the opportunity to discuss the fall of taillebourg at length he was still in midcry when hal quietly withdrew first from the dais and then from the hall but few noticed it was an amazing feat willem henry concluded enthusiastically i do not know anyone who could have done better even me and the lad is only twentyone think what a commander hell make once he gains more experience willem agreed finding it easy to echo henrys praise for no soldier could fail to be impressed by richards triumph henry added that geoffrey had been successful in brittany too if not quite on such a spectacular scale forcing that habitual rebel guihomar de leon to surrender all his strongholds but he soon returned to praising richard and when willem asked how he planned to reward the young man he laughed i am giving him aquitaine god knows he earned it willem was impressed knowing how reluctant henry was to relinquish authority he must have been overwhelmed he said and henrys pleasure lost some of its luster he was not as joyful as i would have expected he admitted when i told him that from now on he could govern the duchy as he chose he thanked me as calmly as if id just offered him a new saddle his eyes rested for a mystified moment upon the tall figure of his second son i confess willem he said quietly that i do not understand the lad never have if truth be told he keeps his own counsel has learned to guard his thoughts as his king i find that commendable for no ruler should be as easily read aswell as hal is but as his father i do wish he were more forthcoming at least with me after a moment though he shook his head and began to question willem about his mission to the flemish court willem had just begun his report when there was a sudden stir in the hall curious he paused and was taken aback to see the queen coming through the open doorway henry caught his questioning look and shrugged richard wanted her here he said simply and willem thought it was encouraging that the king was learning to pick his battles with his sons but then henry said actually what hed asked for was her freedom and there is no way i could have granted that wish so it would have been churlish to deny him her presence at revelries in his honor ive tried to be a good sport about it willem even bought her a gilded scarlet saddle and new robes for the occasion i cannot say though that i am pleased to have her here willem understood why the change in richards demeanor was startling where before hed been detached even aloof he was now displaying considerable animation as he conversed and laughed with his mother henry made no comment but he kept his eyes upon them even as willem completed his account of his meeting with count philip by then richard had noticed willems presence and was heading in their direction his mother pacing serenely beside him her hand resting lightly but possessively upon his arm once greetings had been exchanged willem made ready to hear richards firsthand account of taillebourgs fall richard had other matters upon his mind though ive not had a chance to talk with you since your return from the holy land and i am eager to hear all about your experiences there you were one of the victors at ramlah no is it true that your siege of harenc was interrupted by the arrival of saladin himself what do you think of his military prowess did you get to jerusalem willem flung up his hand in mock surrender and let richard lead him away to continue his interrogation henry and eleanor found themselves alone for the first time since her arrival at woodstock after an awkward moment henry took refuge in courtesy and escorted her toward their chairs upon the dais richard and willem had moved to a windowseat to continue their discussion of holy land warfare and they were soon surrounded by a large throng for richard was exercising the sort of magnetic appeal that had previously been hals alone henry watched his son for a few moments more wishing that richard could be like that with himenthused and unguarded glancing toward his wife he said what were you saying that richard found so amusing his brusque tone made it sound more like an accusation than an inquiry eleanor ignored the undercurrents and said composedly ah that i told richard that i was particularly gratified to see taillebourg castle reduced to rubble for louis and i spent the first night of our marriage there henry gave her a sharp look but decided he did not want to talk of wedding nights with eleanor that was too intimate for his liking it vexed him that she insisted upon displaying a wifes familiarity instead of a rebels contrition you like to accuse me of never learning from my mistakes he said but louis does not even learn from other mens mistakes did you hear that he is planning to have philippe crowned in august on ascension day no i had not heard that eleanor said i cannot say it surprises me though louis always had a talent for taking a bad situation and making it worse to be fair he did have some misgivings about the idea after observing how well it worked with hal but he has decided to go ahead with it mayhap because he has been ailing this past year it will be interesting to see how it goes henry commented in a masterly understatement eleanor regarded him pensively i saw hal out in the bailey she said he looked out of sorts and sad to say was making no attempt to hide his discontent i fear that he is not handling richards newfound fame very well no he is not henry said and sighed hal and richard show all the good will of cain and abel and for that matter richard and geoffrey are not much better eleanors eyes narrowed was he saying the dissention between their sons was richards fault but as he continued she saw that was not what he was implying i confess to being baffled by their constant squabbling and strife eleanor it is true i never got along with my brother geoff but that was mainly his doing will and i were always very close i know she said remembering how griefstricken hed been by wills sudden death at twentyseven i was only six when my brother died so i do not have many memories of him i probably considered him a pest as big sisters are wont to do but petronilla and i were confidantes and allieseven partners in crimeas far back as i can remember somehow though our sons have managed to reach manhood without any true sense of brotherly affection or loyalty and i do not know what to do about it neither do i henry admitted frowning as he saw the corners of her mouth curving upward what possible amusement can you find in this not amusement exactly it just occurred to me that we have finally found some common ground to agree upon harry and what is it our failings as parents henry shared her sense of the ridiculous and when their eyes met they were soon both laughing laughter that stopped abruptly when they realized that this was the first time theyd laughed together in more than seven years chapter twentynine august woods near compiegne france at first philippe was angry with his horse for bolting and with his companions for taking so long to find him hed been calling out until his voice was hoarse but the only sounds he heard were the normal noises of the forest he was getting hungry and tired and as the afternoon wore on increasingly uneasy the prospect of being lost in the woods at night was a daunting one this was the first time in philippes fourteen years that hed ever been utterly alone and he liked it not at all he was scratched from brambles and overhanging branches bothered by swarms of gnats and other insects as miserable as hed ever been in his entire life when his mount suddenly shied and he banged his elbow painfully against a gnarled oak he lost his temper altogether he did not enjoy riding had always viewed horses with dislike and distrust and this particular horse was to blame for all of his troubles today giving in to his rage he jabbed it in the sides with his spurs at the same time that he brought his whip down upon its withers the gelding snorted and reared up suddenly philippe dropped his spear and clung to the mane as he tried to maintain his seat but the horse began to buck and the boy lost his grip and his stirrups went sailing over its head into a wild blackberry bush like his father philippe rarely cursed the strongest oath he normally used was by the lance of st james but as he sought to extricate himself he was muttering an obscenity one that could have come from the mouth of the english king or any of his sons when he finally fought free of the thorns and briars and saw that the wretched horse was nowhere in sight he had to bite his lip to keep further profanities from spewing out into the humid august air as bad as being lost was being lost and on foot was far worse philippe rooted around in the undergrowth until hed recovered his spear theyd been hunting boar and had not seen one all day but now it seemed to him that boars lurked in every thicket behind every felled tree and he gripped the weapon so tightly that his knuckles turned white he shouted again listened in vain for a response and then hunching his shoulders began to trudge along the path the tree branches intertwined forming an opaque green canopy over his head and he went for long stretches without seeing the sky he was slow to realize therefore that the light was ebbing with the awareness that the sun would soon be setting he suffered his first surge of fear his second came when he tripped over an exposed root and nearly landed on a snake and his next when he heard an owls prey in its death throes unseen in the twilight dusk but it was the distant howl of a wolf that sent him into panicked flight he ran until he stumbled and fell flat hitting the ground with enough force to bruise his ribs and drive all the breath from his lungs the shock of it enabled him to regain control of himself realizing it was madness to keep racing around in the darkness he crawled over to the closest tree curled up next to its trunk and prepared to endure an interminable night he was sure hed never be able to sleep but he finally dozed and jerked upright just before sunrise during the night fog had drifted in and the trees were wreathed in patches of pale vapor blotting out the sun shivering in the damp dawn air he struggled to his feet every muscle in his body cramping in protest took a deep breath and yelled for help he thought he heard an answering shout but he did not trust his own senses his next cry brought another echo though louder this time i am here over here he could hear running footsteps now and then a huge hulking figure was looming out of the mist a giant with bare muscled arms hands like hams a blackened smudged face and an axe dangling by his side the ogre of philippes boyhood night terrors shrinking back against the tree he gasped stay away from me i am philippe capet the kings son keep away henry was back at woodstock it had always been one of his favorite manors and it gave him comfort to visit the nearby nunnery of godstow where he lavished largesse upon the priory and prayed for rosamunds soul hed held a council meeting that afternoon a productive session in which they discussed a wide range of topics the coming christmas visit of the king of scotland the feasibility of issuing a new coinage a report upon his recent judicial reform in which hed divided the realm into four circuits and the need to fill the justiciarship now that richard de lucy had resigned the post because of ill health the council was done but henry and a few others still lingered in the solar as all of them were men who stood high in henrys favor the talk was more relaxed and informal theyd been idly discussing the lateran council held in rome that spring one of the canons had banned those abominable jousts and fairs which are commonly called tournaments but henry and his companions agreed that the church prohibition would not likely be heeded nor did they expect the lateran councils excommunication of routiers to discourage rulers from hiring them henry candidly admitted that hed continue to make use of routiers when the need arose though it could be argued that routiers are actually more dangerous when they are not employed my son richard kept his routiers under tight rein but once he came to england in june and they were no longer being paid they sacked bordeaux getting to his feet and beginning to pace henry stopped the others from rising too for gilbert foliot and the bishop of winchester were no longer young i received two interesting communications from the french court this week he said and these men knew him well enough to understand that there was something highly unusual about those interesting communications one came from the french king henry continued and the other fromwell lets just say a wellplaced source at louiss court louis has had to postpone his sons coronation philippe was hunting in the royal forest near compiegne and somehow he became separated from his companions he spent the night alone in the woods and was finally found the next morning by a charcoal burner but my source tells me that the charcoal burner must have had a fearsome visage for his appearance scared philippe so badly that he took ill soon after his rescue the men exchanged grins and several laughed outright henry shared their amusement royal heirs were not supposed to be so delicate at that age any of my hellions would have considered a night alone in the woods a grand adventure but we know philippe is as highstrung as a lass the humor of his mishap soon soured though for within a day he was burning up with fever and they are now fearing for his life they were no longer laughing if philippe died the repercussions would be felt throughout christendom louiss own health was said to be failing if he died soon after his son there could be a vicious struggle for his crown his two sonsinlaw the counts of champagne and blois would be sure to make claims on behalf of their wives his daughters with eleanor marie and alix some would look to marguerite too even though she was a younger daughter for there were bound to be french barons who would eagerly embrace the idea of having the easygoing pleasureloving hal as their king just as there were poitevin lords whod prefer hal to his more martial brother richard marie is the eldest of course willem said thoughtfully but that might not count for much what with her husband now in the holy land my money would be on thibault of bloisunless you seriously back your son and the lady marguerite my liege henry knew this was the question in all of their minds but only willem was bold enough to voice it thinking that hal had yet to show he could rule one kingdom much less two he said you are getting the cart before the horse willem lets not be so quick to bury louiss son i said id heard from louis as well as from my spy he has been half out of his mind with fear adding fairly as any father would be but it seems that st thomas came to him in a dream and told him that if he made a pilgrimage to canterbury philippe would recover needless to say when he suggested this to his council they were greatly dismayed and dismissed it out of hand henrys smile was sardonic my spy tells me they lectured louis that it would be utter madness to enter the lions den of his own free will the lion i suppose is me which might be considered a perverse sort of compliment be that as it may philippes condition continued to worsen and thomas paid louis two more nightly visits after the third dream he did what he ought to have done from the firstfound a kings backbone and told his council that he meant to make a canterbury pilgrimage their misgivings be damned and so he has written to me earnestly entreating me to issue a safe conduct so that he may come to england and pray for st thomas to spare his son there was a moment of astonished silence and then incredulous laughter for some reason willem said dryly a verse of scriptures comes to mind he that diggeth a pit shall fall into it and hamelin gleefully recited a proverb to the effect that revenge was a dish best eaten cold henry smiled ive always believed that the best way to deal with temptation was to yield to it so it came as a surprise to discover that it is not actually that difficult to tell satan to get behind me an interesting lesson to learn so late in life no hamelins mouth dropped open harry surely you are not saying that you might give louis a safe conduct yes i am henry said and saw that hamelin was not the only one to be gaping at him he had not expected to have to defend his decision but he said with rare patience it is too easy to put myself into louiss shoes if one of my sons were on his deathbed i would bargain with lucifer if i thought that would save him it is not the french king that i am accommodating hamelin it is a grieving father on august louis landed at dover where henry was waiting to welcome him and to escort him to canterbury it was the first time that a french monarch had ever set foot on english soil henry led willem into the cloisters of the cathedral hed sent willem to france with the safe conduct and this was the first time theyd had to talk since willem had returned to england with louis and the count of flanders it was a beautiful evening that twilight hour in which stars were just beginning to glimmer in the sky and the clouds still reflected the dying glow of the setting sun both men paused to breathe in the sweet cloverscented air listening as a passing bell chimed somewhere in town signaling that a parishioner had gone home to god henry came often to canterbury in the years since hed done penance at the archbishops tomb and he was always surprised that this place the scene of sacrilege and murder could seem like such a peaceful haven that the cathedral hed entered in such despair and dread could now be soothing to his soul i am on a rescue mission he confided to willem louiss physicians begged me to coax him into ending his penance they fear that he may become ill himself if he passes a second night fasting and praying i promised to do what i could for it would be rather awkward if he were to die whilst he was an honored guest of the english crown willem agreed that louis was too frail for severe mortification of the flesh and for a moment henry remembered what hed been told of thomas beckets selfabasement in the last years of his life baring his back thrice daily for scourging wearing a liceinfested hairshirt and braies spending hours on his knees or prone upon the stone floor as he offered up his prayers to the almighty even now five years after he and thomas had made their peace in that shadowed silent crypt henry found it difficult to reconcile the holy martyr with the worldly chancellor whod been his friend ere i go chasing after louis he said there is something i want to discuss with you willem i learned this morning that the count of aumale died on monday it was never comforting to hear of the passing of a man who was close in age to them and willem instinctively sought to distance them from the dead count saying he was not in the best of health was he i seem to recall that he was called guillaume le gros at least behind his back he was on the stout side henry allowed but it is not his sin of gluttony i want to talk about he had no son and his estates will pass to his daughter hawise it is my intention to give the girl to you willem willem was rarely taken by surprise but he was now kings were usually loath to give up the wardship of an heiress for that gave them control of her revenues and eventual marriage i am honored by your trust in me i will be greatly pleased to have the lass as my ward will do right by her you may be sure i am not offering you her wardship willem i am giving her to you in marriage henry said amused to see that hed managed to render the courtly urbane earl quite speechless for once willem was overwhelmed as earl of essex he need never have to beg his bread by the side of the road but his was not the wealthiest of earldoms guillaume of aumale had held extensive lands in yorkshire and other shires as well as his estates in normandy henry was offering him a great heiress as casually as if he were proffering a benefice to an improvident priest harry how can i ever thank you im sure ill think of something henry joked before saying quite seriously kings are not denied much in this life but their friendships are as scarce as hens teeth which is one reason why we rely so often upon kinsmenthough that obviously has its drawbacks too ive been luckier than most for ive had two men i could call friend you and thomas unable to resist teasing lets hope that our friendship ends better than mine and thomass did they laughed and embraced and henry then went off in search of louis in good spirits delighted to be able to reward willems loyalty as lavishly as he deserved entering the martyrs door into the choir he descended the steps into the crypt there he found the french king prostrating himself upon the tiles before st thomass tomb attended by one of his physicians the archbishop the new prior and several monks as soon as louiss prayer was done prior alan impressed henry by taking the initiative coming forward before the french king could begin another invocation he said quietly my liege king henry is here louis glanced up squinting in the dim light and henry was struck anew by how feeble he looked louis was twelve years his senior which put him in his late fifties but if henry had not known that hed have assumed that the french king had easily reached his biblical three score years and ten even allowing for the stress of philippes illness louis seemed to be carrying the weight of the world upon his stooped shoulders reaching out his hand henry helped the other man to rise you have been keeping this vigil since your arrival yesterday for a day and a night now you have done nothing but fast and pray st thomas will not take it amiss if you get a few hours sleep louis would have demurred but henry did not give him the chance what did thomas say to you in those dreams i assume you remember of course i do he said our lord jesus christ sends me as your servant thomas the martyr of canterbury in order that you should go to canterbury if your son is to recover as i suspected he said not a word about your sacrificing your life for your sons youll do philippe no good by dying at canterbury if youll not rest for your own sake do it for mine louis spare me the embarrassment of having to explain to the rest of christendom that the first french king to visit english shores did not make it home alive henry had long ago concluded that louis did not have a humorous bone in his body but the french king was still able to recognize humor in others and he mustered up a wan smile you are right he admitted i am indeed boneweary and in need of sleep looking vastly relieved his physician started toward him before he could change his mind but he held up his hand and slipping his arm in henrys drew him aside henry did not resist startled by how heavily louis was leaning upon him for support you have been very kind harry but i must impose upon your kindness by seeking yet another favor from you i would ask that you add your prayers to mine that you entreat the blessed martyr to save my son st thomas showed himself willing to perform a miracle on your behalf so i think yours would be the voice hed be most likely to heed henry managed to keep his face impassive and he would later consider that a remarkable accomplishment i will pray to st thomas for your son he promised the french king after taking a moment to savor the irony of louiss request and watched bemused as the older man let his physician lead him from the crypt archbishop richard and the others accompanied louis but one of the monks lingered behind should you wish some time for private prayer my liege yes brother bertram i would henry confirmed for this had become his practice upon his visits to canterbury he waited until the monks footsteps receded before walking over to the martyrs tomb well i suppose you heard that thomas he said breezily for that is what his talks with thomas were conversations rather than prayers hed discovered that he could unburden himself to the dead far easier than he could with the living the thomas he confided in was the friend hed lost to the church somehow restored to him by his anguish in this crypt and the victory at alnwick a miracle so manifest that not even the french king could doubt it i hope that youll show mercy to louis if you could snatch a king and scatter a fleet curing a skinny skittish whelp like philippe ought to be childs play and yes thomas i daresay youre marveling at how magnanimous ive become in my old age you need not fret for i have no yearning for sainthood am not poaching in your woods henry cocked his head half listening for a response i admit itmy own interests are invested in philippes recovery louis does not look as if he is long for this world and id rather my son face a stripling like philippe than henri of champagne or thibault of blois christ help him thomas for either one of them would eat hal alive there was a relief in being able to confess his doubts about his eldests capacity for kingship in the past few years hed occasionally asked thomas for guidance entreated him to show hal the way home to restore the laughing fairhaired lad of cherished memory not the sullen erratic stranger hed become but tonight his prayers were only for philippe capet and he said softly i never thought id pity that fool on the french throne thomas fathers and sonsmayhap you were wise to choose the church he paused then for hed caught the sound of sandals on the crypt stairs my lord king may i approach brother bertram hovered in the doorway loath to intrude upon his sovereigns prayers your son has just ridden in my liege and is asking to see you straightaway is it your wish that i send him down of course the monk retreated before henry could ask the identity of this son and as he waited he entertained himself by trying to guess which one it might be not johnny not richard either for it would not even occur to him to ask for permission hed just sweep on into the crypt nor would hal have sought permission his innate good manners had succumbed to a more pressing needto show the world that he was a king in deed as well as name his fathers equal in all matters so that left one of his geoffreys he concluded and was pleased to be proven right a few moments later when geoff came into view what a welcome surprise geoff when did you get back to england struck by a sudden ominous thought he did not wait for his sons reply you are not bringing word that philippe has died and when geoff shook his head he sighed with relief thank god for that i do not see myself as craven but i would not want to be the one to tell louis that his son was dead i came straight from tours did not even know philippe was ailing until i landed at southampton it was good of you papa to let the french king make this pilgrimage when i think of all he did to turn your sons against you i would not have been so generous not all of my sons geoffnot you henry said fondly but as he studied the young man he felt a prickle of unease you may not be bearing sad tidings about philippe lad but youve come to tell me something id rather not hear geoff blinked how did you guess can you read my mind no but i can read your face what is it geoff my news is indeed sad papa on august the bishop of worcester died at tours henry sucked in his breath roger god in heaven he turned aside as he fought to get his emotions under control and then sat down heavily upon the closest seat which happened to be the archbishops tomb geoff took an anxious step forward remembering that st thomas had punished a young boy for falling asleep against his shrine but he decided then that the martyr was willing to allow his father liberties that hed deny to other men and came forward dropping his hand to henrys shoulder in a mute gesture of comfort tell me henry said huskily how he died the archbishop of tours was accompanying roger to rome for the lateran council but he fell ill in paris and had to turn back geoff said dutifully for hed been rehearsing this speech since he left tours upon his return from rome roger journeyed to tours to see how the archbishop was faring he became ill himself soon after his arrival and died at the abbey of marmoutier not long afterward he was buried with great honors in the abbey church of st martin one of the worlds bright lights has gone out henry said after a long silence my cousin was a good man and a brave one he alone dared to tell me that i was not blameless for thomass murder for he was never intimidated by my temper or my rank i remember your telling me of the time you and he quarreled on the road over thomas and over hals coronation you said that when you shouted at him he shouted right back and when some of your courtiers sought to curry favor with you by denouncing him you flew into a rage saying do you think you villains that if i say what i please to my cousin you and the rest can insult him and you and roger then rode off in perfect harmony henry nodded i remember that day well i remember too another time that we quarreled because of thomas hed excommunicated my chancellor geoffrey ridel and of course that meant other christians could not consort with him when roger encountered ridel during mass he turned around and walked out i was angry that he was heeding thomas and not me i lost my temper geoff and ordered him from my domains another man would have tried to make peace to beg my pardon roger said his foot was already in the stirrup and stalked off i soon calmed down and sent a messenger to recall him but damned if he would come it took three messages ere hed deign to return and i had to make sure that geoffrey ridel did not come into his presence for the remainder of his stay henry smiled sadly i often thought that it was a pity hed not been my uncle roberts eldest son instead of his youngest for hed have made a far better earl of gloucester than that boneheaded william but then that would have been a great loss to the church henry had dropped his head into his hands when he looked up geoff saw that his eyes were wet did i ever tell you my favorite story about my cousin lad roger was on his way to see me when he came upon two wretches being held outside under armed guard he always had a cats curiosity and stopped to see what was happening he was told that these men had gotten drunk in an eastcheap tavern and uttered words insulting to the king they had sobered up by now and were scared out of their wits roger told them to deny nothing to admit what theyd said and plead for mercy geoff had never heard this story and he said what happened then henry grinned they were brought before me and freely confessed that theyd called me evil tempered and a miser who wanted to tax londoners of their last drop of blood whilst i was considering this one of them added and that was nothing to what we would have said if the wine had not run out of course i laughed and then sent them on their way roger later denied that hed put words in their mouth but that sounded so like him that i never believed it geoff grinned too that does sound like cousin roger he said chiming in with a story of his own about the bishops daggersharp humor and they stayed for a time in the cathedral crypt mourning roger the way he would have wantedlaughing through tears philippe recovered from his illness and was crowned at rheims by his uncle the archbishop on all saints day henrys three oldest sons attended the coronation hal carried the crown for his young brotherinlaw and then held it steady for philippe during the ceremony once he realized it was too heavy for the boy but louis could not attend hed suffered a stroke soon after his return to france one which left him unable to speak and partially paralyzed chapter thirty april reading england upon learning that geoffrey would be returning to england that spring ranulf and rhiannon decided to make the long journey from wales for theyd not seen morgan in more than a year since henry published his itinerary a month in advance they knew hed be at reading and arrived at the cluniac abbey of st mary and st john the evangelist on an overcast afternoon in early april ranulf rose early the next morning as was his habit choosing to let his wife sleep in for it had been an arduous trip for them both he was sixtyone now and rhiannon only a few years younger and he knew the day would be coming when theyd not be able to chase after their son or the king like this upon his entry into the guest hall he was delighted to be told that hal and geoffrey had arrived late the night before after he and rhiannon had retired and instead of breaking his fast he went in search of his son he had no luck until he found will marshal in affable conversation with abbot joseph morgan was with the king they told him he had offered to show his young kinsman their family tombs for not only was the abbeys founder henrys grandfather of blessed memory buried here so was the son whod died at age three and more recently the earl of cornwall ranulf headed for the gatehouse that connected the north and south garths and entered the church not finding henry and morgan within he lingered long enough to say a prayer at his brother rainalds tomb thinking that the most burdensome aspect of aging was that a man had to bury so many of his friends and loved ones exiting via a side door into the cloisters he came upon his son and nephew they were laughing together in one of the carrels tossing a coin back and forth at the sight of his father morgan hastened over to enfold ranulf in a boisterous embrace the latter was startled to realize that morgan was now the taller of the two the king has been telling me about the new silver penny morgan exclaimed with the enthusiasm that was a large part of his charm he was invariably curious about all things great and small he showed his father the coin with a short cross on one side and on the reverse the kings crowned head under the inscription henricus rex this is one of the first to be struck as they are not to be exchanged for the old coins until martinmas he says i can keep it too so ill have the only one in england for the next seven months he paused then to glance questioningly back at henry it seems like a lot of work and trouble my lord why not just continue using the old coins over time they become debased morgan henry explained knaves file the edges off the coins and melt the clippings down to make counterfeit coins so they are not worth as much sometimes too the moneyers who operate the mints cheat mixing the silver with cheaper metals when they make the pennies coin clipping is a serious offense and those caught pay dearly for it but greed can entice men into all sorts of lunacy ranulf inspected the new penny since no welsh princes minted their own money these coins would be circulating in wales too i appreciate your tutoring morgan in money matters harry he joked unable to resist teasing his son judging from the way he spends he needs all the lessons he can get all of todays youth are moneymad henry said cheerfully compared to my lads though morgan is as frugal as a cistercian monk morgan smiled dutifully for he knew he was expected to acknowledge adult humor no matter how lame and ranulf felt a surge of pride in his sons good manners when he suggested that morgan go to the guest house and greet his mother the youth still remembered to excuse himself politely before he went dashing off to find rhiannon he is growing up so quickly ranulf said his the bittersweet satisfaction of a father recognizing that his son is fast approaching the borders of manhood be thankful for it uncle lads his age are vulnerable to so muchtheir own foolhardy impulses and even worse the calculating flattery of men eager to take advantage of their youth and inexperience ranulf assumed henry was thinking of his own wayward sons and made a sympathetic murmur of agreement all the while hoping that morgan would show better judgment than his royal cousins but then henry said that philippes youthful mistakes were likely to haunt him well into his manhood if something was not done and ranulf realized that he was speaking of the fourteenyearold french king not hal and his brothers i did not know about the french unrest ranulf said until we stopped in chester to ask maud to accompany us the only news that had trickled into wales was of louiss apoplectic seizure and philippes lavish coronation i wish you could have persuaded maud to come with you she took rogers loss very hard ranulf said quietly and henry nodded somberly saying that they all had ranulf still found it difficult to talk of rogers death and nudged the conversation back to the subject of the french turmoil maud told us that philip of flanders has been hovering over young philippe like a hungry hawk and philippe has stopped listening to anyone else including his mother and his uncles is it truly as bad as that worse henry said and as they began to stroll along the cloisters walkway he told ranulf about the troubles at the french court philippe is ruling as if his father were already dead with the everhelpful philip there as guide and tutor his first act was to dismiss all of louiss councilors and replace them with men of his choosingor philips depending upon whom you believe the lad is now in flanders with philip waiting until lent is over so that he may marry isabelle of hainault philips tenyearold niece ranulf whistled how did adele and her brothers react to that about as well as youd expect adele was so disquieted that she began to fortify her dower lands when philippe heard that he gave orders to seize her lands and she felt threatened enough to flee to her brother thibault in blois jesu ranulf whispered how could a family tear itself apart like this had the french learned nothing from harrys feuding with his sons poor louis wait until you hear the rest ranulf hal and geoffrey brought with them a truly amazing letter from the french queen adele and her brothers the archbishop of rheims and the counts of blois and sancerre entreating me to come to their aid ranulf was dumbfounded the houses of blois and anjou had been enemies even before stephen of blois had stolen the english crown from henrys mother that they should now be seeking to ally with englands king against their own son nephew and sovereign seemed utterly incomprehensible to him henry read his thoughts easily enough and smiled grimly i know uncle the world has gone mad i realized that as i stood in the crypt of canterbury cathedral and listened to the french king beg me to intercede with thomas after that i did not think anything would surprise me but i was wrong ranulf shook his head slowly what will you do harry damned if i know abbot joseph had turned over his private quarters to the king and henry and geoffrey were seated in the abbots bedchamber listening as hal raged about the shameful way louis was being treated they even took away louiss chancery seal papa so that he could not revoke any of philippes acts it is outrageous enough to dishonor an anointed king like that but the man is philippes father how can he be such an ungrateful wretch henry was beginning to think that he was the only one still able to recognize or appreciate irony but he noticed then that the corner of geoffreys mouth was twitching and it reassured him that at least one of his sons could see the madness of this moment as their eyes met geoffrey smiled and shrugged and to henry that rueful acknowledgment meant more than the formal public apologies hed gotten from his sons at michaelmas marguerite is distraught hal confided in truth the blame does not lie as much with philippe as it does with the count of flanders he has the boy doing his bidding as if philippe were one of his lackeys instead of the king of france it is pitiful like watching a fly caught in a spiders web henry had rarely seen his son so irate and he wondered how much of hals indignation was on marguerites behalf for he did not think hal was all that fond of his fatherinlaw you both have the advantage of me he said for you know philippe better than i do tell me more about him what sort of man is he likely to become an annoying one geoffrey drawled and hal grinned geoffs assessment is not kind he said but accurate of course in fairness to philippe he is young yet so there is still hope if i did not know he was fourteen though id swear he was forty for he is so very serious and earnest about everything and he can be a bit of a prig not only does he not curse he has actually forbidden swearing in public and anyone who does must pay a fine of twenty sous he is the only person ive ever metmale or femalewho is uneasy around horses he has shown no interest whatsoever in tournaments or music or jongleurs which baffles me exceedingly and he does not seem affectionate by nature at least not with his sisters for certes he has never shown much warmth to marguerite and marie thinks he is a horses arse henry had never met eleanors eldest daughter but he decided hed like her you are not painting a very appealing picture of the lad hal i suppose i am not hal conceded he does have his good qualities he is clever enough and well mannered and pious and he does not seem to hold grudges but he is also very naive putting his trust in philip proves that and so does the nonsense he believes about the jews do you know what he told me papa that the jews meet secretly in caves beneath paris where they sacrifice christian children henry blinked it had been his experience that only the uneducated believed the stories of ritual murder periodically raised against the jews id heard that he had the paris synagogues raided and seized all their property is that why he did it part of the reason geoffrey commented he also has a good eye for profit and he told me he plans to cancel all the debts that christians owe to jewish moneylenders whilst reserving to the crown onefifth of the amount he assured me though that he will be calculating the sum on the debt principal only not wanting to benefit by usury you are making him sound like a hypocrite hal protested and in this i do believe he is sincere that he well and truly hates the jews his father always protected them even protesting to the holy father when the last lateran council forbade jews to hire christian servants philippe is very critical of louiss leniency and he does not look kindly upon your policy toward the jews either papa he told me he disapproved greatly of your decision to allow english jews to be buried in other towns than london i daresay i can live with philippes disapproval henry said the jews often serve as bankers of the crown and louis understood that philippe will learn that lesson the hard be that as it may hal interrupted you must find a way to free philippe from philips baneful influence papa i promised marguerite that wed do what we could for her father hed moved to the open window and catching sight of several of his knights crossing the garth he found a reason to excuse himself and was soon striding out into the sunlight calling to will marshal and peter fitz guy henry was pleased when geoffrey remained for he wanted to get his younger sons views of the french crisis you did not say that much he observed and geoffrey smiled saying that few men could compete with hal or richard in laying claim to a conversation it did surprise me henry admitted to hear hal speak so harshly of philip of flanders id not go so far as to say hal idolized the man but he did seem rather fond of the ground upon which he walked so this is quite a reversal geoffrey was laughing have you ever known a spurned lover to take rejection well philip spent years cultivating hals good will for certes he did not pay for hals tournament expenses out of the goodness of his heart hals nose is out of joint because philip has dropped him like a hot coal in favor of a more promising prospect young philippe henry frowned for he did not want to see hals outrage as personal pique that implied hals sense of justice was only engaged when his selfinterest was why was it that his sons were so critical of one another do you agree with hals appraisal of philippe yesup to a point i think hal is too quick to put all the blame on philip philippe may be callow and god knows he lacks hals style or richards swagger but he is no mans fool and no mans puppet he knows his own mind papa i do not believe hed have heeded philip unless he also believed that his uncles exercised too much influence at louiss court paris is rife with rumors that philippe means to take the seneschalship away from thibault and bestow it instead upon philip but if there is any truth in that it would be like ridding your woods of foxes by bringing in a pack of wolves henry leaned back in his seat his expression pensive men have always observed how closely hal resembles my father and he does have the same coloring and features but i think you are the one who is most like him geoffrey glanced up with a surprised smile i take that as a compliment you should for ive known few men as shrewd or as astute as my father it is not too much to say i owe him my kingship it is true that my blood claim came from my mother but if my father had not won normandy at the point of a sword i may not have been able to win the english crown because he did take normandy and then turned it over to me stephens barons were forced to choose between their english and norman estates and his support began to bleed away at the very least i doubt maman would have agreed to wed you if you were not already duke of normandy and not merely the count of anjous heir geoffrey said daringly and was both pleased and relieved when henry laughed youve got my fathers sense of humor too lad he always had a feel for the vitals as far back as he could remember geoffrey had looked at his world with oddly dispassionate eyes sometimes he felt as if he were watching someone elses life he knew that he was about to make a mistake but hed never before experienced a moment of emotional intimacy like this with his father and he could not help himself you were not yet seventeen when he handed normandy over to you henry stiffened for he knew where this was going that ground has been ploughed over and over again lad but i need to know to understand your father could have held on to normandy until you were of age and few would have blamed him why can you not do the same for me and my brothers because henry broke off and shook his head let it be geoffrey geoffrey couldnt papa i need to know becausebecause i cannot trust you and your brothers the way my father could trust me the bitter words were no sooner out of henrys mouth than he wished he could call them back i did not want to say that he said at last but you kept pushing i wanted an honest answer geoffrey said slowly and you gave me one ive no cause for complaint but even as he sought to make light of it he was shaken for hed recognized a truth that did not bode well for the future the wound inflicted upon his father by their rebellion had not healed would never heal and that meant his father would never be willing to share power not until he drew his last mortal breath philippes relationship with his family and nobles continued to deteriorate as more and more of his barons became alarmed at the influence wielded by the count of flanders philippe had announced plans to have his new queen crowned with him that june on whitsunday but philip advised him to have the coronation performed earlier so that none could hinder it and philippe and isabelle were secretly crowned by the archbishop of sens at the abbey of stdenis on ascension day as french kings were traditionally crowned only by the archbishop of rheims philippes uncle was outraged by the slight and war seemed more and more likely until henry persuaded the young french king and the count to meet him near gisors in late june the day was hot and despite the shade offered by the tree known as the peace elm the men were soon sweating henry found himself reminded of the many times he and louis had assembled here in past years it seemed strange to see louiss place taken by this fledgling philippe was still two months shy of his fifteenth birthday still in that awkward gangling stage his pallor hinting at his serious illness last summer his face framed by a halo of tousled brown hair bristling like a hedgehogs quills henry could see little of louis in the boy henrys patience was fast fraying for hed made what he considered a very fair offer agreeing to make peace with philippe upon the same terms that he and louis had accepted three years earlier at ivry he knew hed surprised them for he was known to take ruthless advantage of an adversarys weaknesses and philippes vulnerabilities would have been obvious to a blind man they were quite willing to avoid hostilities with england but they were balking at one of his conditionsthat philippe reconcile with his mother queen adele and her brothers philippe was letting philip do most of the talking but he was watching henry intently taking in every word every gesture unlike his father his face was not a window to his soul and henry noted approvingly that it was impossible to know what he was thinking for that was a valuable skill in a king one hal had so far failed to master much to his disappointment glancing up at the sun he measured the passing time and then said in an abrupt change of tone i think it will be in all our interests if we speak frankly cast aside the ambiguous elusive language of statecraft i need not point out my lord philippe that you may be facing the devil dogs of rebellion and war if an accommodation is not reached with me and your royal kinsmen that would not be an auspicious way to begin your reign and you take the risk that i may not always be feeling so benevolent the time might well come when i can no longer resist the temptation to profit at the expense of your youth and family troubles philippes eyes flickered but he showed no other reaction philip was scowling openly is that meant as a threat a threat a warning call it what you will henry said and then like the others he was turning to watch the approaching riders as they drew nearer it became evident that one of them was a woman and when philippes face suddenly flamed with color henry hid a smile knowing that the young king had recognized his mother sauntering over he gallantly helped the french queen to dismount adele of blois had been only fifteen when shed wed louis and twenty years later she was still a strikingly handsome woman moving toward her son she made a graceful curtsy my lord king and when she added my son philippe no longer looked like the ruler of a great realm more like an errant youngster whose sins were about to be made public i thought it was time henry said blandly for mother and son to talk facetoface without intermediaries or mediators draping his arm around philips shoulders he suggested that they go for a walk in order to give the french king and queen some privacy the flemish counts body was rigid resistant but henry was not to be denied and philip reluctantly let himself be led away once he realized that it would take physical force to disengage the english kings grip lets get out of the sun henry said amiably so we can talk candidly moving into the shadows of a leafy willow tree he leaned comfortably against the trunk as he regarded the count of flanders i cannot say i blame you cousin a gyrfalcon coming across a newborn lamb alone and unprotected will want to make a meal of it but once the gyrfalcon realizes that the flocks ram is close at hand it flies off in search of easier prey very amusing philip said coldly you are enjoying this actually i am there are times when the exercise of power can be very gratifying philip i am philippes godfather and now his uncle by marriage that gives me the right to offer him advice and counsel and comfort need i remind you that your mother and my father were sister and brother that makes us first cousins but that would hardly give me the right to meddle in flemish affairs would it i know what i can get from philippe what can i get from you cousin we once had an agreement under which i paid you a yearly fiefrent of one thousand pounds in return for the service of five hundred of your knights i am willing to renew that agreement philip considered the offer why should i settle for that when i can obtain so much more enough about offers and profits and benefits cousin lets speak instead of debts of what is owed there was no longer any amusement in henrys voice for years you did all you could to estrange me from my eldest son you owe me a blood debt my lord count but until now i have made no effort to collect it you might want to think about that think about it long and hard philip was ten years henrys junior had effectively ruled flanders since he was philippes age renowned for his knightly prowess on the battlefield and in the tournament he was not a man who was easily intimidated but he was also a realist one whod always known when it was time to fish and time to cut bait correctly interpreting his silence henry said i think we understand each other shall we go back and see how the family reunion is going emerging from the willows screen they walked without speaking for several moments they were soon close enough to see that philippe and adele had drawn apart from the others and were conferring quietly together their faces earnest and intent seeing the last of his hopes fluttering away on the wind philip came to a sudden halt at least you can tell me why you are doing this for louiss son i am entitled to that much henry had stopped too because he said there were none to do this for my sons louis capet seventh of that name to rule france died on september of that year at barbeau the cistercian abbey hed founded and philippes reign officially began chapter thirtyone july winchester england eleanor had just finished dictating a letter to a scribe thank you edwin she said and as he departed she exchanged a look of amused understanding with amaria both of them sharing the same thought that her circumstances had definitely taken a turn for the better she was permitted to write and even to receive letters now although she was sure that they were read before being dispatched or delivered henry had named ralf de glanville as his new justiciar and she was technically in his custody although ralph fitz stephen continued in his role as her warden shed confided in amaria that she suspected de glanville was interpreting the rules of confinement as generously as possible for hed struck her as a highly capable man with an eye for the main chance one too shrewd to make an enemy of their future kings mother i was writing to my daughter in castile she told amaria not yet twenty and already the mother of two my grandchildren are certainly getting singular names berengaria and sancho richenza lothair and otto she wondered if thered ever be an eleanor hal would name a daughter after her if harry was dead but would he dare do so whilst his father lived richard would and geoffreymayhap her third son remained the one she found hardest to read we may as well go down to the great hall she said for the dinner hour is fast approaching amaria was helping her adjust her wimple when they heard footsteps in the stairwell and a moment later the countess of chester was announced eleanors delighted smile faded at the sight of her friends face maud what is wrong mauds eyes filled with tears my soneleanor my son is dead drink this dearest eleanor urged amaria fetched it from the buttery just for you shed held the other woman as maud wept knowing there were no words to ease so great a grief when maud felt like talking she listened when she did not eleanor kept silent and gradually the story emerged hugh had taken ill soon after easter and his condition steadily worsened he died a fortnight ago at his manor in staffordshire only in his thirtyfourth year leaving a young widow an elevenyearold son and four daughters death came for them all in gods time but eleanor thought it was harder to accept when it came in a mans prime parents should not outlive their children ive done my share of mourning mauds sobs had subsided but tears still streaked her cheeks i lost my parents and my husband though widowhood was a blessing of sorts then roger was taken as were all of my brothers except will the worst of the lot until now i thought my greatest heartbreak was my son richard that he never lived to manhood but now hugh is gone too and all i have left is my daughter not so you have hughs children and bertrada for youve often said she is more like a daughter than a daughterinlaw she is going to need you maud with five children to raise on her own hugh had a fine crop of bastards too maud said smiling sadly four that he acknowledged as his hed want me to make sure they were taken care ofah eleanor how have you done it how have you survived nigh on eight years of confinement without going mad with grief or rage or sheer boredom teach me how dear friend teach me to accept gods will as you have done it is an ongoing struggle maud too often i have days in which my captivity seems to be harrys will not the almightys but i persevere for as a wise welshwoman once pointed out what other choice have i what choice do any of us have maud acknowledged and they talked for a while of her son finding comfort in memories of happier times they spoke too of eleanors first husband eleanor admitted that she prayed for louiss soul which convinced maud that she had indeed learned to let go of many of her earthly grudges eleanor also shared sad news of her own that her daughter marie had been widowed that february the count of champagne had been captured in the holy land and although the emperor of byzantium ransomed him his health had suffered in captivity and hed died on his way home to france enough maud cried at last no more talk of death or regrets or unhealed wounds tell me something cheerful something hopeful even if you have to make it up as it happens eleanor said with a sudden smile as luminous as her eyes i do have good newsa letter from my daughter joanna she is with child and maud discovered that she could take solace from that from this reassuring proof that the circle of life was eternal and her son hugh would live on in his children until the day that theyd be reunited at gods throne as morgan and his elder brother walked along the quays of the rouen waterfront they were attracting glances from passersby and bleddyn finally noticed these norman maidens are bold ones he joked for they are definitely looking you over lad morgan grinned ill not deny that women find me irresistible but youre the one drawing all the attention they are not accustomed to seeing men with mustaches but no beards are doubtless wondering what odd and alien land you come from passing strange that you should say that morgan for i find the sight of your beard to be just as odd who knew you were old enough to shave clearly your memory is failing in your old age morgan shot back if youve forgotten that i turned seventeen in february as much as he was enjoying this brotherly banter he was somewhat surprised by it too bleddyn was almost thirteen years his elder and theyd never before bandied jests and gibes as equals so he was particularly pleased that his brother was no longer treating him like a fledgling newly fallen from the nest when bleddyn had first sought him out at the castle hed gone cold with fear terrified that he was bringing word of a family tragedy to his vast relief bleddyn assured him that their parents were quite well he was here with the lady emma who had stopped in rouen on her way to visit her young son at laval morgan had been astonished to learn that bleddyn was now serving emmas husband given the longstanding hostility between davydd ab owain and their father bleddyn had laughed at his surprise assuring him that davydd was actively pursuing friendly relations with the english crown and ranulfs status as the kings favorite uncle mattered more than his past friendship with davydds slain brother hywel nor did he see any difference between his serving the prince of north wales and morgans serving the english kings son hed pointed out dryly and morgan had conceded defeat stopped bedeviling bleddyn about the loathsome davydd and took him out to see the city of rouen so far hed shown bleddyn the marketplace the partially completed cathedral the archbishops palace and the belfry tower from which two alert monks had spotted the french kings sneak attack and rang the great bell rouvel in time to alert the citizens and stave off attack until henry could come to their rescue bleddyn did not have any particular interest in norman towns but he was willing to indulge his young brother and listened patiently as morgan bragged about the leper hospital henry had built five years ago and the stone bridge paid for by his mother the empress maude and the fact that rouen had once been a roman outpost known as rotomagus but when morgan suggested that they visit the tomb of william the bastard in the abbey of st ouen bleddyn balked and expressed his desire to find a tavern the sooner the better thank god morgan exclaimed i could not take you to the most interesting neighborhoods for i doubt your wife would appreciate that so i had to make do with the marketplace and the churches coming to a halt he glanced around and then took bleddyns arm there is an excellent tavern up ahead but it is too close to the river renelle and the tanners quarter as good as their wine is it cannot compete with the stench i know another place though a bit on the shabby side but itll do us well enough and he led his brother into a maze of alleys showing such an intimate knowledge of the less reputable areas of the city that bleddyn realized his little brother was indeed growing up once they were seated at a corner table with two henaps of red wine morgan brought bleddyn up to date on the latest political news the king had expected to cross the channel after easter but then philip of flanders had besieged a french castle hed met the flemish count and the young french king at gisors again managed to persuade philip to withdraw his forces and was now on his way to cherbourg with the scots king where he planned to sail for england just missing the lady emma by a few days bleddyn doubted that the lady emma was heartbroken by that for time had not reconciled her to living in wales so what is this i hear about a great row between the king and your lord since geoffrey has been given permission to wed the breton heiress what other grievances does he have they made peace ere the king departed rouen but geoffrey has good reasons for his discontent morgan took a swallow of wine then lowered his voice even though they were speaking in welsh i am guessing you are not that familiar with breton affairs he said and laughed when bleddyn insisted that brittany claimed his last thought upon retiring at night and his first upon awakening in the morning well breton history is complicated so bear with me the king initially supported constances father conan in his fight for the duchy with his stepfather but conan could not keep the peace and as his liege lord cousin harry finally grew tired of putting out breton fires so fifteen years ago he forced conan to abdicate and betrothed constance to geoffrey although he did allow conan to keep his vast english estates youre probably wondering why he had english lands it is because his father was the earl of richmond his claim to brittany came through his mother when conan died five years later the honour of richmond then became part of constances inheritance bleddyns eyes were glazing over but he nodded attentively and morgan continued then there is the county of nantes it was once ruled by the breton dukes but twentysome years ago the people rebelled and offered it to cousin harrys brother geoffrey but he died suddenly two years later and both conan and harry claimed nantes conan because it had once been ruled by his uncle and harry because he was his brothers legal heir not surprisingly the king won that dispute bleddyn was beginning to see which way the wind was blowing for it was his experience that welsh and english rulers shared the same vicesa hunger for more than they already had so the bone of contention between henry and geoffrey is either nantes or richmond depending upon which one the king is holding back i think geoffrey expected that much knowing his father as he does but he was not expecting cousin harry to hold on to both of them for that is twothirds of constances inheritance geoffrey does not often lose his temper but when he learned that hed get neither nantes nor richmond he flew into a rage it availed him naught though for the king remained adamant and eventually they patched up their quarrel but he let his words trail off busied himself in finishing his wine bleddyn thought that morgan was bound to be torn in his loyalties and said encouragingly think of me as your confessor your secrets will be safe with me for who am i going to tellwelsh sheep morgan did need to discuss this and he smiled gratefully at his brother the king has been very good to me bleddyn i did not see him all that often of course but he always took an interest in my education always made me feel welcome it is different though with geoffrey as his squire i see him every day and he treats me as his cousin not just as a retainer it troubled me greatly to see him so distraught over this id never seen him so angry before he even said what did he say morgan he said that much of the blame lay with his grandmother the empress maude he claimed that she taught cousin harry to treat men the way a wild hawk was tamed by offering it meat and then snatching it away ere the hawk could eat well that method is said to work with hawks making them more obedient and biddable whether it works as well with sons remains to be seen bleddyn set his henap down barely touched listen lad i was not entirely candid with you earlier i offered to be part of lady emmas escort and i did so because i wanted the chance to talk with you about your future morgan was flattered but puzzled too i daresay you have a wealth of advice to share with me big brothers always do but you could not entrust it to a letter no it needed to be done in person morgan i have misgivings about the path youre following i know what it is like to be the proverbial fish out of water neither fully welsh nor truly english when i was nineteen i chose the welsh way cast aside gilbert fitz ranulf and became bleddyn ap ranulf you were too young to remember but it caused serious dissension between our father and me as he saw it i was rejecting his heritage rejecting him we eventually made our peace but i hurt him and i was sorry for it it was the only path for me though and ive never regretted it morgan was genuinely bewildered i am glad of that but what does this have to do with me it is not easy for us lad to be stranded between two worlds the sad truth is that we can never feel completely comfortable in either world you are threequarters welsh and onequarter normanfrench i want you to be sure you are making the right choice taking the road that is right for you and i fear that you are letting yourself be borne along by the wind your decisions made by chance or convenience you need to think seriously about what you want from this life not what papa wants for you what you want morgan morgan was astonished papa is not forcing me to this bleddyn i like being at the english court and i have never felt as if i were stranded between two worlds that is your truth not mine i consider myself blessed to have both norman and welsh blood flowing through my veins have never seen it as a burden bleddyn was equally astonished for it had not occurred to him that his brother might not share his confusion his conflicted sense of identity are you sure lad and when morgan swore he was the older man could only shake his head in rueful bafflement well now i feel like a fool here i was rushing off to save my little brother from pirates only to find that he fancies being a pirate himself morgan burst out laughing our cousin harry has been called many things in his life but i think it is safe to say that you are the first to brand him as a pirate he set himself then to dispelling his brothers discomfort joking and teasing until bleddyn was laughing too he was warmed by this dramatic display of family love and loyalty and he found himself feeling sorry for his royal cousins who knew nothing of brotherly solidarity but afterward when he marveled how he and bleddyn could drink from the same cup and yet find the taste so very different he finally began to understand why the king and his sons seemed unable to reach common ground no matter how they tried constances wedding was just as unpleasant as shed always expected it to be in fact it was even worse for shed never anticipated that her mother would not be in attendance widowed by the death of constances father ten years ago her mother margaret had wed an english baron three years later constance had been glad of the remarriage for it was so much easier to see her mother once they both dwelled on the english side of the channel but now margarets english residency worked to her daughters disadvantage for when constance was summoned to rouen on such short notice and told that she was to marry geoffrey as soon as possible there was no time for margaret to make the trip too constance had only one small consolation that her wedding was not taking place in normandy when she learned that the english king was not going to ease his grasp on either nantes or the honour of richmond her longsmoldering resentment had flared into outright fury she did not trust herself to sit beside henry at her wedding feast exchanging pleasantries with the man whod ruined her father and now sought to rob her of her rightful inheritance and the thought of him being present at the beddingdown revelries was even more distasteful to her in desperation she had asked geoffrey if they could be married in brittany and to her amazement he readily agreed even more surprising to her so did his father it was only later that she realized why they were willing to be so accommodatingbecause the wedding itself was meaningless to them they cared only for the legal rights that geoffrey would acquire once he made her his wife shed suggested that the wedding be held in the castle of one of her most loyal barons andre de vitre only to learn that andre had recently left on pilgrimage to the holy land before she could despair though geoffrey brought her remarkable news raoul de fougeres was willing to act as host knowing that raoul shared her loathing for the english crown she was morbidly curious as to how theyd compelled his cooperation and so it was that geoffrey and constance exchanged vows on the porch of st leonards church in fougeres for weddings were commonly held in public to guarantee as many witnesses as possible to the union after they entered the church for the mass conducted by the bishop of rennes they were then escorted through the steep streets of the town and back to the great hall of the castle which had only recently risen from the ashes of a crushing defeat fifteen years earlier henry had captured the supposedly invincible stronghold and razed it to the ground the day had been one of humid august heat and even as twilight slowly trickled into the river valley the suns warmth still lingered turning the hall into a sweltering cauldron constance was pleased to find that it was essentially an allbreton affair for shed been given no voice in the hasty preparations andre de vitre was absent of course but his wife matilda de mayenne was present as were the most prominent of the breton barons no less than three bishops were in attendance as were the abbot of holy trinity and robert de torigny the venerable abbot of mont st michel geoffreys mentor roland de dinan had been invited as were a number of men whod been familiar presences at constances fathers court and constance was relieved that no needless slights had been offered for her breton lords were as touchy and hightempered as their more notorious neighbors in poitou when she learned that the wedding guest list was geoffreys doing she grudgingly gave him credit where due even though she was not inclined to look kindly upon her new husband the most favorable thing she could say about him was that at least he was not richard or hal however hed been coerced into it raoul de fougeres had spared neither expense nor effort and the great hall was richly decorated with fresh rushes upon the floor white linen tablecloths draped over the trestle tables and cinnamon and cloves burned to combat the ripe smells of summer and sweat and spilled wine for the wedding guests were happily doing their best to drain raouls wine kegs dry so was her groom when hed given her the kiss of peace at the conclusion of the mass geoffrey had already tasted of wine which was one more grievance to hold against him for constance did not dare to follow his example too much wine might loosen her tongue and that was not a risk she was willing to take she was yoked to this man for the rest of her earthly days and it would be the height of folly to antagonize him from the very outset of their marriage she did her best to play the role that had been forced upon her smiling and accepting congratulations and demurely turning her cheek for the bridal kisses pressed upon her by the increasingly inebriated male guests afterward there was dancing and entertainment by a rising young troubadour star bertran de born who interspersed his own songs with the bawdy poetry of geoffreys greatgrandfather count william of aquitaine the verses were explicit enough to cause the bishops some discomfort but constance kept a smile upon her face even as she felt her cheeks growing hot she was not prudish not easily shocked but she still had the beddingdown revelries to get through and was in no mood to appreciate ribald lyrics or the drunken cheering of the men whod soon be crowding around her marriage bed eventually the interminable evening came to an end and she and geoffrey were escorted across the bailey to their bridal chamber in the northwest tower they knelt by the bed for the bishops blessing were sprinkled with holy water as he prayed that their marriage would be fruitful and find favor in the eyes of the lord clerics often reminded newlyweds that they ought not to consummate their marriage that first night spending it instead in prayer and meditation but the bishop of rennes was a realist and omitted an admonishment that he knew was so rarely heeded the men then trooped out noisily so that constance could be made ready for her husband the women guests clustered around the bride helping her to undress brushing out her long dark hair and dousing her in so much perfume that she had a coughing fit at last they departed leaving her alone with her two handmaidens juvette and blanche and enora her childhood nurse this was not unusual she knew that both marguerite and alys were still served by women whod tended to them in their cradles but she assumed that the french kings sisters were fond of their longtime companions and she found enora to be a vexing foolish creature prone to fluttering about and clucking like a mother hen shed promised herself that once she was the duchess of brittany shed send the old woman to live in her mothers household but for now she had to grit her teeth as enora prattled on about how beautiful she looked and how lucky she was for lord geoffrey was quite goodlooking even if not as spectacularly handsome as his brother the young king constance thought that she was attractive enough but she well knew she was not a great beauty nor did she much care if geoffrey had a fair face all that truly mattered was that he was the spawn of her enemy the english king her women exited when the men returned their arrival heralded by raucous singing and shouting and the lewd jests that were such an inevitable part of wedding festivities shielded behind the bed hangings constance lay very still she refused to admit she was nervous for she was no child she was twenty after all and she knew what to expect in the marriage bed but her breathing quickened as the humor grew cruder jokes about castles under siege and broken blades and the best way to mount a skittish mare and ride her bareback rolling over she clasped the pillow over her head so tightly that she could no longer hear their laughter she was startled therefore by a sudden burst of cursing followed by thumping noises good god were the fools brawling in her bedchamber it certainly sounded like it for voices were raised and there was a scuffling sound more swearing sitting up she scowled and reached for the bed curtains her first instinct to give the culprits a right sharp scolding but she thought better of it just in time geoffrey seemed to have the trouble well in hand for it sounded as if he were ejecting the mischiefmakers from the chamber with some help from the more sober members of the wedding party he got rid of them so fast in fact that she was taken by surprise when the bed hangings were suddenly yanked open her husband was standing there clad only in his linen shirt and braies holding out a brimming wine cup when she realized he was offering it to her she shook her head saying primly no thank you i am not thirsty he ignored her refusal and pressed the cup into her hand ive never seen a woman more in need of a drink darling this is a special wine i had brought in from my mothers lands in poitou i think youll like it once you try it constance was beginning to bristle not caring for his flippant tone in the least why would you think i need a drink i assure you that it is not so i am not at all nervous am quite prepared to do my duty as your wife i daresay you are and nothing stirs a mans lust more than the prospect of deflowering a woman resigned to doing her duty who could resist a temptation like that constances brows slanted down shed submit to his caresses but if he thought shed submit to his mockery too he was about to learn otherwise if your lust is lacking theres always greed just close your eyes and think of brittanys riches whilst you bed me she was sitting upright in the bed her hands clutching the sheet as if it were a shield against his anger but to her astonishment he gave a shout of laughter and her own anger was diluted now by bewilderment shed been betrothed to geoffrey since she was five and he was eight nevertheless she was realizing that this halfdressed man was a stranger she did not know him at all hellfire i forgot to lock the door careless of his near nudity he strode across the room and slid the bolt into place better safe than sorry sometimes drunken guests think it is a great joke to burst in upon the wedding couple at the most inopportune moment constance took a sip of the wine discovered that he was right she did like it what was all that squabbling about earlier oh that men playing the fool which doubtless does not surprise you any since you seem to hold such a high opinion of my sex juhel and herve got into a shoving match but gerard and i separated them ere any blood was shed she knew that juhel was raoul de fougeress son and herve was one of the breton knights in geoffreys retinue shed been surprised to note that almost all of his household knights were bretons like herve the frenchman gerard de fournival was one of the few exceptions i was pleased to see so many influential lords amongst our guestsreginald boterel roland de dinan and his adopted son alan de rohan even the de moulton twins you forgot nary a one hed moved to the table was reaching for a small coffer but at that he gave her a lazy smile over his shoulder must you sound so surprised ive spent most of the last six years in brittany id have to be feebleminded if i could not learn who mattered in all that time ah here it is coming back to the bed he held out a small package your brides gift darling constance undid the linen wrapping and shook out an ovalshaped object of silver gilt she recognized it at once and thought that geoffrey had not wasted any time in having his ducal seal made up but as she held it up to the light she saw that it bore the image of a female figure mantled in a long cloak holding a lily in one hand and a bird in the other she stopped breathing for a moment but she still did not believe it not until she read the engraved legend constancia dvccissa britannie comitissa richenvndie this is for me well id hate to think the image looks like me for mine i used the same design as your father did just changing the name would you believe i never had my own seal until now my lord father did not think i had need of one constance dampened down her rising excitement did he think to win her over with an empty gesture so now i will have a seal to confirm your acts how convenient the bed shifted as he sat down upon it and to validate your own acts governing brittany is likely to be as great a challenge as taming those lunatics in poitou and it will take us both to keep your breton barons from running roughshod over the chancery she was silent for several moments as she considered the implications of what hed just said absently sipping wine as she ran her fingers over the name carved into the seal mold what chancery she said cautiously it was abolished when my father abdicated and i plan to restore it straightaway in fact i intend to revive the ducal government as it was under your father some of my fathers innovations are worth retaining such as creating the office of seneschal for each of the breton counties but i know i can improve upon stop constance begged for the unreality of this conversation was affecting her as much as the wine did he mean any of this but what did he have to gain by lying to her he cocked his head regarding her quizzically and then he grinned i know strange talk for our wedding night it is just that ive been waiting so long and now we can start putting all these ideas into practiceat long last constance took another bracing swallow of wine surprised to discover that her cup was almost empty geoffrey reached over took the cup from her lax fingers and padded barefoot over to the table to refill it watching as he came back to the bed she said suspiciously are you trying to get me drunk settling down beside her again he passed her the cup if i were it would be a waste of wine you do not have to seduce me geoffrey im your wife now yes you are he said amiably but what if i want more than that she drank some more wine to cover her confusion what an ally he saw that she did not understand and sighed he rarely secondguessed himself but he started to do so now wondering if it would have been wiser to have waited until hed won her trust her cup was tipping precariously and he grabbed it before she could spill wine over them both i think youve had enough darling she thought so too for she was feeling lightheaded it was a strange sensation shed never even been tipsy before never willing to relinquish control what did you mean about us being allies i just think it would be a shame if we did not join forces for we want the same things somehow i doubt that geoffrey shall i tell you what your priorities are constance you want to keep brittany strong and prosperous and to protect it from your predatory neighborsthe french cub my brother richard and my esteemed sire oh yes and to provide an heir preferably two did i leave anything out when she slowly shook her head he said well those are my priorities too which is why it makes sense for us to unite i do not know that i can believe you she confessed vaguely aware that the wine was subverting her sense of caution you seem to be saying that youd put brittanys interests above those of your father and why would you do that because our interests are not identical even if he seems to think so i am his third son and brittany is all iwehave she wondered if it was the flickering candle flames for his eyes seemed to change color sometimes decidedly blue and at others very grey prove it to me then she challenged tell me how you got raoul de fougeres to agree to hold the wedding here i am sorry darling but i have no sordid secrets to reveal raoul was quite willing to do it needed no persuasion or extortion from me she felt a sharp throb of disappointment shed almost let herself be taken in by his honeyed tongue and easy smile i am not a fool geoffrey raoul hates the english king i daresay he does he said calmly but i am the duke of brittany while she was thinking that over he pulled his shirt over his head and she found herself paying sudden rapt attention to his bare torso the candlelight caught the golden glints in his chest hairs played upon the ripple of muscles as he slid next to her i am going to tell you something that no one else knows yet he murmured so close now that his breath was warm against her cheek i am going to dismiss roland de dinan for he is my fathers man not mine then i intend to create a new officeseneschal of brittanyand once i do i am offering it to raoul why she whispered they were lying together in the bed now and she was faintly surprised to find that her arms had slipped up around his neck that she was holding on to him as if he alone could anchor her to the earth as i told you darling because i seek allies wherever i can find them constance had never felt so relaxed so comfortable in her own body if this was what wine did shed been missing out on a lot i would suggest then that you begin looking in your bed an excellent suggestion he said and raised up on his elbow to shed his braies she moved over to make it easier for him why did you not take all your clothes off ere this we were interrupted by that brawl he reminded her and then i thought it best to wait after that not wanting to overwhelm you with my male magnificence right away when she laughed he said thank god you do have a sense of humor of course i do she said but her indignation was soon forgotten for hed begun to kiss her throat her inhibitions and her wariness had been dramatically diminished by the excellent wine of aquitaine and geoffreys intriguing candor and she delighted him by proving to be an apt pupil quite unlike the bride hed feared to be burdened with the indifferent inert virgin passively resigned to her fate this woman was warm and willing and eager to follow his guidance and he experienced far more pleasure than hed expected to find in her bed afterward he assured her drowsily that it would get better but she said she had no complaints and then gave him a promising sign that their marriage would be a successful one for she showed no inclination to talk as so many of his other bedmates did instead she curled up against his back and went to sleep she awoke the next morning just before dawn with a dull headache a dry mouth and total recall of the extraordinary events of her wedding night propping herself up on her elbow she studied the man beside her he looked younger in his sleep less guarded and she realized that the flighty enora was right after all her new husband was easy on the eye best of all he was quickwitted and clever and ambitious we will make effective partners we will be good for brittany and good for each other and who would ever have imagined it the sheet had slipped only partially covering him and she smiled at the sight of his earlymorning erection then slid over until their bodies were touching still halfasleep he responded at once to the soft female curves nestled against him and they were soon entwined together in a carnal embrace she suspected that hed begun making love to her without fully realizing who she was but she was not bothered by that she may have gone to her marriage bed a maiden but she was no wideeyed conventbred innocent she fully expected geoffrey to stray for that was the way of their world she felt confident though that he would never shame her by flaunting a concubine the way his father had flaunted rosamund clifford he was too shrewd to make a mistake like that and as she gave herself up to the moment to the sheer physical sensations that he was stirring with hot kisses and intimate caresses she discovered that hed been right it did get better henry had sailed for england in the belief that hed patched up a peace between philip of flanders and the young french king it was to be shortlived adele and her brother the archbishop of rheims had been reconciled with philippe because of henrys efforts but her other brothers thibault of blois and etienne count of sancerre were still disaffected in an act of utter cynicism they allied themselves with their former enemy philip against their nephew they were soon joined by the count of burgundy the counts of hainault and namur and philippes half sister marie regent for her fifteenyearold son the new count of champagne etienne was the first to strike occupying saintbrissonsurloire and then doing homage for it to the flemish count the hostile coalition was soon threatening philippes precarious hold on power and he appealed urgently to the english king for help once again henry proved to be philippes salvation providing military aid under the command of his own sons eleanor was jubilant when she learned that henry would be holding his christmas court that year at winchester for her last two christmases had been lonely ones with the royal court at nottingham and then angers but henry was back in england after more than fifteen months on the other side of the channel and her spirits soared at the prospect of seeing one or more of her sons she was to be disappointed though richard had remained in poitou hal and marguerite were visiting her brother the french king and geoffrey and constance were holding their first christmas court in rennes henrys son geoff had accompanied him as had john but geoff could barely bring himself to be civil to eleanor and john was her phantom son vanishing with breathtaking speed every time she got within ten feet of him somewhat to her surprise though henry was on his best behavior so attentive that she did not have time to dwell upon her discontent they enjoyed a pleasant supper as henry told her what he knew of constance and geoffreys wedding revealed that geoff had resigned as bishopelect of lincoln confessing that he did not think himself fit for such a high office and was now henrys chancellor and disclosed that richards betrothed alys would soon be residing at winchester as shed complained life was too lonely and dull at devizes castle henry also reported that richard had a tumultuous summer hed angered the citizens of limoges by insisting that the city walls be torn down and then found himself embroiled in strife with the brothers of the count of angouleme count vulgrin had died unexpectedly in june leaving only a small daughter and richard claimed her wardship and then announced that she would inherit angouleme which did not sit well with the counts kinsmen i would think not eleanor was taken aback for primogeniture was not the custom in aquitaine and vulgrins brothers would have expected to share his inheritance it sounded as if richard had poked a stick into a hive not the best way to obtain honey richard chased them out of angouleme and they took refuge with their half brother aimar in limoges theyve been joined by the count of perigord and several of his neighbors and will be plotting mischief in the coming year this is why richard did not join us in winchester for i know he wanted to see you eleanor looked at him with surprise and some misgivings why was he being so kind to her tonight when he proceeded to do his best to reassure her about the fledgling rebellion richard was facing lavishly praising their sons military skills she began to feel more and more uneasy it had been a long time since hed shown such solicitude for her peace of mind what was he up to now is it true that you sent our sons to philippes aid last month he smiled slightly so you heard about that did you philips flemings sacked noyon captured clermont and senlis and actually got within fifteen miles of paris by then i was back in england so i dispatched hal and richard and geoffrey and they were quite successful soon had philip and his allies on the run eleanor gazed at him in bemusement three times hed acted to salvage philippes budding kingship twice intervening personally to stave off disaster and now this latest rescue name of god harry why can you not be as generous to your own sons as you are to louiss son the question never left her lips though she knew it would only destroy their newfound camaraderie for hers would be the last voice that hed ever heed when it came to their children henry stayed by her side after the meal was done chatting so easily that she saw they were being watchedand gossiped aboutby virtually every guest in the hall gossip that doubtless reached spectacular levels when henry accompanied her once she was ready to leave the festivities ice crunched underfoot as they walked across the bailey eleanor glanced over her shoulder at their footprints in the snow not sure how hed come to be escorting her back to her chamber she let henry keep up the conversation for her mind was racing as she tried to anticipate him to guess what his latest scheme was when henry actually offered an offhand apology for geoffs rudeness she was convinced that something was in the wind and decided to put her suspicions to the test i am not troubled by geoffs ill will harry i would be grateful though if you had a word with john on my behalf i tried all evening to speak with him to no avail can you assure him that the sky will not collapse if he exchanges a few civil words with me i suppose i could but you have our other lads dancing to your tune quite happily surely you can spare me one son eleanor she stopped abruptly and studied him there was just enough moonlight to catch the glimmer of a smile i think we need to talk lets go into the garden where we can be alone he didnt object and they crossed the bailey in silence opened the wicker gate and entered the gardens as shed expected none were about at that hour stopping by a bench henry cleared snow from it with the corner of his mantle for he only wore gloves when hunting he stayed on his feet though after seating eleanor you are right he said in a low voice we do need to talk shed thought that he had political intrigue in mind and needed her cooperation now though she felt a chill go up her spine utterly unrelated to the winter weather is this about one of our children it is not good is it no it is not you know that there has long been tension and suspicion between the holy roman emperor and our tildas husband it has now gotten much worse heinrich has been banished in disgrace compelled to leave germany as soon as i learned about this i sent willem to the emperor to argue on heinrichs behalf the most he could gain though was the reduction of heinrichs exile from seven years to three so he will be taking refuge at my court in the coming year and tilda and their children will accompany him that is indeed sad eleanor agreed but in truth she was somewhat relieved for shed feared more grievous news than that at least tilda and heinrich were well in no physical danger it is good that they have a shelter from this storm a place where they will be safe and welcome until the emperor can be placated and coaxed into ending the banishment and i confess that it will be wonderful to have tilda back and to see our grandchildren at last when he did not reply she said sharply i will be able to see them harry of course for the first time eleanor realized how cold it was in the garden rising she shook snow from her mantle smiling as a memory suddenly surfaced do you remember the time we were pelting each other with snowballs and your mother caught us at it she was horrified that we were acting in such an unseemly way where was thatrouen or caen rouen i think he sounded distracted as if he had other matters on his mind and she decided it was time to bring this surprising evening to an end while they were still on such amicable terms but when she suggested that they go indoors he made no move to leave eleanorthere is more i ought to have told you at once but i was too craven wanted to put it off as long as i could you are the least craven man in christendom she said but her voice was no longer steady for her fear had come flooding back whatwhat is it i had grievous news this week from sicily joanna gave birth to a son but he came too early he only lived long enough to be baptized oh no no this was not the first time that death had claimed a grandchild marguerite and hal were still mourning for their infant son and just that autumn eleanor had learned that the baby born earlier in the year to her daughter leonora had been found dead in his cradle but joannas heartbreak was harder for her to bear joanna was just sixteen why had god done this to her turning away blindly she would have stumbled and fallen if henry had not reached out swiftly to catch her putting his arm around her shaking shoulders he drew her to him and she wept against his chest wept for joanna and her baby son wept for herself too for her husband and their sons for their accursed ill luck and their deplorable blunders for all the evil that had overtaken their family chapter thirtytwo may winchester england the spring had been one of incessant rains and unrelenting bad news it began when eleanor learned that her sister petronillas elder daughter had died just before easter eleanor had told amaria about isabelles sad story shed been wed to philip of flanders at a very young age and their marriage had soured when shed been unable to give him an heir six years ago philip had accused her of adultery had her suspected lover beaten to death and compelled her to give him control of her inheritancethe french province of vermandois isabelles untimely death had greater significance therefore than merely the end of her misery for neither eleanor nor amaria doubted that philip had made her life a living hell now that she was dead vermandois should have passed to her younger sister alienor but alienors rights were ignored as vermandois became one more bone of contention between the count of flanders and the young french king both of whom claimed that rich county eleanor was infuriated that her niece had been treated so shabbily she could not help alienor though and that only added to her discontent eleanor was still fuming over her impotence when news came from poitou that richard was facing a formidable coalition of rebel lordsthe disinherited taillefer brothers of angouleme their half brother aimar viscount of limoges the count of perigord and the viscounts of ventadour comborn and turenne richard had as usual chosen to strike first and attacked the count of perigords castle of puystfront in perigueux but he did not have enough men with him to hold it and to amarias troubled eyes eleanor seemed to age years in the span of days her face pallid and drawn her appetite gone her sleep sporadic if amaria had doubted eleanors partiality for her second son those doubts were dispelled as she witnessed the depths of the queens fear for better or worse richard was closest to eleanors heart and now she could do nothing as he faced the most serious threat yet to his authority in aquitaine that morning they learned that ralf de glanville had ridden in the night before and eleanor made haste to seek him out for the justiciar had accompanied henry to normandy and he would be likely to have the latest word about the rebellion as she waited for eleanor to return amaria paced nervously unable to sit still for long to distract herself she even tried to pet the cat and shed never cared for felines considering them to be vexing odd creatures but cleo haughtily rebuffed her overtures and she resumed her pacing wondering how she could comfort eleanor if evil had befallen her favorite son when eleanor finally came back to their chamber though amaria knew at once that the news was good for the first time in weeks there was color in the queens cheeks and her eyes had lost that glazed inward look after instructing amaria to pour them some wine she sat down in the windowseat and shared what shed learned would you believe that harry is still acting as philippes guardian angel she marveled ralf said he met philip and philippe at senlis and patched up yet another peace between flanders and france he then headed south summoning the rebels to meet him at the abbey of grandmont in whitsun week he told ralf that if he could not end their rebellion by peaceful means he would then take the field with richard against them richard actually requested his support which shows how precarious his position had become my son does not easily ask for help harry told ralf to assure me that there was no further need for concern hed summoned geoffrey to grandmont too and he said that if the war continued hal would also join them in punishing the rebels madame that is wonderful news yes amaria it is it was a long time coming but at last the men in my family will be fighting on the same side the count of perigord had retaken his castle at puystfront after richards april seizure of the fortress and in june richard his father and his brother geoffrey set about recapturing it the siege was going so well that richard expected the count would soon surrender but as of the first day of july hal had yet to put in an appearance richard and theobald chabot one of his mercenary captains were inspecting puystfronts defenses for weaknesses venturing so close to the castle walls that his knights and his squire rico were alarmed for he was now within range of count elies bowmen richard was disdainful of the danger studying the battlements intently if we were to shift the mangonels he said aim them at this corner tower my lord duke one of his soldiers was approaching at a run for richards men knew that he expected his commands to be carried out with dispatch in that he was truly his fathers son the young king has just ridden into camp and with a goodly force of knights and menatarms has he indeed not for the first time richard found himself thinking that hal had an uncanny talent for arriving just as a siege was winding down i suppose then that i ought to bid him welcome hal and his knights had already dismounted and he was conversing easily with their father and geoffrey looking immaculate and well groomed and rested in the midst of the begrimed sweaty weary men whod been besieging the castle for nigh on a month as richard shouldered his way toward hal the throng parted to let him pass and henry turned with a smile pleased that his sons had come together like this the first time that all three of them had gone to war under his command the smile left henrys face though with richards first words thank god almighty for now victory is assured once the rebels learn that the young king is here at last they will surely be clamoring to surrender it could conceivably have been meant as a jokeif not for the razoredged tone of richards voice henry looked taken aback geoffrey interested and richards knights amused hals knights took it for what it wasa mortal insultand angry murmurings swept through their ranks but hal appeared unperturbed smiling at his younger brother he said pleasantly given how heavyhanded you are with your liegemen little brother rebellions like this will be a common occurrence since well have to be riding to your rescue so often in years to come it seemed wiser to pace myself the glitter in richards eyes did not bode well for a peaceful resolution and henry hastily stepped between them enough he said lowvoiced will you make a spectacle of yourselves in front of the entire camp others came to his aid then seeking to draw richard aside offering to show hal where his men would be setting up their tents and the moment passed henry did not move though not until willem came to his side god grant me patience he said softly pitching his words for the earls ears only whatever that was it was not the usual brotherly rivalry that i can understand but thisthis was lethal willem and since willem agreed with henry he could think of nothing to say and they stood in silence for a time watching as men sought to keep the kings sons as far from each other as possible rebellions were not fought to the death and when they realized that theyd been outmaneuvered and outfought viscount aimar and count elie sued for peace aimar was compelled to offer two of his sons as hostages and henry hal and geoffrey accompanied aimar to limoges where peace terms were sworn in st augustines abbey richard remained in perigueux to supervise the destruction of puystfronts walls with only aimars taillefer half brothers in angouleme still in defiance of richard the revolt sputtered to an end limoges was like nottingham two separate cities one clustered around the bishops palace by the river vienne and the other spread out on the hillside around the viscounts castle and the great abbey of st martial where henry and his sons chose to stay the day after the peace terms were accepted henry and his sons celebrated with a hunt in the viscounts woods by the time geoffrey returned to his guest chamber compline was chiming his squires morgan and jehan had just helped him to change his muddied hunting tunic when his brother hal made an unexpected appearance both surprised and curious geoffrey sent his squires down to the guest hall so they could talk in privacy he assumed hal had a specific purpose in mind for while they had never had a serious falling out they were not confidants or even boon companions hal seemed in no hurry though to get to the point and began to discuss the days hunt but geoffrey alone of his family had learned the art of patience and he lounged at ease on the bed sharing hals wineskin as he waited for his brother to reveal his intent so hal said sprawling on the bed beside him as if they were still youngsters without a care in the world how do you like being married well enough hal doubted that for hed always found constance to be as prickly as a hedgehog id wager your lady is not as easy to content as my marguerite take the advice of a seasoned husband gifts do wonders for marital harmony the more frequently the better you may be right constance did seem quite pleased with the barony of treguier taking note of his brothers blank look geoffrey explained treguier was held by constances father but when he died our father gave it to conans uncle the uncle died earlier this year and i reclaimed it in constances name propped up on his elbow geoffrey grinned saying his wife had been very grateful and hal regarded him in surprise for that sly smile was easy enough to interpret so the demure dignified constance was a hellcat in bed who would ever have guessed it flipping the wineskin to geoffrey he said soyouve had no luck in getting papa to hand over richmond or nantes no geoffrey said tersely but then made an effort to sound more positive at least he has given me a free hand in governing the rest of brittany hal was looking at him pensively no longer smiling i wonder he said if you and richard realize how lucky you both are geoffrey was in no mood for one of hals selfpitying rants need i remind you that a king takes precedence over a dukeeven a king in waiting yes but would either of you truly trade places with me i think not anyway that was not what i meant you are lucky because the two of you are not as emotionally entangled with papa as i am it is easier for you geoffrey sat upright on the bed what do you mean give me the wineskin back and ill tell you making a deft onehanded catch hal took a swig before saying lets suppose that another great flood engulfs the world on the morrow and the almighty selects richard to be the new noah only he tells richard to fill his ark with family not creatures of the earth what would richard do how would i know you know the only person richard loves is maman hed take her onboard and leave the rest of us to drown ill grant you that geoffrey said after a moments reflection though he might also take joanna but what of me are you saying my ark would be empty too except for maman no youd take us all along well not richard hed better hope he could swim but youd warn the rest of us of the coming flood wed only have so many chances though to catch the ark if one of us had used up his chances youd sail off without a backward glance i cannot say for certes when you left papa stranded on the shore but most likely it happened last year when he kept control of nantes and the honour of richmond hal had not often surprised geoffrey but hed done so now hed not thought hal was that insightful looking at his brother through new eyes he said and who would occupy your ark hal would you find room for papa hal shrugged and then sighed it depends on the day that is why i say you and richard are the lucky ones geoffrey was finding this conversation intriguing but he wasnt sure it was wise to venture into such uncharted terrain hed never before talked openly about his own ambivalent feelings for their father as interesting as this is hal i doubt that you sought me out to talk of arks what really brought you here youre right i do have something in mind one reason i took so long to reach puystfront was that i was meeting with some of richards rebellious barons on st martials feast day i was in limoges where the viscount and the people welcomed me warmly and then save your breath brother i am not interested in another rebellion against papa i did that once before and it did not turn out so well i agree with you geoff papa is not the target richard is geoffrey rose crossed the chamber and slid the bolt into place coming back to the bed he stood looking down at his brother what have you gotten yourself into now hal over the past few years ive come to know quite a few of the poitevin lords if truth be told theyve sought me out richard has done the impossiblegotten that lot of mules and malcontents to unite in a common cause they grudgingly respect his battle skills but when he tried to change local laws of inheritance that was too much for them to swallow they do not want him as their duke have promised to transfer their allegiance to me if i am willing to help them overthrow him i thought you might be interested in joining us what would i gain by that apart from the great satisfaction in seeing richard brought down hals grin was so contagious that geoffrey could not help returning it id make it worth your while geoff one of these days i will actually become king for not even papa can live forever and when i do ill hand over richmond and nantes to you straightaway mayhap you would but papa could live another twenty years whos to say that i cannot coax him into dealing with me fairly whilst he is still alive he has never refused me outright keeps saying that hell give them to me in time if you still believe in papas good faith you probably believe in mermaids and dragons too i am willing to offer more than future gains once i am in control of aquitaine ill no longer be dependent upon papas whims his meager acts of charity there will be lucrative wardships and marriages at my disposal and who better to share them with than my brother and poitou is a land of many castles a number of which are located close to the borders of brittany what would make more sense than to turn some of these castles over to you i will not deny it is a tempting offer geoffrey said slowly for i do not fancy having richard as my neighbor constantly watching brittany with hungry eyes but it is a risky proposal too are you so sure we could bring richard down his delusions of grandeur notwithstanding richard is not caesar or charlemagne nor would we lack for allies virtually all of the barons of aquitaine would come in with us even the wily de lusignans they see this as a matter of their survival and we could expect aid from my brotherinlaw too after all that papa had done for him i was hesitant about broaching the subject with philippe i need not have worried though indeed i was surprised how willing he was to join us that did not surprise geoffrey at all so you are saying youd have the backing of all the lords of aquitaine and the backing too of the french king are you not forgetting someone i do not think so the count of toulouse would never be able to resist an opportunity like this and mayhap even the what about our father what about him we would be striking at richard not him and you think hed stand aside do nothing as richard went down why not i know full well he loves me better than richard papa might even be relieved to be rid of him you cannot tell me that a man as full of ungodly suspicions as our father does not worry about brother richards trustworthiness surely he knows how much richard resents him for keeping maman captive all these years hal got to his feet too reached out and put his hand on geoffreys arm sowhat say you i will think about it you can give me no better answer than that as i said i will think about it but this you must bear in mind hal this cannot be a halfhearted effort there can be no eleventhhour regrets if you are serious about this you must commit to itand you must prepare for all possible consequences in other words you cannot take it for granted that papa would not rush to richards rescue if you do this you must be willing to fight papa too if it comes to that hal had no such misgivings sure that if their father were forced to choose between him and richard hed be the chosen one he did not want to lose geoffrey though by pushing too hard too soon geoffrey would be an invaluable ally for he had a cool head was quickwitted and could dip into the royal coffers of brittany to hire the routiers they would need fair enough he said think about it just do not wait too long opportunities like this do not come along that often geoffrey knew he was right the trouble was that opportunities and pitfalls could not always be easily or clearly distinguished one from the other he would talk to constance he decided although he already knew what she would say for they were very much alike born gamblers willing to take great risks if the rewards were equally great and the rewards hal was offering were very great indeed the duchess of saxony and bavaria was standing with her brothers on the battlements of chinon castle where she discovered that they were right the view was indeed breathtaking below them lay the narrow crooked streets and blue slate roofs of the village and beyond was the silvery expanse of the river vienne shimmering against a deep blue september sky how lovely tilda said admiringly and then laughed when hal gallantly turned her comment into a compliment pretending to think she was referring to herself she was indeed ravishing he assured her solemnly but it was not seemly for her to call attention to her own beauty better she wait modestly until others noticed it as they undoubtedly would you have not changed a whit she said playfully and untruthfully for nothing was as shed remembered it shed last seen her fathers domains fifteen years ago when shed been sent off to wed the man known as heinrich der lowehenry the lion shed been only eleven twentyseven years younger than her new husband a man renowned for his courage military prowess temper and lack of tact but it was obvious to her brothers that there was genuine respect and affection between heinrich and tilda and they were glad that shed found contentment in germany they were still getting accustomed to the tilda of today for this poised young woman of twentysix was very different from the fragile shy sister who still flitted through their childhood memories of yesterday they were surprised by how much shed grown she was almost tall enough to look richard and hal straight in the eye noticeably taller than her husband and the slender sylphlike girl had ripened into a beauty so much so that they felt uncomfortable taking notice of the voluptuous curves motherhood had given her tilda found their new selves to be no less startling hal had been twelve when theyd last met richard ten and geoffrey nine and she had to make a conscious effort to associate those boisterous boys with these worldly grown men of twentyseven twentyfive and twentyfour but shed expected that shed find strangers in their skins what shed not expected was to find her father was a stranger too shed remembered him as a veritable whirlwind remembered a hoarse raspy voice that could shout down the heavens or purr intimately in her mothers ear remembered coppery curly hair and sunbursts of pure energy a giant who towered above other mortal men a force of nature as dazzling and daunting as heat lightning in a summer sky what she found at chinon was a man of fortynine who was not aging well a man not much taller than her husband with too many grey hairs a stiff leg that throbbed when the weather changed and hooded eyes etched in wrinkles that no longer looked like laugh lines heinrich had cautioned her to tread with care fearful that too many questions about her mother might jeopardize henrys favor a risk they could not afford to take but as she gazed into her fathers face shed realized that the story of his ruined marriage and betrayals was writ plain for all to see and her heart ached for him for the mother sequestered in england and for the little girl shed once been the child secure in the innocent belief that their family was and would always be favored by god a burst of laughter drew their eyes toward the middle bailey of the castle where henry and heinrich were walking in the gardens theyd just been joined by tildas three childrenrichenza otto and heinrichand fiveyearold otto was shrieking with delight as henry swung him up into the air the sight of her father taking such joy in his grandchildren brought a smile to tildas face but it was tinged with sadness for theyd been forced to leave their third son behind in brunswick lothairs health was too frail for him to make the difficult journey from saxony to normandy no matter how often tilda told herself that shed had no choice but to put the needs of her husband and other children before lothairs she continued to have dreams in which her absent son cried out for her at night the separation was even harder because he was only eight and she did not know if the emperor would keep his word and permit them to return in three years lothair could grow up without her that fear gave her even greater sympathy for her mother whod been made to disappear from her childrens lives as if by some malign spell one cast by her own husband tell me the truth she said blue eyes moving from face to face how is maman truly faring in confinement her brothers exchanged glances and hal said lowering his voice instinctively even though they were not within their fathers hearing surely you talked to papa about her what did he tell you he insisted she was living in comfort and contentment and then hastily changed the subject he has spent more time discussing the french kings expulsion of the jews from his realm and telling me about the new outbreak of war in jerusalem between king baldwin and the saracen prince saladin than he has talking about maman and when i asked why she could not cross over to normandy to be with us at his christmas court i never did get an answer from him and you will not richard said sharply for the man is impossible to pin down even with a forked stick if there is any justice he will come back in his next life as a snake or an eel hal looked at his brother with dislike he made no attempt to conceal the three of them had agreed to put the best face upon their mothers plight and to speak well of their father in tildas hearing not wanting to make her exile any harder than it already was he should have known that richard would not hold to the bargain hopefully in your next life youll come back as a mute richards eyes narrowed a pity you were not born a woman in this life little king of lesser land for you seek only to please and to be admired by all youd have made a right fine whore tilda gasped she did not understand why hed called hal little king of lesser land although she recognized it as a grave insult geoffrey did understand and bit back a grin richard was quoting from a song by the troubadour bertran de born whod mocked hal for not displaying more martial fervor hal flushed but he lashed back at once saying with all the contempt at his command and a pity you were not lowborn in this life that the blood of kings keeps you from following your hearts desire you are never happier than when you are up to your knees in blood and guts and gore clearly the almighty meant you to be a butcher hal knew his retort had missed its mark as soon as the words left his mouth even before richard laughed at him when men fight they bleed and sometimes they die for war is not as pretty or fanciful as your tourney games war is real so little wonder you like it not rot in hell hal spat but geoffrey decided to intercede before things got totally out of hand and interrupted hal in midcurse were attracting an audience he warned nodding toward the bailey below and the others saw that he was right as their voices had risen men were beginning to look upward including henry and heinrich when her husband beckoned to her tilda was only too happy to comply for shed been shaken by what shed just witnessed geoffrey escorted her down to the gardens but she could not forget that ugly scene up on the battlements and came to a sudden stop while her husband and henry were still out of earshot they sounded as if they hate each other geoffrey how did it ever get to this blame the demon countess of anjou he said flippantly if were the devils spawn as our enemies claim we are only being true to our nature but it is not only hal and richard sweeting if i were drowning brother richard would throw me a lifeline with an anchor attached to it and in all honesty id do as much for him tilda stared at him she did not know this man did not know any of them what had happened to her family and standing there in the warm sunlit bailey she shivered suddenly sorry that shed ever come home that autumn hal made another demand for territory of his own insisting that henry give him normandy when henry refused hal withdrew to paris in a rage and announced he was taking the cross and going to the holy land to fight the infidels henry entreated him in vain to reconsider he did not agree to return to his fathers court until henry promised to increase his allowance to a generous one hundred angevin pounds a day with an additional ten pounds a day for marguerite and to pay for the cost of maintaining one hundred knights in hals household for a year henry had decided to hold his christmas court that year at caen and spared no expense to make it a memorable occasionas an official welcome for his daughter and her husband and proof that the tattered family loyalty of the angevins was once more intact and flying high heinrich had gone on pilgrimage to the spanish shrine of santiago de compostela while tilda remained in her fathers care but he returned in time for the december festivities so did hal and marguerite only john and eleanor were absent both of them left behind in england chapter thirtythree december caen normandy an icy rain had been assailing the riverside city of caen since midday but the kings solar that evening was a cheerful scene shutters barred against the storm a hungry fire in the hearth henrys christmas court had drawn princes of the church barons and their ladies and more than a thousand knights the gathering in the solar was an informal one though for henry was determined to spend some time with his family in as much privacy as a king could reasonably expect richard was due to arrive any day but the others were all present tilda and her husband geoffrey and constance hal and marguerite if any thoughts were spared for eleanor the ghost at the feast they were not expressed aloud and henry was in a mellow mood delighted to have his daughter back relieved to have lured hal away from the paris court and his toohelpful young brotherinlaw it was one more worry for henry that the seventeenyearold french king had begun to show greater steadiness of purpose and will than hal who was fully ten years philippes elder tilda was comfortably ensconced on the settle with her father on one side and her husband on the other hal and marguerite were together in a windowseat and constance was seated in a highbacked chair with geoffrey lounging on cushions at her feet henrys grandchildren had just been ushered out of the solar reluctantly sent off to their beds and the echoes of their carefree laughter seemed to linger pleasantly in the air marveling at the resilience of the very young who were able to take even exile in stride henry found himself hoping that their stay at his court would be an extended one it had been a long time since hed been able to enjoy the simple pleasures of parenthood have you talked to richenza about a name change he asked his daughter and tilda gave him a shy sideways smile yes papa we have we explained that richenza is a foreignsounding name to norman or english ears and highborn brides often take names more familiar to their husbands subjects like my sister leonora richenza seemed comfortable enough with the idea but wanted to choose her own name fortunately she does not have joannas fertile imagination and she decided shed like to be called matilda after me henry was pleased that his mothers name was being kept alive in a new generation matilda was the latin form of maude hal and marguerite expressed their approval of richenzas new name but constance mused aloud whether richenzas brother otto would change his foreignsounding name too and henry gave his daughterinlaw a tight smile sure that she was amusing herself at his expense he was very fond of marguerite and hed done his best to like constance too but she did not make it easy putting him in mind of eleanor on her worst behavior she was adept at delivering pinprick wounds with a smile planting her barbs with a specious air of innocence he was not going to let his sons caustic wife ruin the christmas revelries though he could only hope that geoffrey thought brittany was worth her peevish tempers hed begun to question tilda and heinrich about the son theyd had to leave in brunswick when a servant entered with welcome word his son richard had just ridden into the castle bailey richard made his appearance soon afterward for hed not bothered to change from his travel clothes and his boots were still caked with mud he greeted his father and heinrich with rather formal courtesy kissed his sister on the cheek and gave courtly kisses to his sistersinlaw but he acknowledged his brothers with a flat toneless hal and geoffrey greetings they returned with equal terseness the tension so palpable that even henry blind believer in family unity could not help noticing he had no time to fret about it though for richard at once revealed what was on his mind i do not understand he said why my mother was excluded from the christmas festivities henry stiffened these arguments about eleanor had been occurring with more and more frequency but this was the first time that richard had thrown down the gauntlet before others his son did not even wait for his response saying curtly you know how much she wants to see tilda and her grandchildren how can you justify keeping her away henry was sorely tempted to remind his troublesome son that he did not have to justify himself to anyone one of the prerogatives of kingship but because he wanted to extinguish this quarrel as quickly as possible he said only it is neither the time nor the place for this discussion richard richard would not be distracted though knowing his father was a past master at such evasive tactics instead he sought allies and turned toward his sister tilda has not seen our mother in fifteen years you think she was not disappointed by this arbitrary decision of yours tildas husband closed his hand over hers giving a warning squeeze she understood his concern her father had been extremely generous to them providing a lavish allowance while continuing his efforts to shorten the length of their exile but richard was right she wanted to see her mother very much and her fathers vague promises had done little to fill that void i admit i am eager for maman to meet your grandchildren papa she ventured in a vain attempt to satisfy her husband her father and her own conscience and it shall happen tilda henry said in a much softer tone of voice than hed used with richard i promised you that we will arrange for your return to england this spring at which time you may visit with your mother to your hearts content still smarting over richards arbitrary accusation he regarded his son coolly you seem to have forgotten how perilous channel crossings can be even in good weather it is dangerous its less than seven years since your brother hals chamberlain and three hundred souls drowned when their ship went down off the french coast did you truly want your mother to risk a crossing in december of all months richard started to speak stopped himself and henry felt a satisfying moment of triumph for even this stubborn son of his could not refute the truth december crossings were dangerous and they all knew it but it was then that constance chose to dip her oar into troubled waters saying in the painstakingly polite tones of one earnestly seeking information but ought that not to have been a decision for the queen to make she may have considered the risk worth taking henry drew upon a lifetime of selfcontrol to say calmly to his daughterinlaw forgive me for speaking bluntly my dear but this is not truly your concern is it constance always knew when a strategic retreat was called for and she withdrew from the field but henrys rebuke now drew geoffrey into the fray surely youd agree that it is my concern papa i am no happier about mamans absence than richard and my wife is rightyou should have offered her the choice whether that be true or not the fact remains that it is done and cannot be undone i do not see any point therefore in continuing this discussion i expected you to say that richard strode forward stopping in front of his father and youre right it is too late to redeem my mothers christmas but the time is past due to discuss her continuing confinement she is about to begin her tenth year as your prisoner and for what reason henry got to his feet not liking the way richard loomed over him when he was seated enough richard let it be youve forgiven all the others who took part in the rebellion you welcomed that french fool louis to canterbury whilst knowing that he bore as much blame as anyone for the revolt you pardoned the rebel lords even that dolt leicester a man who drew his sword upon you for christs sake you ought to have sent the bastard to the block but instead you restored his lands the only one who continues to suffer for her past sins is my mother and i want to know why i want you to tell me here and now why you refuse to set her free id be interested in hearing that answer myself geoffrey interjected and hal now chimed in too saying that he also wanted to know henry looked from one to the other saw that they were all allied against him in this and that knowledge was as bitter as gall i told you once before that i would not discuss my wife with you richard and nothing has changed i would suggest that you apologize to your sister for your bad manners and that for the remainder of the christmas court you remember this if you will not accord me the respect due your father then by god youll give it to your king now this conversation is done and ill say no more on it for a long moment he stared down his sons daring them to protest they did not but their silence was shrouded in hostility and he knew it bidding good night to tilda heinrich and marguerite he left the solar without looking back by the time henry reached the bottom of the stairwell hed still not decided whether hed return to the great hall or withdraw to his own chamber but when he opened the door he came to a halt for the storm had intensified and rain was coming down sideways hed left his mantle behind in the solar and after his dramatic departure he did not want to go back for it sheltered from the worst of the wind he gazed out across the deserted bailey thinking that this bleak sight was a good match for his mood he particularly resented the accusation that he meant to keep tilda and eleanor apart as if hed be that cruel the perilous channel crossing had definitely been a factor in his decision why else would he not have summoned johnny to join them and if hed wanted to enjoy one christmas without having to share his daughter with eleanor what of it he was entitled to that much tildas coming had forced him to face a painful truththat his children sided with eleanor he thought he understood why their sons continued to agitate for her release they had to feel guilty that shed paid so high a price for their rebellion and hed not blamed joanna for failing to comprehend the enormity of eleanors offense for she was just a child but tilda was a woman grown and hed expected better from her heinrich saw the truth of it what greater sin could a wife commit than to turn upon her own husband why was tilda so willing to forgive it the answer seemed all too obvious his children loved their mother in a way that they did not love him assuming that they loved him at all he doubted that richard did could find nothing in his second sons eyes but resentment and reproach since wedding that breton bitch geoffrey had grown more distant more guarded and hal washal more and more his eldest son was beginning to remind him of the man whod stolen his mothers crownstephen so charming and goodhearted and courageous so utterly inept at the mastery of other men thank christ for johnny there were times when it was only the thought of his youngest son that kept him from utter despair the rain had yet to slacken off and it occurred to him that just as he was trapped by the storm he was trapped by his own family by his inability to give his sons an honest answer to richards angry question but how could he tell them that their mothers continuing confinement was their fault the truth was that hed have freed eleanor long ago if only he could trust them he still did not fully comprehend why shed rebelled but he no longer doubted the sincerity of her regrets nor did he still believe that shed throw herself at once into plots and conspiracies if he set her free he did not fear as he once had that shed do all in her power to revenge herself upon him but he never doubted that if one of their sons rebelled again shed draw upon the considerable resources of aquitaine on behalf of that son offering her unqualified support especially if that son was richard hed never underestimated his wifes shrewdness or her cunning or her ability to dissemble to beguile others into doing her bidding hed valued her for those very qualitiesuntil shed turned them against him but even if shed made it safely to paris nine years ago her presence would not have tipped the balance in their favor for men like louis and philip of flanders would never have heeded the advice of a woman henry laughed suddenly mirthlessly any man who thought women were the weaker vessels had never met his motheror his queen thank god almighty that shed not been able to take the field against him but now she had richard the son who was most like him the son who loved him not he remained confident that he would prevail if richard ever rebelled again but richard would pose a greater challenge than any foe hed fought and he was too pragmatic to deny it until richard and his brothers proved that they could be truly trusted the way a man ought to be able to trust his sons how could he risk letting eleanor go and yet how could he say that to richard or geoffrey or hal how could he confess that he still harbored such doubts and misgivings about their loyalty he could only ask the almighty and st thomas to show his sons the error of their ways to pray that they saw the light ere it was too late raised voices came to his ears now muffled in the winding stairwell either his sons were squabbling again or making ready to depart he looked out dubiously into the wet gloomy night remembering when hed been utterly indifferent to such storms when his body had not yet begun to show the results of so many years of hard riding and careless confidence in his own invincibility shivering as he stepped out into the rain he could take no comfort from the irony of itthat he and his exiled wife were sharing the same wretched christmas the last months of gods year were among the most miserable of will marshals life without the favor of his lord the young king he felt like a ship gone adrift lacking moorings or direction because the other knights of hals mesnie did not know why theyd fallen out speculation ran rampant and will found himself the target of gossip and innuendo vulnerable to the malice of his enemies and enemies he had for his privileged position in hals household and his spectacular tournament successes had long provoked the envy and jealousy of lesser knights too proud to acknowledge the talk will did his best to ignore the whispers and stares but his heaviest burden was that he could not confide in his friends could not reveal the cause of the young kings displeasurenot without betraying hals confidence will was accustomed to being hals confidant basking in their friendship even though he knew it had cost him the good will of the old king henry blamed him for failing to curb hals whims and reckless spending will did not think that was fair but he accepted that kings were often unfair and there was naught to be done about it what he could not accept was the sudden change in his status hal no longer sought his advice no longer wanted his companionship it was as if the last twelve years had never been it had begun that autumn when will noticed hals preoccupation his moodiness hed always believed that his duties involved more than protecting hal from an enemys lance a foes sword thrust he was often called upon to protect hal from himself hed encouraged hal to reveal the source of his distraction and finally it had all come spilling outthe blandishments of the poitevin lords his hunger for lands of his own and his loathing for his brother richard will had been appalled once he realized hal was entangling himself in such a lethal spiders web and hed spoken out forthrightly against it with a blunt candor that kings did not often hear hal had been furious and ever since their quarrel hed kept will at a distance will did not even know if he still intended to follow through with this folly in his despair hed considered approaching the queen but hed soon abandoned that idea marguerite was not cast in the same mold as her motherinlaw all he could do was to waitfor hals temper to cool for his common sense to reassert itself what he would do if neither happened he did not know it was not until his friends came to him on a rainsodden december night at caen that will learned what was being said behind his backthat he was guilty of far worse than arrogance or pride that he was seeking to cuckold his lord to seduce hals lovely young queen accustomed as he was to the spite and jealousy that thrived in the artificial atmosphere of a royal court he was dumbfounded by such baneful rancor for he was being accused of the greatest crime a man could commit against his liege lord baldwin de bethune simon de marisco and peter de preaux had agonized over warning him of the stories being circulated at last deciding that it was more dangerous for him not to know they watched will now with sympathetic eyes bracing themselves for the questions to come how did you find this out he asked at last and they explained that the conspirators had tried to win over one of hals friends raoul de hamars hoping that hed take the tale to hal but raoul had scoffed at the story and instead of warning hal hed chosen to warn wills friends at least all are not willing to believe the worst of me who are these men who slander me so foully they were reluctant to say fearing an even greater scandal but will was insistent and they were forced to reveal that the ringleaders were adam dyquebeuf and sir thomas de coulonces just as theyd feared will at once announced his intention of challenging them to combat vowing to clear his nameand the queenswith the power of his strong right arm you cannot do that will if you proclaim yourself innocent of adultery youd be spreading the scandal even farther making sure that all whod not heard the rumors now know of them that would do you no good would shame the queenand the king wills shoulders slumped for he realized baldwin was right surely hal could not know of this if he had would he not have acted would he not have punished the men whod dared to slander his queen but will discovered that he still had to ask looking from one face to the other he finally blurted it out does lord hal know of these rumors none of them seemed in a hurry to answer him we are not sure simon admitted raoul de hamars agreed to find out more and reported that after hed refused to pass the story on they got one of lord hals pages drunk and convinced him it was his duty to tell the king supposedly hal laughed it off forcing them to take more drastic action and they then came to him swearing on their honor that it was so seeing wills look of dismay baldwin said hastily we do not know if that truly happened it is only what raoul was told when he went out drinking with thomas de coulonces will fell silent hed assumed that hals coldness was due to their quarrel to his disapproval of hals grand schemes for claiming aquitaine but what if hed been wrong what if hal had heard these vile accusations and believed them what will you do simon asked and will could only shrug i do not knowyet the castle chaplain accompanied hal into the church of st george and hal feared that hed continue to hover but he excused himself at once promising to make sure the king would not be disturbed during his prayers thank you father matthew hal said with a smile sighing with relief when he was finally alone for that was a rarity in his life even more than his father he seemed to be a magnet for all eyes usually he enjoyed such attention but this christmas court at caen was different and he longed to escape the constant scrutiny to have time to himself without any demands being made upon him realizing that a church ought to be a good place to find solitude hed decided to take refuge there although he did intend to pray too he was in gods house after all hal had always loved christmas not this year part of the reason for his discontent was being thrown into such close proximity with richard his brothers glowering presence made it impossible for him to ignore his misgivings reminding him that he had to make a decision soon did he commit himself irrevocably to the rebels in aquitaine or did he step back from the cliffs edge the trouble was that he did not truly know what he wanted to do well he knew he wanted aquitaine but he was not sure he wanted to fight to the death for it and after his talk with geoffrey hed realized how naive hed been how shortsighted how could he have been so certain that their father would stand aside whilst two of his sons destroyed the third for that was what it would come torichards destruction only death could make his brother accept the loss of aquitaine and would maman forgive him for that shed always had an inexplicable fondness for richard no it would not be as easy as hed first thought he did not want to alienate or hurt his mother nor did he want to fight his father again but how could he walk away from such an opportunity if he held aquitaine hed no longer be answerable to his father for every denier he spent hed finally have enough money to reward his liegemen to attract the best knights to his banner to buy a stallion without fretting about papas dour disapproval to indulge marguerite as she deserved that was why hed again asked his father for normandy for it would be the perfect solution to his dilemma giving him his own duchy without any of the risks that taking aquitaine entailed but of course papa had balked when had he ever listened to reason and now the vultures were circling for certes aimar of limoges had turned up in caen ostensibly to prove he was honoring the summers peace but in reality to remind hal of his commitment to the rebels hed even brought news that richard had obligingly given them the ideal excuse for attacking aquitaine hed begun to build a castle at clairvaux in an area that was under the sway of the counts of anjou hal was not surprised that richard should be poaching in his woods he was surprised though that he was not better pleased about it for as aimar had been quick to point out he was now the wronged one justified in protecting his own domains but because richard had given him a legitimate grievance he felt even more pressured to take action soon all of christendom would know of richards encroachment into anjou thanks to that impudent poet according to geoff bertran de born had written one of his mocking verses about clairvaux claiming it shone so brightly that the young king could not help but see it it seemed to hal that the fates were conspiring to force him into making a decision ere he was ready and he yearned for another opinion one dispassionate and dependable but he whod always had friends beyond counting had no trusted confidant when he most needed one he could not consult geoff for his brother would be scornful of his inability to make up his mind in that geoff was like richard both of them strangers to doubts or forebodings none of his knights could be relied upon either theyd tell him what they thought he wanted to hear or theyd be unable to keep such a secret and blab it all over creation nor could he turn to the two people he most trusted his wife and will marshal hed hinted to marguerite of his intentions and mere hints had been enough to alarm her greatly no he could not confide in marguerite and that created problems too for she wanted him to take her to the holy shrine of our lady at rocamadour in southern aquitaine once the winter weather broke shed learned that barren women often conceived after making a pilgrimage to rocamadour and shed been both hurt and bewildered by his refusal nor could he explain that aquitaine might well be at war by the spring and will had let him down badly acting for all the world as if he were about to commit high treason in attacking richard at the time that he most needed wills support the knight had lectured him about his duty to his father and liege lord droned on about fidelity and sworn vows and nonsense like that it was particularly infuriating because will knew how shabbily papa treated him knew too what a swine richard could be hals tempers rarely lasted long hed never been one for holding grudges but so great was his disappointment that hed found it difficult to forgive will then just when hed decided to let will back into his good graces those idiots had come to him with their absurd accusations he had been outraged both by their suspicions and the terrible timing here he was about to make the most important decision of his entire life and he was supposed to deal with tawdry gossip like this hed ordered them from his chamber after warning them not to repeat such vile rumors but somehow he found himself blaming will too for his unwitting part in this farce all he wanted was enough time to consider all his options without being dragged into his households petty squabbles or being nagged by his wife about that damnable pilgrimage was that so much to ask apparently so for hed yet to find a peaceful moment at caen not with marguerite sulking and aimar lurking and will acting putupon and geoff wanting to lay plans and richard strutting around as if he were the incarnation of roland and poor tilda grieving over mamans absence and his father refusing to heed any voice but his own he was sorry hed let himself be talked out of going to the holy land at least there it would be simple enoughfight the infidels and protect the sacred city of jerusalem from saladin and his saracen hordes by now hal had convinced himself that few men had suffered the burdens he was expected to bear a pity he could not stay here in the hushed quiet of the church for it seemed a world away from the chaos and turmoil of his life it occurred to him then to ask the almighty for guidance and he wondered why he hadnt thought of that before feeling more cheerful he approached the high altar knelt and prayed for a sign for some manifestation of gods will so that he would know what the lord wanted him to do he was just getting to his feet when a clamor erupted outside the door slammed and his brother richard stalked into the church trailed by the flustered priest my liege i am sorry the priest stammered i told the lord duke that you were at your prayers but he would not wait do not distress yourself father matthew the lord duke is not known for his good manners in fact they are so deplorable that some suspect he was raised by wolves whereas you are the veritable soul of courtesy richard jeered youd be sure to ask ere you borrowed a mans dagger to stab him in the back and i daresay youd wipe it clean afterward what are you babbling about now richard did you think i would not find out i know about your treacherous doubledealing with my vassals know about your visit to limoges this summer you gave the monks a banner for their abbey one with henricus rex inscribed in gold thread what else did you give them hala promise that youd be a far more benevolent liege lord than me id hardly have to tell them that hal said coolly as anyone with eyes to see knows it already ive even heard it said that fulk nerra would have been a more benevolent lord than you is this what you are whining about my visit to limoges need i remind you that limoges is on the way to pereigueux you might as well complain that i stopped in stdenis on a journey to paris my lords the priest began timidly but they ignored him utterly glaring at each other with such hostility that he was thankful swords were not worn at the christmas court your conspicuous sojourn in limoges was only the beginning of the trail richard snapped i assumed that youd conspire as carelessly as you do everything else and indeed you covered your tracks very sloppily youve been meeting with malcontent lords from the limousin and poitou for some time now offering a sympathetic ear for their complaints and that is my great crimefeeling sorry for your illused barons i freely admit to it i feel sorry for anyone who has to suffer your foul tempers little brother but that hardly constitutes proof of conspiracy and rebellion ere im done ill have enough proof to convince even your wife and when i do ill make a formal protest to our father if he gives me no satisfactionand i rather hope he does noti will deal with you myself and youll not find me as forgiving as he is you can wager the surety of your soul on that as entertaining as your rants always are i have no more time to waste with you hal started to brush past his brother but richard grabbed his arm we are not done here hal swung around and brought the stiffened edge of his hand down upon richards wrist breaking his brothers hold richard lunged forward just as the priest desperately flung himself between them both of the kings sons were much taller than he and he found himself crushed between them his nose buried in richards mantle unable to see their faces but feeling such tension in their bodies that he was terrified thered be blood shed in his church for hed remembered that theyd be carrying eating knives my lords please he pleaded but they were exchanging curses calling each other names so vile that he doubted theyd even heard him they did hear though the astonished exclamation from the direction of the door and they stepped back allowing father matthew to breathe again as they confronted two of their fathers most distinguished guests the archbishops of canterbury and dublin the archbishop of canterbury was a mildmannered individual utterly unlike his predecessor the fiery thomas becket not one whod be eager to rebuke the kings sons fortunately for father matthew the archbishop of dublin was made of sterner stuff what sort of outrageous behavior is this he demanded striding down the nave so swiftly that his cope billowed out behind him giving him the appearance of a ship under full sail would you spill blood in gods house for shame my lords for shame hal recovered his poise first patting the priest apologetically on the shoulder as he moved to greet the prelates you are quite right my lord archbishop there is no excuse for our bad behavior and i beg your pardon i will be sure to confess this transgression to my chaplain so that he may impose a suitable penance watching as his brother pacified the archbishops richard shook his head in disgust he knew he should keep silent but hed been watching hal perform these conjuring tricks as long as he could remember and as hal started up the aisle with the clerics his bitterness spilled over you could rob a man blind in broad daylight and then somehow make it seem as if he were the one at fault but if you meddle again in aquitaine all your smiles and pretty compliments will not save you nothing will hal could recognize an opportunity when he was presented with one and he paused at the door then turned without haste and looked back at his furious brother you put me in mind richard of a cuckolded husband bewailing his wifes infidelity when he is the one who drove her into another mans arms and confident that hed gotten the last word he departed the church with the archbishops leaving richard standing by the high altar fuming but vowing that hal would not get away with his treachery not this time on the day after christmas henry was obliged to hold a hearing to adjudicate a bizarre incident that had happened during the christmas feast as a silver basin of scented water was borne to the kings table so that he and his guests might wash their hands before the meal began william de tancarville a highborn norman baron had rushed forward forcibly seized the basin and insisted upon carrying it to henry himself refusing afterward to surrender the basin to henrys indignant chamberlain de tancarville did not lack for enemies and protests were made resulting in the next days session henry had no liking for de tancarville for the baron had been one of the first to defect to hal in the rebellion of but he accepted the mans passionate defense that as the hereditary chamberlain of normandy it was his sole privilege to attend his duke on ceremonial occasions while hal had been amused by the fracas in the hall he was fidgeting and squirming in his seat as he listened to de tancarville proclaim his right to retain custody of the silver basin for it had occurred to him that richard might see this as the ideal forum to charge him with subverting his rule in aquitaine he was reasonably confident that richard did not have convincing evidence yet but his brother might well choose to make a public scene after their confrontation in st georges chapel he was relieved therefore when the proceedings were finally concluded and richards window of opportunity slammed shut but before henry or any of the lords could withdraw will marshal strode toward the center of the hall and declared my lord king in a clear carrying voice henry sat down again reluctantly wondering why he could not enjoy one peaceful christmas without any drama or strife but then he saw that the king being approached was hal and he settled back to watch as did the rest of the men in the hall sire hear me will was very nervous more uneasy than hed ever been before a tournament or a battle but when he spoke his voice revealed none of his inner turmoil i have been unjustly accused of a vicious and vile act of treason i am here to defend myself before you and your noble father and these assembled lords and barons have the men who accused me come forward and agree to meet me in combat i will fight three of them in turn and if i am defeated in any contest i am willing to forfeit my life for i would not want to live if i could not clear my name as soon as will stopped speaking the hall was utterly still hal could feel every eye upon him and he felt a sudden flare of anger resentment that will should pick this inopportune moment to make his overwrought theatrical challenge will made it sound as if he were not in control of his own household knights his father was watching him with an enigmatic expression and geoffrey looked puzzled but richard was smiling faintly and that smile was enough to arouse all of hals suspicions had richard put will up to this theyd always been too friendly for his liking for that matter will was de tancarvilles cousin could that odd event have been deliberately staged to give will this chance to appear before the kings court if he allowed the trial by combat this would drag on for three days delaying their departure from caen was that what richard had in mind was he seeking time to produce witnesses a poitevin baron that hed coerced into making a confession i do not know what you are talking about marshal he said sharply and i will not have my household disrupted with petty personal quarrels there will be no trial by combat now let that be an end to it will looked at him gravely and to hals discomfort he felt heat rising in his face under that unblinking regard pushing back his chair he got to his feet and that seemed to break the spell but instead of withdrawing will turned and knelt before henry sire i can no longer remain at court i beg you to grant me safe conduct through your domains henry was glad to do so wishing he could rid himself of all of hals knights and will bowed stiffly then departed the hall holding his head high and paying no heed to the buzz of questions and conjecture that swirled in his wake will marshals actions had created a furor and for the rest of the evening there was no other topic of conversation for will was a star on the tournament circuit and all thought it odd that hal would have parted with such a redoubtable knight most of the men did not know what will had been accused of for the rumors had not spread much beyond hals household shaken by wills challenge for none of them wanted to meet him on the field the conspirators kept quiet doing their best not to call attention to themselves the paucity of facts did not discourage gossip though and it seemed to hal that there was not a soul in caen who did not have a theory about wills fall from favor and every last one of them was eager to expound upon it at great length hal discovered now that there was a drawback to the sort of popularity hed long enjoyed he was well liked by virtually everyone and greatly admired for his tournament successes but men felt free to approach him with a familiarity theyd not have dared to show his father or richard much to his annoyance he found himself having to deflect obtrusive questions avid curiosity and speculation that he considered both unseemly and presumptuous pride kept him from making an early departure from the hall but when he was finally able to withdraw to his own chambers he was weary and thoroughly out of sorts but in his bedchamber hal found that an unpleasant evening was about to get much worse marguerite had excused herself after theyd eaten pleading a headache but she was still fully dressed and her face was so pale and drawn that he felt a pang of guilt for hed been so consumed with his own troubles that hed not had a thought to spare for her sweetheart you do not look well at all shall i send benoit to summon a doctor glancing around the chamber he noticed for the first time that neither his squires nor marguerites ladies were in attendance where did the lads wander off to i dismissed them marguerite startled hal by crossing the chamber and sliding the bolt into place she stayed by the door arms folded tightly across her breasts i must know hal do you believe that gossip about will marshal and me hal was shocked jesu you heard that agace came to me believingcorrectlythat i needed to know it did not occur to me that you credited it thoughnot until today sweetheart of course i do not believe it he moved swiftly to her side but when he put his arm around her her body remained rigid in his embrace never for a moment did i think there might be any truth to it i swear that to you marguerite upon the soul of our dead son may god assoil him he could feel some of the tension go out of her shoulders but when she gazed up into his face her blue eyes were still shadowed with anxiety and uncertainty you do believe though that will made improper advances to me and he did not hal that i swear too upon our son marguerite there is no need for this i know will would never betray me like that then why did you let him leave your court in disgrace marguerite did not voice the question even though it burned on her tongue instead she allowed herself to take a moment of comfort in her husbands arms clinging to him as her refuge in a world gone mad hal kissed the tear tracks on her cheeks murmuring love words and endearments but after a time he said sweetheart why did you not come to me about this i never dreamed that youd heard these vile rumors why did you not tell me because i know youve been troubled and uneasy in your mind about something and i did not want to add to your worries she said surprising herself by how readily the lie came to her lips in truth shed been waiting for him to take action to banish the culprits from his court and she still did not understand why hed not done that halif you believe will to be innocent of these charges why are you still so displeased with him what has he done that you cannot forgive it is not important he insisted and he sought to stop further questions with kisses but for once she was not as compliant stepping back she searched his face intently and then repeated her question hal was momentarily at a loss he did not like lying outright to her considered that a more serious marital offense than lies of omission tell me she pleaded we promised thered be no secrets between us not like your parents it has long been obvious to me that something is wrong and ive been waiting for you to confide in me i can wait no longer hal i want to know now tonight he was both surprised and amused by her sudden assertiveness but he was touched too and he realized that he did need to talk about his concerns at least with marguerite he could rely upon her utter loyalty leading her over to the bed he sat down with her and after a brief hesitation he began to speak there was a relief in being able to speak candidly about his ambivalence and he ended up telling her more than hed initially intended by the time he was done she knew it allthe conspiracy with the lords of the limousin and poitou the dazzling prospects offered by the capture of aquitaine his overtures to geoffrey and her brother philippe his temptations and his misgivings even his chapel altercation with richard so he concluded now you know he waited expectantly but she stayed silent and her head was lowered hiding her face from him marguerite what do you want me to say when she glanced up at last her eyes reminded him of the way will had gazed at him in the hall the silent reproach of a dog unable to understand why it had just been kicked why hal why must you risk so much because there is so much to gain he was on his feet now needing to move as he sought to deal with his disappointment you sound just like will but i expected better of you marguerite youre my wife and if i cannot rely upon your heartfelt support then i am truly alone midst my enemies of course i support you it is just thatthat i fear for you too beloved her eyes were shimmering with tears and he was quick to take her in his arms they clung together with an urgency that revealed their shared misery more than words could have done for theyd failed each other and on some level they both understood thathal let down by her tepid response marguerite horrified by his intrigues and planned betrayals hastily shedding their clothes they fell into bed their lovemaking was intense ironically given an impassioned edginess by the very fears they were trying to escape afterward hal had no trouble sliding into an exhausted sated sleep marguerite was not so lucky she lost track of the time but she heard hals squires enter and bed down heard church bells pealing in the distance heard dogs barking all the familiar sounds of night but there was nothing familiar about her world not anymore she gently stroked hals tousled fair hair and he murmured her name in his sleep instinctively reaching out for her warmth and softness her throat was so tight that it hurt for she was determined to choke back her tears oh my beautiful boy what have you done she had no memories of a life without hal she still loved him dearly would love him until she drew her last breath but it was as if their roles had reversed for she suddenly felt so much older and wiser than he watching him sleep she found herself wondering if the almighty in his infinite wisdom had taken her son because her husband would always be as he was now a charming child adrift upon stormy seas a pallid winter dawn had not yet dispersed the night shadows and a few stars still glimmered along the horizon because it was so early the castle was not yet astir and wills leavetaking was witnessed only by a small group of friends and a few sleepyeyed guards baldwin de bethune and simon de morisco were doing their best to act hearty and jovial making bad jokes and pretending that this morn was no different from any number of past departures will appreciated the effort just as he appreciated their attempts to reassure him that his future still shone brightly that christendom was full of lords eager to snap him up like a starving trout the practical part of his nature knew that they were right hed have no trouble finding a place in another great household but that knowledge did not blunt the sharp edges of his newfound awarenessthat he was thirtyfive years old with no lands or wife cast aside by the man whod been his friend his liege lord his lodestar he was not going alone accompanied by his squire eustace de bertrimont and a few fellow knights whod pledged themselves to his banner when it was flying high and were unwilling to abandon him now that his luck had soured as he looked about at these loyal men he could not help remembering how proud hed been the first time hed fought in a tournament as a knight banneret leading his own company of men that had been at lagny the tourney held after the young french kings coronation was that truly only two years past it felt like a lifetime ago when his eyes began to burn he awkwardly embraced his friends submitted to their equally clumsy hugs and swung up into the saddle with their farewells echoing in his ears he and his small party rode toward the gatehouse and out onto the drawbridge the dawn continued to lighten and a brisk wind sent clouds scudding across the sky it would be a good day for travel spurring his stallion he settled into an easy canter not allowing himself to look back keeping his eyes on the road ahead chapter thirtyfour january le mans anjou hal no longer had qualms about going ahead with the conspiracy when hed asked the almighty for a divine sign hed not expected what hed gotten but the wrathful chapel altercation with his brother had dispelled his doubts aquitaine was worth fighting for and richard deserved to be defeated and shamed if any man did their father had to believe that richard was the one in the wrong though if they hoped to keep him out of it and so hal was grateful for his brothers fiery impulsive nature if richard had been more calculating hed have said nothing until hed assembled his proof and then set up an ambush as it was hal had the opportunity to plan his own response and by the time the confrontation came he was ready for it summoned to henrys bedchamber he found his father and richard waiting for him richard was leaning against the wall arms folded across his chest looking both defiant and expectant henry shared none of his sons anticipation he looked tired and troubled come in hal he said your brother has made some grave accusations against you for all our sakes i hope he is mistaken these charges are too serious though to be dismissed out of hand i thought it best that we discuss this matter in private but if there is truth to his claims richard shot henry a resentful glance could the old man make it any plainer how eager he was to believe hals denials hal has been conspiring with my vassals against me he said coldly for he was determined to be matteroffact not to let hal bait him into losing his temper i do not know who was the instigator whether he came to them with honeyed promises of a lenient lordship or whether they sought him out first it does not really matter does it what does is that they have engaged in treason scheming to depose me as duke of aquitaine and put hal in my stead hal regarded him calmly have you any proof of this richard yes i do have proof richard said with a smile like an unsheathed dagger i have a witness one of the household knights of viscount aimar of limoges he is willing to testify that his lord met with you on numerous occasions that you have been conspiring together to stir up a rebellion against me and that you have involved others in your plotincluding joffroi de lusignan and those habitual rebels the taillefer brothers sodeny it if you dare after richard accosted him in the chapel at caen hal had been dreading this moment of reckoning but now he found that he was actually enjoying himself so confident was he of the stratagem hed devised during those bleak days at the christmas court you are right papa these are indeed serious charges and i welcome the chance to respond to them but not here i want it done in public before witnesses of unimpeachable probity so that richard cannot twist my words to suit his own ends hal stifled a smile gratified by the startled reactions of his father and brother sounding highly skeptical richard demanded to know when this would take place and hal did grin openly then thinking that if suspicions were fuel richard would be a flaming torch the sooner the better he said agreeably this afternoon if it pleases you it pleases me richard said grimly and henry looked from one to the other in utter dismay singed by the heat of the hostility burning between them the castles great hall was the site for the drama hal was about to stage the royal family and the most honored of their guests had been ushered onto the dais henry was flanked by the archbishops of canterbury and dublin geoffrey constance richard marguerite heinrich and tilda were seated nearby and behind them stood henrys natural son and chancellor geoff the bishop of le mans and several of henrys trusted advisors including willem and maurice de craon catching marguerites eye hal winked and she smiled if rather wanly he was amused to see that his father and brothers had retreated behind their inscrutable court masks a clear indication that they were curious and uneasy unsure of his intentions that was exactly how he wanted them to beslightly off balance he was sorry that hed not been able to warn geoffrey beforehand but it could not be helped glancing about the hall he let the suspense build until all eyes were upon him and then he raised his hand for silence he felt that rush of excitement that he imagined a player must feel the first time he stepped onto a stage and took command hed always thought that acting must be great fun those who wish me ill have been spreading rumors about my loyalties ostensibly speaking to henry he was also playing to the audience and many of them noticed that his eyes had lingered upon his brother richard when he spoke of those who wish me ill richard certainly did and his mouth set in a hard thin line these accusations are baseless hal declared i would not have you harbor any doubts about that sire taking the cue his chaplain came forward knelt before him and held out a book bound in fine calfskin beautifully illuminated in gold leaf borrowed that day from the bishop of le mans putting his hand upon the book hal said solemnly i swear upon the holy gospels that my fidelity to you is as true and steadfast as my faith in christ the redeemer i further vow that i will be loyal to you my liege for all the days of my life and show you the honor and obedience due you as my father and my king it was hard for hal to read his fathers expression but the scornful twist of richards mouth needed no translation let him smirk the hellspawn was about to get the surprise of his life i realize that oaths can be broken he continued thinking that his father had broken more than his share of them but i want there to be perfect trust between us from now on and to prove my sincerity i shall be utterly honest with you my lord father my brother richard has accused me of plotting with his liegemen against him i do not deny it i did indeed enter into a pact with the disaffected barons of poitou and the limousin the stunned expression on richards face was quickly followed by one of triumphant wariness geoffrey simply looked horrified but henry had blanched like a man bleeding from an internal wound hal ignored the murmur sweeping through the audience and kept his eyes upon his fathers face i am sure that none here are surprised by the anger and resolve of the lord dukes barons they have chafed for years under his heavyhanded rule charging that he tramples their cherished traditions into the dust that he makes free with their women and imposes his will by force and violence how could i not sympathize with legitimate grievances like that but it was not sympathy that drove me into this conspiracy it was his treachery he has fortified a castle at clairvaux which lies within the holdings of the count of anjouand all know it can you imagine his outrage my lord father if id intruded into poitou and dared to put up a castle in his domains it was this threat to the sovereignty of anjou that stirred me to action for i would not willingly cede so much as a shovelful of angevin dirt to the duke of aquitaine there was so much commotion in the hall now that hal had to raise his voice to be heard over the clamor my only regret is that i did not come to you first my liege as soon as i learned of his perfidy i ask you now to take the castle at clairvaux from my brother and keep it in your own hands so that peace may be restored to our family hal was pleased with the outcome of his dramatic declaration for all had gone as hed expected richard was infuriated henrys attention had been diverted from hals wrongdoing to his brothers encroachment into anjou hed impressed people particularly the clerics by his willingness to swear upon the holy gospels his own knights were inspired by his boldness and richards men were suddenly on the defensive he did feel a prickle of remorse that marguerite was so proud of his candor knowing she believed that the conspiracy was now part of the past but he assured himself that hed make her understand when the time came the only surprise was that geoffrey had not sought him out afterward for an explanation hed have liked to think that geoffrey had instinctively understood what he was doing but that unguarded shocked expression on his brothers face argued otherwise and as the evening wore on he went looking for the breton duke to no avail it was only when he found geoffreys squires jehan and morgan flirting in a windowseat with the castellans fetching daughter that he learned geoffrey and constance had departed some time ago hal still marveled that his brother seemed to enjoy such a satisfying sex life with the prideful sharptongued constance but he could imagine no other reason for their abrupt withdrawal from the hall after bounding up the stairs to their private chamber he made sure to knock loudly on the door and waited until he heard geoffrey call out enter he was half expecting to find them in bed but they were still fully dressed seated together by the hearth smiling he greeted his sisterinlaw warmly before asking if he could borrow her husband for a brief time you may speak freely in front of constance hal blinked for he could not imagine trusting constance the way he trusted marguerite he had no real interest in his brothers marriage though as you will he said affably i thought you might have some questions for me did you indeed geoffreys eyes had always been changeable but now they were as grey as flint and just as welcoming unfortunately theyre questions i ought to have asked you last summer at limoges you were so busy instructing me how richard and i would captain our arks that we never got around to discussing your own views on seamanship a pity for it would have been useful to know that you were a believer in lightening the load when you ran into rough waters at the very least it would have prepared me when you chose to push our allies over the side i can only wonder why you did not throw me overboard toounless youre saving me for a particularly severe storm hal was genuinely shocked by the accusation and then offended jesus god geoff id never do that youre my brother so is richard constance pointed out coolly and hal gave her the sort of vexed look that she was accustomed to receiving from his father i can understand that you are unhappy with me geoff he said striving to sound apologetic even though he thought geoffrey was being needlessly contentious i ought to have alerted you to what was coming but i had no time truly i did not you know about my chapel quarrel with richard i had to find a way to deflect his accusations as for pushing our allies over the side that is absurd richard already knew they were conniving against him nor did i mention any names geoffrey and constance exchanged a meaningful glance one that spoke volumes without a word being said richard suspected they were conniving against him geoffrey pointed out but he did not know for certesnot until you helpfully made a public confession do you truly think aimar and the others will be pleased with the work youve done this day hal shrugged it does not matter whether they are pleased or not theyll still be keen to ally with me for where else can they go geoffrey was silent for a moment i cannot decide he said slowly whether youre a complete fool or an utter cynic look geoff we had to put richard in the wrong well ive done that and quite adroitly i think now the pressure will be on him to yield that accursed castle in all honesty can you envision him doing that geoffrey was still frowning but he had to shake his head at that no i cannot he admitted exactly and when he balks we both know papas temper will catch fire as it always does when his will is thwarted ive proven my good faith by confessing freely to my part in the plot now it will be up to richard to prove his and when he refuses hell become the legitimate target for our fathers wrath once papa is publicly defied like that how likely is it that hed go racing to richards rescue not likely geoffrey had to agree you do make a plausible argument ill grant you that of course i do id given this careful thought hal insisted apparently unaware hed just contradicted his earlier claimthat hed not had time to consult geoffrey as for aimar and the others leave them to me ill smooth their ruffled feathers easily enough crossing to constances side he kissed her hand with a flourish and departed with a jaunty bounce in his step a smile lingering at the corners of his mouth it was quiet for a time after hed gone constance was the first to break the silence you cannot ever trust that man geoffrey i know but then i trust no one darling she arched a brow but did not make the obvious response the one that most women would have asked and because she did not he amended his statement except for you of course youd have to say that she pointed out and when their eyes met they both laughed richard had come in grudging answer to the kings summons but he was in no conciliatory mood unable to understand how his father kept allowing himself to be taken in by hals act you may as well save your breath he warned for i will not give clairvaux up henry had been expecting just such a response why did you decide to fortify the castle at clairvaux richard was surprised by the reasonableness of that question it is not as clearcut as hal pretends it to be he said less truculently clairvaux was once part of poitou it is not as if i started building a castle in the heart of angers i have a map of anjou burned into my brain know where clairvaux is henrys tone was mild enough to take any sting from his words but why clairvaux why do you think you need a castle there it was not an accusation henry sounded as if he truly wanted to know the work at clairvaux was not done with hal in mind at least not directly clairvaux is just six miles from chatellerault and as you know chatellerault controls the crossing of the vienne on the poitiers road henry nodded thoughtfully but the present viscount of chatellerault is your cousin his father hugh was eleanors uncle and you think our shared blood will guarantee guillaumes loyalty the way blood binds me and hal henry acknowledged the accuracy of richards thrust with a bleak smile so you have reason to doubt guillaumes fidelity fair enough but would it not have made life easier for us all if youd come to me first explained why you wanted to fortify clairvaux as it is you gave hal the perfect excuse for heeding the siren songs of your malcontent barons richard had not expected his father to see that clairvaux was as much a pretext as it was a grievance it would have been more prudent he conceded and then flashed a sudden smile but prudence is not one of my more conspicuous virtues is it no i cannot say that it is henry agreed dryly but there were worse vices than a lack of prudence far worse you do not sound as if you hold me much to blame richard said cautiously for he had little experience with this evenhanded sort of justice as far back as he could remember his father had favored hal i do not i am not saying you are an innocent mind you but your sins in no way justify what your brother has done to richard that admission was sweet balm for a wound hed never have acknowledged they were standing by the fireplace and he gazed for a time into the shivering shooting flames but you still want me to give over clairvaux yes richard i do richard almost said it was not fair he did not want to sound like a spoiled pampered lordling though did not want to sound like hal if his fathers maltreatment of their mother was his most grievous sin crowning hal was surely his most idiotic one bertran de born had accompanied richard to court and the troubadour had been quick to lambaste hals public confession calling him the king of fools his mockery changed nothing though hal was gods anointed and richard knew he had to deal with that however little he liked it tonight he suspected that his father did not much like it either and there was some comfort in that realization for much of his resentment had been fueled by henrys failure to see hal as richard saw him i will never turn it over to hal he warned and henry nodded i would not ask that of you promise to keep it in my hands i will even consult with you ere i choose a castellan well i trust you more than hal richard said a joke that was too bitter for humor but if i surrender clairvauxeven to youhal wins does he henry asked blandly and his son looked at him with an emotion that hed rarely felt for his father one of reluctant admiration papa was right what pleasure would hal take from a win like that without clairvaux hed have no pretense for further plotting the more richard thought about it the more he could see the irony of such a solution hed still have to sacrifice some pride and that would not be easy but the look on hals face when he understood hed been outfoxed might well be worth it ill give it over to youand only to you but youre just putting a bandage upon a festering belly wound papa and i think you know that henry did but he was not yet willing to admit it not even to himself for now he said wearily ill be content enough if i can stop the bleeding henry knew that the surrender of clairvaux was a temporary solution to a problem that threatened not only the peace of his realm but even the survival of his empire hed always envisioned a federation of loosely linked selfgoverning states with hal reigning over england normandy and anjou richard over aquitaine and geoffrey over brittany each one following the customs of his own domains but bound by a common interest a mutual commitment to a dynasty capable of dominating all the great houses of europe this was to be his legacy but in those early days of january he was forced to face a troubling truththat upon his death his sons might well turn upon one another tearing apart all that hed labored and fought for and attracting a multitude of enemies drawn by the scent of blood this was the greatest threat hed ever faced for it came from within but as was his way once he acknowledged the problem he set about finding a means to resolve it one of his greatest strengths had always been his ability to remain dispassionate only in his clash with thomas becket had that ability failed him with tragic consequences now though he found himself caught up in the same sort of emotional turmoil unable to judge his sons as a king not a father his awareness of this weakness eroded some of his innate selfconfidence and for one of the few times in his life he sought validation and support from others there had never been many allowed into his trusted inner circle and death and distance had whittled the number down even further his parents were dead so were his brother will and his greatly mourned cousin roger thomas becket had been elevated from kings confidant to holy martyr ranulf was in wales and eleanor banished from his bed and to the outer edges of his heart hed always assumed that hed have his sons as allies once they were grown but that fire had burned down to ashes and smoldering cinders giving off neither heat nor light and so he reached out now to the only ones whose loyalty was neither suspect nor tainted by past betrayals and confided in his friend willem and his son geoff they listened in sympathetic silence as he unburdened his heart confessed to his fears that his familys unity was broken beyond repair and at last admitted that the son hed loved the best was the one whod inflicted the deepest wounds hals bright luster was dimming and he could no longer deny his doubts about the sort of king his eldest would be how was he to rout the demons let loose at caen how was he to patch together a peace between his sons that would not die with him pacing restlessly in his bedchamber at le mans the room in which hed taken his first breath nigh on fifty years ago he told them that hed convinced richard to surrender clairvaux but if he could not reconcile richard and his rebel barons he feared that hal would be tempted again to taste that forbidden fruit and there would be no shortage of serpents to beguile him as for richard he was a fine soldier and showed promise of becoming a brilliant battle commander but hed yet to learn that there were times when he could win more by concessions than by threats and intimidation so it was his intent henry explained to summon richards disgruntled lords to a peace council at mirebeau where he hoped to address their grievances and persuade richard that compromise and flexibility were also arrows in an archers quiver neither willem nor geoff saw much chance of success in these plans for they were convinced the barons of aquitaine were as changeable as the shifting sands and trusting henrys sons was like toting water in a sieve they would never have admitted that to henry though and so they nodded and made appropriate responses indicating agreement and optimism and when he told them that he also meant to have his sons renew their oaths of allegiance to him and to enter into a compact of perpetual peace with one another they struggled to hide an emotion that henry had rarely if ever invoked in othersa sorrowful sense of pity but they did not know how to heal henrys ailing family any more than he did and so they could only hopeas he didthat a solemn oath could avert the coming calamity after theyd gone henry slumped into a chair stretching his legs toward the fire if hed been on the other side of the channel hed have called for a horse and ridden for winchester it was not that he expected eleanor to have the answers that eluded him but only the mother of their sons could understand the depths of his despair hed been sleeping poorly since hals dramatic confession and he must have dozed for a time for he jerked upright in his seat to find geoffrey leaning over him let me get you some wine papa he said i was about to knock when i heard you cry out a bad dream i suppose handing henry a wine cup he stepped back can you spare some moments for me of course henry drank then set the cup down in the floor rushes would you be willing to do homage again to your brother if i asked it of you why not geoffrey said sounding puzzled as duke of normandy hal is the liege lord for brittany so why would i object why indeed henry murmured at least one of his sons was amenable to reason i am going to need your help geoffrey in settling this feud between your brothers richard has agreed to yield clairvaux but we both know that will not be the end of it geoffreys eyes had widened did he by god he said softly that is a surprise mayhap if you talked to them i doubt that theyd heed me but im willing to try of course if you wish it good lad henry roused himself to ask geoffrey if he wanted wine too and then leaned back in the chair closing his eyes he could not remember the last time hed been so bonetired it seemed so long since hed awakened each morning eager for what the day would bring when had the joy begun to seep from his life when had his losses begun to loom so large papa i came here to talk with you about the honour of richmond constance and i will have been wed two years come august so we have been patient but how much longer must we wait for what is rightfully ours if youd rather give me nantes that is your choice but richmond or nantes one or the other i can see no reason why youd continue to withhold them it is a matter of fairness if nothing else henry opened his eyes reluctantly geoffrey had been handsomely provided for given a great heiress and a duchy how many third sons could say that but no matter how much he gave them his sons always wanted more and if he handed richmond over to geoffrey now that would only add to hals discontent only strengthen his belief that his brothers were reaping benefits that had been denied to him i will endow you with the honour of richmond but not just yet this would not be the best time to do that not whilst hal and richard are at each others throats once ive resolved their differences i will give consideration to your request till then you must be patient it is not as if you need the incomes from richmond after all the revenues of brittany are more than sufficient to provide you and constance with all the comforts you could ever need i daresay hal would thank god fasting for your resources henry saw the shadow that crossed his sons face and sighed i promise you that i will give you both richmond and nantes when the time is right getting stiffly to his feet he looked longingly at his bed as weary as he was mayhap tonight hed be able to sleep through till dawn can you summon my squires lad i sent them off so i could speak with willem and geoff ill see to it geoffrey had not moved though and henry gave him a quizzical look over his shoulder was there something else you wanted to discuss with me besides richmond no geoffrey said were done chapter thirtyfive january angers anjou hal was having a run of luck he seemed unable to lose winning every throw of the dice he was usually elated when he won at raffle but on this cold wet afternoon he was finding it difficult to focus upon the game his thoughts kept straying to other matters he was still brooding over his brothers improbable decision to surrender clairvaux castle he would have wagered the surety of his soul that the old man would never be able to coerce or coax richard into cooperating and now what without clairvaux there was no reason for rebelling at least none that his father would accept if i surrender unconditionally his friend raoul de farci pleaded playfully can we switch over to hazard hal didnt care which game they played and raoul quickly removed the third dice before he could change his mind he had no opportunity to cast the remaining dice though for hals brother had materialized at the table and was insisting that hal come with him the other men were not happy at forfeiting the chance to recoup their losses but geoffrey was not to be denied and they could only watch glumly as hal was spirited away hal followed his brother out into the bailey with poor grace he did not see why he must be the one to inspect geoffreys lame stallion their father had forgotten more about healing horses than hed ever known but he could not muster up the energy to object it was sleeting again and he felt damp and chilled by the time they entered the stables several grooms throwing dice scrambled to their feet looking discomfited when geoffrey flipped a few coins their way and suggested they warm up with mulled wine they did not argue and eagerly abandoned their duties hal was standing by one of the stalls regarding geoffreys stallion and looking perplexed if this horse is lame he is hiding it remarkably well what is this about geoff well either i needed to talk with you out of earshot of eavesdroppers or i just fancied a stroll over to the stables geoffrey glanced around to make sure they were alone i saw papa this morn he wants us to enter into a compact of perpetual peace and swear to abide by his disposition of his domains then he asked me again if i was willing to do homage to you for brittany none of this was news to hal and none of it seemed worth freezing his butt over so even in the subdued stable lighting geoffreys eyes shone like silver he is also going to ask richard to do homage to you for aquitaine hals jaw dropped i am not richards liege lord he owes allegiance for aquitaine to the french king geoffrey had often marveled at hals fondness for belaboring the obvious i know and you may be damned sure that so does brother richard richard will never agree never hal burst out laughing and when he refuses ever so rudely papa will be so wroth with him that my minor sins will be forgotten geoff this is a gift from god how else explain itunless the old man has gone stark raving mad he is not mad geoffrey said just desperate and he frowned for however much he told himself that his father did not deserve it he still felt an unwelcome flicker of pity richard stared at his father in shock you cannot be serious as suspicious as he so often was of henrys schemes hed never expected this i will never agree to so outrageous a demand hal and i stand as equals just as he lays legitimate claim to your crown and lands so do i lay claim to my mothers inheritance i owe him nothing for aquitaine and i owe you nothing either henry had known how difficult it would be to gain richards consent and he was prepared to be as patient as needed will you listen first whilst i explain my reasoning why i want you to no i will not aquitaine is my mothers and it is mine and i will never give that lazy idle drone any rights over it i have been unable to gain my mothers freedom but i can safeguard the independence of her homeland and by god i will you can at least hear me out but richard was already heading for the door and when henry started after him his son slammed it resoundingly in his face richard was conferring with the most trusted of his household knights for he and andre de chauvigny were cousins andres mother being eleanors aunt so tense was the atmosphere in the chamber that they jumped like startled cats when a knock sounded at the door i am seeing no one rico richard instructed his squire and the youth hurried to do his bidding as soon as hed opened the door though he spun around to face richard his eyes as round as moons my lord he stammered itit is the king richard was impressed that his father had been the one to seek him out but he was not about to show it folding his arms across his chest he regarded henry stonily andre did not share his sangfroid and quickly found excuses to leave with rico right behind him richard we need to talk no we do not there is nothing you can say that i care to hear do you not even want to know why i would ask that of you i already know whybecause youd go to any lengths to secure my idiot brothers feeble hold on power henry shook his head vehemently no you are wrong i am trying to protect you not hal richard was so obviously taken aback that henry seized his chance and said quickly an act of homage is a doublebladed sword yes it would impose obligations upon you but it would do the same for hal as your liegelord he would be honorbound to respect your rule in aquitaine would no longer feel so free to conspire with your vassals he would owe you protection and you could hold him to that richard wondered if his father really believed hal could be fettered by an oath i am quite capable of defeating hal on my own indeed i would welcome the opportunity do not hold your brother too cheaply richard once i am dead he will have the resources of england normandy and anjou to draw upon money to hire more routiers than you could hope to count nor would he lack for allies in aquitaine youve seen to that let him do his best richard said with such bitter bravado that henry took a step toward him yearning to shake some sense into this stubborn son of his i am trying to help you lad why will you not let me he sounded so sincere that richard almost believed him assuming your intentions are good he said with less hostility it changes nothing i will never agree to do homage to hal aquitaine is mine for how long christ jesus can you not see the danger youd be facing and not just aquitaine would be at risk if you and your brother lunge for each others throats as soon as i draw my last breath what do you think will happen to my empire my lifes work would be undone in a matter of months if you and hal cannot make peace our enemies would be drawn by the scent of blood and who do you think theyd choose to side with theyd flock to hal the way wolves go after a crippled deer and after they helped take you down theyd turn on him can you not see the truth in what i am saying i can think of no other way to rein hal in to safeguard my legacy and to keep our family from being ripped asunder i do not blame you for fearing a future in which hal is king his reign will make stephens look like a golden age but the survival of your empire is not my responsibility i am the duke of aquitaine not the king of england as for our family it is too late that ship has already run aground no youre wrong richard it is not too late i will not accept that delude yourself if you will it is no longer my concern henry drew a labored breath what must i do to get you to agree you have nothing i want are you so sure of that richards eyes narrowed what are you saying that youd be willing to free my mother henry had been braced for this if that is the price i must pay for your cooperation yes i will release eleanor after you do homage to hal no ill do homage after you release her they stared at each other having reached the end of the road once again but this impasse was to be different than their others instead of storming out henry sat down wearily in the closest seat do you remember asking me at caen why i would not release eleanor whyare you going to answer me now and to richards amazement his father nodded i am not seeking to punish her in all honesty i doubt that i could ever fully forgive her betrayal but ten years have passed and weve made our peace even you cannot deny that her life is much more comfortable than it once was she has her own chamberlain again her own servants despite your suspicions i have no intention of keeping tilda from her i let joanna see her did i not and the wound was still bleeding then richard was searching henrys face intently his voice was drained of rage even those defensive echoes seemed to come more from force of habit than genuine indignation why then why have you not set her free becausebecause i no longer fear shed conspire against me but i do believe shed do so for your sake or for your brothers if one of you rebelled again that was such a simple answer one that made sense to richard and he wondered why it had not occurred to him picking up a stool he carried it over and seated himself next to henry maman has always had an appreciation for irony but this is a jest worthy of lucifer himself she told me once that much of your troubles could be traced to the fact that you saw her as your queen and she saw herself as the duchess of aquitaine you could not have picked a worse time papa to come around to her point of view at that hint of grim humor henrys head came up sharply hed not truly expected richard to understand had fallen back upon utter honesty because he had no more weapons at hand he saw now though that this son was capable of the sort of dispassionate analysis that had been the cornerstone of his own success and that was a revelation richard was discovering that he felt more kindly toward his father now that he knew his mothers confinement had not been rooted in vengefulness it was even a perverse sort of compliment he supposed that papa had recognized what a formidable adversary shed be even if she were a woman but she was a woman with a mans brain and a mans daring and she ruled a duchy richer than the domains of the french king we are going to have to do something that does not come easily to either of us then he said wryly we are going to have to trust each other henry exhaled a deep breath hed almost forgotten to breathe for the first time he saw in richard what his wife had seen and it was a bittersweet moment this realization that his second son would have made a far better king than hal you will do homage to your brother then he said cautiously here at angers on the morrow the younger mans mouth tightened but he gave a terse nod if you will give the order on the morrow to set my mother free i will henry said and richard studied him pensively at last able to see the man in the masterful king and the flawed father it was a pity he thought that theyd not been able to talk like this until nowwhen it was too late hal would not honor an oath of homage even if he meant well hed fall victim to the blandishments of others let himself be talked into treason again my beloved brother the male whore and now god help him but papa is starting to see it too but if agreeing would gain mamans freedom and buy him time to make ready for hals future aggression he would not begrudge the priceor so he tried to convince himself constance was seated on a bench in her bedchamber while juvette unfastened her braids when geoffrey entered he seemed in good spirits teasing juvette snatching up an ivory comb so he could brush out his wifes long dark hair claiming hed never understood why troubadours lavished such praise on day when any man of discernment found true beauty in the night juvette giggled for she was a brunette too and constance marveled how her husband managed to turn sensible girls into simpering sheep with a smile and a few polished gallantries when geoffrey deftly steered juvette toward the door though constances interest sharpened if he wanted more privacy than their curtained bed provided either he had something confidential to tell her or he had one of his erotic games in mind lacking imagination herself shed come to value this attribute in her husband as soon as they were alone she turned to look up into his face one glance was all she needed for by now shed learned to see past the mask he showed the rest of the world what is wrong geoffrey hed already bolted the door once juvette departed i am beginning to believe my father puts merlin to shame if my suspicions are right he could turn dross into gold i think he has somehow convinced richard to do homage to hal constance was astonished that is not possibleis it you tell me richard was planning to leave angers at first light but he changed his mind of a suddenafter my father made a surprise visit to his private chamber and they were later seen in the hall conversing together with remarkable amiability given the outrageous demand hed made of richard constance did not ask how he knew so much of richards plans for geoffrey believed that knowledge was power and he paid well enough to attract reliable agents i fear you may be right richard must have come to terms with your father for nothing else explains his behavior it makes no sense though why would richard ever agree geoffrey shrugged witchcraft threats a staggeringly rich bribewho knows but if ive guessed rightly the rebellion has breathed its last gasp which means our best chance of gaining nantes or richmond has given up the ghost too constance gnawed her lower lip a habit she reverted to under stress she and geoffrey had agreed after considerable deliberation that their only hope of claiming the rest of her rightful inheritance depended upon hals alliance with the rebels if he won control of aquitaine hed reward them with the promised poitevin castles now and richmond and nantes once he became king given the lavish way hed been willing to compensate his allies during the last revolt they had no worries that hed renege upon the deal and if he lost it was still possible that they could win for the unrest might give them the leverage they needed to pressure henry into giving up richmond at least and if the rebellion sputters out like a quenched candle geoffrey said morosely well actually lose more than hal those routiers i hired did not come cheap and if i have to cut them loose theyre likely to do what masterless men usually do and plunder the breton countryside the way richards dismissed routiers sacked bordeaux a few years back constance frowned at this reminder of their financial investment in the rebellion for she was thrifty by nature lets assume the worst and youre right about richard why does that mean the rebellion is dead why not just delayed until a more opportune time because hal is ruled by whim and who knows what hell decide to do six months or a year from now and because if richard really does homage he will earn himself unlimited credit with my father for the foreseeable future which means that papa is likely to turn a blind eye to richards border incursions as they were convinced that richard was too predatory a neighbor for comfort this was a prospect that they both found daunting constance chewed on her lower lip again thinking that richards next clairvaux castle could well be on breton soil well she said then we have to make sure that richard does not do homage to hal theyd dissected hals failings with merciless honesty but theyd not really discussed richards weaknesses you know richard better than i do geoffrey where is he most vulnerable to attack at one time id have said his temper but he is showing signs of learning selfcontrol so i would say his hubris i already know you had a fine education so you need not flaunt it what is hubris pride he said vainglory arrogance vanity all terms that can fairly be applied to brother richard constance nodded thoughtfully so we have a man who is prideful and hottempered surely you can find a way to turn those traits against him he was silent for some moments and then he smiled yes he said i think i do know a way before a distinguished audience of bishops barons and highborn lords geoffrey did homage to his brother for brittany and then it was richards turn making little attempt to hide his aversion he came forward fixed hal with a baleful hawks stare and knelt in the floor rushes before he could speak hal held up his hand for silence and beckoned to his chaplain the man hastened over cradling a silvergift reliquary as if it contained the host itself hal accepted it with equal solemnity although as his eyes met his coconspirators he winked geoffrey winced thinking that if this was hals idea of circumspection god have mercy upon them all smiling down at his glowering brother hal seemed in no hurry for the ceremony to begin and henry frowned for he was taking too much obvious pleasure in richards submission all eyes were upon his sons and henry could see the bafflement on many faces from the moment hed announced that richard would do public homage to hal thered been no other topic of conversation at angers for none could figure out how hed gotten richard to agree to this wanting to get it over as soon as possible exasperated by behavior he saw as juvenile and petty henry shot his eldest son a warning look making up his mind then and there to return clairvaux castle to richards custody and if hal liked it not what of it taking his cue at last hal again signaled unnecessarily for quiet an act of homage is not to be entered into lightly he said gravely whilst i am gladdened that my brother the duke of aquitaine has offered to do so i regret that i cannot accept his oath without some misgivings richard stiffened henry took an involuntary step forward and a low buzz swept the hall hal let the suspense build for a few moments longer noticing that his brothers eyes had fastened suspiciously upon the reliquary holding it up as if it were an actors prop he said loudly as sorry as i am to say it i cannot trust the lord dukes sworn word without additional validation therefore i would have him swear homage to me upon these blessed holy relics so that there will be no doubts as to his good faith bedlam ensued even more chaotic than hal had hoped catquick richard was on his feet his face flushed with incredulous fury his lips peeled back in a snarl that went unheard in the confusion henry looked no less dumbfounded staring at hal in disbelief and then utter outrage quarrels were breaking out across the hall as richards followers began to exchange insults and threats with hals household knights watching from the sidelines geoffrey kept his face carefully impassive but inwardly he was relishing the moment a master puppeteer whod succeeded even beyond his expectations richard had leaped onto the dais was telling hal in no uncertain terms exactly what he could do with those holy relics and if his suggestion was anatomically impossible it was nonetheless an eloquent declaration of his mood at the moment by then henry had reached them and as richard cursed his brother to hell for all eternity he grabbed hal in a grip that would leave bruises have you lost your bloody mind come with menow hal was not pleased to have his dignity disparaged like this but henrys fingers had clamped onto his wrist like talons and he decided against attempting to break free not wanting to be seen physically brawling with his father in public as henry pulled hal toward the stairwell richard turned on his heel and made a dramatic departure slamming out of the hall as people scattered out of his way and his men made haste to follow constance moved to geoffreys side with a low throaty well done meant only for his ears they were soon joined by several of the bishops and when they entreated him to act as peacemaker between henry and hal he graciously agreed to do what he could in the interest of family harmony as he mounted the steps geoffrey could hear the yelling only slightly muffled by the closed door entering without knocking he found his father and brother glaring at each other both shouting at once neither listening geoffrey closed the door and then leaned back against it to watch henry was as angry as hed ever seen him giving off as much heat as a flaming torch berating hal bitterly for his lunacy his irresponsible selfish blundering saying all that hed kept bottled up for years hal was more in control but he was angry too defending himself by casting as much blame as possible upon richard his chest heaving his blood pounding in his ears henry at last exhausted even his hoard of invectives once his rage no longer burned so hotly his suspicions began to flare up with that insulting demand you alienated richard to the point where hes not likely to ever agree to do homage again is that what you had in mind halto cripple my efforts to make peace between you of course not hal exclaimed indignantly and geoffrey decided it was time to intervene not wanting to give their father a chance to dwell upon those suspicions hal is not alone in his mistrust of richard papa he said moving to step between them i share it too i daresay you do not want to hear this but we know richard better than you do and he has given us reason time and time again to doubt his good will to suspect his good faith hals method may have been lacking in subtlety but he was only trying to protect himself hoping that a sacred oath might be more binding upon richard than the one he intended to make henry was inclined to give geoffrey more credence at that moment than hal but their treacherous ravening richard did not resemble the man hed bargained with last night whatever your suspicions hal you could not have handled it worse i am not even sure i can repair the damage youve done this day when hal would have argued further henry cut him short weve said enough he said curtly better that we discuss this later once our tempers have had time to cool and turning away he left the chamber left them alone together hoping that geoffrey might be able to convince hal that compromise was an important aspect of statecraft hed spoken the truth when hed confessed that he did not know if richard could be placated knew only that he dreaded trying could he truly blame richard if he suspected collusion if hed concluded that hed been led into an ambush retreating to his own chamber he pondered the best way to heal this ugly breach between his sons he could think of only one way to convince richard of his good faith and while it would not be easy for him to do his son had spoken true yesterday they had to trust each other if he still held to his part of the bargain and ordered eleanors release that should convince richard that hed known nothing of hals duplicity deciding that once again he must be the one to come to richard he rose tiredly from the bed limping slightly for his bad leg was sensitive to wet weather the bailey was muddy but at least the rain had eased up catching sight of his steward he called the man over it might be best to avoid any surprises to give richard warning that he was on his way when he instructed the man to carry this message to his son though the steward flushed in dismay i am sorry my liege he mumbled looking anywhere but at henrys face i thought sure someone would have told youthe lord duke is gone he and his men rode out immediately after thethe altercation in the hall he did not even take the time to pack left his clothes behind in his chamber hal escorted marguerite to her mare assisted her to mount she was pale but her eyes were dry shed shed her tears already in the privacy of their bedchamber as shed argued against being sent to her brothers court in paris she did not want to go she could not counter hals contention that it was too dangerous for her to remain as long as war might be looming shed had no answer for him when hed reminded her how shed been caught by henry at poitiers and held in honorable confinement for several months she still did not want to go for she did not trust hals protestations of innocence she suspected that he was still conspiring with the rebel lords against richard and she had a terrifying premonition that if they were parted now she might never see him again hed laughed away her fears assuring her that she had no cause for concern that even if richard forced a war hed be in no danger holding her hand in his he pressed a kiss into her palm and promised that hed soon join her in paris she mustered up a brave farewell smile trying very hard to believe him constance was no happier than marguerite shed quarreled with geoffrey for days to no avail for he was stubbornly set upon having her accompany marguerite to paris shed preferred to return to rennes but he insisted that shed be safer in france in the event the war went badly for them shed finally stopped arguing although she had no intention of humoring him once they were well away from angers she meant to inform her escort that thered been a change of plans and theyd be heading back to brittany standing in the castle bailey with geoffrey she found herself reluctant to mount her mare reluctant to leave she realized that her reluctance was illogical she could not very well ride to war with him yet she continued to linger delaying her departure with needless questions and lastminute admonitions it was disconcerting to recognize the real reason for her disquietfear for his safety she was not accustomed to worrying about someone elses welfare and did not like the sensation in the least nor did she want to sound foolish by urging him to take care instead she wrapped her arms around his neck and gave him a kiss that was not at all wifely breathing in his ear a promise to celebrate his victory with a game of the novice nun and the lecherous monk geoffrey laughed said with an incentive like that how could he possibly lose and helped her up into the saddle henry had come out to bid his daughtersinlaw a safe journey and he joined geoffrey as the womens escort mounted and they headed off hal went back indoors but geoffrey remained in the bailey to watch their departure so did henry he looked drawn and tired for hed not been sleeping well hed sent an urgent message after richard but so far thered been no reply he knew though that richard would have to come to mirebeau for the peace conference with the rebels of poitou and the limousin and he hoped then that hed be able to give richard the reassurances he clearly needed how he would reconcile richard and hal he did not yet know but he told himself that he could only take one step at a time for now he had to concentrate upon making peace between richard and his defiant barons and with that in mind he drew geoffrey aside i want you to go to limoges on my behalf do whatever it takes but convince viscount aimar and the others that they must meet with me at mirebeau assure them that i will hear their grievances and richard and i will work out some sort of accord can you do that for me geoffrey his son looked startled but then he smiled i can do that he said chapter thirtysix january angers anjou henry walked to the hearth and thrust a parchment into the fire wrinkling his nose as an acrid smell of burning sheepskin filled the chamber when hed been unable to dictate the letter to his scribe hed dismissed the man and tried to write it himself to no avail the words just would not come how could he tell eleanor that the curse of cain had afflicted their two eldest sons he wanted to believe that hed be able to patch up a peace between hal and richard but for once his innate optimism and boundless selfconfidence were guttering like candles in the wind the survival of his empire had been predicated upon the premise of family solidarity hed envisioned hal as ruling over a loose federation ably supported by his brothers in aquitaine and brittany hed expected that they would be allies never enemies no he could not burden eleanor with such knowledge at least he could take action do what he could to mend the breach she could only grieve and blame herselfjust as he was blaming himself as suspicious as he still was of her influence over their sons he knew this was not her doing she would never have deliberately tried to set hal and richard at odds better that she not know hed reluctantly sent tilda an oblique warning for she and heinrich had settled in at domfront castle in normandy and theyd likely hear of the confrontation at angers with luck though the channel might keep gossip and rumor from reaching eleanors ears at least until hed been able to repair these fraying brotherly bonds he was watching the parchment burn when willem and geoff were escorted into the solar and some of his edginess eased in their familiar presence thank god almighty that there were still a few men whom he could trust they were discussing his plans for the mirebeau council when hal joined them and he entered enthusiastically into the conversation criticizing the various limousin barons as if these same men had not been his conspirators only a few months past henry watched his performance without comment wondering how this stranger had gained possession of his sons body he refused to believe that hal had always been this shallow and selfcentered could only assume that hed somehow missed the warning signs that hal was losing his way he refused too to look too far into the future a man whod always been one for longrange planning now he took one day at a time today he must reconcile his sons and then reconcile richard and his barons tomorrowtomorrow he would figure out how to keep hal from heeding the seductive whispers of the serpent and taking another taste of the forbidden fruit they were interrupted briefly when a servant entered and murmured a few words for henrys ear alone his gaze fastening upon his son he knew hal would soon be seeking entertainment elsewhere and he gave the man a lowvoiced directive with that in mind as hed predicted it was not long before hal lost interest and found an excuse to depart but it gave henry no satisfaction that he was now able to read the younger man so accurately he wished that like eleanor he could have remained in blissful ignorance of his eldest sons failings both as a man and as a king once hal had gone henry moved over to warm himself by the fire before telling geoff and willem that his best agent had arrived and was about to be ushered up to the solar i told matthew to wait until my son went back to the great hall he said and shook his head when they offered to leave no there is no need to go youve met him already willem and it is time that you did too geoff a memory stirred for willem i remember the young man who was spying upon the french king for you his name wasluc no well that is the name he was using henry said with a faint smile he has not been at the french court for well over a twelvemonth though his mother was born in the limousin and after she was widowed she chose to return to her family in limoges she took ill last year and luc hastened to limoges to look after her until she recovered hed intended to return to philippes service but when he discovered that one of his cousins was a household knight of viscount aimars he thought that might be a better place to fish than paris and arranged to be taken on too henry smiled again i suspect he was finding life rather dull at philippes court whereas the limousin was bound to be a fertile ground for intrigue and rebellion which is mothers milk to him i am surprised that he did not discover hals plotting for he misses little and my son plays at conspiracy as if it were a game of campball i can only assume that aimar was more careful geoff looked away lest his father see his anger for he knew his was an expressive face he did not have a forgiving nature as hed be the first to admit and hed never forgiven his half brothers or the queen for their betrayal he was an admirer of richards battle skills and he thought that geoffrey was showing a deft touch in his dealings with the breton lords but he had no use whatsoever for hal was one of the few at court who was utterly immune to the young kings charm when luc was escorted into the chamber willem had to remind himself that nigh on nine years had passed for the younger man seemed to have kept time at bay he looked much as he had when willem had last seen him on the road to rouen he still put willem in mind of a wolf masquerading as a domestic dog sleek and supple and dangerous stepping forward luc knelt at the kings feet henrys welcoming smile faded as he got his first look at lucs face his agent was so somber that he knew at once something was very wrong gesturing for luc to rise he braced himself for yet more bad news what have you come to tell me what i wish could have been done by someone else my liege luc said in a low voice and when his dark eyes locked with henrys grey ones the older man was chilled by what he saw in thempity my lord king there is no easy way to say it your son has betrayed you henrys relief was so great that he laughed aloud you need not tread so carefully luc i already know of my sons scheming with the viscount of limoges and the others the young king made a full and public confession at my caen christmas court luc sighed and then shook his head you do not understand my liege i am not speaking of the young king but of your other son the duke of brittany henry was incredulous and then enraged that is a lie luc faced his anger without flinching my lord king do you truly believe i would give you such grief if i were not sure i ask you only to hear me out henry was regretting his flare of temper luc had earned better than that he was mistakenobviouslybut he was not lying speak then he said i will listen the lord duke arrived in limoges last week luc began and henry could not help interrupting i know that luc i sent geoffrey to limoges instructing him to persuade aimar and the other barons to meet me next month at mirebeau so there is nothing suspicious about his presence there i know his peace mission was the public reason given for his arrival in limoges but what troubled me from the first was that aimar and the others welcomed lord geoffrey more like an ally than a mediator i had no proof nothing to go on but my instincts theyve served me well in the past though and so i kept my eyes open and my ears pricked the duke is a cautious man not one to boast of his shifting alliances but i got lucky i happened to overhear him instructing a courier and so i trailed inconspicuously after them into the stables he gave the man a sealed letter told him that it must be delivered to lord raoul de fougeres without delay and warned him of the urgency of his undertaking i do not find it strange that hed be sending a message to one of his breton barons henry said but he was now sounding more defensive than defiant for he too put a great deal of trust in lucs instincts it could well have been utterly innocent luc admitted i knew only that i wanted to get my hands upon that letter and so when the courier rode out i followed him i did not expect to get a chance to steal it until that evening but the fool stopped in a limoges tavern on his way out of town and put away enough wine to need to relieve himself in an alley nearby i slipped in behind him and clouted him ere he even knew i was there luc would normally have digressed from his account at this point explaining there was a spot behind the ear that could render a man unconscious ere he hit the ground for henry was interested in esoteric facts like that now though he knew better for the kings color was taking on a waxen hue i took his purse and ring too to make it look like a robbery and i am sure that was how he explained it to the lord duke when he eventually woke up doubtless conjuring up three or four brigands against whom hed struggled fiercely when henry said nothing luc reached into his tunic and withdrew a rolled parchment youll recognize the lord dukes seal sire he tells raoul de fougeres to dispatch the routiers theyd hired saying war is imminent and he expects lord richard to take the offensive and strike first so the sooner the routiers can reach the limousin the better henry was still silent but when luc held out the letter he took it glancing down at the elegant slanting handwriting he recognized it at once as his sons keeping his gaze upon that damning document he said huskily youll be well rewarded for this service luc but that can wait for now youll be wanting a meal tell my steward to see that youre fed and then to find you a bed and a wench if you want one thank you sire luc murmured and backed out of the solar geoff and willem had sat frozen finding it almost as hard as henry to credit the spys revelation they exchanged troubled glances neither knowing what to say but as the door closed behind luc henry raised his head find my son willem he said fetch him here straightaway so you claim you knew nothing of geoffreys treachery henrys eyes bore into hals and there was such icy accusation in his voice that his eldest felt heat rising in his face jesu of course i did not hal insisted with all the indignation he could muster had i suspected geoffrey was so vulnerable to aimars blandishments id have come to you in private and argued against sending him to limoges how can i doubt you when youve always been so devoted to my interests henry said with sarcasm that cracked like a whip papa i understand that your nerves are on the raw after getting such news but it is not fair to blame me for what geoffrey has done were not even that close if hed been planning this beforehandand i doubt that he washed hardly have confided in me not when he was planning to usurp my place in the rebel plot it is true that you addressed my grievance by taking clairvaux from richard hal paused and then smiled wryly but in all honesty any peace between richard and me is likely to last as long as a whores chastity vow sooner or later hell start lusting after angevin lands again when he does id like to be able to rally his barons to my side and what better way to do that than to put forward my own claim to aquitaine there was a certain wayward logic in hals argument something persuasive in his candid admission that hed not ruled out making another try for aquitaine if circumstances warranted it seeing henrys hesitation hal swiftly pressed his advantage so why would i want to see geoffrey as the new duke of aquitaine if geoffrey held both brittany and aquitaine that would give him far too much power for my comfort i trust geoffrey more than richard but then id trust the saracen chieftain saladin more than richard henry turned to the table poured a cup of wine and let the liquid trickle down his throat but he knew that all the wine in the world would not wash away the foul taste in his mouth sitting down in the closest chair he looked from geoff to willem then back to hal why do you think this was not premeditated because i know how persuasive aimar can be papa if he seduced women the way he seduces allies hed have sired enough bastards to populate an entire city in fairness to aimar he has just cause for loathing life under richards reign it shows you how desperate they are that they turned to geoffrey now that i am no longer available and in fairness to geoffrey i daresay they bedazzled him with their promises aimar is good at that hed never expected more than brittany and that comes with a pricehaving to put up with constance how many younger sons would not have been tempted by the riches of aquitaine you make a curious defense of your brother hal by pleading his weakness and greed who amongst us is without sin papa as far as i am concerned much of the blame rests with richard for geoffrey would not have gotten himself entangled with aimar if richard had not pushed them into rebellion hal was surprised to see how much his father seemed to have aged in a matter of hours and he found himself wanting to offer some genuine consolation moving to henrys side he knelt by him so their eyes were level and said earnestly you ought not to take this too much to heart papa you are not the target hererichard is i hope youll bear that in mind and for once let him reap what he has sown henry looked into hals eyes saw sincerity and sympathy and an utter inability to understand that geoffreys doubledealing was putting their entire empire at risk i am glad we had this talk he said wearily i want you to tell my council and court that geoffrey has gone over to the rebels theyll have to know i will do it now hal promised getting lightly to his feet and letting his hand drop to henrys shoulder in a gesture of comfort glancing toward the other men he said willem geoff do you want to come with me again that rueful smile surfaced i know how tattered my credibility is in some eyes and none would doubt either of you when willem rose geoff had no choice but to rise too wishing he had the power to see into his brothers brain he regarded hal with poorly concealed antagonism he was willing to admit that hals performance had been convincing but that was the trouble he suspected it was a performance henry gave no indication of wanting him to stay and so he followed the others to the door but then he looked back and what he saw caused him to catch his breath as if hed taken a blow for thinking himself alone henry had leaned forward and buried his face in his hands by the time he found willem geoff was seething so flushed and distraught that he looked as if he were at risk for an apoplectic fit have you heard he demanded hal has offered to go to limoges to coax geoffrey into abandoning the rebels and my father has agreed to let him i know willem said morosely but for gods sake lower your voice geoff or theyll be able to hear you in saumur i think my father has lost his mind geoff said but in more circumspect tones how can he trust hal on such a mission lets assume he is not already in this plot up to his neck though that takes more faith than i have how is he supposed to bring geoffrey back to the fold he has as much backbone as a hemp rope and like as not geoffrey will talk him into joining the rebellion you do not have to convince me geoff i agree with you then you must go to my father make him see that this is a great mistake i tried but hed not hear me mayhap if you voiced your concerns too i already have to no avail he would not heed me either geoffs breath hissed through his teeth and his chest heaved as he sought to get his temper under control why he asked simply and willem had no answer for him i do not know he confessed i remember the way harry was ere he did penance at canterbury you were not with us then geoff but he sailed in a gale that the devil himself would have shunned it was almost as if he were leaving his fate up to the almighty leaving it to god to choose whether he prevailed or not it may be that he is doing that again willem shook his head and repeated i just do not know none of that made any sense to geoff what can we do willems shoulders slumped we can pray that his trust in hal is justified hal crossed the chamber and embraced his father which hed not done in years you will not be sorry papa ill not let you down he promised when all this is done youll have no reasons for regrets go with god hal henry said softly not moving until the young king had departed the chamber he went then to the window flung the shutters open and heedless of the cold gazed down into the castle bailey hal soon emerged and started toward his men who were already mounted catching sight of willem and geoff he veered in their direction henry could not hear what was being said he assumed hal was bidding them farewell willem ever the courtier was responding courteously but geoff was glowering looking rather like richard in one of his rages henry knew they were distraught over his decision to let hal go after geoffrey it was not something he could explain though for it was neither logical nor wise in light of hals past history it was not the king who was setting hal loose it was the father his head and heart were at war and he could no longer endure the uncertainty he had to know if his eldest son could be trusted and this was the only way to find out if hal let him down it could not be more painful than geoffreys betrayal for hed never seen that coming at least thered be no surprise if hal confirmed his fears and betrayed him too better he knew the worst for then he could deal with it hal was mounted now on a prancing grey stallion glancing up he saw henry and waved jauntily before riding out henry stayed at the window not moving until long after hal was no longer in sight for months hals emotions had been swinging back and forth like a pendulum in a high wind never had he felt so conflicted so confused whenever richard had the upper hand hed burned to bring his brother down furious and frustrated that his chance for rebellion was slipping away but whenever richard had taken a misstep and fallen from their fathers favor hed been beset by doubts feeling as if he was being pressured into making a decision ere he was ready hed departed angers in high spirits confident and eager for what lay ahead the trip had been long enough though for misgivings to creep back in and as he approached limoges he felt more like a hostage to fortune than the commander of his own fate limoges was actually two cities the ville which held the great abbey of st martial and the viscounts castle and the cite site of the bishops palace and cathedral each was enclosed within its own ramparts and as was so often the case the rivalry between the ville and the cite was not goodnatured as they were coming from the north hal reached the ville first and he drew rein once they neared the montmeiller gate saying a silent prayer that hed made the right decision and asking the almighty to send another sign that it was so the gates were open and they were close enough now to see the people thronging the narrow streets waving and cheering hal and his men rode into a warm welcome found themselves acclaimed as heroes by people eager to throw off duke richards yoke hal was already popular in limoges for hed always been generous with his spending and almsgiving and now he was hailed as their savior the man who would deliver them from richards harsh rule hals spirits soared and he acknowledged the acclaim with grace and a shower of coins this was clearly a good omen a portent of success to come and he forgot the qualms that had been nagging at him in recent days he hadnt been lying when hed assured henry that hed have no reason for regrets for he honestly believed that all of their problems would be resolved if only he could gain control of aquitaine the duchys deep coffers would allow him to support his household in kingly style no longer dependent upon henrys miserly pension and that would be bound to improve their relationship eliminating the worst bone of contention between them once richard was defeated all would be well ahead lay the viscounts castle and he saw his brother and aimar standing in the gateway watching his triumphant procession with banners streaming in the wind escorted by the enthusiastic citizenry hal reined in before them swung to the ground and embraced geoffrey then aimar an imaginative touch geoffrey said dryly looking to the conspicuous white flag of truce and hal grinned sure that he was where he was meant to be doing gods work and soon to have the power that a king ought to wield chapter thirtyseven february gorre limousin the village was a scene of devastation the houses that were not charred ruins had doors smashed in their contents ransacked by men in search of booty some of the soldiers were sleeping in these cottages finding them more comfortable than their tents and the stench was rank for routiers rarely bothered to dig latrines a few bodies lay where theyd fallen those villagers whod not fled in time piles of entrails were strewn about what was left of livestock butchered for food the animals that were not needed by the camp cooks were dead too for one of the aims of a chevauchee was to wreak havoc upon an enemys lands even the cemetery had not been spared some of the graves dug up by men hoping to find that the more prosperous burghers had been buried with rings or other valuables raymond brunnus barely noticed the destruction for it was too familiar a sight to register with him in the two decades since hed left his native gascony in search of profit and adventure hed sold his sword to more lords than he could remember taking naturally to the lawless life of a mercenary when his nephew william arnald had sent him a message that there were easy pickings in the limousin and the viscount of limoges and the young english king were eager to hire routiers hed wasted no time in leading his men north one of his scouts had reported that the viscount and his nephews routiers were besieging a church in the village of gorre and hed headed there instead of the viscounts city arriving in midmorning under an ashen february sky that warned of a coming storm welcomed boisterously by his nephew he listened without great interest as arnald related how some of the duke of aquitaines men had been ambushed the survivors retreating into gorre and taking shelter in the church by the time they were discovered theyd fortified the building barricaded the windows and doors and burned the external wooden stairway leading up into the bell tower it was a substantial stone structure could not be fired like the village houses and theyd apparently gambled that the routiers would soon grow impatient and seek easier prey that would have happened too arnald admitted had he not sent word to the viscount aimar had ridden the dozen miles from limoges to see for himself and once he learned these were duke richards knights hed set men to building a massive irontipped battering ram raymonds interest quickened for viscount aimars personal involvement indicated rich ransoms were in the offing so there is someone inside whom duke richard will pay dearly to save then arnald shook his head therell be no ransoms seeing his uncles lack of comprehension he took it upon himself to inform the older man of recent developments in the war this is what happened the duke of brittany sent for routiers hed hired earlier in the year and as they moved into poitou they burned and plundered on their way south duke richard raced to head them off and there have been numerous clashes whenever richard caught any of his brothers men he beheaded them right then and there while mass executions were not the norm they were not unheard of either for routiers were considered expendable by both sides even by the men who hired them and they could be slain without fear of church censure and with the enthusiastic support of the people theyd been victimizing raymond had long ago become inured to the hypocrisy of his highborn employers seeing it as an occupational hazard well from what ive heard of duke richard i cannot say that surprises me much ah but he did not just slay lord geoffreys routiers he killed the knights too whoa that was indeed a different kettle of fish the duke and viscount must have loved that they were raving and ranting like madmen arnald confirmed and as their eyes met they shared a moment of grim humor taking some satisfaction that for once the highborn faced the same risks as their lowborn hirelings so arnald continued as soon as the viscount heard that some of richards knights were trapped in the church he saw an opportunity for vengeance though i daresay hed put it more elegantlyas welldeserved retribution slapping his uncle fondly on the shoulder he said come on over and meet your new patron raymond did not move why the viscount id heard the young king was paying more yes hes been putting out word that men can make their fortune in his service but that one has not two coins of his own to rub together youd do better with his brother but duke geoffrey is off raiding into poitou so between the king and the viscount go with lord aimar youll have a much better chance of collecting from him nonpayment was not usually a problem for routiers their lords knew that if they were cheated of their just due theyd turn on their masters without qualm or compunction raymond believed though in keeping things as simple as possible and he accepted his nephews advice saying lead on lad any chance we can fill our bellies ere the assault begins arnald cast an appraising eye toward the men working upon a huge tree trunk they do not have the wheels on it yet so there ought to be time to eat first things first though lets see how much money you can squeeze out of the viscount the viscount of limoges had not always been at war with his angevin overlords hed stayed neutral during the last rebellion of henrys sons but that all changed when his fatherinlaw the earl of cornwall died and henry cheated his wife sarah of her inheritance for that was how he saw it henry himself had arranged aimars marriage and that only exacerbated his grievance as rainalds legitimate son was dead and rico born out of wedlock aimar had expected the earldom to pass to the old earls daughters with sarah the eldest getting the lions share when henry chose to bestow the earldom upon his son john hed turned the hitherto loyal aimar into an embittered rebel until now aimars animosity had been reserved for henry and not his sons but after richards brutal execution of geoffreys breton knights the viscount had sworn a bloodoath that this ruthless prince would never again rule over the limousin casting an eye toward the leaden skies he hoped theyd be able to launch the final assault while there was still light he did not doubt that the battering ram would be able to smash through the churchs thick oaken door it was likely though that the men would retreat up into the bell tower once that happened and they could be difficult to dislodge from that refuge he did not know what provisions theyd managed to bring in with them but they had to be running low on food for theyd been trapped in the church for nigh on a week well if it came to that they could always be starved into submission hed just accepted a wineskin from one of his squires when a sudden urgent shout turned all heads one of their sentries was galloping toward the camp yelling that riders were fast approaching knowing this seasoned soldier would not have been alarmed unless the riders posed a threat aimar whirled and ran for his horse snatching up his helmet jamming it down upon his head he fumbled with the chin cord as he swung up into the saddle all around him men were running and shouting scrambling for weapons and horses whores almost inevitably turned up at an army encampment and some of these women were screaming shrilly even before the riders came into viewclad in chain mail swords drawn and lances leveled mounted on horses caked in lather and dust one glimpse was enough to tell aimar that they were in for a fierce fight one of the lead knights drew aimars attention for he was spurring ahead of his companions encountering a campfire he jumped his stallion neatly over the flames instead of swerving around it an act of horsemanship that the viscount could not help admiring even at a moment like this the knight had caught arnalds eye too darting forward quick as a snake he grabbed for the other mans leg it was a daring maneuver but if successful was guaranteed to unhorse a man aimar had seen arnald drag more than one foe from the saddle this way for the routier was a big man as wellmuscled as a blacksmith what happened next stopped aimar in his tracks the knight under attack did not pull back as men usually did instead he leaned in and suddenly blood was spurting everywhere a red haze before aimars eyes arnald reeled backward his face contorted as he stared in shock at the stump where his hand had been the knights sword was already sweeping down again a powerful blow that all but decapitated the routier aimar heard the command to retreat and was surprised that the order was coming from his throat for hed not made a conscious decision to withdraw but by then hed recognized the knight bloodied with arnalds blood and his instincts for selfpreservation had taken over the awareness that they were facing richard himself banished any desire for battle he was no coward but richard was a lunatic would he be mad enough to execute a man of aimars rank the viscount found that hard to believe but he knew that men could get drunk on bloodlust and he preferred not to put richards sobriety to the test followed by those of his men lucky enough to have reached their horses he spurred his mount toward the limoges road all of them riding as if the devil were on their tails by the time richard rode back into gorre the trapped knights had ventured out and were quenching their thirst at the village well easing their hunger with the meal intended for their foes not all of richards men had followed him in pursuit of aimar and theyd rounded up close to a hundred prisoners the rest of the routiers having been slain or escaped andre de chauvigny grinned at the sight of his duke he had a wineskin in one hand and bread in the other and he waved the loaf over his head in a jubilant joyful salute i won a right goodly sum on you my lord he laughed i wagered two marks that youd arrive in time that was indeed a handsome sum for knights rarely earned more than a shilling a day how could you lose richard pointed out youd either win or youd die and in neither case would you have to pay the wager andre laughed again fortunately alan is as thick as a plank and he never worked that out coming forward as richard slid from the saddle he hovered by the younger mans side overwhelmed by the intensity of his gratitude but not knowing how to express it for banter and mockery were the most common coins of their realm your men said youd ridden for nigh on two days and nights to reach us not having the words he playfully offered the purloined wineskin and loaf joking that all he had was at his lord dukes disposal richard appreciated his cousins insouciance for hed not have been comfortable with earnest protestations or lavish praise not from andre you look like youve been wallowing in a pigsty after an allnight carouse he said which was as near as hed come to acknowledging the harrowing ordeal andre and the others had enduredhungry thirsty and fearing they were doomed i came so close to overtaking that whoreson andre he burst out so bloody close i would have caught him too if my horse was not so winded and worn down some of the other rescued men had gathered around them by now were beginning to offer their thanks with none of andres nonchalance and richard was glad to be interrupted by one of his knights my lord duke what is your wish regarding the prisoners richard looked over at the routiers huddled on the ground bound to one another by ropes subdued and silent all their bravado gone he glanced around at the skeletal remains of gorre and his eyes took on the winter chill of the february sky we will take them with us to aixe he said where other brigands will learn from their sorry fate what befalls those who ravage my lands and my people upon reaching his castle at aixe richard made good on his promise to make an example of the captured routiers some were drowned in the river vienne others had their throats cut and eighty men were blinded unlike his beheading of geoffreys knights this ruthless effective means of denying the routiers future services to the rebel lords occasioned little comment the prior of vigeois abbey even noted approvingly of the treatment meted out to these sons of darkness entering the great hall at aixe andre de chauvigny soon spotted his duke and headed in richards direction richard was conferring quietly with one of his most trusted men a grizzled serjeant whod been in his service since hed been invested with the duchy at age fourteen he smiled as andre approached and once they were alone he surprised his friend by confiding that hed instructed the serjeant to escort his young son to poitiers for safetys sake andre knew richard had an illegitimate son but he knew nothing whatsoever about the child and even less about the childs mother richard was as closemouthed as a clam about such matters agreeing that it was wise to bring the boy to poitiers he confessed then that i do not even know the lads name what was he christened philip richard hesitated and then offered up another rare nugget of private information saying she wanted to name him after her father his shoulders twitched in a whynot shrug i was not about to name him after mine andre knew better than to pursue that further richards troubled relationship with his father was as fraught with peril for the unwary as a walk across a thinly iced lake he asked instead if the rumors were true that the viscount of turenne was bringing more routiers to join aimar and the young king at limoges richard confirmed it and they began an intense discussion of the rebellion and hals prospects until they were interrupted by the arrival of one of richards knights just back from a scouting foray he was not alone his men were dragging a prisoner into the hall a glumlooking man of middle years who was shoved forward to kneel at richards feet we saw him galloping along the limoges road the young knight explained breathlessly and i was curious why he was in such a tearing hurry most men who race the wind are either outlaws on the run or theyre bearing urgent messages so we stopped him searched him and discovered the reason for his haste he is a courier for the french king carrying a letter for your brother the young king he beamed at richard his face aglow with triumph and pride for all knew their duke put a high value upon men who were resourceful and quickwitted nor was he disappointed for richard responded with heartfelt praise delighted that hed earned his lords favor he produced the royal letter with a flourish i did not think it was my place to read it but i recognized the seal as king philippes and after a little persuasion our friend here admitted he was delivering it to your brother well done ancel richard quickly broke the seal and held the letter under a smoking rushlight when he glanced up his face was utterly without expression as blank as a sepulchers graven image and andre felt a frisson of disquiet shoot up his spine summon my seneschal and the other members of my council he instructed andre in a voice that was toneless so dispassionate that the other mans unease flamed into outright alarm richard had never spent much time at aixe a castle hed taken from viscount aimar several years ago and hed expended little money on its upkeep lacking a solar they had to gather in his bedchamber richard stood by the hearth his eyes moving from face to face as if taking inventory of the men he trusted robert de montmirail was his new seneschal of poitou eleanors uncles were not present for hugh had died seven years ago and raoul de faye was in ailing health but raouls eldest son and namesake was there as was ourse de freteval his soninlaw the chauvignys were represented by andre and his cousin nicholas whod served eleanor with such loyalty as soon as hed been released from his imprisonment at loches nicholas had transferred his allegiance to richard guillaume de forz was like andre a friend since boyhood and richards cousin rico had recently earned the accolade of knighthood after briefly telling them how hed come into possession of the french kings letter richard wasted no time in breaking the bad news philippe writes that he regrets he cannot come to fight alongside hal in person but he has sent a large band of brabancon routiers to limoges moreover he assures hal that his cousin hugh the duke of burgundy is showing considerable interest in joining their alliance and he claims that the count of toulouse is another one who is likely to throw in his lot with them unable to resist this opportunity to bring me down there was a prolonged silence when he was done as the men looked around at one another it was obvious that they were sharing the same thoughts richard was already facing a formidable coalition his brother the young king his other brother the duke of brittany viscount aimar the taillefer brothers of angouleme several de lusignans elias the count of perigord the viscounts of ventadour comborn turenne and castillon the latters brother oliver the castellan of chalus and fulcand lord of archiae as well as several lesser lords who could nevertheless contribute men and money even with the archangel michael himself fighting on richards side he could not hope to defeat so many rebel lords if they were backed by the french king the duke of burgundy and the count of toulouse all of richards battlefield brilliance would avail him little against an army of that size but if they were in agreement as to what must be done none of them were eager to try to convince richard the burden should have fallen upon his seneschal but robert de montmirail had only recently been appointed to his post and he prudently held his tongue neither richards friends nor his kinsmen wanted to risk their rapport with their young duke it was finally nicholas de chauvigny who spoke up as forthrightly as hed done on the day hed defied porteclie de mauze for eleanors sake my lord you must seek the aid of your lord father the king richards failure to flare up at the mere suggestion showed them that hed already had the same thought and his common sense was warring with his pride they waited uneasily for his response for with richard they could never be sure which one would prevail i do not see how i can do that he admitted after a long silence my father and i are hardly on good terms these days i left his court without his consent and have ignored all the messages hes sent since then and i would rather go down honorably in defeat than grovel and plead for his help andre cleared his throat my lord send me to the king he said utterly earnest for once i will not grovel on your behalf you have my sworn word upon that i will simply relate the facts let the king make up his own mind there is no dishonor in that richard looked intently into his face and then away go then he said in a low voice be sure you take a strong escort though for the roads to angers are swarming with bandits rebels routiers and masterless men seeking to take advantage of the unrest his mouth twisted down such is the evil that my brothers have let loose upon my duchy the english kings newest bedmate had raised some eyebrows for she had a curly mane of flamered hair which had been thought unlucky since the time of judas and a crop of unfashionable freckles but she also had an earthy sensuality a merry laugh and a goodnatured tranquility that henry found soothing there was so little serenity in his life these days that he sought it out wherever he could find it shed fallen asleep while waiting for him awakening only when shed reached out drowsily for his warmth and found his side of the bed cold and empty pulling the bed hangings aside she sighed when she saw him seated by the hearth still fully dressed his sleepy squires struggling to stay awake should he have need of them my lord are you never coming to bed henry glanced up at the sound of her voice soon belle go back to sleep he said knowing that bless her she would she was easily contented utterly lacking in undercurrents and he found that a strong part of her appeal rubbing his eyes he looked down blearily at the pile of petitions in his lap he was bonetired but he knew hed not be able to sleep his nights were always the same now hed lie awake for hours unable to silence his inner voices unsettled thoughts ricocheting around his brain until it was almost dawn until his bodys exhaustion would finally triumph over his minds disquiet rifling through the petitions randomly he tried to focus upon the multitude of requests the castellan at loches had written to tell him of storm damage his lazar house at caen was also seeking aid hed always had a deep visceral sympathy for lepers had founded hospitals at caen rouen le mans and now angers and it seemed that they all had unexpected expenses he must bearroofs to be repaired cisterns to be dug fences to be mended even one of his proudest accomplishmentsthe great levee hed built along a thirtymile stretch in the loire valley to prevent seasonal floodingwas showing its age in need of shoring up at bourgueil it was almost as if all of his lifes work was crumbling at the same time jesu that last thought had him shaking his head in disgust it was bad enough that he was wallowing in selfpity like this must he be maudlin too thrusting the petitions aside he found himself staring into the dying fire why had he not heard from hal by now an eerie silence seemed to have settled over the limousin his scouts had little to report when he got to his feet his squires stirred looking hopeful that he might be ready for bed but hed heard what they had nota soft knock at the door it was his chamberlain explaining apologetically that a courier had arrived with an urgent message from his son and hed reluctantly agreed to see if the king was still awake warning the man that if not hed have to wait till morning henry felt a vast weary surge of relief but his hopes were soon dashed for the man being ushered in was one of richards household knights not one of hals brushing his disappointment aside he took solace that at least he was hearing from one of his recalcitrant sons andre de chauvigny is it not he asked in an impressive display of the memory that had always served him so well are you kin to the nicholas de chauvigny who was one of my queens men indeed sire we are cousins andre came forward and sank to his knees in the floor rushes as much to ease his aching body as to show proper reverence to the king for hed spared neither himself nor his horse in his haste to reach angers my liege there are matters that you need to know about as concisely as possible for he knew henry had no more patience than his duke he related what theyd learned from the french kings letter revealed the magnitude of the conspiracy confronting richard henry listened without interrupting and when he was done said only are you so sure then that the young king is allied with the rebels andre paused recognizing a pitfall when he saw one we have no reason to think otherwise sire he said cautiously henrys expression was not easily read beckoning to the chamberlain he said see that sir andre gets a bed for the night and whatever else he needs realizing hed just been dismissed andre got reluctantly to his feet it took all of his selfcontrol to do as he was bade not to argue further on richards behalf his discipline took him as far as the door and there he could not help blurting out in despair my lord kingwhat will you do what do you think henry said brusquely i am going to put out this fire ere it engulfs us all chapter thirtyeight february winchester england some of the prerogatives of queenship had been restored to eleanor in recent years and she now had her own household her own servants when her chamberlain informed her that lord ranulf fitz roy and his son were asking if shed see them her brows arched in surprise was ranulf finally thawing but when he was ushered into her chamber he greeted her with such brittle courtesy that she knew this wasnt the case so what had brought him here this is my eldest son bleddyn ranulf said and bleddyn bent over eleanors hand as if he were a polished courtier welcoming the chance to study this controversial queen at such close range ranulf did not waste time in social pleasantries at once revealed the reason for their unexpected presence at winchester my son and i are taking ship at southampton and as we approached winchester it occurred to me madame that you might have the latest news from aquitaine it has been almost a fortnight since we got word of the rebellion and much could have happened since rebellion what are you talking about ranulf you do not know he asked incredulously this was a complication that hed not foreseen the lady emma heard that war had broken out in the limousin and she was kind enough to pass word along to me knowing that my son morgan is serving as your sons squire eleanor had rarely been so bewildered what did geoffrey have to do with the limousin unless hed come to richards aid but that did not make sense either for why would that have sent ranulf racing from wales in such haste did viscount aimar rebel again this was harrys fault damn him aimar had been a faithful vassal until hed been denied rainalds earldom it is far worse than that madame your sons are at war with one another hal and geoffrey have joined forces with the rebel barons against richard they aim for nothing less than to make hal the duke of aquitaine and my son is caught up in the midst of this madness eleanor stared at him blankly as if shed not been able to process what hed just told her it was the first time that ranulf had ever seen her utterly at a loss she swallowed with an effort and her voice did not sound like eleanors at all barely audible with a noticeable quaver whatwhat of harry what is he doing about this ranulf shook his head i do not know emmas message made no mention of him she turned away blindly and he instinctively put out a hand in case she needed his support amaria had also hastened to her side her eyes wide with horror but then eleanor said get my mantle in a very different tone biting the command off so sharply that amaria flinched away from the words as if they were weapons eleanor did not notice she seemed to have forgotten ranulf too wrapping herself in her mantle she moved swiftly toward the door jerked it open and plunged into the stairwell ranulf and his son exchanged glances and then hurried after her ralph fitz stephen looked utterly miserable my lady it was not my doing i would never have kept this from you if id not been ordered to do so by the king the pupils of eleanors eyes had contracted to slits did he indeed she said softly but the reckoning with harry could wait tell me what you know of this war between my sons he did but he did not have much more information than ranulf the last hed heard geoffrey had joined the rebels at limoges hal had gone after him and bloody fighting had broken out all across the duchy hed heard that the king was on his way too to limoges and there were rumors that the french king was coming to hals support he was confident though that the king would quell the rebellion and reconcile her sons eleanor dismissed his reassurances with an impatient shake of her head and the rest of his words trickled away into the silence enveloping the hall no one else ventured to speak all eyes riveted upon the queen from now on she said you will let me know as soon as you hear anything from aquitaine sir ralphanything at all is that understood he assured her that he understood but over the years hed grown protective of her impressed by her courage madame if i may be so bold as to tell you what the lord king told me he said that he meant to do all in his power to make peace between his sons and that he hoped you would never need to know eleanor was not mollified saying icily he did not have the right to keep this from me this was eleanor at her most imperious and none dared to argue with her but it was oddly enough at this moment that ranulf finally forgave her for his fathers fear had sharpened his perception and he saw beyond the queens camouflage to the anguish underneath andre de chauvigny had been edgy and unsettled ever since they left angers for henry had taken only his household knights and andre considered that an inadequate escort to ride into the lawless chaos that had descended upon richards duchy henry had brushed aside his misgivings so curtly that he decided his king and his duke were more alike than either one wanted to admit he was vexed too that so many of henrys men had elected not to wear their mail on the road this was a common practice when speed was of the essence and he was the only one clad in both hauberk and helmet they traveled fast pushing their mounts and making no allowances for the winter weather but andre was accustomed to that from years of riding with richard despite his qualms they encountered no troubles on the road and at dusk on the fourth day they were within sight of limoges andre was not happy about their destination either but hed failed to convince henry that it made more sense to rendezvous with richard at aixe before attempting to contact the young king and the rebels he could only wonder which contributed more to the royal familys stubbornnesstheir angevin blood or their high birth the gates of the ville were closed tight a sign that the city was on a war footing and henry was displeased to see how much progress had been made in restoring the walls torn down at richards command two years ago aimar was becoming more than a nuisance a burr under the saddle his habitual rebellions were causing too much havoc in the limousin if there were any more intractable troublesome vassals than eleanors barons he hoped to god he never encountered them they made the welsh seem downright tame and docile as they approached bells began to peal loudly when one of henrys men demanded entrance in the name of the king there was no indication that hed been heard although they could see mens heads bobbing up in the embrasures the church bells were still ringing and they could hear men shouting dogs barking they drew closer but before they could shout out again for admittance they were met with a hail of arrows in the confusion two men were thrown from their horses henry saw one of his knights take an arrow in the shoulder and then he was rocked back in the saddle slamming into the cantle he felt no pain just the impact but geoff was pointing and shouting and he glanced down saw the arrow shaft protruding from his mantle they were all in retreat by now and as soon as theyd gotten out of arrow range the men clustered around henry the wounded knight temporarily forgotten youve been hit geoff gasped the soldier totally submerged for the moment in the son henry had already pulled his mantle back and they all stared at the arrow caught in the metal links of his hauberk i am not hurt henry insisted the point did not penetrate the mail i may have a bad bruise but the royal hide is not even scratched his attempt to make light of the hit did not convince the other men for they knew that mail had no magical properties that would always deflect arrows injuries depended upon such variables as the size of the arrowhead and the angle of the shot and simple luck moreover some of them remembered that henry had wavered about wearing a hauberk on the journey prudence finally prevailing over comfort henry remembered that too but he took it as a sign of divine favor this was not his closest call when hed been ambushed in the deep forests of wales an arrow had almost grazed his cheek still though it was a shocking assault upon the person of the king upon gods anointed assuming it had been deliberate when willem and andre de chauvigny insisted they must ride for aixe henry did not protest after tending to the injured knight as best they could they detoured widely around limoges and headed south to ford the river vienne and as he rode henry refused to let himself dwell upon that nearmiss for then hed have had to confront questions he was not ready to face questions about the complicity of his sons in those arrows raining down upon his men had it been an accident or an assassination attempt geoff had been taken aback by richards outraged reaction to their fathers narrow escape he found it difficult to dismiss his suspicions though and later could not resist commending his brother sarcastically upon his sudden filial devotion richard liked geoff no more than geoff liked him and he gave the older man a suspicious look of his own what did you expectthat id not be angry if some damned fool nearly kills the king if his aim had been a little better we might have found ourselves facing calamity the surest sign of the coming apocalypse will be the day hal gets to call himself a king in fact and not in name only catching the vexed expression on geoffs face he frowned what our father was almost slain this afternoon and youre just thankful that hal will not be king i swear the lot of you make absalom look like a dutiful loving son whybecause i spoke the truth sorry to disappoint you but i am not a good liar i could not hope to compete with hal in that arena i cannot argue with you there geoff conceded grudgingly the truth is not an utterly alien tongue to you as it is to our brothers praise like that will turn my head geoff richard said very dryly hal is the worst offender though geoffrey can lie as easily as he breathes but at least he does not lie to himself hal usually gets entangled in his own webs and that makes him truly dangerous again geoff could find no fault with richards assessment of their brothers do you think they deliberately ordered he began only to be halted in midsentence by the stunned look on richards face following his gaze geoff turned and then he too gasped for hal had just entered the hall henry had been seated on the dais paying little heed to the men clustering around him friends and sycophants alike trying their best to distract his thoughts from the days troubling events at the sight of his son he jumped to his feet although he remained where he was and let hal come to him richard and geoff were already in motion too and all three of them converged upon the dais at the same time are you unhurt my liege hal stopped on the steps looking up searchingly into henrys face i was horrified to hear of your mishap it was an unfortunate misunderstanding a fool watchman mistook your men for a raiding party from the cite and rang the alarm bell crying out that the town was under attack thankfully one of my knights was on the castle walls and he recognized the royal banner when i think what could have happened he grimaced shaking his head you may be sure the bowman will be punished for his carelessness and the watchman too i can spare you the trouble richard said laconically send them to aixe and well punish them for you hal gave richard a cool dismissive glance how very kind of you to offer brother but youve been known to discipline offenders withan excess of zeal i think it best that we deal with the culprits ourselves richard dropped all pretense of civility and said with a snarl if you truly do punish that bowman it will be because his aim was off hal flushed looking genuinely angry you dare to accuse me of seeking my fathers death and you dare to come here and insult us with your talk of accidents and mishaps it is not wise to think all men are as dullwitted and foolhardy as you brother now i have another question for you how do you plan to get back to your friends in limoges the knights whod accompanied hal took that as the threat it was meant to be and moved closer to the young king hands now on sword hilts id sooner trust the good faith of an infidel turk than yours hal jeered but i am here to speak with my lord father and unlike you he is a man of honor now it was richards turn to sneer what would you know of honor youre a joke the king of cockaigne whos done naught but spend his sires money and play the fool enough henry said suddenly up till now a stricken witness to his familys fratricide his eyes flicked from one to the other and then making up his mind he beckoned to hal i will hear what you have to say come with me he commanded and people hastened to clear a path as he stepped from the dais and headed for the door hal gestured to his knights to remain in the hall and then followed after his father richard and geoff watched them go that gibe about the king of cockaigne was clever geoff said at last thinking that hal was indeed meant to reign over that fabled land of milk and honey never one in the real world richard did not reply but as their eyes met they silently acknowledged the start of an unlikely alliance theyd come to a halt out in the bailey snow crunching under their boots chilled by a wind that had sprung up without warning the damp heavy air warning of rain before dawn papa surely you cannot believe that arrow shot was anything but mischance what am i supposed to believe hal you ask to be allowed to make peace with geoffrey and the rebel barons and then you disappear into blue smoke with nary a word of your whereabouts or your intentions when i reach limoges i find you dwelling comfortably in that den of thieves and as i approach the gates i come under attack if you were not my flesh and blood but i am and that makes all the difference in the world what greater crime could there be than patricide yes i was at limoges because that is where geoffrey and the others are to be found i have not abandoned my hopes of mending this rift between you and geoffrey i think ive been making headway too but aimar and his allies are naturally doing their best to keep geoffreys resolve from wavering so it may take more time ive been assuring him that you are willing to forgive will hold no grudges that is true is it not i cannot act as your catspaw papa cannot make promises to geoffrey and the others if you do not mean to keep them of course i mean to keep them henry snapped not sure how hed ended up on the defensive i want no more strife in our family hal but that peace must extend to you and your brothers it is not enough that you all pledge fealty to me you must somehow learn to live amicably with one another however little love there is between you well i get along with geoffrey and johnny two out of three is not so bad is it hal smiled then saying quickly i ought not to be jesting about it papa for i can see the pain it gives you i know you are right i just wish brother richard did not make it so damnably difficult henry studied his sons face but the moon was obscured by clouds and the stars too were hidden hed always found it easy to detect lies and falsehoods for all but the most practiced liars gave subtle signs that they were not telling the truth it was a useful talent for a king so why did it fail him when he needed it most why could he not tell when his sons were being truthful and when they were playing him false putting hals veracity to the test he demanded to know the identities of the other conspirators hal readily reeled off the names of prominent barons of the limousin including a few whose involvement had not been known to henry raymond of turenne was expected to arrive by next week along with his son boso and bernart du casnac his soninlaw he confided and he wanted the chance to talk them out of throwing their lot in with aimar adding now that youre here that should make my task easier for their grievances are with richard not you so you want more time with so much at stake papa i think it is worth my while to keep trying hal said earnestly and henry released a breath as soft as a sigh making his choice the only one he could go back then he said i will await word from you here hal returned to limoges in a surly mood tersely reported that hed achieved his objective allaying henrys suspicions and gaining them the time they needed to hire more routiers but hed then stalked off to his own quarters and they could not help worrying that he was having second thoughts even geoffrey was concerned knowing how mercurial his brother could be and after a hurried conference they delegated several of their number to find out if hal was indeed prey to misgivings in addition to geoffrey they selected one of hals closest friends the fleming roger de gaugi and a man known for his battle prowess and his iron will the head of the rapacious house of lusignan the lord joffroi hal did not look pleased to see them at his door but he let them enter and sent his squire down to the buttery for wine he then sprawled in the chair closest to the hearth and stared broodingly into the flames as if oblivious of their presence there was something so deliberately dramatic about his pose though that geoffrey was sure he was playing to his audience and could be coaxed into revealing what was troubling him and indeed it only took a few probing questions to uncover the reason for hals discontentguilt not that hed admit it but when he grumbled about henrys trusting naturea charge rarely if ever brought against the english kinggeoffrey found it easy enough to draw the natural conclusion hal felt remorseful that hed taken advantage of their fathers desperate need to believe in his innocence geoffrey did not begrudge hal a twinge or two of conscience hed occasionally had them himself but he had to be sure hal did not mean to act upon those regrets and he drew up a stool next to his brother i know what youre feeling hal he said not altogether truthfully for he was capable of unsentimental pragmatic assessments that eluded his brother altogether you are not comfortable relying upon deception or guile but we fight with what weapons we have at hand and if we see an enemys weakness wed be fools not to make use of it i know hal admitted his brother was right he did not take naturally to deceit preferred a more forthright straightforward way he was sorry hed had to deceive his father but why did he have to rush to richards rescue why could he not have stayed out of it was that so much to ask it is only to be expected that youd have some regrets geoffrey said in the reassuring sympathetic tone that had coaxed any number of skittish women into his bed but you cannot dwell upon these regrets hal it is too late that ship has sailed roger and joffroi had no idea what he was talking about but hal did and he mustered up a wry smile you mean that ark has sailed do you not the shared memory was a bracing one though reminding him that they were in this together you need not fret he assured his brother i am not losing heart i just wish thered been another way so do i geoffrey said with utter sincerity exchanging glances with the other men geoffrey saw that they agreed with him the crisis had passed he started to talk then about military mattershow many men they could expect from the french king how long it would take them to finish replacing the city walls that richard had destroyed whether the count of toulouse could be lured into joining their alliance hal stretched his long legs toward the fire accepting a wine cup from his squire in better spirits now he told them about his ugly exchange with richard i would barter the surety of my soul to bring that bastard down he confessed and when he glanced up he was heartened to see that they were all united in their loathing for his arrogant churl of a brother geoffrey had been hoping for such an opening actually there is something you can do hal to make victory more likely you can call william marshal back into your service for the life of me i do not understand why you let so able a knight go his battlefield judgment is solid his courage unquestioned and he handles a sword as well as any man ive ever seen we need all the marshals we can get roger de gaugi had been waiting for this chance too and quickly added his voice to geoffreys urging hal to bring will marshal back hal was not surprised by his praise for he knew roger and will were good friends and had often partnered in tournaments he took more notice when joffroi de lusignan also argued for the marshals recall as there had long been bad blood between will and the de lusignans acknowledging that now the knight said bluntly that he knew marshal loved him not he has always blamed me for the death of his uncle in that ambush and i was never able to convince him that wed wanted very much to take salisbury alive our differences notwithstanding i would be the first to welcome him back in truth hal wanted will back too hed begun to miss him almost as soon as will had ridden off and hed toyed with the idea of recalling him his pride had kept him from doing it though for he was not willing to risk the humiliation if marshal balked at coming the other men were presenting him with an opportunity now to reach out to will while still saving his pride if will refused he could always say that hed never truly wanted him back that hed agreed only because his brother and friends had asked it of him very well he said graciously if it means that much to you all ill take him back and he did not object when geoffrey at once sent for his chamberlain not wanting hal to change his mind during the night when the man entered hal instructed him to go in search of will marshal and tell will that i am summoning him in good faith confident that hell not fail me chapter thirtynine march limoges limousin henry and his men drew rein gazing at the newly fortified walls of the ville so their scout had been right when hed reported that they had torn down more than half a dozen churches to get timber for the walls henrys mouth tightened this was hardly an indication of the peaceful intentions hal had avowed no one spoke he knew hed been the only one to have doubted the scouts story insisting upon seeing for himself my lord king maurice de craon nudged his mount closer to henrys shall we continue on to the cite henry found himself torn between amusement and exasperation for he well knew what maurice was really saying theyd been greatly relieved when hed agreed to enter the cite rather than the ville and they were worrying now that he might have changed his mind you need not fret old friend he said with just a touch of sarcasm i daresay well get a warmer welcome at the bishops palace than the viscounts castle the words were no sooner out of his mouth than it happened his stallion was shifting restlessly and tossed its head up just in time to take an arrow in the neck which pierced the carotid artery blood spurted wildly all over henry the horse and even maurice de craon henrys years of horsemanship now stood him in good stead and as the animals legs began to buckle he flung himself from the saddle to escape the fate of the scots king whod been pinned by his own mount when it was slain at alnwick his horrified men moved hastily to get between their bloodsplattered king and the unseen bowman on the town walls holding up their shields to deflect any more arrows none came there was only silence from the ville as henry got to his feet wiping blood from his face and stared down at his dying mount richard was exhausted and angry by the time he got back to aixe that evening hed ridden south to investigate a report that routiers had been seen near pierrebuffiere and found it was even worse than hed feared a large band of men led by one of the most notorious of the routier captains a basque known as sancho of savannac had seized control of the citadel at pierrebuffiere this was another of viscount aimars castles that had been taken away from him by richard and it was now back in rebel hands for richard knew that sancho was in the hire of aimar and the viscount of turenne hed not had enough men to challenge their occupation could only watch from a safe distance and fume he was dismounting in the bailey at aixe when he saw geoff coming toward him the look on his half brothers face warned him that he was not about to hear good news and he listened grimly as geoff gave him a succinct account of the latest attack upon their father he was not hurt though geoff shook his head but that was by gods grace for if the stallion had not raised his head at that very moment papa would have taken the arrow in his chest richard had not expected them to be so brazen to make another attempt on henrys life but mayhap it was for the best if this latest treachery had opened his fathers eyes to the truth what did he say about it surely he must know by now that hal is less trustworthy than a hungry weasel he has not spoken much about it except to express his sorrow at losing such a fine horse so i cannot say if he is still deluding himself or not but you have not heard all of it richard who do you think just rode in bold as you please and this time hal brought along his partner in crime richard swore making use of one of henrys favorite oaths where are they and when geoff said that henry had taken them up to his bedchamber he flung the reins of his stallion at the closest of his knights and headed for the keep geoff hurried to keep pace what are you going to do id not miss this performance for all the gold in montpellier reaching henrys bedchamber geoff was about to knock on the door when richard shoved it open with enough force to slam it into the wall i hope the mummery has not started yet hal scowled at the sight of the intruders it was geoffrey though who seemed most eager for a confrontation you are looking surprisingly well richard you must have found a very strong soap to wash all that blood off your hands i make no apologies for what i did and i will do it again if the need arises when men invade my lands they will pay with their lives be they lowborn routiers or breton knights my only regret is that the truly guilty ones are likely to escape the reckoning they so richly deserve richard was easily the taller of the two but geoffrey stood his ground and the look that passed between them was so virulent that both henry and geoff acted instinctively and stepped forward in case they needed to intercede physically henry had reached a milestonehis fiftieth birthdaythat week and he looked every single one of those years at the moment enough henry said wearily i told hal and geoffrey that id hear them out you are welcome to remain richard and you too geoff but only if you keep your mouths shut if you cannot do that go a brief silence settled over the room a truce that they all knew was not likely to last hal was the first to speak ignoring richard and geoff he looked intently into henrys face as we told you papa i had no luck in finding the man who shot that arrow none of them are willing to own up to it not surprising i suppose hes afraid and with good reason i am so sorry for this ought never to have happened as soon as we learned of it we came straightaway to assure you that it was mischance no more than that he glanced then toward his brother geoffrey tore his gaze away from richard made a visible effort to focus himself hal speaks true papa that bowman was not acting on our orders henry would have expected richard to be the one to erupt first instead it was geoff well whose orders was he acting on he snapped you cannot convince me that hed have dared to act on his own so who told him to shoot the king henry started to speak then stopped for he wanted the answer to that question himself geoff took advantage of his fathers hesitation and glared accusingly at his brothers well he demanded can either of you tell us in all honesty that none of your honorable allies would have given that command yes i can hal said with certainty at the same time that geoffrey admitted no i cannot hal stared at his younger brother in surprise how can we geoffrey gave hal an impatient look the fact is that papas death would be very advantageous to a number of men i make no accusations have no reason to suspect any particular one of the lords now in limoges but neither can i say with utter certainty that such an order could not have been given well i can hal repeated none of them would sully their honor with a crime like regicide it was an accident no more than that the most convenient accident since william rufus was slain in the hunting mishap that made his brother king richard muttered and hal glared at him before turning his attention back to henry neither one of us would ever have done this papa surely you know that henry was not sure what he knew is that why you came geoffrey to tell me this was none of your doing and when his son inclined his head he reached out suddenly and grasped the younger mans arm geoffrey stiffened but did not pull away nor did he avert his gaze meeting henrys eyes unflinchingly what of the rebellion hal says he has been seeking to win you back to your family your natural loyalties have you heeded him are you willing to renounce this accursed alliance i have been thinking about it geoffrey said but i cannot abandon my allies without a backward glance i would need to know that their grievances will be heard i am willing to do that henry said letting his hand slip from geoffreys arm richard drew an audible breath well i am not they want to meet with the king not with you geoffrey said disdainfully and for a moment his eyes rested upon his brothers flushed face silently promising richard that there would indeed be a reckoning i will talk to aimar and the others tell them that you agree to a truce whilst they consider their choices he told henry and startled them all then even hal when he made ready to depart that is it henry stared at his son that is all you have to say geoffrey paused his hand on the door what would you have me say i would have you explain yourself i would have you tell me why you would betray me like this why you how could you possibly not know i do not henry insisted and geoffreys control cracked that you do not know papa says it all he said sharply and left before henry could respond henrys frustration found expression in anger what is he talking about what grievance could he have that justifies his betrayal you truly do not know do you hal marveled it is because of richmond and nantes papa geoffrey and constance feel that you cheated them out of twothirds of her inheritance that is the reason he rebelled how could he be so foolish ive always told him that id give him nantes and richmond when the time was right he had only to be patient hal and richard were looking at him with an oddly similar expression one of amazement for it was obvious to them that henry was quite sincere that he did not understand why geoffrey might not trust his promises or be willing to wait indefinitely even geoff was uncomfortable with his sires inability to see any viewpoint but his own id best catch up with geoffrey ere he takes all our men and leaves me stranded here hal said with a quick smile but i think i know a way papa to reassure you that aimar and the townspeople are not utterly set on war suppose they offer up hostages for their good faith when henry agreed hal made his departure too making an ostentatious display of ignoring his brothers as he walked past them to the door richard at once started to follow halting with obvious reluctance when henry ordered him to wait there until hal and geoffrey had gone whilst you were ducking arrows at limoges my lord king richard said coolly some of aimars routiers retook the castle at pierrebuffiere unless you want us to be trapped in aixe under siege we need to take action and take it now i have sent into normandy and anjou for my levies and for the routiers whove served me well in the past they are better trained and better disciplined than the brigands hired by aimar and geoffrey whore like to riot and go wild the first chance they get richard agreed that his fathers and his own routiers were superior soldiers to the men in the rebels employ he was heartened too that henry was at last reacting as a king and not a foolish overly fond father it is about time he said gruffly approving and went off then in search of a late supper geoff would have lingered but henry clearly did not want him there and so he too departed alone at last henry slumped down in his seat and closed his eyes whenever hed faced a crisis in the past hed known what he must do to prevail even when he was imperiled by the becket scandal and then his familys first rebellion hed seen a way clear a route that would lead him out of the morass and back onto solid ground now he saw no such escape the best he could hope for would be to lure geoffrey back to the fold and reconcile richard with his angry barons but that would be a shortterm solution slapping a bandage upon an ulcerating wound one that oozed blood and pus and could prove mortal if it were allowed to fester ranulf and bleddyn had been stuck in southampton for several weeks waiting for favorable winds then there had been a further delay as they tried to find men going south into a war zone for it was too dangerous to venture into the lawless lands of aquitaine without a goodsized escort they did not reach aixe therefore until late in lent before they could seek henry out though they were waylaid by richard and geoff and borne off to the great hall ive ordered food for you geoff said as soon as they were seated but we need to talk with you ere you see our father your arrival is a blessing uncle ranulf for youre one of the few men that papa may be willing to heed you must convince him that hal and geoffrey cannot be trusted that they are playing him for a fool it would help if i knew what is going on ranulf said somewhat testily for these past weeks had been highly stressful hed not expected to be making urgent journeys like this at his age where is morgan at the castle with geoffrey the last we heard geoffrey is still in limoges richard confirmed and i assume morgan is with him youre right to fear for the lad uncle for he has fallen in with men who are no better than outlaws and cutthroats that was hardly what ranulf had hoped to hear but before he could press for more information they were interrupted by the arrival of their food an unappetizing lenten meal of salted herring supplemented by a tastier dish of hulled wheat boiled in almond milk commonly known as frumenty bleddyn was very hungry and tucked in but ranulf lost his appetite once richard and geoff satisfied his need to know what is going on he was shocked by henrys two narrow escapes although he was not as certain as they seemed to be that henry had been deliberately targeted it would take a bold man to strike down a king he was deeply troubled too to hear how hal and geoffrey had been taking advantage of henrys trust even allowing for richards bias it sounded to him as if his nephew was indeed being played for a fool he prodded his knife into his herring without enthusiasm thinking that none of this boded well for morgan youve not even heard the worst of it yet richard leaned forward no longer remembering to keep his voice low hal promised that theyd offer up hostages and when maurice de craon went to fetch them he and his men were fired upon then hal had the gall to come back and once again avow that this was another of their many mishaps did harry believe him geoff shrugged who knows hell not even talk to us about it anymore but the mere fact that he is still willing to listen to their lies is more than i can comprehend geoff is right richard declared loudly enough to turn heads in their direction i tell you uncle it shames me to see him being duped like this hes usually quick to suspect the worst for certes where my mother is concerned but now he keeps giving those doubledealing hellspawns the benefit of every doubt it is enough to make me wonder if he is slipping into his dotage it is not his brain that is leading him astray it is his heart ranulf said with such heat that the younger men looked at him in surprise do you truly find it so strange that hed not want to believe his sons could be conniving at his death if either of you had sons of your own youd not be so quick to pass judgment on him i do have a son richard protested earning him curious glances from geoff and bleddyn but ranulf was not mollified and id wager hes too young to give you any grief yet just wait until hes old enough to balk until he stops paying heed to a word you say and then tell me that harry is in his dotage bleddyn had begun to look uncomfortable not sure whether ranulf was drawing upon painful memories of their own estrangement richard and geoff merely looked baffled are you saying then that youll not even try to talk some sense into him for if you cannot convince him uncle i do not know who can of course i will talk to him richard i am simply saying that i understand i understand all too well but harry is not my first concern i am here to get my son morgan out of thisthis blood feud will the rebels honor a flag of truce geoff and richard exchanged glances and then nodded richard could not resist a flash of mordant humor though saying sardonically that i hope though that you have better luck with your flag of truce than my father had with his ranulf stared at his son in dismay you cannot stay here morgan god only knows how this will all end but i can safely say it will not end well your brother and i have come to take you back to wales morgan glanced toward his brother his indignation showing clearly on his face bleddyn shrugged and gave him a sheepish smile for unlike ranulf hed been sure morgan would refuse hed still chosen to accompany ranulf on this perilous trip if only to keep him safe but hed never expected them to succeed morgan you are not being given a choice i am not going to leave you in the midst of a civil war morgan began to bridle but the anguished expression on his fathers face stilled his temper before it could fully ignite papa he said gently i am no longer a child i was nineteen in february need i remind you that in wales a lad reaches his legal majority at fourteen i am old enough to make my own choices and my choice is to remain with cousin geoffrey he has been very good to me has even promised to knight me himself and has offered me a place in his own household moreover he has a just grievance against his father how can i abandon him at a time like this because he is fighting against his king because that is treason morgan and if you stay with him it makes you guilty of treason too morgan felt as if they were speaking two different languages neither one able to understand the other papawe do not see it like that we are fighting for our king fighting for cousin hal he is gods anointed just as much as cousin harry so how can that be treason ranulf looked at his son in despair seeing that he was not going to prevail making one last effort he said i promised your mother that id bring you home how am i supposed to tell her that you refused to come that was a low blow morgan said sounding more reproachful than resentful and ranulfs shoulders slumped in defeat i know he admitted and after that there seemed nothing more to say one glance at ranulfs face and henry knew his mission had failed beckoning his uncle up onto the dais he signaled to a passing servant for wine you look like a man greatly in need of a drink it is one of the regrets of my life that i never learned how to drown my troubles in wine but who knows it might work for you ranulf gratefully sank down in an empty chair i do not remember ever being so tired he confided i must be getting old you are old henry pointed out with the glimmer of a smile hell and damnation uncle were both old and getting older by the day ranulf took a deep swallow of wine then another were we this stubborn and foolhardy when we were young henry was gazing down into his wine cup as if it held the answers they sought so morgan is still beguiled by my sons chose them over you my sympathies uncle i can say in all honesty that i know exactly what you are feeling right now harrywhilst i was at the ville i heard men talking in the hall they were saying that viscount aimar had summoned all the townspeople to the church of st pierre where they were instructed to swear fealty to hal to ranulf this was the final nail in the coffin of hals credibility and he was taken aback when henry continued calmly to sip his wine you do not seem surprised he said at last and henry regarded him in silence for a moment then leaned over and clinked their wine cups together with the saddest smile ranulf had ever seen shall we drink he said to the joys of fatherhood when ralph fitz stephen was admitted to her chamber eleanors eyes locked upon the letter in his hand he did not keep her in suspense hastened toward her and held it out this has just arrived for you madame from your son amaria wondered which son he meant but eleanor already knew even before she saw the familiar ducal seal of aquitaine it had been broken of course for her greater freedom did not include freedom from discreet surveillance snatching the letter she moved toward an oil lamp and began to read ralph fitz stephen withdrew and amaria wondered if she should leave too not sure if eleanor would want to be alone or not it depended she supposed upon the contents of that letter when eleanor looked up she eased the other womans uncertainty by saying this is from my son richard i am thankful that he thought to write to me but all his news is bad amaria he says the french king has sent routiers to aid the rebels and they have done widespread damage burning the town of stleonarddenoblat after stripping it bare killing the men and carrying off the women perigord angoumois and the saintonge have all been overrun by the rebels he admits that theyd be in dire straits if the rebel lords could control their men and launch concerted attacks but fortunately their routiers lack discipline and are more interested in plundering and looting than in fighting a real war it sounded to amaria as if richard and henry were already in dire straits and she suspected that eleanor thought so too the queen had that glazed faraway look in her eyes again deciding to take her cues from her lady she asked no questions waiting to see if eleanor wanted to confide in her and after a time the older woman began to speak again her tones brittle and taut sounding as if the muscles in her throat had constricted so painfully that the words had to fight their way free richard says that hal and geoffrey have done nothing but lie to harry that again and again he has offered them forgiveness only to have them make a mockery of his trust he says that harry was twice shot at as he approached the city that hal promised hostages and then ambushed harrys men when they came to get them that he claimed to have taken the cross and threatened to depart for the holy land but let himself be persuaded when harry entreated him not to go that when harry sent two envoys to geoffrey his men attacked them stabbing one and throwing the other off the bridge into the river neither geoffrey nor hal took any measures to punish their men for these breaches of the truce eleanor related this litany of her sons sins so matteroffactly that amaria found herself on the verge of tears for she knew how much that dispassionate recital had cost the queen she wanted to say how very sorry she was but eleanors wounds were beyond her power to heal what are the king and lord richard doing to defeat the rebels my lady harry set up his camp at the cite and is besieging the ville that part of limoges controlled by the rebels but richard says it is not going well that the weather has been wretched and theyve been unable to seal off the ville completely so richard has gone south in pursuit of the routier bands and he says they have been unwilling to face him on the field have been fleeing instead of giving battle amaria seized upon this last statement so eager was she to offer eleanor some slivers of hope surely it is a promising sign madame that the routiers are afraid to fight the duke the king and lord richard are such brilliant battle commanders that they will soon have the rebels on the run will crush them like king david smote the philistines eleanor understood that amaria was only trying to comfort her and so she did not point out that two of her sons would be leading those crushed rebels nor did she comment upon the eerie aptness of amarias choice of biblical verse for king david had been betrayed by his bestloved son the beautiful beguiling absalom whod stolen the hearts of the men of israel i want to go to the chapel she said and amaria hurried to find her mantle an icy sleet was falling for it had been a cold wet spring and as she crossed the bailey eleanor no longer fought back her tears let them mingle with the raindrops upon her skin what could she ask the almighty no matter who won this accursed war she and harry would lose chapter forty april limoges limousin known to be a stalwart supporter of the duke of aquitaine the abbot of st martials had prudently taken refuge in a nearby town when viscount aimar rebelled again leaving the abbey in the charge of his prior that individual lacked the moral fortitude to deal with the latest crisis and hed gone in despair to one of their guests geoffroi de breuil for he was the prior of the abbey of vigeois to the south of the city had once been a monk himself at st martials and had the necessary steel in his spine to stand up to the scandalous demands of the young english king upon hearing the alarming news that hals soldiers had entered the abbey grounds and were making off with the silver plate chalices and jeweled reliquaries of st martials prior geoffroi hastened to find the king finally tracking hal down in the cloisters the scene that met his eyes was a dismal one men joking and squabbling with one another their arms full of booty trailed by unhappy monks outraged by this violation of gods house prior geoffroi cried out to hal and was taken aback by the warmth of the younger mans welcome ah it is priorgeoffroi is it not i met you at the viscounts castle last summer as i recall hal smiled benevolently at the prior pleased that hed been able to remember the mans name and prior geoffroi gaped at him in amazement unable to treat this banditry as a social occasion my lord king may i speak with you in private it is urgent i assure you hals smile faded but he thought a refusal would be rude and reluctantly followed the prior toward the chapter house hoping this was not going to be a lecture it was not as if prior geoffrois own abbey was being affected after all prior geoffrois trip to limoges had been an impulsive one motivated both by his fondness for his former abbey and his awareness that the prior would not be up to the challenge of keeping st martials safe in the abbots absence now he realized why he was here the almighty had chosen him to stop this sacrilege my lord you cannot do this no matter how much you need money there is no justification for stealing from god hal had not expected such a direct assault not after the priors timid wavering protest i am not stealing from god he said indignantly did prior gautier not tell you that i have promised to repay every last sou this is a loan no more than that like the loan made to me by the good citizens of the ville prior geoffroi had heard about that loan hal had extorted twenty thousand sous from the burghers of limoges who were intimidated by the continuing presence in the ville of so many swaggering brawling routiers that matter is between you and the townsmen my lord what you do here today is between you and the almighty and i urge you to reconsider there is still time to remedy this sin it is hardly a sin hal said curtly regretting the good manners that had gotten him into such an awkward predicament as i said i have every intention of repaying the loan it is not a loan if it is not voluntary my lord king moreover your men are taking more than money they are carrying off valuable chalices and reliquaries that cannot be replaced hal yearned to escape back into the cloisters but prior geoffroi had positioned himself before the door and hal was loath to shove the prior out of the way he was an elderly man and frail for all his bold talk lookprior geoffroi it is like this he said lowering his voice to increase the intimacy of his confession i do not want to do this but i have no choice viscount aimar and i agreed to hire all the routiers who sought us out wanting to deny their services to my father and brother but the cost has been higher than we expected what can you do with a pack of hungry wolves except feed them the prior was unmoved by his plight why cannot viscount aimar pay your routiers or the viscount of turenne or joffroi de lusignan because they do not have the money either hal heard the impatient note creeping into his voice and drew a deep breath if my brother the duke of brittany were still at limoges i could have turned to him for aid but he has gone north to protect the breton borders so you see prior geoffroi i must borrow from the abbey i took measures to make sure that none of the monks or abbey guests would be molested and i even ordered men to protect your library for i know that st martials has a fine collection of books and as i already said i have sworn to repay the loan hal could see no sign of softening in the chiseled granite of the older mans face but hed exhausted the last of his patience i had a chirograph drawn up setting forth my promise to repay the abbey as proof of my good faith when prior geoffroi did not reach out for it hal thrust it into the priors hands saying brusquely here is the abbeys half now i have no more time to spare for you my lord prior if youll step aside prior geoffroi hesitated but then realized the foolishness of resistance for hal was half a foot taller and almost forty years younger grudgingly he gave way his fist tightening around the chirograph for he knew its true worth he could not help giving one final warning though as hal brushed past him look to your soul king of the english for youve just put it in grave peril but hal did not bother to reply and once he was alone the aged prior sank down upon the closest bench his eyes stinging with angry tears hal and aimars taillefer half brothers had captured angouleme with surprising ease leaving them to hold the castle and town hal decided to return to limoges to share his triumph with aimar and the other rebel barons his success was proof that the almighty understood why hed had to take the silver plate and treasures of st martials and when his money started to run low he made another forced loan this one from the monks at la couronne just west of angouleme securing enough funds to hire sancho of savannac and his equally notorious partner couraban theyd left the viscount of turennes service when hed been unable to keep paying them and hal was looking forward to bedeviling viscount raymondgoodnaturedly of courseabout it they reached limoges in late afternoon the gates were closed and they could see men standing guard on the walls one of hals knights rode up to demand entry in the name of the young king to their surprise the gates remained shut when another shout for admittance brought no results hal spurred his stallion forward impatiently identified himself to the sentries and waited expectantly the gates did not open though instead a shower of rocks rained down upon them from the walls several men and horses were struck and hals stallion reared up in fright and then bucked wildly had he been a less skilled rider hed have gone sailing over its head the hailstorm of stones continued forcing them to retreat and now hal could hear the taunts and curses the angry shouts of we will not have this man to rule over us hal was genuinely shocked to be turned away by the citizens of limoges and when aimar sent out a messenger he brought no words of comfort the townspeople had been outraged by the plundering of st martials abbey the man reported and the viscount had been unable to calm them down it would be best if hal did not try to enter the city again hal and his men withdrew to aimars newly recovered castle at pierrebuffiere and used it as a base to burn crops and launch raids on neighboring towns but the insult hed received at limoges continued to rankle and as may dragged on he became more and more discontented hed truly expected the war to be of short duration and now they seemed likely to face a prolonged struggle once the wretched weather improved henry resumed the siege of limoges and richard was in deadly pursuit of the roving bands of routiers that had been terrorizing the saintonge and poitou hal still expected them to win but he was beginning to realize that victory could come at a much higher price than hed wanted to pay he was soon thoroughly unhappy with his routier allies they seemed far more interested in looting than in laying siege to castles and he had little confidence in sancho and courabans ability to control them he found the routier captains to be as irksome and offensive as their men until now hed never had many dealings with mercenaries and he did not enjoy their company the routiers were scornful of the chivalric code that had governed hals life and mocked the concept of knightly honor they showed him none of the deference he was accustomed to receive from others and he suspected that they did not respect him much either most vexing of all they were draining his coffers charging exorbitant fees for their services and demanding to be compensated on a regular basis unwilling to accept vouchers or promises of payment his disillusionment extended well beyond the routiers though he was annoyed with geoffrey for racing off to defend brittany hed argued that the struggle in the limousin was critical to their success but once geoffrey got word that henrys agent roland de dinan had occupied the ducal castle at rennes hed turned a deaf ear to hals pleas promising only that hed return as soon as he could hal missed his brother more than hed expected aware that geoffrey had a cooler head in a crisis than his own he was not pleased with aimar either for allowing the citizens of the ville to rebuff a king and he was having some doubts about the reliability of his other allies his brotherinlaw philippes routiers were wreaking havoc in the border regions but he thought the french king ought to have put them under his command instead of turning them loose to ravage like mad dogs hed heard rumors that joffroi de lusignans brothers were gaining a foothold in la marche and there were reports too that the count of toulouses son was raiding in quercy and cahors since the de lusignans had vigorously opposed the sale of la marche to henry and count raimon had lost cahors and quercy during one of his wars with the english king hal could not help wondering if they were acting in his interests or their own but his greatest grievance was with his father for he was sure that his war would already have been won if only henry had stayed out of it he did not understand why henry must meddle in a dispute that did not involve him directly but it was obvious by now that henry was backing richard with the full power of the english crown after weeks of offering an olive branch hed unsheathed his sword giving the command to ravage geoffreys lands calling upon his levies in normandy and anjou bringing his mangonels and battering rams to limoges in a far more serious siege of the ville at easter hed ordered the arrest of the earl and countess of leicester and other prominent participants in the rebellion of hed even included the earl of gloucester in his net although thered never been proof of his participation and rumor had it that hed asked the church to issue sanctions against the rebels no this was not the war hal had expected to fight on may hal his knights and routiers seized control of richards castle at aixe afterward the men celebrated raucously in the great hall but hal did not share their pleasure for he knew it to have been a hollow victory richard had left only a token garrison at aixe and hal could not take pride in such a lopsided win this was new for himthis cleareyed assessment of their accomplishmentsand he did not welcome it thinking morosely that life had been more fun before hed discovered this hitherto hidden sense of realism he had little appetite for their simple soldiers meal was even less inclined to join in the revelries and when a tipsy couraban lurched over to offer the services of a buxom drunken whore with hair the shade of beet juice hals distaste was enough to drive him from the hall as if hed take a routiers leavings hed decided that couraban was even more disreputable than his partner in crime sancho for hed finally learned the meaning of courabans odd name he was the brigand had boasted a saracen prince at the siege of antioch hal could not begin to understand why a man would choose to call himself after a godless infidel if hed needed more proof that he was consorting with the dregs of their world surely this was it hed claimed the bedchamber he hoped was richards and flung himself down upon the bed without bothering to remove his muddied boots he wished hed thought to bring a flagon from the hall but he could not muster the energy to go back for one and he had no idea where his squires were it had not escaped his notice that his household knights had been making themselves scarce in recent days waiting for his bad mood to pass but the news hed heard today was not likely to raise his spirits one of their scouts had reported that henry had summoned the archbishop of canterbury and numerous norman bishops to caen where they were to pass sentence of excommunication upon the rebels hal was stunned that his father would put him at risk for eternal damnation an excommunicate who died without making amends would burn for aye in hell no matter how often he reminded himself that these excommunications were purely political he still found the prospect chilling how could papa even consider that how had they ever come to this his thoughts were so morbid and unpleasant that he welcomed a sudden rap on the door several of his knights trooped into the chamber brandishing wine and dice and hal was touched by their attempt to cheer him up at least he had good friends by god but he soon lapsed back into melancholy for two of the menroger de gaugi and simon de mariscowere also good friends of william marshal and of hals many disappointments that may wills betrayal was one of the sharpest he supposed that betrayal was too harsh a word for the knights failure to answer his summons but it hurt nonetheless that will could let him down like this for nigh on two months hed heard nothing from ralph fitz godfrey the man hed sent after will and when he did get word it was not encouraging fitz godfrey reported that will had accepted a position with the count of flanders and then left on pilgrimage to the shrine of the three kings in germany hal was stung that will could so blithely offer his services to another lord and this news did not endear count philip to him in the least it was like poaching in a neighbors woods eventually hed gotten a second message that fitz godfrey had finally caught up with will and hed agreed to return but hals jubilation soon soured once he read the rest of the letter will said he would come as soon as he could but not before he obtained a safe conduct from hals father the lord king and with that in mind he planned to visit the french court and ask for recommendations from king philippe and the french bishops hoping their good words would sway henry in his favor to hal that meant he was not coming for he was sure his father would never grant will a safe conduct to fight against him why should he no this was a clever pretext a way for will to get credit for loyalty without putting himself at risk but he was damned if hed let marshal cast a shadow over the rest of the night and he called for wine reached for the dice they were soon interrupted again and this time the visitor was not as welcome as hals knights he glanced up with a frown at the sight of sancho of savannac offended that the routier should take the liberty of seeking him out in his own bedchamber at least hed left that drunken swine couraban down in the hall a word with you my lord king if i may sancho said with a perfunctory politeness that grated on hals nerves ive been giving thought to our next target and ive come up with an idea i think youll fancy you think so do you hal knew that not all routiers were lowborn one of the usurper king stephens most trusted captains had claimed to be the bastard son of a count of flanders but he had no doubts that sancho and couraban came from the gutter and he valued their advice accordingly he paid these men to bleed for him not to think for him sancho either did not notice his disapproval or was indifferent to it for he sauntered forward without waiting to be asked i know youre running out of money again he said and hal scowled whose fault was that every time he turned around these accursed routiers had their palms out so sancho continued why not pay a visit to grandmont grandmont was a penitential religious order greatly favored by henry its monks known as bons hommes or good men lived lives of extreme austerity and deliberate poverty hal pointed that out now asking sarcastically what the monks had that was worth taking sancho grinned showing teeth that explained his foul breath that is what they all say the cistercians claim to be as pisspoor as leprous beggars but believe me ive carried off enough from the white monks to go on a monthlong drunk monks always have riches hidden away did your sire not give grandmont a pyx of solid gold who knows what other treasures they have yes my lord father did give them such a pyx hal acknowledged stressing the proper way to refer to a king even though he knew it would go right over sanchos head but he began to give serious consideration to the routiers proposal it was not just the appeal of ready money although god knows he needed it his father was grandmonts most illustrious patron hed been very generous to the monks even rebuilding their church and had expressed the wish to be buried at their mother house striking at grandmont would be a dramatic way to strike at his father too sending a message that he was not intimidated by those threats of excommunication he almost asked his knights what they thought but decided against it for hed begun to see that most of them told him only what they thought hed want to hear a pity geoffrey was not here for his advice could be counted upon they were all waiting and hal made up his mind saying nonchalantly why not well visit the good monks on the morrow the pyx henry had given grandmont was a thing of beauty made of beaten gold crafted in the shape of a dove even in the subdued light of the church it seemed to shimmer in the dark as hal approached the high altar he was irritated with his knights for balking at retrieving it but theyd mumbled that it did contain the host after all and it was obvious it would take a direct command to get one of them to fetch it sancho and couraban were quite willing to do it but hal did not want the pyx to be sullied by their bloodied hands and so he had no choice had to get it himself he felt a superstitious prickle along the back of his neck when he reached for it and for a moment it seemed as if the air itself had chilled telling himself his imagination was overwrought and the almighty would understand he carefully lifted the pyx and carried it from the church there he was confronted by guillaume de trahinac the outraged prior and his equally indignant monks garbed in coarse brown tunics with scapulars and hoods they looked like old testament prophets to the uneasy knights and several glanced toward the sky almost as if expecting the prior to call down celestial thunderbolts upon their heads at the sight of the pyx the prior stiffened for hed not really believed hal would dare to take it take heed he said hoarsely do you think that the almighty does not see what you do here nothing in creation can hide from him and if a man sin against the lord who shall entreat for him hal hated the way churchmen were so quick to quote scriptures using gods words to make their own paltry opinions seem more than they were he turned to glare at the prior and saw that one of the routiers was swaggering toward the monks clearly eager to end the argument hal was tempted to let him for hed enjoy seeing the sanctimonious prior knocked on his skinny butt but then he sighed and ordered the man to stop i just saved you from a beating prior guillaume he said look upon it as an act of unexpected mercy from an unrepentant sinner his men laughed but the monks were not cowed and continued to shout out dire warnings as they rode off hal stirred laughter again by feigning dismay that men of god should use such unseemly language but he was glad when they were out of hearing range and the angry voices no longer echoed on the wind by thursday may hal and his men were fifty miles to the south approaching the town of uzerche hal had no one riding at his side for his nerves were still on the raw and his knights were avoiding him again their plundering of the monastery at grandmont had left a bitter aftertaste and hed had unpleasant dreams about the selfrighteous monks and their arrant threats even his body seemed to be out of sorts for hed awakened that morning with a queasy stomach and loose bowels all in all it had been a week he wanted only to forget that changed however within an hour of their arrival at uzerche theyd stopped at the abbey of st pierre creating a panic until they convinced the monks that they meant only to pass the night there hal was so irked by the obvious anxiety of their hosts that he decided to forgo supper and withdrew to the abbots chamber hoping that a nights sleep would settle his stomach but several of his knights soon burst into the chamber with the best news that hed heard in weeks his allies were here at long last the count of toulouse and hugh the duke of burgundy had just ridden into the abbey garth hal did feel better the next day and took it as a sign that his luck had changed with all the men brought by raimon and hugh they would now outnumber the forces of his father and brother while there was some discussion of heading north to lift henrys siege or hunt for richard no one was keen to fight a pitched battle not even the routier captains and they began drifting south instead raiding at random in this almost aimless fashion the first day of june found them approaching the famed abbey of rocamadour hal had never been to rocamadour before and like all visitors he was awed by his first glimpse of the celebrated shrine perched on a limestone cliff five hundred feet above a deep river gorge a hamlet had sprung up on the lower level of the ridge shabby taverns and shops selling wine ale cider food and the ubiquitous pilgrim badges higher up was a hospice the basilica of st sauveur and the chapels of st michel and notre dame it was the latter that drew the pious and the ailing to such a remote inaccessible site for rocamadour was one of the most popular shrines dedicated to the blessed virgin mary and on this hot summer day they could see a trail of pilgrims straggling up the steep hill in the hope that theyd be the ones deemed worthy of our ladys miraculous cures later hal was not sure whod first broached the subject but it was probably in all their mindsthe awareness that rocamadour offered much more lucrative spoils than grandmont which had been a decided disappointment aside from henrys gold pyx the duke of burgundy quickly bowed out joking that heights gave him nosebleeds and when the count of toulouse also declined to participate rocamadours fate hung for a time in the balance hal was astonished by count raimons stance for he had a reputation for being as grasping as any pirate and hed certainly plundered his share of churches in the past but when pressed he argued that this was different that rocamadour was becoming renowned throughout christendom granted that it is not the same as sacking mont st michel or the holy sepulcher in jerusalem he conceded but why stir up the church needlessly i have enough problems with them as it is hal was envious of duke hugh and count raimon men who had their own rich domains their own resources lords who were not impoverished kings forced to such desperate measures by their humiliating lack of lands or money still though he was irresolute until sancho and couraban prodded him into action by implying that there was something shameful about his allies refusal and reminding him how deeply he was in debt there was no question of taking horses up that imposing cliff hal doubted that even a mountain goat could have done it the sun was scorching and he was sweating and out of breath by the time they reached the summit for his stomach ailment had not gone away after all looking down at the serpentine windings of the river far below them he felt suddenly lightheaded and found himself wondering what strange path had led him to this place and this moment by then the monks were hurrying toward them looking to him like flapping crows in their black benedictine garb their faces so white and set that he knew theyd heard about st martials and grandmont rocamadour was different from the other plundered abbeys here they had a larger audience than aggrieved monks throngs of pilgrims were staring at them in alarm shrinking back when the routiers unsheathed swords the monks blanched too at the sight of those naked blades but they stood their ground gathering around the man designated as their spokesman a stooped spare figure who leaned heavily upon a heavy oaken cane but the eyes sunken back in that furrowed pockmarked face were blazing with an anger that was ageless go no farther he declared if you value your immortal souls the routiers laughed at him and headed toward the church but he was not ready to concede defeat and stepped boldly in front of hal holding up his hand as if to hold back the tides thirteen years ago he said in a surprisingly strong voice the english king came close to dying of a tertian fever when he recovered he and his queen made a pilgrimage to our lady of rocamadour to express their gratitude for sparing his life you are of their flesh their blood courses through your veins should you dishonor them by this barbarous evil deed there can be no going back harken unto thy father that begat thee turn away from this unworthy undertaking ere you shame your noble father and bring down the awful wrath of god almighty upon your head by now hal was thoroughly tired of these dramatic biblical scenes noble father this withered old man had a droll sense of humor i will submit to divine judgment upon dies irae as all good christians must and when i face the great creator at least it will not be with the blood of a martyred archbishop upon my hands he snapped and shoved past the monk the chapel of our lady had been filled with pilgrims but they were fleeing in panic before the routiers sancho grinned at hal holding up a hemp sack stuffed with silver plate candlesticks and chalices all of which had proudly adorned the high altar we hit the mother lode this time he announced gleefully youll be able to hire a whole troop of routiers with what youre getting today need i remind you that this is a loan not a treasure trove hal said truculently and then came to a halt his eyes locking upon the black virgin carved of dark walnut it dominated the chapel conveying none of the mercy and grace associated with the gentle mary this was a stark severe image almost primitive in its austerity as if harkening back to a time long lost in the mists of memory that was such an odd irreverent thought that hal felt a sudden chill much as hed experienced in the church at grandmont and he abruptly abandoned his intention to offer the mother of god a prayer of apology and explanation turning on his heel he started to leave the chapel signaling one of his knights to keep a sharp eye upon the routiers they were not going to benefit personally from their plunder if he could help it he stopped though when sancho called out wait my lord do you not want the sword of roland hal spun around hed forgotten that the sword reputed to have been wielded by the legendary french hero was kept at rocamadour retracing his steps he took the weapon from sancho his fingers lingering upon the blade as if it were a holy relic durandal he said softly that is what he named it sancho no more believed this was rolands sword than he believed in the bona fides of all those fragments of the true cross hed once taken part in a scheme to dupe gullible pilgrims into making offerings at a manger said to contain some of the holy straw that had cradled the christ child this experience had convinced him that people were as simple as sheep and he included hal in the flock he was in good spirits though for they were all going to profit handsomely from their haul at rocamadour and in truth he felt a little sorry for this pampered young lordling if a man was going to follow the brigands road he ought to enjoy it and from what he could tell hal had less joy in his life than these shriveled stiffnecked black monks why not take it he suggested seeing how hal was caressing the sword with his eyes the lad might as well be hung for a goat as a sheep he thought and managed to keep himself from slapping hal on the back when the young king unsheathed his own weapon then reverently slid the celebrated sword of roland into his scabbard the walled town of martel was only eight miles north of rocamadour and hal heaved a sigh of relief when its seven towers finally came into view his abdominal cramps had gotten more severe and by the time they reached martel his bowels had become so loose that hed had to make several quick stops by the side of the road colic and diarrhea were such common ailments though that the teasing he had to endure was offhand and he was thankful for that hed always prided himself on his sense of humor but this spring it had definitely begun to unravel around the edges they were lodging in a fortified manor house in the center of town known as the maison fabri it was a substantial stone threestory building overlooking the marketplace once etienne de fabri had escorted hal up to the best bedchamber he wasted no time in stripping off his hauberk and soiled clothes then ordered a bath he felt a little better once he was clean but his stomach roiled at the mere thought of food and he settled instead for wine flavored with comfrey root a reliable remedy for his malady lying back on the bed he soon fell asleep when he awoke he was momentarily disoriented not remembering where he was god help me he groaned if it is morning already and his squires responded with laughter nay my lord dawn is hours away but you have a visitor hal squinted up at them in disbelief there is only one person in the world i am that eager to see so unless youve awakened me to welcome my queen the pair of you will need to find a new lord on the morrow they greeted that sally with even louder laughter and hal sat up with another groan thinking that he must teach his household to take his mock threats more seriously but knowing he would not for hed realized very early in life that hed much rather be loved than feared i am awakei think just who is this distinguished guest worthy of disturbing my sleep sir baldwin de bethune and sir hugh de hamelincourt my liege hal smiled for both knights were friends as well as liegemen and it pleased him greatly that they had responded so promptly to his summons well send them in he said and winked at his squire youve been reprieved benoit need not seek a new lord after all benoit was beaming they were not traveling alone my lord he said and nodded to the other squire who swung the door open wide hal caught his breath as will marshal entered the chamber flanked by baldwin and hugh swinging his legs over the side of the bed he started to get to his feet and was startled when the room began to spin he grabbed for the closest arm and it was only after hed straightened up that he saw it was wills the other men had discreetly withdrawn leaving them alone the sight of you gladdens my eyes hal said huskily indeed it does sit back on the bed my liege i was told youd been ailing nothing worth mentioning hal assured him but took wills advice and sat down again germany must have agreed with you he joked for you are looking sleek and well fed will could not return the compliment for hal had lost so much weight that his cheekbones stood out in sharp prominence making him look almost gaunt and his fair skin was splotched with hectic color let me get you some wine he said and busied himself in pouring drinks for them both using that time to disguise his concern so hal said happily you decided you did not need that safe conduct after all will blinked in surprise i have one my liege your lord father was good enough to grant it hals mouth dropped open you are serious jesus wept if that is not just like my father he has his bishops cast me out into eternal darkness and then he gives you permission to fight with me will handed him a cup his eyes searching hals face you were not excommunicated the old king instructed the bishops to pass sentence upon all the men whod stirred up dissension between the two of you but he told them not to include you in the damnation for true will hal had not realized how nervous he was until that fear was suddenly lifted well ill be damned he said and then grinned no i guess now i will not what about geoffrey was he spared too i do not know will admitted reaching into his tunic he drew forth two sealed parchments the french king gave me this for you my lord and this one is from your lady queen marguerite his eyes met hals levelly but hal did not take up the challenge he was the first to look away hal could feel heat rising in his face heat that had nothing to do with his fever an awkward silence fell what did will want an apology fair enough if it would mend this rift between them i am sorry he said carefully for any misunderstandings we may have had i want us to put the past behind us will to start anew can we do that this was will realized as close to an apology as he was going to get yes my liege he said quietly we can do that and was rewarded with a radiant smile the smile of the young lord hed loved and tutored and protected for so many years hal got to his feet again somewhat unsteadily and embraced the older man welcome back will he said and laughed joyfully welcome home hal had reluctantly agreed to spend the next day in bed but that night he insisted upon joining the others in the great hall a hunting party had been successful and they were able to feast on venison washing it down with prodigious amounts of wine hal merely pushed the meat around on his trencher but he drained his wine cup often and discovered that it was as effective a restorative as comfrey root the other men were drinking freely too and the atmosphere in the hall soon became boisterous and rowdy will marshal was one of the few who stayed completely sober at hals insistence hed eaten with them at the high table but once the dishes were cleared off and the tables removed he slipped away and sat down inconspicuously in a windowseat where he was soon joined by peter fitz guy and baldwin de bethune without speaking they watched the antics upon the dais where hal was bantering with duke hugh and count raimon hal was very animated laughing often making such expansive gestures with his wine cup that he was in danger of dousing the knights crowding around him is he drunk baldwin sounded uncertain for he could not remember ever seeing hal totally in his cups i think it is the fever more than the wine will said lowvoiced and then frowned at a loud burst of profanity coming from a corner where the routiers were dicing seeing the direction of his gaze peter dropped his voice too we scraped the bottom of the barrel for that lot he said grimly i tell you will it grieves me to say this but these past weeks ive felt as if i were riding with an outlaw band will looked at him intently why have you stayed then peter for the same reason that you came back old friend after a moment peter said softly god help us all although he smiled it was not a joke and will and baldwin knew it will was up early the next morning breaking his fast with a plentiful helping of soft cheese and sops of bread soaked in wine he was soon surrounded by friends and they began to tease him about his ravenous appetite doing their best to act as if things were as theyd once been back in those halcyon days when theyd been so proud to serve the young king so proud to be known as his knights and the world seemed full of such shining promise my lord hals squire materialized at wills elbow asking for a private moment and as soon as will led him aside benoit blurted out that hal had a bad night not falling asleep until dawn was nigh the doctor said i must give him a potion of comfrey root and costmary every two hours but i have been unable to rouse him and i do not know what to do should i let him sleep will knew what the boy really wantedsomeone to assume a responsibility that was too heavy for such narrow shoulders ill come up to his chamber with you and see how the king is faring this morn he said and benoits face glowed with the intensity of his relief as they mounted the stairs will assured the squire that hal was on the mend and he was convincing for he believed it himself hal was young and healthy and there was no reason to think he would not soon recover the chamber was stifling so hot that will strode over to the window and flung the shutters wide his nose wrinkling as he breathed in a fetid rank odor he crossed swiftly to the bed the sheets were soaked in sweat and the stench grew stronger my lord you must wake up will said firmly when he got no response from the man in the bed he touched hals shoulder and drew a sharp breath for his skin was searing to the touch my liegehal hal mumbled incoherently turning his head away from the light and will reached for the sheet pulled it back benoit had followed him to the bed and cried out at the sight of the blood and feces his face twisting in horror will swung around quickly and grasped his arm you must not panic benoit i need you to keep your head do you understand me and when the boy nodded he released his grip saying as calmly as he could good lad now i want you to fetch the doctor straightaway benoit nodded again and fled will could hear the thudding of his feet on the stairs once he was sure that help was on the way he leaned over the bed again the bloody flux he whispered ah hal but his throat had constricted making further speech impossible chapter fortyone june martel limousin hal had been blessed with bountiful good health as well as beauty and had only vague memories of childhood illnesses he was dimly aware now that he was very sick hed drifted far from familiar shores his dreams shot through with swirling hot colors and hazy forebodings he wanted only to sleep yet people would not let him alone they kept poking and prodding him swathing his body in cold compresses trying to get him to swallow bittertasting liquids that he did not want to drink hed thrashed about in bed seeking to evade these unwelcome ministrations but they persevered and he was too weak to resist delirium was not unlike drowning for he was caught up in a riptide carrying him farther and farther from reality and when he finally regained consciousness he had to fight his way back to the surface gasping for breath as he broke free of the feverish currents dragging him down the light was unbearably bright even after he filtered it through his lashes gradually the room came into focus two of his friends robert de tresgoz and peter fitz guy were slumped on a bench by the bed and his squire benoit was seated crosslegged in the floor rushes he wondered why they all looked so miserable when he opened his mouth to ask them though the words that emerged from his throat were so slurred that even he could not understand them the sound was enough to jerk their heads up and the next moment they were gathered by the bed all talking at once they were not making much sense to hal benoit kept murmuring gods grace as if he had no other words and peter seemed to be blinking back tears but robert was acting the most strangely wanting to know if hal could recognize him hal thought that was a very odd question for hed known the norman knight for most of his life he opened his mouth again meaning to assure rob that he was too ugly to forget but he was surprised to discover that speaking demanded more energy than he could muster when he flinched away from the sunlight flooding the bed one of them hurried to close the shutters and the chamber was soon a scene of joyous confusion as other men crowded in hal felt a great relief at the sight of will sure all would be well now that the marshal was here he was not as pleased to see the doctor looming over the bed like an avenging angel for he recognized the man as his chief tormentor the one whod kept pouring vile potions down his throat who would not go away god be praised the fever is down the doctor announced but he sounded so triumphant that hal thought he was claiming more credit than the almighty for that benevolence doctors were like that he knew it was always their doing when a patient recovered and gods will when he did not he could not summon up the effort to tease the physician though since when did talking tire a man out so he was finding it hard to stay awake but he was loath to slip back into those disquieting dreams and when his eyes met wills he silently entreated the older man to keep vigil whilst he slept when will brought a stool close to the bed and sat down he smiled will had understood bless him will always understood when hal awoke hours later he was disappointed that he was still as weak as a newborn cub he must have been at deaths door for certes he was astonished to learn that this was sunday hed lost three full days of his life he remembered some of it nowthe sharp pains in his belly the endless bouts of diarrhea the nausea no wonder he felt as flat as a loaf of unleavened bread hed have to be patient as he got his strength back and patience came no easier to him than it did to the rest of his family his stomach was not ready to cooperate though and when they tried to feed him egg yolks mixed with cumin and pepper he promptly vomited them up he could not even keep wine down and the doctor had to settle for mixing galingale and yarrow in spring water then feeding it to hal one small spoonful at a time at least he was no longer passing clotted blood doubtless because he had nothing left to void but he sounded like a croaking crow and looked like a corpse waiting to be sewn into his shroud complaints his friends were happy to agree with he thought they were much too eager to regale him with accounts of his suffering gleefully describing how he had been sweating like a southwark cutpurse caught by the watch and spewing your guts out and shitting a river of blood when the doctor made ready to bleed him that brought back another unpleasant memory and he grumbled that i dreamed i was stabbed by a lunatic with a knife but it was really a leech with a lancet the knights all laughed but the doctor ignored his protests and deftly opened a vein in his arm explaining needlessly that it was done to drain away the noxious humors that caused fever knowing full well that bloodletting was an approved method of treating numerous ailments hal thought the doctor sounded like a prideful buffoon but it was probably not wise to vex a man with a blade in his hand and so he submitted grudgingly to the treatment although he noticed that he seemed much more lightheaded after the procedure the men around his bed were members of his inner circle most had been with him since his coronation at age fifteen his gaze flickered from one familiar face to another will and baldwin de bethune and simon de marisco and roger de gaugi and robert de tresgoz and peter fitz guy a man could not ask for better friends hed been told that theyd rarely left his side during the worst of the crisis he wished he could thank them for their devotion but knew theyd be flustered and discomfited if he did for banter and sarcasm were the only languages spoken in their realm at the moment they were harassing rob entertaining hal with exaggerated accounts of robs erratic behavior in the last few days it seemed that hed recalled some folklore that a fever could be cured by the liver of a beaver and hed been flailing around on the riverbank as long as there was light trying to catch one when hal asked if this was true rob confirmed it with a sheepish grin insisting that beaver liver if fried with onions could heal the worst fever he would have elaborated upon this miracle remedy if will had not seen the greensick look on hals face and hastily cut him off hal could bring up only yellowish bile for hed not been able to eat for days his friends were clustering around him offering wine and putting wet compresses on his forehead and rushing off to see if the doctor thought he ought to be bled again go away he groaned youre worse than a mother abbess with one novice nun and they laughed uproariously for these glimmers of humor were surely the best proof that the almighty had heeded their prayers and not those of the vengeful monks sundays celebration continued into the next day for hals allies and routiers were just as pleased by his recovery as the knights who loved him will lost track of all the toasts drunk to hals health but he observed the hilarity with a jaundiced eye well aware that these men had a vested interest in the young kings wellbeing the more he saw at martel the more he understood peters bleak admission how had hal ever come to thisleading an outlaw band of cutthroats and bandits and how was he going to convince hal to renounce these false friends and return to his proper allegiance hal was no stronger on monday still could not eat without becoming nauseous and although he now had a constant thirst he could only keep water down but he was quite lucid and his men took heart from that assuring themselves that hed soon be on the mend will was not so sure and began to harbor doubts hal was young and had been robust and vigorous shouldnt he have begun to regain some of his strength by now it frightened will to see how feeble he was the man able to wield a tenfoot lance with lethal skill could not even hold a cup to his blistered lips because of his own disquiet will soon picked up on the doctors unease and nerved himself to demand the truth he was not prepared though for the grim response he got from the physician once they were safely away from eavesdroppers the doctor seemed relieved to share his fears it was not just that the young king was showing no signs of improvement his new symptoms were troubling too his skin and mouth were very dry and his thirst could not be quenched his eyes were sunken back in his head and despite all the water he was drinking his urine was scant and when it did come it was a dark yellow had sir william noticed that he was no longer sweating will had not and when he asked what that meant the doctor muttered evasively that it was never a good sign are youare you saying that he will not recover the physician no longer met his eyes that is in gods hands and not for me to say will stared at him in horror understanding that hed just pronounced a death sentence upon the young king hal was frustrated that he was making so little progress this was tuesday morn ought he not to be regaining strength by now hed been dozing since dawn and each time he awoke will and rob and baldwin and benoit were keeping watch by his bed standing guard against night demons and quite likely the routiers when hed emerged from his delirium hal had been surprised to find an unfamiliar emerald ring upon his hand emeralds were said to have the power to vanquish fevers they reminded him and the duke of burgundy had kindly offered his own ring it was a valuable piece of jewelry and hal had jested with his knights wondering how much they could sell it for but hed begun to fret that a routier might sneak into his chamber and steal it and he decided that if only for his peace of mind they ought to return it to hugh he did not need it anymore after all for his fever had not spiked again was more like a smoldering peat fire now than a roaring conflagration he watched his friends for several moments before they noticed he was awake if you are not a sadlooking lot he mocked youd think i was on my deathbed or that richard had martel under siege and we were running out of wine hed meant it as a joke but there was nothing amusing about the reaction he got his jape was met with a stricken silence and suddenly they were looking everywhere but at his face he stared at them incredulously i am not dyingam i this time they responded with a flurry of frenzied denials assuring him that of course he was not dying what a foolish notion hed be up and about in no time at all hal was stunned for he could see they were lying will alone had kept silent but now he cried out sharply enough he deserves the truth when they would have protested will stared them down he has the right to know he insisted he needs to know whilst there is still time to make amends they could see the pulse thudding in hals throat hear the ragged edge to his breathing butbut i was getting betteryou all said so will knew that hal had always preferred an oblique approach to unpleasant truths but he had no choice now had to face it headon we hoped you were my liege but youve been growing weaker andand the doctor says your recovery is now in gods hands hal looked at him mutely and then turned his head away from them go he said hoarsely leave me be they did not argue and fled in unseemly haste none of them knowing what to say or how to comfort him will did not go far though for he knew that hal of all men would never find solace in solitude he waited what he hoped was a decent interval time enough for hal to absorb the blow then knocked on the door and came back into the chamber i will go if you wish it he said and when hal didnt object he approached the bed dreading what he would see hals spectacular tournament successes had overshadowed the fact that he was not as gifted a battle commander as richard or geoffrey either for that matter he did not seem to have a head for strategy to be able to anticipate the unforeseen or to adopt longrange plans no one had ever questioned his courage though if he did not have richards reckless daring few men did will had never seen him display fear either at castle sieges or in the wild melees of the tourney which could be as dangerous as battle skirmishes but hed never seen hal look as he did noweyes wide and staring pupils so dilated that much of the blue had been swallowed up filled with utter panic when he spoke his voice was unsteady almost inaudible god is punishing me for my sins will yes will said softly i fear he is lad i ought to have heeded the monks they tried to warn me but i would not listen and now it is too late lucifer is here waiting to claim my soulcan you feel his presence too hal shivered i am damned and it is my own fault will hal no will had to fight the urge to glance over his shoulder half expecting to see diabolic red eyes glowing in the shadows it is not too late the almighty has not forsaken you has given you a great mercytime to repent and seek forgiveness hal had a heartbeat of hope but no more than that no he whispered theyd not forgive me how could they will was momentarily puzzled not sure who they were but then he understood hal was speaking of his divine father in heaven and his earthly father at limoges of course theyd forgive you hal the mercy of the almighty is everlasting and endureth forever and the lord king has never ceased to love you why do you think he spared you from excommunication or granted me a safe conduct to come to you are those the actions of an unloving father hal desperately wanted to believe him but my sins are so grievous that does not matter not if you are truly contrite as complete as wills education had been in military matters and the tenets of chivalry hed not learned to read or write hed never regretted that lack not until now when he yearned to quote scriptures that could assuage hals fear fortunately even though hed never been able to read the holy writ he did have an excellent memory and could remember enough to paraphrase with reasonable accuracy the lord god will not turn his face away from you if you return to him will forced a smile holy writ says there is great joy in heaven over even one sinner who repents tears welled in hals eyes when i thought that salvation would be denied me and that it was all my doing he shuddered but he no longer sounded like a man sure he was doomed fetch me a priest will so i may be shriven will managed another smile even as his own eyes filled with tears you need not settle for a priest lad you have a bishop at your beck and call bishop gerald of cahors rode in an hour ago shall i summon him now please hal was suddenly terrified that he might die before he could confess his sins but he still called will back as he reached the door willi must see my father ere i die must tell him how sorry i am will doubted that henry would come not after being shot at twice under flags of truce but he was not going to rob hal of the smallest sliver of hope and he said as confidently as he could we shall send a man to limoges straightaway once he was out in the stairwell though he sagged against the wall feeling as if his bones were suddenly made of sawdust incapable of supporting his weight much less his grief alfonso the young king of aragon had arrived to assist richard and henry in fighting the limousin rebels and his personal bete noire the count of toulouse daylight held sway well into the evening on summer nights and richard took alfonso to see aixe the castle now garrisoned by rebels well lay siege to it on the morrow he said and if they balk at surrender god may pardon their sins but i will not alfonso smiled thinking that richard had changed little since their first meeting at limoges ten long years ago he was still as decisive and confident as ever i can see he joked why your men call you richard yea or nay for youre never one to dither at crossroads are you richard glanced at him in surprise hed not known hed been given that nickname he was not displeased though thinking there were far worse things a man could be called hed begun to suggest unflattering nicknames for his elder brothersir spendthrift and lord lies a lot among the least insultingwhen a scout sounded the alarm a horseman is coming my lord riding like hes escaping from hell to alfonsos amusement richard at once swung onto his stallion and rode out to intercept this mystery rider he mounted with less haste and followed after his friend by now the horseman was within recognition range and after a moment alfonso identified him as the old kings chancellor and natural son whom hed met just hours ago at the cite pebbles and dirt flew everywhere as geoff reined in his mount the animal was streaked with lather and alfonso braced for bad news knowing that richards brother would not push a horse like this unless the message he bore was urgent richard had reached the same conclusion what has happened now he asked warily for lately the war had not been going well hed chased geoffreys routiers out of poitou into brittany but his duchy was still infested with these vermin some hired by the french king and the rebel lords others freelancing and the arrival of the duke of burgundy and the count of toulouse threatened to tip the balance in their favor youll not believe hals latest knavery richard was accustomed to geoff waxing indignant about their brother but hed never seen him so outraged he was literally shaking with the intensity of his emotions he sent a man to our father tonight claiming that he is dying and pleading that papa come to martel and forgive him ere he does richards jaw dropped and his indrawn breath was audible enough for alfonso to hear many considered it shocking and even sacrilegious that henry dared to swear upon the almighty gods bones being one of his favorite oaths the holy body part that richard now blurted out was so scandalous that alfonso did not know whether to laugh or move out of range it was obvious though that richards blasphemy was involuntary he looked as if hed been poleaxed every time i think that whoreson has gone as low as he can richard spat he finds a shovel and keeps digging you have not heard the worst of it yet papa wants to go to martel then he is not just in his dotage he is stark raving mad richard wasted no more time questioning his fathers sanity took off in a cloud of dust with geoff right behind him by now alfonsos men had caught up with him theyd been alarmed to have their lord and the duke ride off like that they were further puzzled to see richard already disappearing in the distance with his own knights scrambling to keep pace but their king did not appear to be perturbed by these odd events when they reined in and asked him if all was well alfonso assured them it was and then grinned it seems we are returning to limoges he said it should be an interesting evening richard found the situation at the bishop of limogess palace was not as dire as hed feared for he did not lack for allies in fact the one without allies was henry he was facing unanimous opposition from kinsmen friends barons and bishops ranulf richard and geoff presented a united family front willem and maurice de craon and rotrou count of perche were adamantly opposed to his going to martel too the newly arrived archbishop of canterbury and the bishops of angers and agen were also lined up against henry the only one holding his peace was sebran chabot their host hed been embroiled in a contentious dispute with henry and richard upon his election to the bishopric of limoges several years ago and thought the icedover breach with his duke and king was too fragile to test as was his wont richard seized control and launched into a passionate assault upon hals tattered credibility he demanded to hear this dunghill of lies with his own ears and robert de tresgoz was ushered back into the bishops great hall at the very sight of the norman knight richard burst out into scornful laughter well well if it is not one of hals pet lapdogs theyd have done better to send a priest but after the raids on st martials grandmont and rocamadour even hals own chaplain has likely taken to his heels rob was enraged to be dismissed so disdainfully but his anger was muted by exhaustion for hed covered more than seventyfive miles in less than two days i am speaking gods truth he insisted the young king was stricken with the bloody flux and he is not expected to recover but to his despair he saw that his words were echoing into a void no one was paying him any heed and he was ushered out again knowing that he had failed hal in his moment of greatest need henry had lapsed into silence as the argument raged around him no longer attempting to rebut the objections coming fast and furious from his two sons with fine teamwork richard and geoff were taking turns reminding him of that arrow deflected by his hauberk the death of his stallion outside the walls of the ville the ambush upon maurice de craon the treacherous assault upon his envoys by geoffreys men the lies the betrayals the numerous breaches of trust it was henrys uncharacteristic reticence that attracted ranulfs attention when had harry ever been passive in the face of defiance why was he even bothering to hear them out if he was set upon trusting his faithless son yet again and then ranulf understood harry was not free of doubts either once more he found his head warring with his heart and with that realization ranulf saw a path opening up through this maze my liege may i have a moment alone with you he asked and while richard and geoff seemed reluctant to trust henry out of their sight the others took hope from this for all knew that if any man could get through to the king it would be his uncle henry seized upon the opportunity to escape his sons hectoring and led ranulf out into the garth twilight was laying claim to the cite and the sky was a deepening shade of lavender spangled with stars and fleecy clouds the color of plums it was such a beautiful summer evening that ranulf and henry walked in silence for several moments as if reluctant to sully this hallowed peace with the feuding and bad faith of mortal men without speaking they crossed the garth and by common consent entered a side door of the cathedral it was empty save for a lone canon who discreetly disappeared when henry frowned in his direction pacing up the nave they halted at last in front of the high altar and only then did henry look challengingly at the older man you cannot tell me uncle that you would not go to morgan if you received such a message yes i would go ranulf admitted but refrained from pointing out that morgan had never given him reason to distrust his word for he knew that his nephew was painfully aware of his sons failings if you do go to martel we may have to sneak out in the middle of the night he said only half joking for he could see richard and geoff locking henry in his chamber rather than let him risk his life and his kingdom on hals word of honor we take care with your pronouns ranulf lest you find yourself accompanying me to martel henry said dryly and was surprised when his uncle smiled i will go with you harryif you answer one question can you honestly tell me that you have no doubts or suspicions about the truth of hals story several tall candles burned on the high altar and ranulf thought he caught the glimmer of tears in his nephews eyes henry did not reply and they both knew that was an answer in and of itself ranulf had gone back to the bishops hall to tell the others that henry would not be taking hals bait not this time henry was never to know how long he remained alone in the church until this june evening at limoges he would have said that the most despairing desperate moment of his life had been passed at canterbury kneeling before thomas beckets tomb now he knew better eventually one of the canons appeared coming to a sudden stop as soon as he saw the motionless figure of the king before he could retreat henry beckoned him forward giving a terse onesentence command that sent the man hastening out into the night the bishop of agen did not keep henry waiting long sire how may i be of service is it your wish that we pray together henry doubted that he had gods ear these days but he kept that blasphemous thought to himself i have another mission in mind for you my lord bishop i want you to ride to martel at first light see for yourself if my son is ailing and if you findif you find that it is true tell him for me that he has my forgiveness that he has my love the bishop inclined his head feeling so much pity for the english king that he was momentarily mute henry didnt notice tugging at a ring on his finger he pulled it free and pressed it into the bishops hand give him this it was my grandfathers passed on to me by my mother when i was invested as duke of normandy hal will recognize it as mine it will be done my lord king the bishop said quietly but as he withdrew he was struck by a disconcerting thought whatever he found in martel he would be bringing grievous news back to the king what would be worsethat hal was truly on his deathbed or that once again hed taken shameless advantage of his fathers trust exploiting his love to lure him into a lethal trap hal continued to grow weaker but his knights were convinced he would cling to life until he could make peace with his father for now that he no longer feared eternal damnation he was obsessed with righting the wrongs hed done especially to henry in a way this was a mercy for he was so concerned with making amends and making a good death that hed not had time to mourn all that he was losing a man whod lived utterly for the pleasures of today with nary a thought for the morrow was now consumed with regrets able to focus only upon his yearnings for salvation and forgiveness and his friends prayed fervently that he would obtain both will was not alone in thinking it unlikely that henry would come and as the hours slid by they were finding it harder and harder to maintain a cheerful pose in hals presence to keep his hopes alive even as his body wasted away he was displaying a singleminded resolve that hed never shown before hed worked out in his mind how long it should take rob to reach limoges and then to return with henry and when friday dawned his eagerness was painful for the other men to watch rob arrived as vespers was chiming in the town churches so guiltstricken did he feel that hed been tempted to take his time on his return trip rationalizing that hed be sparing hal great pain as well as himself was it not better for hal to die still hoping for reconciliation than to know his father had not believed him but he continued to spur his horse onward driven by a sense of duty that was stronger even than his sorrow when he dismounted before the fabri manor he was mobbed by the other knights but after one look at his haggard face they asked no questions the king would not be coming did it matter why to their surprise and relief hal seemed to take the news better than they did he listened without speaking as rob stammered and stuttered and tried to put the best possible face upon henrys refusal and then he said softly it would have taken merlin to make it happen rob do not blame yourself will was not fooled though by hals composure and when hal then whispered for his ears alone i did not deserve his forgiveness the older man could not bear it and excusing himself started for the stables determined to ride to limoges himself when baldwin and peter learned of his intent though they were able to talk him out of it by pointing out that it was too late even if will could somehow convince the king hal would be dead long before they could get back to martel for will it was the worst moment of a wretched week he was naturally a man of action and he was finding it intolerable to watch helplessly as the young kings earthly hours trickled away like sands in an hourglass but he must be at hals deathbed for it was the last service he could perform for his lord hal had been sincere when he said he did not deserve forgiveness there could be few epiphanies as dramatic as one brought about by the awareness of impending death but no matter how often he told himself that his punishment was just and fitting he was anguished by his fathers rejection if the man hed finally become in the last week of his life could try to accept henrys judgment the boy hed always been cried out for mercy needing his father to bring light into the encroaching darkness of his world to say he understood and the slate of his misdeeds was wiped cleanjust as hed done time and time again when will burst into the chamber and saw hal lying so still his eyes flew to the dying mans chest holding his own breath until he reassured himself that hal still breathed baldwin and peter were keeping watch and they started to warn him to be quiet grateful that hal seemed to be sleeping at last will ignored them and leaned over the bed my liege a messenger has just ridden in sent by your lord father hals lashes flickered truly it is bertrand de berceyras the bishop of agen and his escort the count of perche will glanced at simon and jerked his head toward the door the knight hurried to open it and ushered the men into the chamber they both came to an abrupt halt when will shifted giving them their first look at hal that was all it took to banish their suspicions doubts and misgivings rotrou of perche was particularly remorseful for hed been one of hals allies during the first rebellion and when his eyes met hals he flushed hal acknowledged their past with a wan smile whod have thought rotrou that id get to hell ere you did as the bishop approached he said hastily that was a joke my lordand a bad one havehave you really come from my father indeed my liege bishop bertrand was so shaken by hals shocking decline that he unfastened his own paternoster from his belt and placed it on the pillow next to hal then reached out and took the young kings hot dry hand in his king henry bade me tell you that he freely and gladly grants you full forgiveness for your sins and that he has never ceased to love you hals lashes swept down shadowing his cheeks like fans as tears seeped from the corners of his eyes thank you he whispered although the bishop was not sure if it was meant for him for henry or for the almighty i bring more than words he said and taking a small leather pouch from around his neck he shook out a sapphire ring set in beaten gold he started to tell hal that this was henrys ring but saw there was no need for hal could not have shown more reverence if hed produced a holy relic he does forgive me then he cried and gave the bishop such a dazzling smile that for a moment the ravages of his illness were forgotten and they could almost believe this was the young king of cherished memory the golden boy more beautiful than a fallen angel able to ensnare hearts with such dangerous ease then the illusion passed and they were looking at a man gaunt holloweyed suffering and all too mortal too weak to do it himself hal looked entreatingly at the bishop saying please when the bishop slid the ring onto his finger he smiled again and closed his eyes a hush settled over the chamber the bishop directed an urgent lowvoiced question to will and sighed with relief when will assured him that hal had been shriven by the bishop of cahors and that hed made his last testament for that was every christians duty death seemed very close to them at that moment but then hal opened his eyes and said faintly i would send a lettermy father and that spurred them all into action within moments pen ink and parchment had been found and the bishop insisted upon taking them himself ive never had so exalted a scribe hal whispered and as the bishop bent forward to hear him he tried to tell bertrand what he wanted to say but the words would not come and he looked at the older man imploringly we could begin with a quote from scriptures the bishop suggested and when hal nodded he paused to think of an appropriate verse remember not the sins of my youth or my transgressions what would you say then my lord will was holding a cup to hals lips he swallowed with an effort saying tell him that i am so sorry for letting him downthat i was a bad son and a bad king will tilted the cup for him again and his voice steadied somewhat tell him of my love entreat him to forgive my mother not to blame her for my sinsmarguerite ask him to provide liberally for my wifeand to pardon my allies to blame no one but memy brother viscount aimar and the good people of limogesi beg him to make restitution to the abbeys i plunderedi stole from god am so sorryask him to provide for my knightsto make right my wrongs doubting that he had the strength to continue the bishop said soothingly very well done my liege i have it all every word it wants only your seal i can say with certainty that your lord father will be proud you have shown such heartfelt repentance for your sins hal was not through i want to be buriedat the church of the blessed mary in rouen if only my father could pay my debts they thought he was done speaking then but he added so softly he could barely be heard so many regrets so many the bishops vision was blurring with tears and as he looked up he saw that the other men were weeping too will leaned over and gently pressed his lips to hals feverish forehead at the touch hals eyes opened again will he said drowsily so glad you came he seemed at peace for the first time and will sought to console himself with that but then hals breath hissed through his teeth jesu durandal will and baldwin exchanged bewildered looks having no idea what he was talking about peter did though and he said swiftly you need not fret my lord king we will see that it is returned i promise hals lips twitched in what was almost a smile good ladid not want the lord roland to think me a thief his voice trailed off his lashes fluttering down again and after that there was quiet in the chamber his knights wiping away their tears as they watched the shallow rise and fall of his chest counting the breaths that were so tenuous each one seemed likely to be his last saturday was market day in martel and amands tavern would usually be doing a brisk business not this saturday the locals were staying at home behind locked doors almost as if the town had been invaded by a pack of hungry wolves amand supposed that in a way they had for the young kings routiers were always on the prowl for prey he had just decided to lock up and go home when the door banged open and some of those godcursed coterels swaggered in his stomach delicate in the best of circumstances lurched and he had to swallow the aftertaste of his mornings breakfast but he managed a sickly smile and gave modette a push when she did not move glaring at him resentfully she waited till sancho and his companions seated themselves at a trestle table facing the door when they ordered wine amand hurried over to pour from one of the large casks and sent the reluctant modette back with four full henaps praying that these dangerous customers would drink and depart without smashing up the place maltreating modette and stealing his meager profits but not expecting to be so lucky thank you sweetheart sancho told the sullen serving maid for flirting was an ingrained habit with him even when he was in a sour mood as he definitely was this noon it was bad enough that the royal whelp was dying but he was dying deeply in debt and some of those deniers ought to have been theirs not only were they not going to be paid but the war would likely sputter to a halt now that the rebels no longer had hal to rally around it had occurred to sancho that with the dying kings knights so busy mourning his approaching death it would be an opportune time to help himself to whatever was left of their rocamadour booty but that had occurred to couraban too and the hellspawn had beaten him to it riding off yesterday with the last of their abbey plunder the men with him were his trusted lieutenants forming the core of a band hed led for several years and he could be more candid with them than with the rest of their company so they were aware of their financial woes they did not appear overly concerned though for they had confidence in sanchos cunning and were sure hed come up with something when pere said as much sancho shrugged off the compliment but he never took their support for granted they were a motley lot he supposed for they did not even have a shared language he and his cousin ander were basques pere was a catalan gerhard a fleming and jagogod alone knew what mongrel blood ran in that ones veins most likely his own mother had not known but what they had in common was stronger than their differences for they were ishmaels condemned to live on the fringes of society scorned even by the same lords who paid for their services this hostility had forged a strong sense of solidarity an usversusthem mentality that often stood them in good stead sancho knew though that their loyalty depended upon his ability to produce to keep their ventures profitable and hals death was undeniably a setback a squeal from modette interrupted his brooding shed brought more wine to their table and gerhards arm now snaked around her waist pulling her down onto his lap the other men paid her no heed as she squirmed to free herself her eyes narrowing to slits when his hand groped under her skirt just then ander entered the tavern though and she took advantage of gerhards momentary distraction to slip from his grasp hastily putting distance between them as amand looked on in dismay fearing shed expect him to speak up for her modette knew better though than to depend upon that frail reed and impaling him with a contemptuous look she began to back toward the door leading into their storeroom she had some good fortune then in a life that had been singularly lacking in it ander brought news they found so interesting that she was forgotten even by gerhard pulling up a stool ander yelled to amand for wine before saying well you missed quite a show mates i am surprised they did not charge admission it was that good i take it the royal whelp is not dead yet he is still clinging to life like a barnacle to a ships hull but to give the lad credit he is going out in a blaze of glory he began by confessing again first in private to the bishops and then in public to anyone who cared to listen i sidled in at the back having never heard a royal confession i have to say it was a great disappointment he seems to have lived a very dull life for he had no truly interesting sins to disavow mainly boring misdeeds like betraying his old man and harrying monks and the like youre being too hard on him ander jago protested naturally youd find his transgressions tiresome when compared to yours youll never find a priest corrupt enough or drunk enough to absolve you of your sins but the rest of us do what we can ander dug jago in the ribs with his elbow but sancho put a stop to the horseplay before it could escalate that does not sound like much of a show to mea dying man confessing to tedious sins ah but he was only getting started next he insisted that they garb him in a hairshirt damned if i know where they found one that bunch does not seem likely to carry hairshirts in their saddle bags do they they must have borrowed gerhards pere gibed and the fleming kicked him under the table but missed and got ander instead swine ander said without heat i am not done yet you cocksuckers the fool then had them put a noose around his neck and pull him from his bed onto the floor and over to a bed of ashes hed ordered them to make this was met with exclamations and expressions of disbelief but sancho came to his cousins defense i believe it he said our young princeling has quite a liking for high drama it would not be enough for him to repent hed have to be the most remorseful penitent since cain wailed that his punishment was more than he could bear gossip had it that sancho was a renegade cleric and although hed never confirmed it the rumors persisted this display of familiarity with scriptures was too tempting an opportunity to resist and they began to heckle him with cries of father sancho while ander appropriated peres henap and drained it in several gulps oh and the duke of burgundy is making ready to depart he said casually for he knew this was hardly newsworthy the count of toulouse had ridden off the day before and theyd known it was only a matter of time before burgundy abandoned the sinking ship too but for sancho this information was quite interesting hed been playing around with an idea not sure if it was feasible but it would require burgundys departure for it to work he wondered if he ought to confide in the others then decided no not yet hed take a little more time to think it over and then give them the good news that their prospects were not quite as bleak as they thought hals friends knew he must be in acute discomfort lying on the hard floor in a bed of ashes and cinders and they were both awed and proud of him for making such a spectacular gesture of atonement as the hours dragged by he dozed fitfully occasionally murmuring in his sleep once will thought he said his wifes name but he couldnt be sure he was sitting crosslegged in the floor rushes by hals side with peter and rob keeping vigil nearby baldwin was slumped in the windowseat and simon was trying vainly to console benoit the boy was huddled in hals bed his eyes so swollen with tears that he could barely see etienne de fabri appeared from time to time offering drinks and food that the knights always refused for it did not seem right that they should enjoy what hal was denying himself hal stirred when bells chimed for none somewhere in the town and will at once leaned over to dribble a few drops of water upon his lips the only liquid hal would accept as their eyes met the corner of hals mouth curved sorry he whispered to take so scandalouslylong to die geoff would say id be latefor my own funeral that was too much for rob and choking back a sob he fled the others were ashamed to admit they too yearned to bolt for the very air seemed oppressive so saturated with sorrow that they felt as if they were breathing in tears seeing that hal wanted to speak again will moved closer to catch his words so much to regretespecially that i amam making richard king hal tried to smile could say itit is killing me that is a very bad joke will said thickly hals death would have repercussions that would echo from one end of the angevin empire to the other but he was not ready to think about that yet for now the world had shrunk to the confines of this bedchamber and time could be measured only by the faint beats of hals heart when hal drew a ragged breath will braced himself for the death rattle but the younger mans eyes were suddenly filled with urgency cloak he mumbled fetch it the men looked at one another in confusion it was only when hal said cross that they understood peter and baldwin rooted around frantically in a coffer of his clothes until they found what he wanted the mantle sewn with a bloodred crusaders cross they handed it to will and he knelt draped it around hal like a blanket hals eyes traced the outlines of that crimson cross and he felt a surge of shame hed taken the cross so lightly had sworn to go to the holy land more to vex his father than to honor the almighty and it seemed symbolic to him of a misspent life yet another regret to take to his grave after a few moments he indicated he wanted will to remove the cloak willi entreat youpay my debt to godtake it to the holy sepulcher for me hed just asked will to make a pilgrimage on his behalf to jerusalem but the knight did not hesitate i would be honored my liege and shall do it gladly a smile flitted across hals lips summoning up the last of his strength he moved his hand so that he could see the sapphire ring upon his finger blessed token of his fathers forgiveness remember me he said as softly as a breath and after that he did not speak again the man who would be known to history as the young king died at twilight on saturday the eleventh of june on the festival of the blessed st barnabas the apostle but the drama surrounding his death was just beginning chapter fortytwo june martel limousin will stumbled down to the great hall the next morning feeling as if he was coming off a threeday drunk hed slept badly could not get rid of a sour taste in his mouth and for once his celebrated appetite was flagging he forced himself to eat some cheese and bread though for he knew it would be a long difficult day when the other knights came over to join him he saw that they looked no better than he felttheir eyes bloodshot and bleary their faces either abnormally pallid or oddly flushedand it occurred to him that men could indeed get drunk on grief he was not surprised when they told him that the bishop of agen and count rotrou had departed for a kings death was like a sunset and even his most loyal subjects would instinctively have their eyes already on the eastern horizon anticipating the coming dawn he was sorry to hear it though for he suspected they were in dire need of money and they could have asked the bishop or the count for a loan peter and rob soon confirmed his suspicions reporting that couraban had stolen the last of the spoils taken from rocamadour and theyd be lucky if they could scrape up enough to distribute the traditional alms expected when a highborn lord died will could not regret the loss for to use such illgotten gains for a noble purpose was still sacrilege in his uncompromising eyes we need to make plans he said knowing that the burden of dealing with hals death was going to fall squarely upon his shoulders i think we ought to take hal to the monks at grandmont they can make his body ready for burial after the king is notified we can then take him to rouen as he wished it made sense to turn to the monks and if they took a grim satisfaction in undertaking funeral preparations for the man whod plundered their monastery theyd earned that right the knights were looking at will with puzzlement though voiced by simon when he repeated notify the king surely the bishop of agen will do that will marveled at the naivete of the question and baldwin gave a derisive snort saying oh yes i am sure hell not spare his horse to be the first to tell the king sire i know i did my best to convince you that your son was lying but it seems i was mistaken sorry he really was ill after all andwell he died baldwin had just made a very effective argument for the bishops taking as long as possible to reach limoges no one volunteered to bear the news to the old king though and will sighed he was no more eager than any of them to face henry but he feared this duty would end up in his lap too master de fabri will know who can best do whatwhat must be done ere we leave martel he said bleakly he did not even want to think about the mutilation of hals bodythe removal of his eyes brains and entrails the use of salt and spices to delay putrefaction long enough to reach rouen he knew the church dwelt upon the corrupt nature of mortal flesh so that all good christians would remember that nothing mattered but their eternal souls that body abovestairs looked too much like the young king hed served though for him to view it as just a husk to be discarded now that it was no longer needed wishing fervently for enough wine to drown all memories of this week of horrors will got slowly to his feet saying wed best see about he stopped abruptly then at the sight of the men swaggering into the hall why were sancho de savannac and his cutthroats still here that made no sense and he did not like it did not like it at all good morrow sancho said cheerfully he was accompanied by his chief henchmen but as he approached will saw more of the routiers entering the hall behind him will had hung his scabbard on the back of a chair and a quick scrutiny of his companions showed that most of them were not armed yet either acknowledging the outlaw tersely will started to move past him saying that he had much to do he was not surprised when sancho barred his way you can spare a few moments for me sir william we have a pressing matter to discuss the young king may god assoil him died deeply in debt alas owing us a large sum of money you profited handsomely from your service to the king rob said harshly from the corner of his eye will saw that he and baldwin were on their feet too several of etienne de fabris servants had been moving about the hall but they now showed the heightened awareness of prey animals and made an inconspicuous speedy withdrawal not as handsomely as we were promised in answering rob sancho kept his gaze unblinkingly upon will but i am a reasonable man do not want to add to your burdens in the midst of your mourning i am willing to settle for a smaller amount pay us one hundred marks and well consider the debt paid in full there were indignant exclamations from the knights will shrugged you might as well ask for a thousand marks we do not even have the money between us to pay for a requiem mass that is a pity sancho said shaking his head in feigned regret i suppose there is only one fair way to handle this then you will remain as our guest sir william whilst your friends raise the money once it is paid off you go with our blessings will studied the routiers with narrowed eyes not liking the odds sanchos cousin ander and his lackeys jago pere and gerhart had begun to fan out purposefully hands on sword hilts even more troubling other routiers had continued to saunter into the hall simon always hotheaded did not help matters then by calling sancho a lowborn churl and declaring that theyd never agree to such brazen extortion sanchos smile was toothy mocking and sharp with menace now lad lets not be hasty we know that youre all redoubtable knights celebrated on the tournament circuit you ought to keep in mind though that weve bloodied our swords a time or two ourselves and you might want to do a head count whilst youre at it will was glad to see baldwin and roger were restraining simon from doing anything mad hed made a quick assessment of their chances concluding that resistance was not an option theyd have to bluff sancho into backing down how does it serve your purposes he said coolly if we all end up dead sancho seemed amused by his challenge and will realized that this was not a man who acted rashly or impulsively hed given careful thought to this ambush that would make it difficult to collect a ransom from you he agreed so we came up with a second plan should you balk at cooperating if we cannot claim the renowned marshal as surety for this debt we will have to look elsewhere fortunately for us there is always the royal corpse the rest of his words were drowned out in an enraged roar of defiance coming from virtually every knights throat sancho seemed unperturbed by their fury continuing as if hed not been interrupted i daresay the old king will pay dear to get his beloved sons body back for a proper burial he might even offer more than a hundred marks will waited until he was sure his fury was under control yes hed payand then hed track you down to the ends of the earth into the gates of hell if need be sanchos smile did not waver yes hed likely hold a grudge that is why id rather do this the easier wayby offering you our hospitality sir william it is up to you of course but youd best make up your mind soon it is a hot summers day and it will not be long ere the royal corpse is too ripe to travel anywhere will glanced toward his friends saw that baldwin and peter had reached the same grim conclusion that he had my first duty is to the young king he said the calm voice belied by the fists tightly clenched at his sides i must escort his body to the monks at grandmont i will agree though to return and offer myself up as your hostage once this has been done you have my sworn word on that ander jago and gerhart howled with laughter their mirth stopping abruptly when sancho nodded as i said i am a reasonable man and you are known to be an honorable one we have a deal the other knights gathered around will appalled yet understanding they had no choice even simon could see that but sanchos men were now the ones to be incredulous and angry lapsing into their thieves cant a jumble of the lengua romana of aquitaine seasoned with basque and catalan that enabled them to communicate privately in public they began to protest vociferously sancho shouted them down enough when have i not known what i was doing i admit there are precious few men id trust to keep such a promise the marshal is one of them mayhap the only one this is a man who values his honor more than his life now you can argue whether that is an admirable virtue or a fatal character flaw he said with a grin but what matters is that it gets us our hundred marks who knows i might even be willing to spare a few deniers to buy candles for the royal whelps soul henry had never suffered from ragged nerves had always been at his best in a crisis in the days following hals message though he felt as if he were unraveling he had more trouble than usual sleeping had no interest in food and most troubling of all he was finding it difficult to concentrate his thoughts were as skittish as unbroken horses darting hither and yon as if he no longer had control of his own brain ostensibly he was laying siege to the ville in reality his mind was roaming far afield why had he not heard from bishop bertrand or rotrou by now theyd had more than enough time to get to martel and then return to limoges what did their ominous silence mean that hal was truly ailing or had they ridden into a trap were they being held prisoner whilst hal waited to see if the bait would be taken my liege geoff was bearing down upon him again and henry strove for patience who knew that sons could be worse than mothers for certes hed never gotten such wearisome constant solicitude from his other lads you are hovering again geoff he warned and geoff acknowledged the truth of the charge with an abashed grin i am being a pest i know he conceded for hed already been chiding henry about venturing within arrow range and nagging him about taking a midday meal i was just going to suggest that you seek shelter from the sun your nose is turning red so is yours henry pointed out for geoff had inherited his fair freckled skin actually he was amenable to the idea for the heat was unrelenting by the rood how he loathed the limousin the spring had been miserably wet and cold and now the summer was hellishly hot so when geoff gestured toward a nearby peasants hut he followed willingly ducking through the low doorway into a small gloomy cottage that reeked of onions and cabbage and sweat straightening up he found himself facetoface with the fearful occupants a bony spare man of indeterminate years and his toilworn wife henry had a rudimentary knowledge of eleanors lengua romana for hed always had an excellent ear for languages only welsh had proved to be impenetrable he summoned up enough of it now to assure the frightened couple that theyd not be harmed and his gentle words and the promise of a few coins did much to allay their unease he sat crosslegged then on the hard dirt floor his body admitting what his pride could notthat he was tired down to the very marrow of his bones ranulf soon joined them he was another mother hen henry thought wryly but he did not come emptyhanded he had several wineskins giving henry the one diluted with water and tossing the other to geoff make yourself comfortable henry invited and ranulf accepted the invitation lowering himself stiffly to the floor beside his nephew muttering that hed likely need help getting up again there were times when henry felt that his fifty years were weighing him down like an anchor but he was a stripling next to his uncle for ranulf would be sixtyfive that november because he did not see the older man that often the changes wrought by aging were more noticeable to him ranulfs hair was now pure silver and his shoulders were stooped his stride slowed by a touch of the joint evil the essential core of the man was still intact thoughthe impish humor and courage and awkward habit of truthtellingqualities that henry appreciated even more now than in his youth is bleddyn still balking at returning to wales without you he asked and ranulf nodded with a grimace that was part vexation and part pride he is missing his wife and bairns but he still insists that hell wait so we can return together he is a stubborn one is bleddyn and though hell not admit it his real reason for staying is that he thinks im too feeble and aged to get home safely by myself henry cocked a brow in geoffs direction and his eldest had the grace to blush just then willem entered the hut saying so this is where youve all gotten off to a monk from grandmont has arrived my liege is asking to see you shall i send him into your audience chamber here ill see him henry said thinking that the monk had likely come about their stolen pyx to their great relief hed promised that hed replace it of all hals outrages in recent weeks the plundering of grandmont was the one that rankled the most for henry had taken it just as his son had intendedas a personal affront he was getting to his feet when a brownclad form blocked the light from the door as the man stooped to enter and then straightened up henry was startled to see a familiar face guillaumeis that you and the heat of high summer notwithstanding he went cold for the prior of grandmont would not be the one to bear a mundane message his presence here was a message in and of itself henrys mouth was suddenly so dry that he did not even have enough saliva to spit all of you he managed to croak out they obeyed at once ranulf halting only long enough to shepherd the peasants ahead of him he thought too to close the door behind them and the hut was plunged into darkness henry welcomed it for instincts honed as sharp as any sword blade were warning that hed have need of its camouflaging kindness the prior took several steps forward would have knelt if henry had not stopped him i do not bring good news sire he said softly henry closed his eyes never wanted to have to open them again my son he whispered but he could go no further struck by superstitious dread that to say it aloud would banish any splinters of hope would indeed make it so the young king is dead my liege stricken by fever and the bloody flux the prior knew those were just symptoms of hals death the real cause was the vengeance of god for his wanton acts of sacrilege he saw no need to salt the kings wounds by saying so though and instead continued quietly telling henry that hals knights had arrived at grandmont that morn bearing the body of their lord and the sorrowful story of his last days after a few moments he realized that henry was not listening shall i go sire henry nodded but cried out as the prior reached the door wait whwhen on saturday eve my lord the prior said sadly and henry shut his eyes again on saturday there had been time if only hed believed he could have been at hals deathbed if hed not given in to his damnable doubts and suspicions hed have been there when his son needed him the most the sound of a closing door told him that he was alone and he sank to his knees but prayers would not come he prostrated himself on the floor of the hut just as hed once done upon the cold tiles before beckets tomb pressing his cheek into the dirt hearing no other sound in the world but the wild hammering of his heart as word spread men began to gather near the hut it was a subdued crowd conversing only in hushed murmurs and since henry was not in sight they were watching his advisors and confidants for it was well known that the king would have gone to martel if his counselors had not talked him out of it but the latter were oblivious to the stares and speculation for they could focus upon nothing except the man in that cottage geoff ranulf willem and maurice de craon were standing together not speaking each one alone with his regrets after the prior had emerged from the hut theyd heard only one cry a lament that raised the hairs on the back of their necks for it was a wail of pure pain and utter despair after that though there had been silence and somehow they found that more chilling than weeping or cursing or raging would have been richard was trying out a relatively new siege engine at aixe called a trebuchet it had a long arm pivoting on an axle the shorter end of the arm held the counterweight and the longer end called the verge was being winched down to the ground so they could load heavy stones into its sling once it was ready the engineers waited for the dukes signal and then released the trigger as the counterweight plummeted down the verge shot upward and rocks rained down upon the walls of the castle the soldiers let out a cheer and richard turned to alfonso with a delighted grin looking like a boy whod just been given a surprise present it has a much greater range than the mangonels he marveled and is more accurate too if those fools dont surrender soon well bring the castle walls down about their ears alfonso agreed equally impressed with the deadly potential of this new weapon thinking hed love to test it against the count of toulouse he followed after richard as the duke paced around the trebuchet inspecting it from every angle good work guy he told a soldier who beamed at the praise men were scurrying about making ready to reload and richard watched intently his brow furrowed in thought when alfonso caught up with him he murmured almost as if talking to himself i wonderif we shortened the sling would that increase the arc of the stones flight if so it would cover greater distance might even hit the keep itself when he looked questioningly at alfonso the aragonese king smiled and agreed although he had no clear idea what richard was talking about it was enough for him that the trebuchet worked unlike richard he felt no need to understand how and why it did but if richard thought so he was probably correct at twentyfive the duke was well on the way to becoming a master of the art of war are we within crossbow range alfonso asked suddenly for hed noticed that richard seemed remarkably casual about matters of personal safety when his friend mocked his caution he reminded richard amiably that his son and heir was only nine years old too young to rule in his own right so if i were killed at aixe it would cause no end of trouble in aragon whereas if you my lord duke were to take a fatal arrow in the chest your brother the young king would be happy to step into your shoes richards knights were taken aback but richard was amused not offended by alfonsos irreverence and laughed dukes may be expendable in aragon but here in aquitaine the dukes death matters more than the loss of any king as for the young king hell never see the day dawn when he he stopped in midsentence and alfonso following his gaze saw that riders were being escorted into the encampment is that not your brother the chancellor richard nodded and to judge by the doleful look on his face he is bringing yet more bad news i am beginning to think my father ought to have christened him jonah rather than geoffrey geoff and his men had dismounted by the time richard and alfonso reached them at close range geoffs agitation was even more obvious and richard braced himself for yet more bad news he greeted his brother brusquely then said well what have you come to tell me that i will not want to hear it is not bad news for you it might even be good news for england too but it is the worst possible news our father could have gotten richard stared at him are you sayingyou mean hal was actually telling the truth for once yes he was he died on saturday at martel there were gasps and exclamations from those whod heard alfonso made the sign of the cross richard was dumbfounded for hed had no doubts whatsoever that hal had been lying through his teeth he took a moment to absorb it and then scowled splendor of god were all in the soup then and me most of all when he starts doling out blame im likely to get the lions share geoff glared at him you have never understood our father have you he is not a man to seek scapegoats when we tried to apologize for giving him such faulty advice he would not hear it saying i am not louis capet he has taken all the blame upon himself for not going to martel and when we argued that it was the only decision under the circumstances he just looked at us with hollow empty eyes alfonso was becoming aware of an undercurrent of excitement surging through the camp as word passed from one man to another they were elated understanding what this would mean for their duke they were struggling to act sober and respectful knowing it was not seemly to gloat over hals death but most could not contain their glee glancing at richard alfonso saw that the full implications of hals death had not yet registered with him hed reacted instinctively as a son and a brother he kept his eyes upon his friends face and he would later tell his queen that hed seen the exact moment when richard realized that not only had he won his war he was now the heir to the english crown geoff was still chiding him on henrys behalf he was no longer listening his expression gave away nothing but alfonso was close enough to catch the hint of a smile curving the corners of his mouth henry had learned of his sons death on tuesday afternoon it was now wednesday night and he was utterly exhausted for hed slept no more than four or five hours in that time and when he had fallen asleep hed been tormented by remorseful dreams of hal that gave him neither peace nor rest as the hours dragged on hed told his squires to go to bed in the shadowed chamber he could barely make them out sprawled on pallets in the corner as tired as he was he was not yet ready to plunge into the nightmare cauldron of his dreams and he remained sitting in a windowseat doing his best to keep the past at bay when a discreet knock sounded he chose to answer the door himself much to the surprise of the bishops servant he blinked and then said speaking in the overly solicitous voice that people used to address the mortally ill my lordsir william marshal has just ridden in since you are still awake do you wish to see him or shall i tell him to wait till the morrow henry had known this moment would come when hed have to listen to a firstperson account of his sons suffering i will see him he said and tried to brace himself for the ordeal wills muscles were cramping and he was grateful when henry gestured for him to rise and told him to find a seat fetching a stool he sat down beside the king keeping his gaze lowered for it seemed somehow indecent to look upon another mans raw naked pain he had been dreading this meeting as much as henry but it had to be done a reckoning had to be made after waiting several moments for questions that did not come he realized the reason for henrys reticencefear that he was about to hear a story that would haunt him for the rest of his life who could blame him for assuming hal had died as fecklessly and carelessly as hed lived you may be proud of his last days my liege he said firmly for he showed courage dignity and grace dying as a good christian as a great lord ought to die setting an example for us all henry searched his face intently but he did not think marshal would lie to him tell me he said and will did thankful that hed not joined hal until the last week of his life and need not speak of those rash actions that the young king had so regretted at the end he related instead the story of the reckless selfish boy whod not become a man until it was almost too late he had to stop occasionally to collect himself for he was finding that retelling it was like reliving it and he was not surprised to see tears silently streaking henrys face as he listened how much worse it could have been though if hal had not repented and been shriven whilst there was still time we did not know what to do with your ring sire he concluded at last decided we ought to return it to you but it was remarkable for none of us could remove it from your sons finger it was as if even in death he could not bear to part with it henry swallowed with difficulty may god grant him salvation he whispered but it no longer seemed such a forlorn hope not after what hed just heard about hals remorse regrets and contrition there is one last duty you can perform for him marshal i want you to escort his funeral cortege to rouen my liegei would that i could but that is not possible and when henry frowned will hastily told him of hals final debts and the pledge hed been forced to make to the basque routier sancho de savannac my son cost me greatly henry said when he was done but i would that hed lived to cost me more this is not your debt marshal i will take care of it thank you sire will reached then for the pouch dangling from his belt and drew forth hals deathbed letter this is for you my lord king dictated by your son to the bishop of agen henry stared at that rolled parchment with dread will understood as painful as it would be to read his sons last words it might help to cauterize the wound though he waited patiently until henry took the letter assuming their conversation was over then but henry made no move to dismiss him henry was gazing down at the unbroken seal recognizing it as hals hed also used the sapphire ring to seal the letter and that brought a lump to henrys throat looking up after a long silence he said i wronged you marshal blaming you unfairly for his mistakes and his sins i see now that yours was the only level head in his mesnie once you were gone he foundered like a ship without a rudder i thank you for returning to him when you did for i do not doubt that you helped to steer him back onto the path to deliverance i could not have done so if youd not granted me that safe conduct sire will said and rose taking this as his cue to depart after you take my son to rouen come back to me will you are a good and honorable man and i would have you join my household knights will gasped hed hoped that henry would offer to assume responsibility for hals debt to sancho but his expectations had gone no further than that hed resigned himself to the loss of royal favor to a far different life from the one hed enjoyed during his years with hal my liege you do me great honor i would gladly serve you as i served your son there is yet one more trust that i must discharge on his behalf though he felt great shame for having taken the cross so lightly and he asked me to act in his stead to deliver his crusaders cloak to the holy sepulcher in jerusalem and you agreed of course henry said with a faint smile his first in more than a week go then with my blessings tell my chancellor how much you will need for your pilgrimage and he will issue letters of credit and upon your return a place will be waiting for you thank you my liege will waited sensing that there was something still to be said i would rather my son had triumphed over me than death had triumphed over him henry said very softly and will did not doubt him they regarded each other without need of words two very different men united in their shared sorrow for the kings son constance had been back at the ducal castle in rennes for only two days and she was still busy cataloguing all the damage done when roland de dinan had seized it on behalf of the english king trailed by a scribe clutching a wax tablet and bone stylus she was inspecting the storerooms as she tallied up their losses she was seething infuriated that so much would have to be replaced their flour was gone as were the salted herring cod and mackerel the dried figs and dates even the five bushels of salt shed purchased that spring they were like a swarm of godcursed locusts she fumed they stripped the hall and bedchambers bare stole our grey fur coverlet that had been a wedding gift from the bishop of rennes even looted several pounds of wax im surprised they did not steal the grease used for cartwheel axles her butler murmured his agreement and the clerk scribbled hastily to keep up with her torrent of words her ladies juvette and blanche exchanged knowing looks for they understood that her foul mood was not explained entirely by the sorry state of the castle duke geoffrey had returned to the war after recovering rennes and staging punitive raids into roland de dinans lands at becherel and constance had hoped that hed left her with child this morning shed found out it was not so much to her disappointment the butler now led the way toward the buttery where constance knew their greatest losses lay any of the tuns of wine not drained dry by de dinans men would have been carried off when hed retreated leaving a garrison behind to guard his prize shed heard that they had not put up much resistance when geoffrey had besieged the castle loath to fight against their duke constance could take some solace from that yet more proof of geoffreys acceptance by her breton lords hed managed to overcome a huge liabilitythat he was the english kings sonwith uncanny ease of course she knew his campaign to win them over had begun well before their marriage hed laid the groundwork during those years when he was acting as his fathers deputy in brittany forging bonds with men like raoul de fougeres and reginald de boterel that would stand him in good stead once he no longer relied upon henry for his standing in brittany constance still marveled at the vast difference between the reality of her marriage and her bleak expectations she would have scoffed at the romantic idea of soul mates nevertheless they had reached a remarkable understanding with surprising speed discovering that they shared the same aspirations and ambitions the same innate skepticism and gamblers instincts with as an added bonus the pleasure they found in their marriage bed theyd be wed two years in august with only one serious quarrel in all that time geoffrey had been furious to learn that she had countermanded him and returned to brittany instead of seeking safety at the french court constance had been forced to apologize which did not come easily to her but geoffrey had right on his sideshe had indeed been put at risk by the seizure of the ducal castle and shed had to concede that her capture would have been disastrous the buttery was a total loss theyd even taken the keg of verjuice i hope my lord husband burned de dinans manor to the ground she said angrily if it were up to me id have sown salt into his fields the judas her butler thought that was not entirely fair to roland de dinan whod been given the stark choice of offending his patron the english king or his duke and duchess he was not crazed enough to offer a defense of the disgraced baron though and sought to console constance by revealing that some of the wine had no longer been drinkable wine rarely remained potable for more than a year for if it was exposed to the air it developed an acid unpleasant taste that did cheer constance somewhat she hoped that the marauders had ended up as sick as dogs she was turning to check the details on her scribes tablet when juvette rushed into the buttery madame the lord duke has just ridden into the bailey constance froze geoffreys unexpected return could only mean something had gone very wrong had he gotten word of a coming attack upon brittany he is not injured oh no madame i could see no signs that hes been wounded buthe and his men look very grim i fear he brings bad news so did constance normally she would have hastened out to greet him but she decided now that a private reunion might be better and she said abruptly leave me all of you tell the duke that i await him in the buttery it seemed like forever to her before geoffrey came through the doorway even in such subdued lighting she could see that he was bonewhite the skin tightly drawn around his eyes his mouth set in a thin taut line he closed the door then leaned back against it hal is dead dear god constances shock held her motionless for a moment and then she moved swiftly toward him how surely not even richard would dare to kill a king it was not richards doing hehe died at martel of the bloody flux geoffrey sounded numb and she could easily understand why for when theyd attempted to envision all the possible drawbacks to this war it had never occurred to either of them that hal might die he was twentyeight in excellent health and shielded from the ordinary dangers of the battlefield by his highborn status who could have imagined hed be struck down by an infection of the bowels was he shriven ere he died yes thank god for that mercy he made a very good end for certes a dramatic one geoffrey meant to sound sardonic sounded sad instead theyd never been very close and his boyhood admiration for the dashing elder brother had faded once hed begun to assess hal with adult eyes but hed discovered somewhat to his surprise that he mourned hal both as a brother and as an ally if i had not agreed to join him he might still be alive his war was made possible by breton money no geoffrey you did not coax hal into rebellion ill not let you blame yourself in his entire life hal never did anything that he did not want to do even if we had stayed out of it it would have changed nothing aimar and the other barons were set upon rebellion and halwell he could resist anything but temptation he would still have she got no further for geoffrey kissed her thank you for that darling for what she asked puzzled but pleased for your use of pronouns seeing her lack of comprehension he kissed her again for saying we i thought you might blame me for this for entangling brittany in a war we can no longer win we made the decision together geoffrey if we lose well do that together too geoffrey was touched by this display of loyalty he and constance were still learning about each other and he had not been sure how shed react he had no qualms about lying if it furthered his own interests he did not want to lie to constance though and he needed to be sure she understood what they were facing fortunes wheel has spun with a vengeance constance it is not just that the rebellion is lost and we have no choice but to submit to my father and hope he is in a forgiving mood it is she reached up stopped his words by putting her fingers to his lips i am not a child geoffrey i understand what hals death means for england and for brittany but whatever comes we will deal with it what other choice do we have he slid his arm around her waist drew her in against him have i ever told you he murmured that i consider myself a lucky man she was dismayed to find herself blinking back tears and she turned her face into his shoulder so hed not see saying briskly of course you are lucky you are the duke of brittany after all after a few moments he said i want to found a chaplaincy in hals memory and she agreed that would be a good thing to do by mutual consent they did not speak of the future and what it held for themwhen theyd be accountable not to an indulgent father but to a soldier king who bore them a deadly grudge agace looked up as the door opened and judith entered crossing the chamber she murmured a few words in the older womans ear agace got stiffly to her feet and approached the bed my lamb there was no response bending over she gently stroked the tumbled fair hair spilling over the pillow your lord brother is here again asking to see you do you feel up to it marguerite shook her head are you sure dearest marguerite kept her eyes tightly shut but her lips moved and agace leaned closer to catch the whispered words i do not want to see him agace and judith exchanged troubled glances their young queen could not hide forever from the world eventually she would have to pick up the shattered pieces of her life and accept her loss but if she needed more time agace was going to see that she got it rest now my lamb i will send him away she promised and left judith to watch over their mistress while she was gone judith sat down in the chair agace had vacated grateful that she would not be the one to deal with the french king philippe had always treated her with courtesy he made her uneasy though for reasons she could not have articulated and she understood why marguerite did not turn to him for comfort her lady had a loving heart and a generous nature whereas there was something bloodless and sly about her brother agace did not like philippe any more than judith did and as she looked into his pale blue eyes so oddly ageless in such a young face she felt a throb of despair knowing that marguerites fate was now in his hands hers had been a long and eventful life though and she knew better than to antagonize a king especially this one greeting him with exaggerated deference she told him regretfully that the queen had finally fallen asleep after yet another wakeful wretched night as shed hoped philippe quickly told her not to disturb marguerite just to tell her of his visit philippe was grateful for the reprieve a sense of duty compelled him to check on his sister but he did not know how to comfort her and their few encounters since learning of hals death had been awkward and uncomfortable what was he supposed to say to a woman whod done little but weep all week long after returning to the great hall he was too restless to stay and strode out into the royal gardens at the west end of the island if the ile was the heart of paris home to both his palace and the great cathedral of notre dame the seine was its main artery and even at dusk the quays were still busy ships from rouen unloading below the grand pont and those coming downriver docking at the greve formerly the site of the weekly paris market but now where local vintners sold their wares this change was philippes doing for he had established a new market at a more convenient location and erected two large sheds so merchants could do their haggling indoors while hed denied parisians the right to form a commune he did have a keen interest in civic improvements and ambitious plans that went far beyond the indoor market at les halles he hoped in time to build a defensive wall around the city and to pave the main streets he did not have the funds for such projects yet but philippe believed in longrange planning and he was willing to wait for what he wanted resting his elbows upon the stone garden wall philippe looked out upon his city as it was gradually cloaked in the soft shades of a summer eve he was trying to be patient with marguerite but he feared that if left to her own devices shed do nothing but weep and wallow in her grief he wished there was some sensible female he could consult but his mother had never shown any sympathy for the daughters of louiss earlier marriages his own queen was a child of thirteen and marguerites mother was long dead her sister alys in england he sighed thinking that sisters were more trouble than they were worth his half sisters alix and marie were strangers and marie had openly allied herself with the count of flanders against him there was his full sister agnes a child bride caught up in a bloody coup in constantinople her fate uncertain and then there was the vexing problem that was his half sister alys she had been betrothed to richard for fourteen years and philippe was offended that the wedding had not yet taken place henry kept offering excuses but nothing changedexcept that alys got older she was already twentytwo for pitys sake philippe knew richard had never been keen to marry alys and he couldnt really blame him since she had no marriage portion he suspected that henry and richard were in collusion looking elsewhere for a more profitable marital alliance while keeping alys off the marriage market thus preventing him from making any advantageous alliances by wedding alys to someone else it had been irksome and was unfair to alys but philippe had not seen it as a priority problem for hed assumed that hal would become king sooner than later from philippes vantage point henrys fifty years was a vast age indeed how much longer could he live and once hal was king hed have ordered richard to marry alys whether he liked it or not philippes thoughts had come full circle for he was back to marguerite and the inopportune death of his brotherinlaw hals loss was a great blow to philippe for hed predicated his plans upon having an amiable pleasureloving prince on the english throne instead hed have to deal with richard who was as unlike hal as any two men could be how could he be so unlucky well one step at a time the immediate concern was recovering marguerites marriage portion from the english king sure that henry would sooner cut off his arm than return the vexin philippe frowned thoughtfully if henry held on to the vexin that would make philippe the laughingstock of christendom the boyking who was no match for the wily veteran on the english throne an idea was glimmering in the back of his brain and he waited for it to come into focus what if he could make it worth richards while to marry alys suppose he offered the vexin as alyss dowry that would save face and would also give him leverage for he could make the agreement contingent upon the marriage and who knows it might even stir up discord between henry and richard the wind had picked up and thunder echoed in the distance philippe considered it prudent to seek shelter and he signaled to his waiting bodyguards he must give this idea more thought but it seemed promising and as he exited the garden he smiled thinking that if he could marry alys off to richard he could then concentrate upon finding a new husband for marguerite she was still of childbearing age with a pretty face and a docile nature a queen with the blood of french kings in her veins thered be no shortage of princes interested in such a bargain bride the english queen was back at sarum and amaria was pleased by the move welcoming any change in the predictable ebb and flow of daily life on this sunsplashed june afternoon she was enjoying the hustle and bustle of market day held on the open ground below the castles east gate accompanied by a servant to tote her purchases shed spent several pleasant hours browsing among the booths buying needles and thread a vial of rosewater scarlet ribbons almond oil the hazelnuts that her queen liked and several jars of honey it was wonderful to have enough money for impulse and luxury buys amaria was very appreciative of the queens rise in status in good spirits she bought candied quince from a vendor and included the delighted young servant in her generosity some of her cheer began to dissipate as they headed back toward the castle for the queens chamber was no happy place these days eleanor had lost so much weight that her face looked drawn and pinched and amaria had to urge her to eat her days were long and her nights were worse amaria ached too feeling her pain and fear and sympathizing with her rage had she been free shed have sailed for her homeland weeks ago recklessly plunging into the very midst of war as she sought to end this fratricidal strife between her sons because she remained tethered to her husbands will she unleashed much of her frustration and fury upon his absent head speaking of him with more bitterness than amaria had heard from her in years amaria did what she could provided an audience for her rants and prayed earnestly that the king would soon restore peace to his domains and his family other than that they could only wait for word from the limousin she paused to exchange greetings with some of the townsmen streaming back into the castle shed discovered to her amusement that she was a source of considerable interest to the inhabitants of sarumthe person closest to that legendary being eleanor of aquitaine they soon parted ways the villagers heading off toward the homes nestled under the castle walls and amaria and her young helper continuing in the direction of the keep and royal palace as soon as they passed through the gatehouse into the inner bailey amaria sensed that something was wrong the courtyard was usually like a hive for humans with servants and soldiers and visitors milling about in raucous confusion dogs getting underfoot and chickens squawking and horses eager to reach the stables and their waiting feed now though an eerie silence greeted amaria a few people were out and about but they were also acting oddly clustered together in small knots and conversing in the hushed tones usually heard only in church the boy felt it too glancing around uneasily as if he expected to find the castle under attack at any moment just then one of the maidservants spotted them dame amaria weve been looking all over for you it is just terriblethe queens son is dead he was stricken but amaria was no longer listening lifting up her skirts she began to run s he arrived panting and flushed in the queens chamber only to find it empty for a moment she stood irresolute and then realized that eleanor might be in the chapel of st nicholas it was accessible from the royal apartments but she paused for a moment before she entered trying to collect her thoughts she was not truly surprised for shed long feared that this would happen men might laud duke richard for his utter fearlessness but not the women who loved him as shed expected she found eleanor in the chapel standing by one of the windows her face was partly in shadow one cheek dappled with the deep rose hues of the panes above her head for the sun was setting the stained glass afire she turned at the sound of footsteps upon the tiles and amaria bit back a cry for the queen could have been a stranger she seemed to have aged years in just a few hours and amaria had never seen her look as she did nowvulnerable frail and defeated my lady i am so sorry amarias words ended in a stifled sob as she came to a halt stretching out her hand in a tentative gesture of comfort that fell short her fingers just brushing the sleeve of eleanors gown i wanted to pray for his salvation eleanor said dully but i do not think the almighty is listening to me not anymore amaria was momentarily mute for shed never known such despair herself even when shed lost her own babies shed not lost her belief in gods mercy she looked at the queen her eyes blurring with tears but she had to ask had to know the worst if she had any hope of consoling this stricken woman madamewas he shriven and when eleanor nodded she leaned against the wall weak with relief god be praised surely thatthat must be of some comfort my lady so often men die in battle without confessing their sins beforehand and duke richard was she stopped then for eleanor was looking at her blankly eleanor felt as if her brain was no longer working as it ought and it took a moment or so until she understood the meaning of amarias words it is not richard it is hal amaria was astounded richards death would have made more sense for he gambled with his own mortality on a daily basis but hal hed seemed to be one of heavens favorites blessed and beloved not a man whose life would be cut short with such fearful finality hhow eleanor shook her head not yet able to talk about it just as she was not ready to think about the political consequences what hals death would mean to richard for now she was a mother whose child had been cruelly taken from her and nothing else mattered her shoulders slumping she leaned her forehead against the sunburnished stained glass closing her eyes against the glare my poor hal she whispered he so wanted to be a king and he was never more than a pawn chapter fortythree july sarum england the queens nights had been so troubled that amaria had gone to see the village apothecary and after consulting him purportedly for her own sleeplessness she purchased a sleeping draught of henbane and black poppy she returned to the castle with a lighter step for it helped immeasurably to know the countess of chester was there maud was familiar with the blighted desolate landscape of grief she too had suffered the loss of a son and she could be candid with the queen in a way that amaria could not amaria thought she could already see an improvement in eleanors spirits and she blessed the countess for being such a loyal friend as she entered the queens chamber she found eleanor seated by the open window reading a letter and maud playing with the cat maud smiled at amaria beckoned her over and related that the queen had just gotten a letter from the duchess of saxony it is bound to comfort her she said softly hearing from her daughter amaria was not so sure what if tilda had more bad news to disclose cleo was curled up contentedly in mauds lap and lulled by her benign demeanor amaria ventured to pet her only to have the feline flatten her ears and spit maud told her not to take it personally explaining that cats were given to whims and unpredictable behavior but to amaria she sounded faintly smug the way people who never got seasick commiserated with those who did glancing up from the letter eleanor said my daughter writes that viscount aimar surrendered his castle a fortnight ago harry razed it to the ground and aimar was compelled to forswear further revolts but tilda thinks he got off lightly the other rebels have gone to ground too for a moment her eyes held mauds and the same thought was in both their minds that the rebellion had died when hal drew his last breath eleanor swallowed with a visible effort and lowered her gaze to the letter but then she stiffened in disbelief god in heaven when she looked up again she was shaking her head in amazement tilda says that as will marshal and hals knights carried his bier north crowds gathered by the roadside to watch weeping and mourning a leper and a woman suffering from hemorrhages claimed to be cured after touching his bier they were equally astonished and she held up her hand to forestall questions wait there is more when the funeral cortege halted at the monastery of st savin people said they could see a beam of light shining down upon the church and as they approached le mans a cross was seen in the sky and another beam of light enveloped the bier the citizens of le mans were convinced theyd seen a miracle and they seized hals body insisting that he be buried in their city will and the knights protested to no avail and he was interred in their cathedral next to harrys father the other women were dumbfounded naturally they believed in saints and miracles but neither one could envision hal as a saint could they say so forthrightly though to his mother eleanor had resumed reading continuing to shake her head at the contents of the letter tilda says the townspeople of rouen were outraged threatening war with le mans if hals body were not reinterred and buried in their cathedral as he wished and to keep the peace harry has had to order it done looking up she said with a sad smile hal would have been amused by the furor and even more amused to hear himself proclaimed a saint his ambitions never rose higher than a kingship amaria was emboldened to confess that she did not understand any of it she got her answer from maud as the countess said dryly saints are valuable commodities dame amaria holy relics attract pilgrims and saints are even more useful for political purposes cousin harry could contend with his rebellious archbishop but he had no chance whatsoever against the holy martyr turning her attention again to the letter eleanor drew a hissing breath do you remember the archdeacon of welles maud harry sent him to me with word of hals death knowing that he had always been sympathetic to my plight it seems the good archdeacon is one of those promoting hals sanctity according to him i already knew of my sons death for id had a dream in which he wore two crowns and i told archdeacon thomas that these dual crowns could only mean eternal bliss and everlasting joy the archdeacon has been commending me in his sermons for fathoming the mystery of my dream and for accepting hals death with such discernment and strength amaria was now thoroughly confused but not maud who said with a frown youd best write to harry and assure him that the archdeacon has a vivid imagination if you wish i will write to him too and tell him that i was present when you first learned of the archdeacons claims that is not needed maud but i thank you harry will know without being told that i would not have said this seeing amarias bewilderment eleanor said with a thin smile harrys foes learned well from archbishop thomass martyrdom if they can convince people that hal was a saint that puts harry in a very poor light indeed and whilst i admit that there have been times when that would have given me great satisfaction if harry is tarnished by thisthis foolishness then so is richard and harry knows i would do nothing to undermine richards authority in aquitaine he has enough troubles there as it is but this thought remained unspoken for not even to maud would eleanor confess her misgivings about her second sons heavyhanded rule over the turbulent defiant barons of her duchy going back to her daughters letter she smiled again only this one was genuine at last some good news tilda says that geoffrey has been summoned to meet harry and richard at angers god willing we can restore family harmony although how long it will last maud was surprised that eleanor seemed so eager to see geoffrey forgiven for shed assumed that the queen would have been very wroth with him for the part hed played in the assault upon her favorite son striving for tact she said you bear geoffrey no grudge then eleanors smile disappeared as if it had never been i am not happy with him nothing is more important though than bringing peace to our family and our domains i have lost one son this summer and i will be damned if i will lose another henry was standing upon the dais in the great hall at angers conversing with the bishop and several of his barons losing interest richard drifted over to an open window he was growing impatient for theyd been waiting since noon for his errant brother to make his appearance one of the castle dogs had followed him and he was roughhousing with the hound when geoff joined him their alliance of expediency still endured for both men had been equally outraged by the claims of sainthood being made on hals behalf they began to discuss the latest developments now for geoff had just learned that robert de neubourg the dean of rouen cathedral had been the one making the loudest demands for the recovery of hals body i think the dean is intent upon feathering his own nest he said darkly all know his uncle rotrous ailment is likely to be mortal and all know too that he is keen to succeed rotrou as the next archbishop of rouen what better way to court votes from the canons than by securing a saint for their cathedral richard wondered why geoff sounded so indignant for he took it for granted that men acted out of selfinterest well you did not think he truly believed in hals holiness did you the only ones who could swallow that fable are madmen drunks and gullible ceorls at least they were not such fools in my duchy there were no grieving crowds lining the roads in the limousin or poitou that lunacy did not start until theyd crossed into anjou it is hard to see a man as saintly when youve been watching him plundering your abbeys and terrorizing your clerics geoff agreed but richard was no longer listening nudging his brother he gestured and turning toward the window geoff saw that geoffrey had just ridden into the bailey will you look at that he said in surprise for geoffrey was not only accompanied by his duchess but it appeared as if half the barons in brittany were in his entourage geoff had not expected that for geoffrey had never shown hals partiality for pageantry and spectacle richard was surprised too the milksop does he hope to hide behind his wifes skirts no he has something more subtle in mind neither of them had heard henrys approach and they both jumped at the unexpected sound of his voice kneeling on the windowseat to get a better view he said he is a clever lad geoffrey he is reminding us that he is duke of brittany by right of his wife that he owes nothing to me and the presence of his breton lords testifies to the widespread support he enjoys amongst his baronsin case i should be rash enough to contemplate trying to divest him of the duchy geoff and richard exchanged looks of mutual aggravation for their father sounded almost admiring of geoffreys political acumen theyd already concluded that henry was not likely to punish his son more harshly than he had the viscount of limoges but it was still exasperating to get confirmation of their qualms uprooting geoffrey from brittany sounds like a fine idea to me richard said acerbically although he knew that had never been an option henry didnt reply watching as geoffrey helped constance to dismount his attention was drawn then to a minor commotion on the edge of the crowd ranulf and bleddyn had shouldered their way through the bystanders and were thumping morgan on the back bantering and laughing showing such pleasure in their reunion that henry felt a sharp pang of envy why could his relations with his sons not be as simple as easy constance gave geoffreys hand a quick squeeze and then he began that long walk toward the dais where his father and brother awaited him he was determined to show no emotion not willing to give richard that satisfaction unfastening his scabbard he put his sword upon the steps and then knelt my lord king i am here to seek your pardon for the part i played in the rebellion i offer no excuses for my actions can only hope that you find it in your heart to forgive me henry wondered how often hed have to play out this farce with one of his sons they always said the right things showed the proper contrition but their words rang hollow and when he looked into their eyes he saw strangers he found he had no stomach for yet another of these public mockcapitulations and got abruptly to his feet come with me he said brusquely and without waiting to make sure geoffrey was obeying he strode from the hall they faced each other in the castle solar a chamber shadowy and stifling for henry had jerked the shutters into place not wanting to risk eavesdroppers gathering below the window leaning back against a table he regarded his son in baffled anger geoffreys betrayal had been more painful than hals for hed never seen it coming by that spring hed had few illusions left about his eldest but hed honestly thought geoffrey was trustworthy finding that it was not so had been a severe blow both to the king and the father you realize he said at last that if youd not thrown in with hal it is likely hed not have been able to rebel he left the rest of the sentence unsaid but geoffrey found it easy enough to finish the thought and hal might still be alive so i am to atone for hals sins as well as my own who else am i to answer for the french king the viscount of limoges geoffrey knew he was in no position to offer defiance but that implied accusation had stung all the more so because the same thought had crossed his own mind he braced himself for henrys fury to his surprise though it did not come henry looked at him in silence and then astonished him by saying quietly that was not fair of me i do not blame you for hals death nor would he want me to it may not have happened until he was on his deathbed but at the last he accepted full responsibility for his actions took all the guilt for the rebellion upon himself there was a dull throbbing pain behind his right eye and his bad leg had begun to ache he shifted so that more of his weight rested against the table keeping his eyes upon his sons face i do not want to hear your apologies or promises of future loyalty geoffrey we both know how little such words mean what i do want from you is honesty you may speak your mind without fear of consequences i wanti needto know why geoffrey blinked in amazement jesus god papa you know why no i do not how could you not know because you refused to grant us richmond and nantes that may be the pretext but it was not the cause you knew it was only a matter of time until they came into your hands for id promised them to you why were you not willing to wait despite henrys demand for utter candor geoffrey knew he could not tell his father that his promises were dross as unsubstantial as cobwebs and smoke he compromised by offering as much truth as he dared nantes is the heart of brittany and the honour of richmond belonged by rights to constances father when he died it should have passed to her and all know it have you never thought that by holding on to these lands you diminish me in my wifes eyes and the eyes of her barons henry was not sure how geoffrey had managed to back him into a corner that is nonsense your barons know it is a delay not a denial even after your recent treachery i am not saying these lands are forfeit although few would blame me if i did but i cannot help feeling grateful that i held on to them for if youd had control of nantes that would have enabled you to launch attacks directly into poitou my giving you nantes might well have made it possible for you to win your rebellion geoffrey stared at him christ papa if youd given me nantes i would never have rebelled he said wearily and after that there seemed nothing more to say tilda smiled at the sight meeting her eyes her tenyearold son heinrich manfully struggling to pull a bowstave back with some unobtrusive help from his grandfather suppose we find you a smaller bow on the morrow henry suggested tactfully and then we can have a real lesson will you shoot it one more time heinrich entreated and henry obligingly showed the boy the proper stance and how to nock the arrowalways on the left side of the stave drawing the bowstring back he loosed the arrow and heinrich gave a jubilant shout when it flew across the garden and thudded into the trunk of a chestnut tree can you do that again no dearest he cannot tilda intervened for it is past your bedtime but it is still light out mama heinrich you know full well that it stays light in august until long past compline tilda reminded him but he continued to argue until henry weighed in on tildas side conceding defeat then he made a reluctant retreat as the adults hid their smiles until he was out of view it is kind of you papa to offer to tutor heinrich in the use of a bow he has always wanted to learn but my husband told him it was not worth mastering since the bow is a weapon for the lowborn the routier he is right about that henry agreed no man of good birth would go into battle with a bow but the lad needs to know how to shoot it if he ever expects to bring down a deer tildas husband did not share henrys passion for the hunt she had no intention of telling him that however for heinrichs lack of enthusiasm would be beyond his ken deciding to take advantage of this rare time alone with her father she linked her arm in his and steered him toward the closest bench may i ask you a question papa of course sweetheart he said quickly but she caught the flicker of a smile as he added i cannot promise to answer it though not until i hear what it is you need not worry she assured him with a smile of her own i will not ask anything awkward or embarrassing in other words she thought nothing about her mother i am puzzled by something you did last month i understand why you insisted that geoffrey surrender control to you of his breton castles but why did you demand the same of richard hehe was not happy saw it as an affront to his pride believe me lass i know richard is never one to suffer in silence henry was quiet for a moment deciding how much to tell her i was not trying to demean richard tilda but ive become increasingly concerned about the hostility between richard and his barons god knows they are no easy lot to govern and you can rarely go wrong suspecting the worst of eleanors poitevins richard is too quick though to apply the whip and spurs passing strange for he is a superb horseman but he rides men too hard and i have not been able to get him to see that tilda had heard her husband voice the same opinion she did not see though how it helped matters to put henrys men in command of richards castles mayhap it would ease richards resentment if you made a formal announcement that he is to be your heir henry was amused by her fishing expedition and decided to let her hook one as it happens lass i plan to do just that next month tilda was glad to hear it for she was troubled by her familys discord shed been deeply shocked by the rebellion and she could take little comfort from the peace that followed hals death for she feared it was not likely to last heinrich had warned her not to mediate between her father and brothers saying it would serve for naught and might jeopardize their own position at henrys court tilda was usually willing to defer to his wishes but she would have ignored his admonition if shed thought she might succeed she knew though that shed be wasting her breath that neither her father nor her brothers were willing or able to see any side but their own papai have a favor to ask of you i would like you to give me permission to go to england before he could respond she reached over and touched his arm in silent supplication please hear me out i want my children to meet their grandmother surely that is not so much to ask no of course it is not but there is no need tilda felt a rare stab of anger why were the men in her family so stubborn you did promise me papa that i could see maman how much longer must i wait you misunderstood me tilda i meant that there is no need to go to england i have sent word to ralf de glanville to make arrangements to bring eleanor to rouen truly papa thank you tilda flung her arms around his neck and he laughed wondering why daughters were so much easier to content than sons truly lass she ought to be here by michaelmas amaria looked up from her embroidery as the queen came into their chamber she knew at once that ralph fitz stephen must have given eleanor good news for there was becoming color in her cheeks and her eyes were filled with light you will never guess what sir ralph told me how would you fancy a sea voyage amaria madame my husband has summoned me to join our family in rouen who says the age of miracles is past my lady that is wonderful i will be able to see my daughter and grandchildren at long last to spend time with richard to pray at hals tomb and to escape this wretched wet isle at least for a while it has always amazed me that ive been able to avoid the joint evil for it is like living underwater in england eleanor said and laughed your sons plea must have touched your husbands heart madame did you not tell me that his last wish was for the king to forgive you so tilda said in her letter eleanor sat down in the windowseat as amaria hastened over to pour wine for them both clinking their cups playfully together they drank to a quick departure and calm sailing but after a time eleanor set her cup down and when amaria glanced over she saw that the queen was no longer smiling madame is something amiss i am not sure amaria i find myself wondering eleanor said what he is up to now chapter fortyfour september rouen normandy as they approached the door of the great cathedral henrys step slowed and eleanor gave him an inquiring look i am sorry he said very softly but i cannot do this i understand she said just as softly and then for the benefit of their audience i just had an idea my lord whilst i go inside you can go over to the palace to see archbishop rotrou and we will meet you there afterward robert de neubourg had stopped when he realized they were no longer following him i think that is an excellent suggestion my liege i am sure a visit from you would cheer my uncle greatly for he grows weaker by the day poor soul henry found something ghoulish about the deans preoccupation with his uncles health he suspected robert was far more concerned with the looming church vacancy than with rotrous mortality all that mattered to him now though was escaping what he was not yet ready to dopay a visit to his sons tomb seizing upon eleanors subterfuge he gave her a grateful smile declaring that he would go straightaway to see archbishop rotrou and was soon striding off with most of his entourage hurrying to keep pace the others stayed with eleanor and tilda following as the dean escorted them into the cathedral they found excuses to remain behind in the nave though knowing that the queen would want privacy while she prayed at her sons tomb holding a lantern aloft the dean led the way down the stairs keeping up a running commentary about the large crowds coming to the young kings sepulcher shall i ask one of the canons to clear the crypt of pilgrims so you may pray in peace madame when eleanor agreed he beckoned to the young canon standing vigil by the door after exchanging a few words he turned back to the queen and her daughter the pilgrims have already been removed madame for your sons are within and they wanted time alone with the young king eleanor was so startled that she almost slipped on the worn stone steps richard and geoffrey together she very much wanted to believe they could resolve their differences at hals tomb but that did not seem likely to her not knowing her sons as she did robert trailed after her as she continued down the stairs and would have entered with her had tilda not intervened diplomatically suggesting that the dean show her around the cathedral whilst the queen prayed he looked disappointed not wanting to miss the queens reunion with her sons but the duchess of saxony was smiling at him expectantly and he yielded as graciously as he could casting one last wistful glance over his shoulder at the queen as the canon opened the door for her the undercroft was lit by wall torches but eleanor still wished shed thought to ask the dean for his lantern candles flamed around hals tomb and she could make out geoffreys figure kneeling in prayer she did not see richard though as she stepped forward movement caught her eye and she found herself facing her youngest son shed not seen john for almost two years and those had been eventful years for him hed grown quite a bit although he was obviously not going to be as tall as his brothers his body had taken on the unmistakable signs of adolescence and if he was not yet ready to flaunt a beard he did look as if he had to shave now and then her son at sixteen in the past hed been as elusive as a wood sprite she was surprised therefore when he came toward her instead of retreating back into the shadows madame he said formally showing hed mastered his lessons in courtesy and manners but then he flashed a sudden impish grin i am john your son he had eyes like a fox eleanor thought golden and alert and wary i am not likely to forget you john she said dryly i was present at your birth after all if i looked surprised it is because i thought you were still in england i reached rouen three days ago my father did not mention that hed summoned me he still smiled but she saw that it rankled to think hed been forgotten i only arrived this afternoon so harry has not had time to tell me much of anything i did not even unpack yet wanted to come here first theyd been speaking quietly so as not to disturb geoffreys prayers but hed still heard the murmur of voices and turned toward the sound at the sight of his mother conflicting emotions chased across his faceboth pleasure and unease john glanced from eleanor to geoffrey back to eleanor again i am sure i can find some mischief to get into he said and headed for the stairs pleasantly surprised by his sensitivity eleanor thanked him and then approached geoffrey mamanit gladdens me to see you i suppose you cannot say the same though ill not deny that i was wroth with you and hal i thought the pair of you had more sense than to get entangled with aimar and my malcontent barons geoffrey was running his hand over the cold marble of his brothers sepulcher i am truly sorry maman sorry that you rebelled geoffrey or that you lost both he admitted and was taken aback when she smiled i was remembering she said that when your father asked me that question i gave that very same answer geoffrey expelled his breath slowly i was afraid youd blame me for hals death it is enough that we answer for our own sins without being held to account for the sins of others i understand your frustration over harrys refusal to grant you richmond and nantes i truly do but your grievance was with your father not with richard what you and hal did was no better than banditry geoffrey looked down at hals tomb i would gladly undo it if only i could maman i know she said and she did for who knew more about vain regrets than she crossing the space between them she held out her hand he was quick to grasp it and she drew him to her holding him close she found her eyes stinging if only she could have embraced hal like this too geoffrey kissed her on the cheek then stepped back looking past her toward the stairs shall we speak louder for your benefit johnny john looked abashed at being caught eavesdropping so openly i guess you would not believe id stopped to remove a pebble from my shoe this time with their eyes unwaveringly upon him he really did depart once she was sure he had gone eleanor said pensively passing strange that i must admit this about my own son but i do not know john at all none of us do maman and that includes papa he cherishes this image of johnny as his only loyal son obedient and affectionate and trustworthy whether that is the real johnny or not remains to be seen eleanor was struck by geoffreys perceptionand by his cynicism had she and harry taught him that most likely they had kissing her hand with a playful flourish geoffrey said id best keep an eye on johnny i will await you up in the nave maman grateful that he was giving her this time alone with hal she crossed to his tomb and kneeling upon the hard tile floor she began to pray for the soul of her son when he was upset or angry richard paced like henry and as he strode up and down her chamber eleanor thought she could have been looking at her husband in his youth richard was taller but otherwise they had the same powerful build the same vibrant coloring and for certes the same fiery temper so far richard had turned their reunion into a recital of his paternal grievances and she was disappointed but not entirely surprised shed hoped that fighting the rebels together might have brought them closer although without any real expectations of it being so for they were too much alike to dwell in harmony for long she thought it was a blessing that richard would have his own sphere of power in aquitaine that unlike hal hed not be dependent upon his fathers largesse belatedly becoming aware that richard had stopped speaking she looked up to find her son regarding her reproachfully are you even listening to me maman of course i am she assured him not altogether truthfully you were telling me about the troubadour bertran de born as i was saying bertran boasted that his castle at autafort was impregnable but alfonso and i took it in just seven days i then gave it to his brother and sent him to my father for judgment where he beguiled papa by professing great sorrow over hals death and writing a planh lamenting his loss so what does papa do he not only pardons the man but he restores autafort castle to him he sounded so indignant that eleanor hid a smile you must bear in mind richard that your fathers wound is still raw and bleeding is it truly so surprising that hed show mercy to a man who shares his grief richard would never be able to fathom the widespread mourning over hals death seeing it as one last trick that his brother had managed to play on him from the grave resisting the temptation to remind his mother that the griefstricken troubadour had once dubbed hal the little king of lesser land he said i do not deny that papa is still grieving but how do you explain his action in demanding that i return control of my poitevin castles to him that is indeed another matter she conceded and i intend to speak with him about it i may not be able to get him to change his mind but at least i can learn what his reasoning was richard was sure he already knew the answerthat his father did not trust him hed debated sharing his suspicions with his mother not wanting to cast a shadow over her release but he saw now that she needed to know the truth and he crossed to her side kneeling so he could look intently into her face has papa told you that he has forgiven you because hal asked it of him when she shook her head he warned he will and when he does maman do not believe it the real reason he has sent for you is to thwart the french king in addition to demanding that papa return the french vexin to him philippe is claiming that hal assigned certain other lands to marguerite as her dowry papa denied it insisting that these lands were yours and as youd assigned them to hal only for his lifetime they now revert back to you not marguerite so you see maman he has an ulterior motive in he stopped in astonishment for his mother had begun to laugh dearest i have been married to that man for more than thirty years do you truly think i do not know all the twists and turns of that formidable brain of his of course he has an ulterior motive he always has an ulterior motive usually two or three why did he summon me from england i daresay youre right about marguerites dower lands but he likely did it too because hal asked it of him and to please tilda and possibly even to please you eleanor laughed again thinking how shocked hed be if she were to confide that shed always found her husbands sharp subtle intelligence to be as much of an aphrodisiac as his muscular strength or boundless energy richard had gotten to his feet and was studying her in obvious bafflement how can you be so tolerant of his intrigues and scheming he has taken away ten years of your life maman yet you do not talk about him as if he is your enemy and i do not understand why because he is also my husband richard and that complicates matters more than you know we are both encumbered by our history and by all that weve shared over the years good and bad it occurred to eleanor that this was the first time she and richard were having a conversation that was adult to adult not mother to son this means that we can never truly be free of each other however much we may wish it you make marriage sound like a mysterious malady that has no cure maman if that is so i am glad ive been spared it well eventually youll have to risk it she said with a grin for youll need an heir for your duchy and your kingdom he grinned too and she realized that he was still coming to terms with the momentous change wrought by hals death speaking of marriage she continued i gather you have no great desire to marry the french kings sister alys he shrugged what would i gain by it the girl has no marriage portion to speak of if papa were one for getting in his cups id wonder if hed been sober the day he made that deal with louis for it was a poor bargain indeed his primary concern then was in getting the french to recognize hal as his heir and you and geoffrey as the future rulers of aquitaine and brittany but if it is not to be alys you ought to be considering other matches dearest have you discussed this with harry weve been rather busy in recent months maman he did once mention the daughter of the holy roman emperor a pity alfonso has no eligible female relatives of course he is already an ally so it would make more sense to look further afield mayhap to navarre eleanor looked at him fondly very pleased to see the drift of his thoughts if he was considering aragon or navarre both houses hostile to count raimon that meant he was thinking ahead to the day when he could reassert their claim to toulouse yes navarre is certainly a possibility she agreed as she settled down to enjoy a simple pleasure other mothers could take for granted but one which had been long denied hermulling over potential brides for her son henry had gathered his family together on michaelmas eve and there was an air of anticipation for all expected him to reveal when he would formally recognize richard as his heir there should have been no suspense in such a straightforward announcement but knowing henrys penchant for eleventhhour surprises both eleanor and richard were on edge and as the queen glanced around the chamber she thought that geoffrey and constance seemed rather tense too only geoff heinrich and tilda appeared utterly at ease remembering john then she located him in one of the windowseats sipping wine as he watched the others and she felt a small dart of regret that he seemed so solitary always on the outside looking in shed concluded years ago that she and henry had made some great mistakes with their older sons failing to foster any sense of solidarity or family unity and she could not help thinking now that theyd gone astray with john too it was too late for hal but was there time to repair the damage done with the others sensing that his audience was growing restive henry moved to the center of the solar hed not been looking forward to this sure that hed encounter initial opposition from richard and eleanor now though he realized that his reluctance had deeper roots that he was loath to bestow upon another what had always been hals he recognized the illogic of it for he knew that richard would be a better king than hal at least his brain knew it but his heart was another matter there was an awful finality about the declaration as if he were throwing one last shovel of dirt upon his sons grave hed never had much patience for sentimentality though especially his own i am sure that what i am about to say will come as no surprise he said determined to get this over with as quickly as possible i intend to convene a great council and announce to the lords of the realm that richard will be king upon my death richard was not sure what response was expected of him and he wondered why things always had to be so awkward with his father to say thank you seemed inappropriate but it also seemed ungracious to say nothing at all i will do my best to meet your expectations ill not let you or my mother down he said sending a smile winging eleanors way she smiled back and he was grateful that she could be here for this moment i am sure that you will be a good king henry said with a smile of his own it is a bittersweet bequest i am giving you though youll have a vast unquiet empire to rule aquitaine alone would be enough for any man for your mothers barons are as perverse and faithless a lot as can be found in all of christendom but youll also have to govern an island kingdom as well as normandy anjou touraine and maine enough to keep me busy for certes richard agreed not sure where his father was going with this neither was eleanor and she was watching henry with a small frown creasing her forehead after giving the matter much thought henry continued i think i have come up with a way to ease your burdens whilst still safeguarding your borders i fear that aquitaine is going to take up so much of your time and energy that youll run the risk of neglecting your other domains youll have a far more successful reign if you relinquish the governance of aquitaine to your brother johnny for richard the shock was so intense that the impact was actually physical feeling as if hed just been punched in the stomach he found himself struggling for breath why did maman not warn me but one glance at his mother whitefaced and stunned told him that shed been ambushed too he cut his gaze sharply then toward geoffrey suspecting his brothers fine hand in this duplicity geoffrey and constance were obviously dumbfounded though as richards eyes met eleanors again she sent him a mute urgent message shaking her head almost imperceptibly he understood her warning but he was not sure he was capable of responding as she wanted so great was his outrage he got help then from an unexpected source his youngest brother john had been caught by surprise too inhaling the wine hed been about to swallow which brought on a sudden coughing fit henry crossed to his side and thumped him helpfully on the back joking it is not as bad as all that lad it could be worsei could be sending you to ireland john was flushed partly from his coughing and partly from embarrassment but his eyes were glowing as he looked up at his father aquitaine for me truly truly henry said with a smile and then looked expectantly at his eldest son by now richard was in control of himself again i must differ with you papa he murmured for id say this most definitely qualifies as a surprise henry was encouraged by that wry response for hed not been sure how richard would take the proposal as little as he liked to admit it the workings of this sons brain were a mystery to him it will change nothing he said swiftly other than sparing you the vexation of daily dealings with those lunatic southerners you will still be the liege lord of the duchy and johnny will of course do homage to you for it just as geoffrey will do homage to you for brittany once you are king so far this was going better than henry had expected for thered been no overt protests from eleanor either but he knew she was clever enough to see that aquitaines importance had diminished considerably with hals death to a man about to inherit an empire her duchy was merely one demesne amongst many a part of richards legacy instead of the whole richard must expand his horizons and his mother could help him greatly in making that transition in learning to think like a king not a duke i do not want to do anything rash richard said so i will need time to consider it you have opened my eyes tonight though for the idea had never occurred to me before i will have to consult with my barons of course the sooner the better news like this cannot be kept secret for long and they need to hear it from me not from rumors or gossip henry glanced over at johns rapt upturned face richard was right there was not a sixteenyearold boy alive who could keep news like this to himself do you think your barons will be receptive to the idea i think they are likely to respond favorably why wouldnt they exchanging a battleseasoned soldier for a green stripling whos never even bloodied his sword gods legs theyd not be able to believe their good luck and the old man knows it too damn him he knows full well that theyd thank god fasting for a chance like this does he think i am as big a fool as his precious hal richard met his fathers eyes his gaze steady they might balk though if they felt that we were trying to shove this down their throats they have to believe they have the right to say yea or nay whether they do or not henry could not fault his sons reasoning none were touchier about their honor than those mulish overweening troublemakers who kept aquitaine in a constant state of turmoil he would have liked to resolve it here and now but he was pragmatic enough to see that it had to be done richards way no more than his vassals richard could not think this was being shoved down his throat as it was his son was being more responsive than henry had dared hope confirming his suspicions that richard might welcome being unyoked from that seditious querulous land now that he no longer needed it and for the first time in years henry let himself think that they truly could restore their fragmented family harmony theyd always see the mended cracks of course but what did that matter if the center held he turned his gaze then upon his wife his eyes locking challengingly with hers have you nothing to say about this eleanor it would truly be a historic event to find you at a loss for words richard is quite capable of speaking for himself she said coolly if he is content with this then so am i after all john is my son too for the first time since hals death henry experienced a surge of genuine joy his spirits soaring he ushered the others from the solar declaring that they had reason for celebration geoffrey and constance were the last to follow him geoffrey was feeling almost lightheaded dazzled by how fast fortunes wheel could spin this was not yet the time to discuss the evenings events with constance but as his eyes met hers he saw his own excitement reflected in their dark depths and he marveled how well they understood each other for the same thought was in both their minds this changes everything after the evening meal was done the trestle tables were removed from the hall and dancing began henry had given eleanor the place of honor beside him on the dais trumpeting their reconciliation with this public display of marital amity it was also eleanor thought an effective way to make sure she and richard had no time alone she did not doubt that her husband would have both of them under discreet surveillance but his spies would be disappointed richard was not going to fall into that trap would make sure to keep his distance until his departure on the morrow shed never been as proud of him as in the solar watching him match wits with henry showing he could dissemble as convincingly as his sire as she thought back over the past few hours she could feel her rage beginning to flare again and she swiftly dampened it down thankful that shed had years of practice in learning patience in learning to congeal dangerous furies in ice there would be time later to indulge her wrath glancing at henry through downcast lashes she seethed in silence still astounded that he would dare to meddle in her duchy so blatantly dare to disinherit the son whod been consecrated before men and god in solemn ceremonies at poitiers and limoges becoming aware of henrys scrutiny she raised an eyebrow in query and he shifted in his seat so that they could converse quietly without fear of eavesdroppers i continue to marvel he said at our accord this evening it seems you can still surprise me after all these years for i never knew you had such an accommodating nature even if shed not caught his sarcasm shed have known better than to overplay her compliance hed never believe it if she was too docile or biddable i suppose it was too much to hope she said tartly that youd have consulted me beforehand what possible interest could i have after all in the succession to aquitaine i should have talked with you first he conceded but she was not mollified by that almostapology for words were cheap especially his words leaning closer he said earnestly i do not want you to think i did this to disparage or diminish richard in any way that was never my intent his kingship is far more likely to flourish if he is not burdened with aquitaine for he will never be able to pacify your barons eleanor studied him with narrowed eyes what are you saying harry that richard has been a failure as duke of aquitaine yes i am saying that he admitted but hear me out he has made mistakes that cannot be undone has been too heavyhanded in his dealings with them look what happened when he arbitrarily tried to change the inheritance customs in angouleme he stirred up a rebellion that continues to smolder even today i am not saying it was all his fault he is young and still learning and they are vexing enough to try a saints patience but he got off to such a bad start with them that there is no going back there is too much bad blood there and they are not ones for forgiving and forgetting eleanor looked at him in disbelief how could he be so logical so practical and so utterly wrong how could he banish all emotion from the equation there was truth in what he said but did he never realize that richard was deeply attached to aquitaine that hed been raised from the cradle with the expectation that he would rule the duchy one day that hed spent the past eight years fighting and bleeding and struggling to put down rebellions and restore peace these questions went unasked of course for she already knew the answers hed taken none of that into consideration for he viewed their sons as pieces on a chessboard to be moved hither and yon at his whims far be it from me to be a naysayer she said but if a brilliant battle commander like richard cannot end their rebellions how do you expect john to do so you do not think he is rather young to be tossed into the lions den hell be seventeen in december he parried and i was ruling normandy at that age i understand that hell make mistakes that hell need more experienced guidance and i am willing to step in when needed yes she thought grimly i daresay you are youd turn john into a puppet prince as you could not do with richard i do have one concern she said what happens after richard abdicates in johns favor what are you prepared to do for him harry for the past eight years he has governed aquitaine if you take that away what do you give him in return hes not one to amuse himself on the tournament circuit like hal i would suggest that you turn normandy or anjou over to him that would enable you to make use of his abilities and give him the purpose that he needs for hell never be one to embrace an idle life of pleasureno more than you would you make a valid point eleanor i will give it some careful thought for certes i am sure you will she jeered silently knowing hed never give up normandy or anjou to richard he could no more relinquish any of his power than he could fly no if he had his way hed keep richard dancing attendance at his court with no revenues or authority of his own but this time you will not win harry i will not let you unman richard as you did hal richard departed the next day ostensibly to consult with his barons in the week that followed eleanor spent as much time as possible with tilda and her grandchildren for she did not know how henry would react to their sons defiance while richard was beyond his reprisal she was not and he might well send her back to england straightaway she also sought out geoffrey and john determined to make the most of her relative freedom but did her best to avoid her husband whenever possible for the tentative rapprochement theyd reached in the past few years had gone up in smoke in the solar of rouens ducal castle amaria led a serving maid up the stairwell to the queens chamber as she opened the door she smiled at the sight before her eleanor and tilda were playing a game of dice with john and tildas young son heinrich they welcomed her boisterously when they saw that the serving maid carried a platter of cheese wafers and cups of cider as amaria passed them around heinrich boasted that uncle johnny had taught them a game called hazard hazard amaria pretended to be shocked to heinrichs delight but that is a game played in taverns and alehouses i know the boy grinned and weve been winning indeed they have eleanor agreed with mock severity pointing toward a pile of coins in the center of the table if i had a suspicious mind i might wonder if some sleight of hand could be involved heinrich laughed and john smiled i seem to be on a winning streak these days he said cheerfully are the dukes of aquitaine always lucky my lady mother eleanor felt a pang of resentful regret that her husband had entangled john in his scheme her youngest was still very much a stranger to her after these few days in his company she could say only that he was clever and guarded and had inherited his share of the familys sardonic humor but she did know hed been bedazzled by the prospect of gaining aquitaine and he was in for a great disappointment they played another game of hazard and john and heinrich won again they were still whooping and slapping hands when the door slammed open with enough force to startle them all henry came to an abrupt halt for hed been expecting to find eleanor alone tilda and heinrich welcomed him happily but john flushed and jumped to his feet as if hed been caught in a misdeed eleanor returned his gaze calmly and her sangfroid confirmed henrys suspicions after greeting them with strained affability he explained that i am sorry to interrupt your game but i need to speak privately now with your mother and grandmother eleanor made a playful grimace at grandmother to heinrichs amusement and her nonchalance added more fuel to the flames of henrys rage so she saw this as a joke did she heinrich was reluctant to end their fun but tilda had picked up on the tension in the chamber and she ushered her son out with a troubled backward glance at her parents john was already gone hed faded away as inconspicuously as that woodland fox amaria hesitated not departing until eleanor gave her a smile and a nod eleanor helped herself then to more cider i take it youve heard from richard yes i heard he sent word that he will never relinquish aquitaine not as long as he draws breath but you already knew that did you not of course i should have known this was your doing and how did i manage that i am sure your spies told you that i was not alone with richard from the time you sprang your surprise until his departure the next morning did we communicate in code by thumping on the walls of our chambers smuggled secret messages to each other mayhap used heinrich as our gobetween he was disconcerted by her defiance it had been years since her claws had flashed like that if you did not plan this with richard how did you know hed refuse how could you not know by the rood harry how can you be so blind about your own sons i told you my reasons for wanting this you seemed to think they made sense last week yes they made perfect political sense but richards love for aquitaine is not political it is visceral in his blood and his bones you might as well ask him to tear out his heart and give it over to you that is arrant nonsense hed still be liege lord of aquitaine would be losing nothing and gaining much gods bones woman you are the blind one can you honestly say that you are pleased with his rule of the duchy that you do not think he has antagonized his barons needlessly and spread the seeds of rebellion with his own hand i do not deny that he has made mistakes but he is the duke of aquitaine not an errant child you cannot step in and slap his hand when you think he has blundered for gods sake harry let him go your love for our sons is strangling them why can you not see that why can you not see that i have to act for the good of our empire i cannot just stand aside whilst our sons put my lifes work at risk aquitaine would be a constant thorn in richards side and turning it over to johnny would benefit them both a duchy is a small price to pay for a kingdom and it troubles me greatly that richard seems unable to understand that if his judgment is so faulty oh enough eleanor was on her feet glaring at him across the table as if it were a battlefield you are such a hypocrite his eyes darkened to a stormsea grey and how is that he asked his voice dangerously soft you refuse to understand why richard is unwilling to give up aquitaine but you are no less unwilling to surrender control of normandy or anjou if youd turned either one over to hal hed never have rebelled but you could not do that could you because i could not trust him to govern himself much less a duchy i see so you have it in mind to rule from the grave please enlighten mehow exactly do you plan to do that but henry had heard nothing after her gibe about hal so what are you saying he demanded hotly are you blaming me for hals death you think i drove him to rebellion she heard the anguish underlying his rage and her own fury ebbed away leaving her sickened and shaken by the wreckage theyd made of their marriage and their world no she said wearily of course i do not blame you for hals death harry i did my part too as did geoffrey and richard and hal himself hal most of all for he was a man grown a man who made his own choices and to his credit recognized that at the end henrys throat had constricted for thoughts of hals last hours were still more than he could bear he died alone he said huskily and it need not have been like that he was not alone harry will marshal and his friends were with him but i was not he swung away keeping his back to her as he fought to regain control of his emotions hal wrote me a letter on his deathbed he said after a heavy silence would you like to read it eleanor blinked in surprise yes i would very much he nodded and then surprised her further by turning toward the door harry wait when he faced her again she was shocked by how ravaged he looked what do you intend to do about richard after coming together as grieving parents shed hoped they could come together too to repair the tattered fatherson bond before it was beyond salvaging but he looked at her expressionlessly his eyes as veiled and opaque as johns i have not changed my mind he said i still think richard needs to relinquish control of aquitaine and i will do all in my power to bring that about the sound of the closing door seemed to echo in the empty chamber reminding eleanor of a wretched memorystanding in that chamber at loches castle and listening as the key turned in the lock she sank down upon a coffer was staring blankly into space when amaria entered with a soft cry of alarm she crossed the floor and knelt at eleanors feet my lady are you ill that is not the man i married amaria the man i knew was stubborn yes but he was flexible too capable of altering his course when need be and he never let his suspicions get the better of him nownow he can neither trust nor compromise god help us all amaria was not sure what to say so she stayed quiet and as she watched the older woman she saw eleanors despair drain away to be replaced by an indomitable resolve for a long time amaria ive blamed myself for those changes in harrys nature id not realized what a deep wound i was inflicting when i chose to rebel never imagined that it would take so long to heal today i saw that it is never going to heal i am done with feeling guilty though no more if he wants to cherish his grievances instead of his sons so be it she raised her chin her eyes taking on a hard green glitter but as god is my witness i will not let him take aquitaine from richard in the days that followed henrys court was not a happy place constance yearned to be back in brittany but she would not leave without geoffrey and his father seemed set upon keeping his younger sons close for the foreseeable future when the oppressive atmosphere at rouen became too much for her she made a brief pilgrimage to chartres proud possessor of the sancta camisa the chemise said to be worn by the blessed mary as she gave birth to the holy christ child there she was welcomed by the bishop prayed in the great cathedral made offerings to the mother of god and was soon ready to return to rouen her spirit nourished and her faith renewed for the queen of heaven had heard her prayers upon her arrival at the ducal castle she sent a servant to let geoffrey know of her return and retreated to their bedchamber with her ladies juvette and blanche had assisted her in washing away the grime of the road and she was wrapped in a new silk robe as they brushed out her hair when geoffrey burst into the chamber swooping her up into his arms he kissed her exuberantly then sent juvette and blanche away giggling when he declared slyly that he could see to all of his wifes needs watching as he barred the door shutting out the rest of the world constance felt a throb of pure and perfect happiness thinking that she would not want to be anywhere but here to be anyone but the duchess of this laughing man with tawny hair and shining eyes i have something to tell you she said at the same time that he said those very same words and they looked at each other in surprised amusement my news first he insisted for ive been waiting days to tell you if id not expected you back so soon id have ridden to chartres myself to fetch you home she smiled at his boyish glee for she was one of the few who ever saw that side of him you first then she agreed i take it your news is good since you look so pleased with yourself yes it is good news he confirmed before tumbling her backward onto their bed reaching for a handful of her hair he inhaled its fresh fragrant scent i ought to make you guess what it is but youd take too long and i cannot keep it to myself for a moment longer kissing her throat he propped himself up on an elbow so close that she could feel the warmth of his breath upon her skin my lord father that steadfast soul of consistency has given us the honour of richmond geoffrey flinging her arms around his neck she showered his face with haphazard kisses that is truly amazing downright miraculous but then she sat up her brows slanting into a suspicious frown why laughing he pulled her back down beside him again thats my girl why indeed naturally he would not tell me why hed decided to do it now and he utterly ignored the oddity and the irony of it that hed be rewarding a rebel with the very lands he rebelled over somehow i doubt that this was a belated birthday present heres another irony for you darling we most likely owe a debt of gratitude to brother richard yes that makes sense he is furious with richard now so it is to be expected that hes looking for allies mayhap even seeing you in a new and appealing light it is about time she said indignantly and then what of nantes he gave another peal of laughter and kissed her until they both were breathless he is continuing to dangle nantes as bait whilst still promising that it will be ours at a later date and you know what constance i think i almost believe him as long as richard continues to be his endearing obstinate self im going to look better and better to papa constance had a sudden dazzling thought could henry become so angry with richard that hed consider making geoffrey his heir she said nothing though not wanting to jinx them by saying it aloud that was a dream to be held close not to be shared with anyone yet not even geoffrey he had slipped her robe off her shoulders and she squirmed out of his embrace knowing that once she was naked it would be quite a while before she could tell him her secret wait she protested when he tugged at her belt you have not heard my news yet tell me then woman and quickly for my attention is beginning to wander so are your hands she chided sitting up again she regarded him with a smile that was confident serene and triumphant all in one i am with child geoffrey she was not disappointed by his response he drew a sharp audible breath his eyes filling with light and this time when he kissed her it was with a tenderness hed not shown before her mother had often told her that there was a special bond between a man and a woman who brought a child together into the world and as she gave herself up to his lovemaking her last coherent thought was maman was right as they lay entwined together afterward they both were sure their future was blessed and it would never have occurred to them that henry and eleanor had once believed that too in december henry met the young french king at gisors philippe relinquished his claim to marguerites dowry in exchange for henrys promise to pay her two thousand seven hundred angevin pounds annually for the rest of her life gisors and the norman vexin were to become alyss marriage portion and it was further agreed that shed wed whichever of henrys sons whom he chose a notsosubtle warning to richard that he was not an only child in return henry finally did homage to the french king for all his holdings across the water chapter fortyfive april le mans anjou geoffrey was not a willing guest at his fathers easter court hed rather have been back at rennes with constance for he was more excited about the coming birth of their child than hed expected naturally the birth of an heir would elevate his status in brittany but he was not dwelling upon the political ramifications more and more he found himself thinking of matters that were purely personal he was concerned about constances health although her pregnancy had been uneventful so far he spent a lot of time thinking about baby names and he vowed that hed be a better father than his own a light rain was falling as he crossed the inner bailey of the royal palace two of richards knights were loitering by the stables and they gave him an unfriendly stare as he passed by it was some consolation to geoffrey that as discontented as he was to be here richard must be even more miserable hed love to know how their father had lured richard to le mans suspecting that his brother had asked for an insulting pledge of safe conduct however it had been done it was an exercise in futility the tension between the two of them was combustible enough to burst into flame at any moment and their animosity had spilled over to infect the rest of the easter court geoffrey had broken up two fights between his men and richards and hed even seen evidence of bad blood between richards knights and their brother johns household since he was not directly involved in this clash of wills geoffrey might have sat back and enjoyed the dramahad it not been for his mother and sister it was obvious to him that eleanor and tilda were deeply troubled by this latest family contretemps and their unhappiness bothered him for he could see no quick resolution he could see no resolution at all as geoffrey entered the great hall he noticed a boisterous dice game over by the center hearth several of his knights were playing and when gerard de fournival waved and beckoned he started in that direction but he halted when he saw his youngest brother sitting alone in a windowseat and on impulse he veered toward john instead you look even more bored than me he said you want to join the dice game when john hesitated he wondered if the boy had enough money to play he had a title nowcount of mortainbut geoffrey was sure he had no income of his own yet geoffrey himself had not gained financial independence until he was finally allowed to wed constance john was betrothed to a rich heiress his cousin avisa of gloucester and the earl of gloucesters unexpected death just four months ago made the girl an even greater marital prize geoffrey was sure though that henry would not let john claim that prize until cobwebs were collecting on the marriage contract their father could be lavish with his gifts generous with his largesse but it was a golden yoke for it kept them beholden always on a tight leash if youre short johnny i can make you a loan he offered and johns hazel eyes darkened with suspicion why would you want to do that why not why are you being so friendly of a sudden geoffrey since when are you willing to do me favors ahi see you are nursing a grudge for my past sins he sounded amused and john did not like it i do not have a single pleasant childhood memory of you or richard not even one his outburst was unplanned but he found satisfaction now in being able to speak up for his younger self at long last how could you we had to adhere to the code after all what code the one that sets out the rules for treating little brothers of course they are to be bedeviled without mercy made the butt of every joke it was just your bad luck that you had no one younger to pick on in turn my bad luck indeed john said coolly remembering those hours hed spent in that open grave remembering his pleas for help that geoffrey and richard had claimed never to have heard geoffrey was regarding him pensively now that i look back upon it all those jokes and pranks that we played on you he paused significantly i have to tell you johnny they were fun lulled into expecting an apology john stiffened in surprise but after a moment he could not help laughing come on lad geoffrey said with a grin lets go shoot some dice they had just started across the hall though when john stopped suddenly directing geoffreys attention toward the door behind the dais tilda saw her brothers at the same time and came toward them so hastily that they knew something was amiss geoffrey thank god youre here richard and papa are having a terrible argument their worst one yet and if it is not stopped i fear they may even come to blows id pay to see that geoffrey said before he could think better of it and his sister stared at him in disbelief i am beginning to think all of you have gone stark raving mad maman and i could hear their shouting and she went in to make peace but by the sound of it shes had no luck now are you going to help me or not geoffrey was not keen about getting into the crossfire especially since he was sure his intervention would be meaningless he did not have the heart to disappoint tilda though for not only had her husband gone back to mainz in hopes of obtaining a pardon from the holy roman emperor but shed recently revealed that she was pregnant of course i will help he said with far more confidence than he was feeling and then glanced over at john whod once more been overlooked having spent much of his own life overshadowed by hal and richard geoffrey was motivated to say come on johnny ill likely need all the help i can get i would not miss it for the world john said with utter sincerity he did not understand why henry could not just order richard to yield up aquitaine for he was the king after all hed initially been sure it would be quickly resolved but during the course of the easter court hed begun to fear that henry might be the one to back down not richard hed never taken his fathers talk of an irish kingdom for him very seriously for he could not envision himself ruling over that strange wild isle on the western edge of the world but aquitaine was different it was real one of the richest duchies in christendom a land of milk and honey hed not even dreamed it might be his not until that michaelmas eve in rouen but now he could not bear to think it might be snatched away richard was to be king no longer needed it why was he being so selfish they found that tilda had not exaggerated hearing the angry voices while they were still in the stairwell geoffrey did not bother knocking shoved the door open with tilda and john at his heels henry and richard were confining themselves to verbal violence at least so far if eleanor had interceded in hopes of mediating shed soon become a combatant herself to judge from the way she was berating henry he and richard were stalking each other like the big cats geoffrey had once seen at the tower of london and he found himself thinking that this scene was true to form for his family with everyone shouting and no one listening eleanor glanced in their direction but the men were so intent upon their confrontation that they never even noticed the new arrivalsnot until geoffrey turned and slammed the door resoundingly they can hear all the cursing and bellowing down in the hall he said and theyve started to wager which one of you will draw first blood i came up to see whom i should put my money on that was not the sort of help tilda had in mind and she frowned at geoffreys levity but it worked for neither richard nor henry liked the idea of entertaining others with their quarrel we are done here henry said glaring at his eldest son before adding an ominous warning for now not at all intimidated richard glowered back and started for the door but then he stopped unwilling to be dismissed so curtly ill gladly go he said defiantly and ill not be coming back the next time you want to threaten and rant you can come to me in aquitaine john watching in dismay saw his great chance slipping through his fingers and he swung around to demand of his father papa does this mean richard has bested you and aquitaine is lost eleanor winced geoffrey rolled his eyes and henry gave his youngest a look john had never gotten from him before my life would have been much more peaceful if id had only daughters he snapped as for aquitaine it is yours if you can take it richard had halted when john protested now he looked the youth up and down very deliberately and then he laughed geoffrey was astonished that his father had actually said that for surely one becket moment was enough for any mans lifetime clearly eleanors thoughts had taken the same track for she said scathingly very good harry it is always heartening to see that youve learned from your past mistakes but it was tildas reaction that overrode the others for she cried stop it in such pain that all heads turned in her direction i cannot bear any more cannot watch my family being torn apart like this there was a sudden abashed silence and then alarm as tilda seemed to falter she looked so stricken that geoffrey hastily grabbed her arm so he could hold her upright if necessary eleanor and henry were immediately at her side united for that moment at least in their concern for their distraught pregnant daughter she let them guide her toward the closest chair and the next few moments were hectic as henry and eleanor hovered over her richard hurried to get her wine and geoffrey asked if he could fetch one of her women he was feeling remorseful sorry he had not spared her this stressful scene by insisting she remain below in the hall and his relief was considerable when she turned so the others could not see and winked he at once entered cheerfully into the conspiracy lamenting how pale and shaken she seemed and doing all he could to keep the focus upon tilda and away from their latest family conflagration john alone had not gone to tildas aid he stood apart as if he were watching a play hearing only the echoes of richards scornful laughter and his fathers dismissive words it is yours if you can take it june had been a cool rainy month but with the approach of july the breton summer finally put in an appearance constance had spent the morning dealing with tedious correspondence and felt she deserved a respite for her diligence so after dismissing her scribe she headed for the nursery hearing the murmur of voices she paused in the doorway smiling at the sight meeting her eyes her husband and morna the wetnurse hanging over the cradle agreeing that theyd never seen a more beautiful baby you just say that because she looks like you geoffrey she said and he glanced up with a grin i do not deny im a handsome devil he said but i think she looks more like you she has your eyes morna giggled at that for shed already explained to geoffrey that it was too early to tell the babys eye color the infant had begun to whimper and she reached for the child but geoffrey forestalled her no let me he insisted and showed some skill in gathering his daughter up into his arms as morna discreetly withdrew to give them some private time with their infant constance joined geoffrey by the cradle she loved her child with a fierce intensity that shed not expected but shed still been greatly disappointed that their firstborn was not a son and she had been both relieved and surprised that geoffrey seemed so content with a daughter it was true that females could inherit the duchy as she herself had done shed observed though that most men were set upon sons watching as he rocked their baby she could not help asking yet again you truly were not letdown that i birthed a girl look at her eyelashes he marveled just like golden fans i am beginning to think ill have to swear a blood oath to satisfy you how could any man be disappointed in this perfect little pearl ill not deny that i might become concerned if you give me four or five girls in a row but i am not going to fret until then we have time on our side after all and if it means i must pay more visits to your bed well i am willing to make the sacrifice how noble she said dryly but once again hed said what she needed to hear he was right for at twentythree and twentyfive they had all the time in the world im not sure id want to visit the birthing chamber as often as your mother though she confided two with louis and then eight with your fatherthe woman is truly a force of nature she definitely had a surfeit of sons he agreed the baby had begun to fuss so he handed her over to constance he liked to watch as his pragmatic commonsense wife melted as soon as she held that tiny bundle in her arms sitting down constance cradled their daughter calling her aenor the breton form of eleanor i have to confess geoffrey said that i was surprised when you were so willing to name her after my mother id thought for certes that id have to coax you into it constance thought it was more than a fair tradeoff a reward hed earned after responding so graciously to the birth of a daughter well ill admit that i have never had any great interest in pleasing your mother she allowed but ive always had a very healthy interest in vexing your father and calling our daughter eleanor was virtually assured to do that as their eyes met over aenors head they both laughed just then a knock sounded on the door and a servant entered to announce the arrival of geoffreys brother geoffrey was taken aback does he have an army with him when the puzzled servant said no he glanced over at constance with a shrug then it cannot be richard he did not think that john or geoff were likely to come all the way to brittany for a family visit either and he wondered if his father had a bastard they didnt know about the servant had departed before he could ask the identity of this mystery visitor and he and constance were unable to satisfy their curiosity until john was eventually ushered into the nursery geoffrey stepped forward to bid him welcome unable to resist joking in the neighborhood were you john smiled as if there was nothing out of the ordinary about his visit and greeted his sisterinlaw with his newfound gallantry complimenting both her and aenor lavishly even though he thought all babies looked the same some of his urbanity slipped however when geoffrey mischievously asked if hed like to hold his niece reacting like the typical adolescent he hastily shook his head no i might drop her almost as if she were reacting to his rejection aenor startled john by beginning to wail making a surprising amount of noise for such a small creature morna hastened back into the chamber took the baby from constance and retreated across the nursery to satisfy her hungry little charge much to geoffreys amusement john seemed unable to take his eyes off mornas exposed white bosom remembering what it was like to be seventeen and utterly obsessed with the female body he took pity on his bedazzled young brother and suggested that morna continue feeding aenor in the antechamber feeling very benevolent at the moment he even refrained from teasing john about his obvious distraction instead asked for the latest family news as it happened john had quite a bit of news to relate their mother was in england again sent back by their father after his easter court henry had spent the spring seeking to bring about a truce between the french king philippe and the count of flanders and once he succeeded he sailed for england in midjune tilda and her children soon followed upon their arrival hed made his customary visit to the shrine of st thomas at canterbury while tilda continued on to winchester as she wanted eleanor with her in the birthing chamber maman was very pleased that you named your daughter after her he reported but papa not so much really geoffrey said blandly managing to sound surprised his curiosity was getting the better of him by now though and he decided to nudge the conversation in the right direction why did you not accompany papa to england johnny i told him that i wanted to visit my estates in mortain john leaned forward keeping his eyes intently upon his brothers face if you have some free time this summer geoffrey i thought we might pay a visit to richard in poitou constance frowned but geoffrey had been expecting an answer like this did you lad who do you have in mind to accompany us some of my knights and routiers hired with breton gold you have the money i do not john said matteroffactly but then his eagerness surged to the surface he told us to do it geoffrey said aquitaine was mine if i could take it so why not ill make it worth your while will give you all the poitevin castles that hal promised you and it is in your interests to overthrow richard for id make a far better neighbor would not be constantly testing the borders between brittany and poitou nor would we lack for allies richards barons loathe him so why would they not rally to me as they did to hal hal was a king constance pointed out so they could claim they were not truly in rebellion from what ive heard of lords like viscount aimar and the de lusignans john countered i doubt that any of them lose sleep at night about legal niceties like that and geoffrey began to laugh bless you johnny youre proof that blood breeds true he declared and constance felt a prickle of foreboding then we have a deal not so fast lad ill give it some thought but im not ready to commit myself to another war just yet why not go back to the great hall and see if my steward has gotten your chamber ready for you getting to his feet geoffrey deftly steered his brother toward the door and once he was alone with his wife he said playfully what is the name of the maidservant with the red hair and freckles i doubt that johnny will want to sleep alone tonight and that lusty little wench would like nothing better than to warm a princes bed constance had no interest in her brotherinlaws sleeping arrangements you are going to do it she said slowly good god geoffrey why do you hate richard so much there is no love lost between us he conceded but can you truly see me fighting a war merely to settle a grudge no i cannot so why do it darling what else can i do when opportunity falls into a mans lap like a ripe peach hed be a fool not to taste it it is not as if i am corrupting an innocent after all johnny came to me that begs the question what do you gain by joining with him against richard he could tell from her tone that she was fast losing patience and no longer teasing he crossed to her side gently propelling her to her feet i think wed have a good chance of winning richards barons are not vanquished are merely biding their time i think johnny is right and they would join with us against richard and who would you rather have as a neighbor my little brother or thor the pagan god of war by richards calculations we owe him a blood debt and it is just a matter of time until he seeks to collect it so it makes sense to strike first does it not and what of your father what do you expect him to do whilst you invade aquitaine do you truly think hed forgive two rebellions in less than a twelvemonth ah but this time i believe hed stay out of it constance when he told johnny to take aquitaine i think he meant it he may not admit it even to himself but that was a cry from the heart i think hed secretly be relieved if we could get aquitaine away from richard he loved hal to distraction and seems genuinely fond of johnny but he knows full well that richard loves him not and he knows too that as long as richard holds aquitaine his defiance will continue so why would he not welcome our efforts to give him what he wantsthe duchy for johnny but what if youre wrong he shrugged it seems a risk worth taking that is what i do not understand geoffrey i do not see what we gain from this unless you have it in mind to then claim aquitaine from johnny no that would indeed bring papa into the fray he said with a wry smile ill settle for some poitevin castles a more peaceful border region and the chance for future benefits ah i knew it tell me about these future benefits what scheme are you hatching now no scheme constance i merely want to give my father the chance to consider all of his options it has to have occurred to him that id make a better king than richard ive proven myself to be an able battle commander and ive done in brittany what richard has failed to do in aquitaineive reconciled the barons to my rule but he cannot disinherit richard as long as he holds aquitaine for he knows it would mean unending rebellion richard would never accept it not if he had the means of waging war if he loses his duchy he loses too his income to hire routiers and wreak havoc he slid his fingers under her chin tilted her face up to his as he murmured tell me darling that a kingdom is not worth the risk she could not of course she wanted him to be the english king as much as he did she wanted the power and security that only a crown could bestow wanted it for geoffrey and herself for her breton homeland and above all for aenor and their children not yet born chapter fortysix september winchester england your son is so sweet tilda may i hold him of course alys tilda said with a smile and surrendered her baby to the younger woman she was making a special effort to be friendly because of her discomfort in alyss presence she felt that her father and richard had treated the french princess rather shabbily coldbloodedly using her as a pawn in their highstakes diplomatic maneuvering her mothers attitude seemed callous to tilda too eleanor was obviously in no position to influence alyss fate but shed shown a marked lack of sympathy for the girl in her conversations with tilda her only concern how alyss fortunes affected richard tildas husband liked to tease her that she was too tenderhearted for her own good and she supposed there was truth in that she could not help pitying alys though as she glanced from alys to her twelveyearold daughter tilda found herself worrying what the future held in store for richenza alys was not the only highborn bride to be treated as a commodity after all alyss half sister agnes had found only grief in byzantium and then there was the stillgrieving marguerite being used by her brother for bait as he fished for allies tilda had heard people claim that a nuptial curse hung over the french house of capet louis had certainly been shipwrecked in matrimonial seas surviving a turbulent union to eleanor losing his second wife in childbirth and not gaining the son he so desperately wanted until hed sired four daughters and given up all hope his sister constance had been unhappily wed to two abusive husbands and his nineteenyearold son philippe had already weathered one marital crisis earlier in the year philippe had attempted to repudiate isabelle of hainaut the niece of his onetime ally turned enemy the count of flanders claiming that she had failed to give him an heir an unfair accusation in light of her extreme youth shed been ten at the time of their marriage and was now only fourteen isabelle had outmaneuvered him though taking to the streets of senlis as a penitent barefoot and clad only in her chemise shed made a pilgrimage from church to church attracting huge sympathetic crowds as she prayed aloud to god to forgive her sins and protect her from the kings evil counselors the citizens had rioted in her favor and when the flustered philippe offered to find her a highborn second husband she had responded sire it does not please god for a mortal man to lie in the bed in which you have lain facing the disapproval of his subjects and the likely opposition of the church his pride assuaged by his young wifes artful flattery philippe had relented and agreed to take her back but tilda still felt sorry for isabelle and hoped when her daughter was wed that shed be treated more kindly than philippes queen alys laughed not at all disturbed when tildas infant son burped and spit up on the bodice of her gown you are so lucky she said wistfully he is such a beautiful baby glancing over the childs head toward tilda she hesitated before saying i was sorry to hear that your husband had no success during his trip to germany it was a disappointment tilda conceded but we remain hopeful my father met the archbishop of cologne at canterbury last month and entertained him lavishly in london the archbishop had long been one of my husbands fiercest foes but my father got them together during the archbishops visit and brought about their reconciliation the archbishop had suggested that henry send an embassy to the pope and ask him to mediate on heinrichs behalf with the emperor but tilda was not about to reveal something so politically sensitive to alys nor was she going to tell alys the real reason for the archbishops presence in england his had been a diplomatic mission disguised as a pilgrimage talks were under way for a marriage between richard and the emperors daughter agnes tilda hoped that the marriage would come to pass for at least that would free alys from her political purgatory but she did not know alys at all and it could be that the young woman really wanted to wed richard especially now that he was a future king so it seemed wisest to say nothing tildas daughter was cooing over her baby brother with a motherly air that brought a smile to tildas lips richenzatilda found it hard to remember that she was now called matildaand alys were taking turns extolling little wilhelms manifold virtues when eleanors abrupt entrance put a halt to their cheery conversation her greeting to alys was so curt that the younger woman flushed and tilda felt a prickle of resentment on her behalf but then she took a closer look at her mothers ashen face alys would you mind taking wilhelm back to the nursery my daughter will show you the way catching the eye of gertrud her attendant tilda nodded her head and the woman rose and followed the others out turning back to her mother then tilda was alarmed to find that eleanor had sank down upon a coffer almost as if she no longer had the strength to hold herself erect mamanwhat is it what is wrong it is happening all over again tilda had never heard her mother sound so vulnerable soold what is happening i do not understand your brothers are at war with one another only this time it is geoffrey and john against richard god in heaven tilda stared at eleanor in horror you meanthey took papas angry words seriously so it would seem eleanor rubbed her temples with her fingers she had a throbbing headache and when she closed her eyes she could see white light pulsing against her lids i am so tired she confessed so very tired of all this tilda it never seems to end tilda leaped to her feet much too swiftly for a woman whod given birth so recently crossing to eleanors side she sat down beside her on the coffer and reached for her hand maman i know how painful this must be for you her voice faltered for in truth she did not she could not even imagine a world in which her own sons were set upon destroying one another could there be any worse grief for a parent than that you must not despair maman papa will not let this happen he will stop the bloodshed find a way to end their lunatic rivalry and make peace between them hell make this right youll see what if he does not want to make it right the words hovered on eleanors lips but she bit them back she was not about to burden tilda with her fears if she could keep from voicing them though she could not keep them from taking root could not banish them from the back of her brain what if harrys angry words had come from the heart what if he meant what he said geoff was in london when he heard of his familys latest crisis he was soon in the saddle riding for windsor in such haste that he covered the thirtyfive miles at a pace one of henrys royal couriers might have envied and reached the riverside castle that evening admitted into the middle bailey he ran into willem who grimly confirmed that the rumors were true thank god youre here geoff youll know how to comfort him once he was escorted up to his fathers chamber though geoff was not so sure of that henry was seated by the hearth staring into the flames as his squires tiptoed around in nervous silence recognizing his sons footsteps he glanced over his shoulder you heard then geoff found a stool and brought it over to sit beside his father for a long time ive suspected that my brothers are possessed i would that it were true henry said his voice so low that geoff barely heard him at least then id have an answer for this family madness they sat in silence for a time the only sound the crackling in the hearth henry stretched his feet toward the fire wondering why he was so much more sensitive to the cold as he aged for most of his life hed never paid any heed to the weather but in the past few years hed begun to see his own body as the enemy for on any given day he had more random pains and aches than he used to suffer in the course of a year he did not want to think of fiftyone as old though his muscles bones and sinew seemed to be telling him otherwise looking at geoff from the corner of his eye he said reluctantly i may have played a part in this latest outbreak what do you mean papa henry sighed heavily during one of our quarrels at my easter court i lost my temper and told johnny that aquitaine was his if he could take it from richard do you think thatthat they could have taken me seriously surely they must have known that i did not mean it this was the first that geoff had heard of his fathers rash outburst and he blinked in surprise but he did not hesitate saying stoutly of course they knew you did not mean it papa anyone with half a brain would have known you were just speaking out of frustration you must not blame yourself for their folly i expected better of johnny though of course he is still young henry said with another sigh geoff did not think johns age was an excuse for he was just three months from his eighteenth birthday but if his father wanted to harbor these comforting delusions about his youngest then geoff would not be the one to gainsay him what will you do i am going to order them to cease hostilities and summon them to england to answer for themselves what will you do if they defy you geoff asked for he considered that a distinct possibility but he was taken aback by the raw candor of his fathers reply i do not want to think about that henry admitted for he found none of his choices palatable if he stood aside and did nothing his sons could tear his empire apart he had limited control over richard and geoffrey neither of whom were financially dependent upon him as hal had been but as angry as he was with them he did not want to make war against his own flesh and blood hed already lost his eldest his bestloved son how much more would the almighty ask of him a light november snow was falling as eleanor her daughter and her soninlaw reached the palace at westminster the journey had not been a long one for theyd been staying at berkhampstead which was much closer to london than winchester eleanor was still very tired and thoroughly chilled too for the day had been one of blustery winds she did not summon servants to prepare her bath yet as eager as she was to soak in warm scented water henry had greeted them briefly upon their arrival but she was expecting him to pay her a private visit he did not keep her waiting watching impatiently as servants stoked the fire in the hearth and piled furlined coverlets upon the bed he seized his first opportunity to dismiss them including amaria as soon as they were alone he crossed the chamber to face eleanor she could not help noticing that he was favoring his bad leg again i have summoned our sons to london johnny has already landed at dover and richard and geoffrey ought to arrive by weeks end i intend to reconcile them to put an end to this infernal rivalry once and for all and i expect you to assist me in this endeavor of course you are not always so biddable he said suspiciously and she gave him a tight smile when our interests converge i am always biddable harry and i want to end this strife as much as you do see that you keep that in mind he said brusquely and turned toward the door eleanor waited until hed reached it before she spoke again i will do all i can to make peace between them however hollow it may be but i will do nothing harry to help you take aquitaine away from richard and you forget that at your cost hed paused and was regarding her impassively but his eyes were as frigid and foreboding as the slatecolored november sky i can only put out one fire at a time he said and left without waiting for her response in addition to his daughter and soninlaw henry was entertaining the count of flanders and numerous english bishops having convened a council to discuss the selection of a new archbishop of canterbury but his first priority that november was bringing his rebellious sons back into the fold with that in mind he waited until all three of them had arrived at westminster and then summoned them to a private reckoning at the tower of london geoffrey was the last to arrive and he took his time climbing the stairs to the upper floor of the white tower knowing the coming confrontation would be an unpleasant one as he was ushered into the great hall he at once became the avid object of all eyes to his relief he was directed toward the private royal chamber that adjoined the hall at least this was not going to be a public ordeal they were waiting for him his parents and his brothers richard john and geoff richard shot him a look that would have been deadly had it been launched from a bow geoff was glaring and john seemed relieved to see him eleanors expression was unrevealing warning geoffrey that he was facing the queen not the mother henrys court mask was in place too but he seethed with restless edgy energy unable to stay still for long not understanding why he whod always found the mastery of other men so easy should be so hobbled when it came to controlling his own sons come in geoffrey he said coldly it has been suggested to me that the lot of you are possessed others think that you must be secretly in the service of the french king for no one benefits more than philippe from our family bloodletting as for myself i do not know what to believe for i can no more explain your inexplicable behavior than i can walk upon water so id truly like to hear you speak for yourselves tell me why you are seeking to do what none of my enemies could why you are so set upon following in the footsteps of cain geoffrey was silent able to recognize a rhetorical question when he heard one his brothers were not as prudent but you told me to take aquitaine john protested i thought that was what you wanted papa richard was almost as quick as john i have nothing to apologize for i was the one wronged was merely defending myself henry dealt with richard first the trouble is richard that you always show what hal called an excess of zeal in dealing with your enemies you were hardly defending your borders when you raided deep into brittany the blatant unfairness of that took richards breath away that was how warfare was conducted as his father well knew being an astute practitioner of the art himselfwhen at all possible carry the war to the enemy but henry had already turned his attention toward john that is not the best defense to make johnny for it raises troubling doubts about your judgment and common sense it was obvious that my words were spoken in anger not to be taken seriously geoffrey wondered if hed said that too about the knights whod been motivated by one of his fits of temper to murder an archbishop in his own cathedral but he had no time to appreciate the irony of it for he was now the one in the line of fire at least johnny has his youth and inexperience to explain away his misdeeds that cannot be said for you geoffrey in fact i see your sins as twofold not only did you make war upon your brother but you dragged johnny into it too i expected better of you geoffrey prided himself upon his inner discipline but this tested his selfcontrol to the utmost he could not help glancing toward john disappointed although not truly surprised when his younger brother kept quiet john flushed as their eyes met but his pang of guilt was more easily overcome than his instincts for selfpreservation hed never understood how his brothers could defy their father so boldly envying them their swagger and their apparent indifference to henrys anger hed been blessedor cursedwith a vivid imagination and when he thought of his life he envisioned a turbulent sea with the only land the small unstable island of his fathers favor an isle that could disappear under the waves in any storm well geoffrey henry demanded have you nothing to say eleanor had long ago mastered that skill so useful to kings the ability to read others as a monk read his psalter a faculty also useful to prisoners and she caught the warning signsthe jut of geoffreys chin the clenched muscles along his jawline deciding it was time to intervene she said coolly i have something to say i too expected better of you geoffrey and i am very disappointed in you but john is not a child and is old enough to answer for his own mistakes that earned her a grateful look from geoffrey a sullen one from john and a mistrustful one from henry who claimed control of the conversation again this is how it will be i have convened a council for this week the archbishopric of canterbury has been vacant since april and it is time to select a successor at that council i am going to have the three of you make a public avowal of peace swear not to take up arms against one another again and give none any reason to doubt the truth of your reconciliation neither geoffrey nor john raised any objections but richard was shaking his head in disbelief and that is it they attacked my lands without provocation or justification and they are not to be punished for it where is the justice in that the sooner we put this embarrassment behind us the better henry said impatiently the last thing i want to do is to drag this farce out any longer than need be all of you are to do as youre bidden for once with no further arguments and heed me well on this it is not to happen againever now it is done and let that be the end of it no one spoke up but they all knew this was not the end of it even henry constance had been willing to accompany geoffrey to london but hed insisted that she remain in brittany with their child saying that there was no reason they both should have to endure his fathers recriminations and he might well be kept in england for the foreseeable future but to her surprise shed gotten a message from him in middecember summoning her to meet him in rouen the winter was mild enough for her to bring their sevenmonthold daughter and she arrived in high spirits pleased that theyd be able to celebrate aenors first christmas together and bringing geoffrey a gift sure to delight himword that she was pregnant again he reacted as shed expected and they celebrated the news in bed afterward they had food sent up to their chamber and enjoyed a private supper for two this is delicious geoffrey constances expectations had been low for it was an ember fast day but the castles cooks had prepared a savory blanc manger made with almond milk rice and pike instead of chicken give me another helpingand i am not being a glutton after all i am eating for two now to judge by the way youve made that pike disappear you could be carrying twins reaching under the covers he slid his hand across her abdomen though as flat as your belly is it is hard to imagine you swollen up like a melon thank you for the complimenti think it is early in the pregnancy yet my midwife says hell most likely be born in the summer hell be born so the midwife also told you that youre carrying a boy did she happen to mention what color eyes hell have tease me all you like but i know it will be a son i just know indeed since we already have aenor i hope i birth only boys from now on why it can be argued that a ruler with too many sons is no better off than the one without any id say my family history proves there can be too much of a good thing i like to think well raise our sons better than your parents did geoffrey surely it cannot be that difficult to foster affection between siblings even amongst the spawn of the demon countess of anjou you are entirely too proud of your fireandbrimstone heritage she said with mock severity but when he grinned she could not help grinning back id rather have sons because daughters are more vulnerable to the vagaries of fate once she is married off a girl is utterly dependent upon the whims of her husband i remember all too well how it was for mesuddenly uprooted from my family and the only world i knew sent off to be raised in the household of the man responsible for ruining my father id not want that for a daughter of mine and since girls are born to be pawns better to have only sons but i was given no more say in our marriage than you were constance he protested sons too are expected to wed for their familys benefit it is not the same geoffrey in the eyes of the church and the law a wife is subject to her husbands will and if he maltreats her what remedy has she i would not want a daughter of mine to find herself a pampered hostage like alys or humiliated like philippes queen geoffrey had never given much thought to the plight of highborn brides but he discovered now that it was very troubling to imagine aenor in an alien land under a strangers control my sisters seem content enough though so if we take care in choosing the husbands for our daughters surely we can avoid some of those pitfalls he said while silently vowing that aenor would not be wed until she was at least twenty i hope so constance agreed without much conviction she had revealed more of herself than shed intended for she was not accustomed to sharing her most intimate thoughts lying in bed with her husband though she found it surprisingly easy to speak with such candor and she realized how much shed come to trust him in the three years since their marriage marveling at the unlikely turns her life had taken she reached over to snatch a slice of bread from his plate for she was still ravenous i was so eager to tell you of my pregnancy that we did not discuss why youre in rouen how did you manage to slip your fathers tether geoffrey set their tray down in the floor rushes keeping a dish of dried figs for constance to munch on make yourself comfortable darling for this is quite a story my father raged at us as expected and somehow i found myself shouldering the blame for johnny too i am sorry to report that my little brother practices hals kind of seamanship whilst he did not exactly push me out of his ark neither did he throw me a lifeline what penalties did your father impose upon you this is where it gets interestingnone we all had to swear to uphold the peace in a public ceremony but that was it richard almost had a seizure he was so wroth i can well imagine she said dryly what of aquitaine does your father still intend to claim it for john i think he has reluctantly concluded that richard will hold on to aquitaine until his dying breath for he has begun to talk again of ireland for johnny the lad seems to be of two minds about his prospects eager for his first taste of freedom but greatly disappointed that it shall not be aquitaine understandable for governing the irish is like herding cats so richard has won constance had known this for some time henrys intervention had made it inevitable she still felt a keen regret though for the dream was not an easy one to relinquish it would have been a great thing to be wife and mother to kings nothing could have protected her family more than a crown that remains to be seen what do you mean geoffrey you said that your father could not consider changing the succession as long as richard holds aquitaine i know but i am no longer so sure of that listen to the rest of my account and then judge for yourself my father next turned his attention to the vacant see at canterbury he wanted the monks to elect baldwin the bishop of worcester but they balked so he sent johnny and me to canterbury to make the monks see reason he smiled at the look of astonishment on his wifes face an odd choice no failed rebels one day royal agents the next i thought richard was going to choke on his outrage gods truth and did you succeed in this mission i did and my father was very pleased richard less so i said i and not we for johnny was more interested in entertaining two canterbury sisters not exactly whores but not nuns either and as alike as two peas in a pod are you saying that you are back in your fathers favor geoffrey welli am here in rouen at my fathers behest he sent me to normandy to govern it in his name geoffrey constance was gazing at him with wide dazzled eyes then he must truly be thinking of choosing you not richard as his heir one step at a time he cautioned i think he is giving serious consideration to naming me as duke of normandy and richard certainly thinks so judging by the threats he made to me who knows he may well be the first man who gave up a kingdom in favor of a duchy constance was deceived neither by his nonchalance nor by his jesting he might not admit it but hed dropped his defenses for the first time seeing their dream as more than a beguiling chimera a bewitching illusion shimmering always on the horizon now it was taking on shape and substance might actually be within their grasp if your father has the sense to choose you over richard she declared then i am prepared to forgive him for all the wrongs hes done me and mine geoffrey burst out laughing and while she did not understand why he found that so humorous she was glad to share his laughter glad to embrace his hopes for the glittering future that suddenly seemed within their reach henry and eleanor celebrated their thirtieth christmas court at windsor he then moved on to winchester leaving eleanor at windsor with tilda heinrich and their children it was there that the archdeacon of lisieux found him bringing welcome news from rome the pope had brought about a reconciliation between heinrich and the emperor frederick delighted henry summoned eleanor and his daughter and soninlaw to winchester so they could celebrate his success and the end of their exile henry also began to make plans to send john to ireland and finally gave richard permission to return to aquitaine without even waiting for the spring thaw richard declared war against his brother and launched punitive raids into brittany once more the angevin empire was riven to its core by internecine hostilities chapter fortyseven may winchester england the countess of chester was content to watch the festivities from a windowseat for she was tired and feeling her years on this early may evening shed brought her grandson to winchester to meet her cousin the king only to learn that henry had changed his plans because of richards assault upon geoffreys lands in brittany hed hurriedly taken ship at dover celebrating his easter court at rouen with the patriarch of jerusalem as he pondered how to deal with richards latest defiance while maud welcomed the opportunity to visit with eleanor and tilda she was not looking forward to making a channel crossing in pursuit of henry i am getting too old for all this to and fro randolph she said wryly amused when her grandson took her words at face value and apologized solemnly for taking her away from home and hearth noticing that he was glancing wistfully across the hall where a jongleur was entertaining with some adroit sleight of hand she relieved him of the duties imposed by blood and courtesy and watched with a smile as he headed over to get a closer look at the conjuring tricks my lady turning at the sound of a soft voice maud found herself gazing up into the face of a young woman one who looked somewhat familiar accepting the wine cup proffered by the girl maud recognized her in time to pretend that shed known the identity of the french princess all along thanking alys and inviting her to sit in the windowseat is that your son hughs boy maud nodded i am taking randolph to confer with the king about his future he has been in wardship since hughs death of course but he is fifteen now and we need to begin making plans for when he reaches his majority the earldom of chester is a great inheritance and a great responsibility fortunately i think the lad will be up to the challenge unlike his father she thought sadly may god assoil him alys politely agreed that randolph seemed quite mature for his age and they passed the next few minutes in inconsequential conversation as the younger woman nerved herself to reveal the reason shed sought out the countess maud was telling her that the april earthquake had done great damage to lincoln cathedral when alys decided she could wait no longer madame you are known to speak your mind freely i am hoping that youll not be offended if i too speak forthrightly maud did not like the sound of that she felt that alys had legitimate grievances but she was above all a realist and she knew there was nothing she could do about it speak my mind do i she said ive never heard my lack of tact described so delicately i am not asking you to betray any confidences alys said hastily it is just that i know so little about what is occurring beyond these walls only what i happen to overhear i would be grateful if you could answer a few questions lady maud for example i know the patriarch of jerusalem came to england to seek the kings aid for the defense of the holy land is it true that the king was offered the crown and actually turned it down and is it true that lady matildas daughter will not be accompanying her parents when they return to saxony those questions seemed innocuous to maud and easy enough to answer i daresay you know that the king of jerusalem is cousin to king henry and you know too that he has been afflicted by leprosy he is a young man of great courage and ability but he is also dying and when he does the crown will pass to his sisters son who is a small child patriarch heraclius hoped that king henry would agree to take the crown himself believing that no one else could keep outremer from falling to the infidels king henry put the proposal to his great council in london but they did not want him to accept it why ever not the king asked them if they thought he could still fulfill his coronation oath to safeguard the realm if he were to accept the crown of jerusalem and they concluded that he could not maud said blandly stifling a smile for given such a broad hint by henry they could hardly have answered otherwise so the king told the patriarch nay offering to provide money and soldiers for the defense of the holy land the patriarch was distraught and asked the king then to send his son john was eager to go from what ive heard pleading for the chance but the king would not agree to it the patriarch was not mollified by the kings offer of gold and men chastised him bluntly for failing in his duty as a christian king king henry would not be swayed though saying he could not leave his kingdom and when they met the french king at vaudreuil the patriarch had another failure for your brother philippe said that he could not take the cross at this time either alys seemed distressed can the holy land survive without a new christian quest though god willing maud murmured wondering what else she could discuss with alys surely personal news would be safe enough i am happy to report that your brothers queen is on the mend after her miscarriage she saw at once that this was a mistake that alys had known neither that isabelle was pregnant nor that shed lost the baby did anyone even write to this girl i believe you asked about the duchess of saxonys daughter it is true that richenzamatilda i meanwill remain behind when her parents depart but that is because she has a crown in her future the scots king has asked king henry for her hand in marriage they are distant cousins so must receive a dispensation from his holiness first but the king has already sent a delegation to rome to procure one so it was for the best that she changed her name for richenza would not do at all for the queen of scotland so far so good she thought as long as they steered clear of any mention of richard the conversation should be smooth sailing did you hear about lord john he was very disappointed when the king turned down the crown of jerusalem on his behalf and mayhap to make up for that the king knighted him and put him in command of that longplanned expedition to ireland so it seems a crown is in the offing for him too alys did not show much interest in johns prospects and maud wondered if she even knew that henry and philippe had agreed after hals death that she should be wed to whichever of the kings sons that he shall choose most likely not why should they bother to inform her that she might become johns bride rather than richards maud had always prided herself upon her pragmatic streak knowing that if shed been more sentimental more of a starryeyed romantic she might have been unable to endure marriage to the earl of chester a man surely burning in hell everlasting these thirty years past she reminded herself now that alys was none of her concern but it was no longer that easy for her sense of justice was offended by the young frenchwomans plight alys was glancing around nervously worried that they could be interrupted at any moment robbing her of her one chance to learn the truth worried too that her resolve might weaken she leaned closer to maud and blurted out in one great gasp lady maud is it true that richard is to wed the daughter of the holy roman emperor maud had somehow known it would get to this where did you hear that she temporized wondering how to make such a bitter brew taste tolerable and then she thought no by god the girl deserves the truth if nothing else one of my ladies overheard people gossiping about it and she came to me straightaway of course is it true i am sorry you had to learn of it that way you ought to have been told a plighttroth was agreed upon but the marriage will not take place as much as it pleased the king and the emperor it did not please god the girl sickened soon after and died ere the year was out alys closed her eyes her lips moving it was the faintest of whispers meant for no ears but those of the almighty maud caught it though deo gratias most likely the only latin alys knew and she felt a sharp pang of pity but no surprise richard was a hero out of a minstrels tale highborn and handsome and courageous and dashing a king in the making of course alys wanted to marry him what girl would not alys soon excused herself looking as if shed been given a great gift maud knew better marriage was never easy but she suspected that marriage to richard would be more difficult than most men like richard did not make good husbands a wife would never be more than incidental relegated to the outer edges of a life given over to war duty honor and the pursuit of power sitting back in the windowseat maud considered approaching henry on alyss behalf there was no deliberate cruelty in his nature surely he could be made to see how unfairly he was treating alys but she was deluding herself and she knew it there was a time when she could have taken her royal cousin to task for his transgressions and he would have heard her out mayhap even heeded her but that time had passed she gazed around the hall her eyes coming to rest upon the still elegant figure of her friend the english queen theyd all lost so much harry most of all eleanor should have been better pleased by henrys summons instructing her tilda heinrich and their children to take ship at southampton and join him in normandy as soon as possible shed like nothing better than to turn her back on england the land she usually referred to as that wet wretched and godforsaken isle but instincts honed both by years of marriage and captivity alerted her to danger of some sort nor was she reassured by the welcome they received upon their arrival at bayeux henry had been as angry as shed ever seen him when hed learned of richards raiding into brittany but if he was still wroth he no longer showed it seemed to be in good spirits teasing his granddaughter about needing to learn to speak gaelic shrugging off tilda and heinrichs effusive expressions of gratitude for ending their exile even joking about the stern lecture hed gotten from patriarch heraclius his apparent equanimity merely served as further fuel for eleanors suspicions unable to endure the suspense any longer she cornered him in the great hall after a lavish meal in honor of the new archbishop of rouen henry had not been won over by the campaigning of rotrous ambitious nephew and saw to it that his own choice was elected to the prestigious post walter de coutances when henry amiably allowed her to steer him toward the relative privacy of a windowseat eleanor was utterly sure that he was up to something you are looking much too smug for my peace of mind she said bluntly if you were a cat thered be cream dripping from your whiskers what are you plotting now harry why am i here would you believe me if i said for the pleasure of your company he asked fighting back a smile when she scowled why are you here a fair question your presence is required for upcoming events as you never tire of reminding me you are the duchess of aquitaine after all despite the warm spring night eleanor felt a sudden chill what are you going to do he leaned back in the windowseat regarding her with a smile that never reached his eyes i am going to answer all your prayers love i am going to restore your inheritance to you rico fitz rainald did not realize how much hed had to drink until it was too late upon learning that richard had no need of them that evening he and andre de chauvigny had ventured into one of the more disreputable quarters of poitiers in search of wine and whores they found the first at several shabby taverns outside the old roman walls and the second at a bawdyhouse popular with the dukes soldiers their thirst slaked and their lust sated they headed back toward the palace after curfew had rung relying upon their prestige as the dukes knights should they have the bad luck to run into the watch jesting and bantering and singing a ribald ditty about a lustful monk they saved time by cutting through the ruins of the ancient roman amphitheater eerily bathed in may moonlight andre had drunk enough wine to become fanciful and he launched into a disjointed tribute to all the men whod died in this unholy arena drawing heavily upon what richard had told him of roman bloodsports a pity we do not have any more wine he declared for we could drink to the memories of those brave men who fought and died on this very ground they were pagans you fool rico hooted reaching out to steady andre as he clambered onto a broken pillar brave men nonetheless andre insisted hazily at least the gladiators were richard says they executed common criminals in the arena too he stopped so abruptly that rico took a quick step forward thinking hed lost his balance again but he was staring over ricos shoulder into the shadows behind them we have company he said in a low voice that sounded as if he were beginning to sober up fast rico spun around to see the men converging on them they moved without haste fanning out to cover any escape routes cagar rico muttered for richard had recently begun to teach him to swear in the lengua romana of his duchy whatever you just said i echo it andre said grimly jumping from the pillar to the ground and unsheathing his sword ricos weapon had already cleared its leather scabbard he did not like the odds four against two nor did he like the looks of these intruders for they moved without haste theirs a cockiness that bespoke an easy familiarity with violence and sudden death two of them had swords drawn the other two wielding clubs studded with iron they were close enough now for rico to recognize one of them a strapping broadchested brute with a closecropped head rico had seen the man at two of the riverside taverns and he cursed himself now for having drunk so much for walking into this trap like a lamb to the slaughter it never occurred to either knight to yield though for there would be great shame in letting themselves be robbed by these lowborn knaves give us your money and your rings and fine leather boots and we may spare your lives young lordlings come and get them andre challenged as he and rico braced themselves for the onslaught it didnt happen the men were turning looking off to the right risking a quick glance in case this was a trick rico saw what had attracted their attentiona glowing light that was moving steadily toward them holding a lantern aloft a man was approaching as casually as if encountering outlaws in a deserted dark locale was a commonplace occurrence is this a private game he asked or can anyone play the bandits regarded him with a mixture of surprise and scorn oh you can play friend the man who was apparently their leader took a menacing step in the newcomers direction you can start by tossing your money pouch on the ground and then kneeling if you beg for your life sweetly enough we might spare itor not youll have to wait and see his companions laughed but the stranger continued to advance hed made no move to unsheathe his sword though and the bandit swaggered toward him his naked blade leveled at the mans chest that is far enough fool unless youre truly eager to die rico and andre exchanged glances agreeing that this might be as good a chance as theyd get before they could move though the lead outlaw lost patience and lunged at the newcomer rico had never seen anyone move as fast as the other man did in one unbroken motion he thrust the lantern into the bandits face and stepped in as the outlaw recoiled from the flames for the length of a breath the two seemed frozen in an odd embrace and then the brigand staggered back sinking to his knees with a guttural cry it was only then that they saw the bloodied dagger in the strangers hand the stricken mans companions gaped at him as if they could not believe the evidence of their own eyes they were no strangers to killings but had never seen one done so swiftly smoothly and economically as this and they hesitated that brief instant of uncertainty was to prove decisive for their new foe did not share it he flung his dagger at the nearest of the men and then drew his sword while it was still in the air the thrown knife missed its target but not by much and the man spun around fled into the darkness that was enough for the other outlaws they too took to their heels rico and andre had yet to move transfixed by the ease of the strangers victory they were not easily impressed by prowess for theyd seen richard on the battlefield fought at his side as theyd grown to manhood but as they looked at each other now the same thought was in both their minds this man was a master of the art of death then he moved within recognition range and they understood mercadier and his band of routiers had been hired by richard the past autumn and hed quickly earned the young dukes favor for he was as fearless as richard himself not all men were comfortable with him though for there was something unsettling about his very presence he had the dark hair of a son of the south but his eyes were so light they were almost colorless and utterly opaque impossible to read a jagged scar angled from the corner of one eye to his chin leaving a bare patch of skin where his beard could not grow and men accustomed to battle disfigurements nonetheless found themselves unwilling to look too long at mercadiers sinister scar or those odd pale eyes andre and rico felt awkward now that they knew the identity of their benefactor nevertheless they could not deny they were now deeply in his debt and lucky indeed that hed happened to be passing by when rico said as much he thought he caught the trace of a smile but it was hard to tell for sure the corner of mercadiers mouth had been twisted awry as that fearsome facial wound had healed i was not just passing by he said id been looking for you both since compline you are wanted back at the palace for the duke has need of you why what happened andre said warily for neither he nor rico could envision mercadier as the bearer of good tidings what is wrong the duke got a message from his father he has been ordered to surrender aquitaine at once to its rightful ruler the duchess eleanor and if he balks the old king threatens to send her into poitou with an army ravaging the land with fire and sword until he yields up the duchy to her they stared at him dumbstruck andre was the first one to recover lashing out bitterly against richards father declaring that henry fitz empress was truly the spawn of satan rico was loath to say so aloud for the same blood flowed in their veins but he found himself in hearty agreement with andres emotional outburst the old king was too clever by half for how could richard take up arms against his mother howhow did the duke react he asked and mercadiers shoulders twitched in a half shrug his face flamed then he went white as chalk and withdrew to his own chamber it was his seneschal who sent me to find you saying go fetch his cousins hoping you two might be able to help how i do not know mercadier said candidly rico and andre did not know either but they had to try and when mercadier turned to go they were about to follow when a groan drew their attention back to the wounded bandit blood was soaking his tunic and rico flinched when he realized that it was coming from the mans groin sweet jesus no wonder the poor sod shrieked like a gutted weasel what about him mercadier glanced back over his shoulder leave him if hes lucky his friends might come back for him if not there are plenty of stray dogs roaming the town on the lookout for a meal that was not an image the young knights cared to dwell upon for long and they hastened to catch up with mercadier leaving the outlaw sprawled in the ancient arena where so many others had fought and died there were only a few times when eleanors anger with henry had burned so hotly that it had been indistinguishable from hatred there was the afternoon shed stood in the great hall at limoges castle and watched as the count of toulouse did homage to hal there were days of despairing rage in the early months of her captivity and the michaelmas eve when hed demanded that richard yield aquitaine to john but this latest clash of wills was different nothing hed ever done was as demeaning and unfair as thisusing her as a weapon against her own son never had she felt as helpless as she had on that night at bayeux listening in stunned silence as he told her what he meant to do utterly oblivious to the damage that might be done to her relationship with richard no she could forgive him for making her his prisoner but never his pawn once shed calmed down though she could see that there actually might be some benefits to his scheme this was proof that hed abandoned any hope of replacing richard with john for he knew shed never agree to disinherit richard richard would still be the heir to the duchy moreover the transfer of authority would not be as hollow as henry undoubtedly hoped she had no illusions knew hed never trust her with real power but the acknowledgment of her suzerainty was significant in and of itself by recognizing her legal rights he was bringing her from the shadows back into the light restoring her identity in the eyes of the world hed not find it so easy to make her disappear again and after eleven years of invisibility she was eager for any taste of freedom however circumscribed it might be the duchess of aquitaine had resources that a disgraced wife did not she would be better able to protect herself for she was a vassal of the french king most important of all shed be able to protect richards inheritance as long as she drew breath his succession was assured and since she was sure her husband had considered that too she could only conclude it did not matter to him further proof that he now knew hed never coax or bully richard into submission it was enough for him to have the semblance of victory to appear to have prevailed over his rebellious son and if this man seemed utterly unlike the one shed married there was no surprise in that realization and only a little regret her greatest fear was that richard would not understand that hed be too outraged to see this devils deal was not such a onesided bargain after all what if he defied his father if it came to war if he blamed her too if he saw her as harrys accomplice in the days that followed she told herself repeatedly that she was being foolish that richard knew shed never put her own interests above his but the truth was that she could not be sure shed been separated from her sons for so long just as they came to manhood she loved richard dearly but how well did she really know him although it would have given eleanor little consolation henry shared her unease as they awaited richards response he thought hed come up with a facesaving solution to an increasingly dangerous problem he could not allow richard to defy him so openly no king could by offering richard a way to back down while still salvaging his pride henry hoped to resolve the impasse and restore peace to his family and realm but hed been bluffing for he never had any intention of sending an army into aquitaine as a father he found that prospect abhorrent and as a king sheer lunacy so as time passed without word from richard he found himself confronting an unpleasant truth bluffing was an invaluable part of a rulers arsenal an integral aspect of statecraft with one great flaw if the bluff failed what then richard gave no advance warning arrived in rouen with a large retinue of knights and clerics he shared his brother hals sense of drama and as he rode through the streets of the norman city people turned out in large numbers to watch enjoying the visual spectacle that royalty was expected to provide it was a source of disappointment to many that their duke had so little taste for pageantry and pomp as they cheered his sonso handsome and splendidly attired mounted on a magnificent white stallionthey agreed that duke richard was a worthy successor to his brother of blessed memory the young king laid to rest in their great cathedral in addition to richards own imposing entourage the kings court was filled to capacity with highborn visitors and vassals so hundreds of avid eyes were upon him as he strode into the castles great hall and approached his parents upon the dais my lord king he said with flawless formality kneeling gracefully before henry his respectful demeanor that of subject to sovereign having greeted his father he turned then to acknowledge his mother bending over her hand with a courtly flourish madame it is my privilege to return the governance of aquitaine to your capable hands the curious spectators realized with disappointment that courtesy could be used as effectively as any shield of wood and leather for none could tell what thoughts lay behind those inscrutable bluegrey eyes not even the two people whod given him life the table that evening was laden with venison from henrys latest hunt but eleanor had no appetite and merely toyed with her food afterward she found no opportunity to speak privately with her son and retired to her own chamber in a foul mood she was too tense to sleep and was still up and dressed several hours later when a knock sounded at the door she nodded for amaria to open it assuming it would be henry coming to discuss their sons submission but it was richard did your fathers spies see you come here he shrugged it hardly matters now does it he said and reached out enfolding her in a heartfelt hug eleanors eyes misted and she blinked rapidly not wanting him to see amaria had retreated to a far corner of the chamber and picked up some sewing doing what she could to make herself as unobtrusive as possible but she neednt have worried for theyd already forgotten her presence i was concerned eleanor admitted that you might be angry with me too thinking that id benefited at your expense richards surprise was obvious why maman you were given no more choice in this than i was no i was not but i knew how difficult this would be for you and and you were probably scared to death that i was going to act like a damned fool and doom us all he said with a fleeting smile i cannot say i was not tempted butwell here i am and thank god for it she said fervently come sit down richard we have much to talk about once they were seated she reached over and laid her hand on his i know this is not what you want to do but at least now you need not fear losing aquitaine by coming up with this scheme your father is conceding defeat admitting that he could not compel you to abdicate richard tilted his head looking at her in bemusement did she truly think he needed to have this pointed out he almost reminded her that he was not the fool his brother had been he did not though for even if he did not understand her grieving for hal he did respect it to give the devil his due he said papa did come up with the only way to pry me loose from aquitaine he knew i would never deny your claim to the duchy he paused but this time he has been too clever for his own good maman the old fox has finally outfoxed himself he will have to grant you more liberty now can no longer keep you sequestered in some remote stronghold out of sight and mind ill not deny that it is not easy for me either to turn over the governance of the duchy or to let the world think he has won but it will be a comfort to know that you are restored to your rightful place and he is in for a rude surprise if he thinks he is going to get another tamed dog for his kennel i will never follow in hals footsteps never i know she said an argument can be made that hal choked to death because he was kept on such a tight chain but not only are you a very different man than your brother your circumstances are different too she leaned forward eager to explain why he need not fear hals fate but he gave her no chance i am looking forward to seeing his face when i tell him what i intend to do he thinks i shall be dancing attendance upon him as hal did but if i am not to govern aquitaine then i am free to follow my heart i am going to take the cross and do what papa would not answer patriarch heracliuss plea and lead my men to fight for the defense of the holy land richard grinned very pleased with himself for having found a way to honor his mother thwart his father and serve god while having a grand adventure at the same time eleanor did not return his smile though she was regarding him gravely i fear that would be a great mistake richard why what could be more important than securing the kingdom of jerusalem securing the kingdom of england i know you want aquitaine but you want the crown too do you not of course i do it is my birthright now that hal is dead why would taking the cross put it at risk because your father will not want you to take the cross no more than he wanted john to do so he will forbid you to do it and will be outraged and distraught if you defy him in this you will be giving him an entirely new grievance he might even be dismayed enough to reconsider the succession especially if you are not here to defend yourself richard was frowning i know he has been favoring geoffrey shamelessly of late his way of reminding me that i am not an only child and nothing is writ in stone i just took it as one of his usual threats nothing more than that you truly think i did not at first nownow i am not so sure geoffreys governance of normandy was cut short by your raids into brittany but harry was pleased with the way he dealt with the norman barons and clerics and he is equally pleased with the news coming out of brittany why what is geoffrey up to now he and constance just presided over an assize in rennes summoning the breton lords to discuss the laws of inheritance in the duchy they have made a compact in which all agree to pass their lands on to their eldest sons harry was quite impressed by reports of this assize saying geoffrey has shown considerable political skill in winning over perpetual rebels like raoul de fougeres they no longer view him as constances alien husband the angevin intruder forced upon them by their enemy the english king hes succeeded in earning their respect and their trust no small feat considering the contentious nature of the bretons and i regret to say that your father has compared geoffreys assize to your own attempts to introduce the law of primogeniture which resulted in a rebellion by the lords of angouleme that is not fair primogeniture was already the custom in brittany so geoffrey had an easier road to travel than i did be that as it may your father likes what he has seen of your brothers rule in brittany and he is troubled by the constant turmoil and antagonism between you and your vassals i still say he gave geoffrey power in normandy to punish me knowing how little id like it you know how he is maman nothing is ever straightforward with him the man has more coils than any serpent and is he giving geoffrey the county of nantes just to vex you too richards eyes narrowed geoffrey is getting nantes when she nodded he lapsed into silence for some moments eleanor was content to wait wanting him to draw his own conclusions would he truly do that he asked at last would he dare to disregard the laws of primogeniture and pass over me in favor of my younger brother would he dare oh yes would he actually do it that i do not know she conceded but you ignore the possibility at your peril her hand closed on his again the crown is yours by right now that hal is dead but only you can decide if the price is too high richard you will still have aquitaine come what may if you can be content with that then take the cross and leave for the holy land but if you want to be king then it would be wiser to remain here and fight for it he rose abruptly and began to pace i do want the crown but i do not know if i could endure the humiliating apprenticeship papa put hal through if he expects me to be at his beck and call like a pet spaniel he shook his head turning back to face her i cannot do that maman i do not think you will have to dearest hal may god assoil him had no lands of his own but you will still have aquitaine all will know this restoration changes nothing in truth you are still the heir to the duchy and men will continue to come to you with petitions and appeals in fact she said with a wry smile the poor souls wanting to have rights recognized will likely need to get charters from all three of usyou me and harryto make sure there are no ambiguities or uncertainties and when rebellion breaks out again in aquitaine harry will have to rely upon you to restore order in the duchy he no longer has the boundless energy that he once had for his youth is long gone and his health is not as robust as it used to be youll be the one he turns to for supportunless you are away in the holy land and then it would be geoffrey he said no more after that soon excused himself without telling her what he meant to do there was no need for she already knew it was a good summer for henry for his domains were at peace and there was finally harmony at home too richard treated him with deference giving him no further reason for complaint now that hed reconciled with his son his anger with eleanor soon cooled and he found himself enjoying her pleasure in her new status shed had her own household for a few years now but she wasted no time in bringing her trusted clerk jordan back into her service and she bestowed lavish gifts upon favorite abbeys like fontevrault upon tilda and richenza the loyal amaria her daughters in castile and sicily and her new grandchild constance had given birth to another girl on the nativity of st john the baptist christened matilda in honor of geoffreys sister and his formidable grandmother the empress henry shared eleanors joy in the birth of their granddaughter the news helped him through a difficult timethe second anniversary of hals death so too did the safe return of william marshal from his pilgrimage to the holy land henry found he took surprising comfort in wills presence he knew will was a man of honor a valuable addition to the royal household but what mattered more to him was wills link to his son for the first time in a long while he could look upon his family with contentment john was finally established in his own lands and the new pope had given permission to have him crowned as king of ireland tilda and heinrich were making ready to return to saxony grateful that hed been able to end their exile richenza would soon be scotlands queen all in all henry thought the future looked brighter than it had in years but with the coming of autumn these prospects dimmed the pope refused to grant the dispensation for richenzas marriage to the scots king much to the girls disappointment tilda and heinrich had already departed and henry was glad that eleanor was there to comfort richenza for hed never been good at drying female tears then henry fell seriously ill and for more than a month he found himself confined to belvoir castle too weak to attend the truce conference hed just brokered between the french king and the count of flanders worst of all the reports from ireland were uniformly dismal johns first taste of independence and authority had proven to be an unmitigated disaster his companions many of them younger sons too offended the irish chieftains by mocking their dress their customs even their long beards instead of curbing such bad behavior john had encouraged it having his own funds at long last hed spent money recklessly squandering it on wine entertainment gambling and frivolous whims when he could no longer pay his routiers they resorted to plunder and eventually deserted to the irish in just nine months john had managed to greatly diminish the longstanding hostility between the native irish and the anglonorman settlers uniting them in their outrage with his inept rule very disappointed in his favorite sons first foray into manhood henry had finally been forced to recall him henry passed a relatively quiet christmas at domfront with only richard eleanor and richenza for john had just gotten back to england and geoffrey and constance remained in brittany that spring henry met the french king at gisors where they confirmed the settlement of again agreeing that alys was to have the vexin as her dowry and this time specifying that the son she was to wed would be richard which philippe took to be an acknowledgment of richards status as henrys heir richard took it that way too and was even more encouraged when henry agreed to stake him in a campaign against the count of toulouse whod taken advantage of the angevin family troubles to seize cahors and quercy now that he was no longer feuding with his father richard was determined to get them back and he was delighted to find that henry was willing to finance the expedition henry and eleanor celebrated easter at rouen and henry invited geoffrey and constance to join them for he was planning to return to england and wanted to see his granddaughters before he left he and eleanor were to be disappointed though geoffrey came to rouen but he came alone explaining that constance felt their daughters were too young to make such a long journey and henry soon realized that geoffrey was not there by choice he behaved as a dutiful son but a very distant one and henry was baffled by his aloof demeanor hed last seen geoffrey that past summer when hed come to tell his parents of the birth of his daughter and hed seemed very pleased when henry then turned nantes over to him so this change was as puzzling to henry as it was unexpected he was disquieted enough to discuss it with eleanor who vexed him with her pithy response if you want to know what is troubling geoffrey you ought to be asking him but somewhat to his own surprise he eventually did putting aside his natural inclination for the oblique approach he summoned geoffrey to a private meeting in his bedchamber and asked his son bluntly what was wrong henry had always lamented hals transparency feeling that a king should not reveal his emotions as obviously as hal invariably did he was no better pleased though with richard and geoffreys ability to guard their thoughts now he could only watch geoffrey in frustration as his son said nothing was wrong his face utterly unreadable i do not believe you he said at last and geoffrey shrugged i do not know what you want me to say papa i want you to give me a truthful answer crossing the chamber he stopped in front of the younger man i would not be asking if i did not want to know geoffrey and when his son continued to regard him blankly he found it easier to express his concern in anger why is it that none of you can be honest with me is that so much to ask that seemed to strike a spark to judge by the way geoffreys eyes began to glitter if you truly want an answer to that question i would suggest you consult scriptures and what is that supposed to mean whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap i am sorry i cannot cite the exact verse but i daresay youve heard it before you are hardly in a position to cast stones geoffrey do you think ive forgotten how frequently and convincingly you and hal lied to me during the siege at limoges but when have i ever lied to you lies are not always expressed in words papa and in this past year you have done nothing but lie to me i do not know what you are talking about i am talking about all youve done to convince meto convince richard and much of christendomthat you might pass over him and make me your heir i see now that it was just a ruse a means of bringing richard back into the fold and of course you never gave a thought about how id feel why should i mind being used as bait to lure richard home after all henry was shaking his head vehemently that is not so i never sought to mislead you geoffrey nor did i ever promise to choose you over your brother i am indeed sorry if you took it that way but not sorry that richard did i daresay you knew the only way to rein him in was to make him think the crown was in jeopardy and as your schemes usually do it worked my congratulations henry felt as if he were seeing a stranger for geoffrey had always been the controlled one the son who never erupted into reckless fits of fury like his brothers it was this realization that tempered his own anger he ran his hand through his hair impatiently pushed it back from his forehead as he tried to decide how best to handle this why was fatherhood so damnably hard he was sure hed never given his father the grief that his sons were constantly giving him geoffreylisten lad i will not deny that i did think about it that i considered whether youd make a better king than richard nor will i deny that ive occasionally wished you were the older brother ive always understood you better than i did richard as i once told you you are the son who most reminds me of my own father if circumstances were differentbut they are not it would set a dangerous precedent to ignore the laws of inheritance and richard would never accept it many men would think he had the right of it too and youd have no peace not as long as he lived i see so you were actually looking out for my own good how kind of you papa i am sorry geoffrey i truly am and i do understand your disappointment but this i swear to you that i did not mean to deceive you or to raise false hopes had i only known geoffrey halfturned away and henry gave him the time he needed to master his emotions when he swung around again he did seem more composed but his breathing was still swift and shallow as if hed been running a long and exhausting race you said id have no peace if youd passed over richard but what peace will i have once he is king you think hell not seek revenge as soon as you are safely gone to god that is why i intend to do all i can whilst i still live to bring about a genuine and lasting reconciliation between you and your brother the corner of geoffreys mouth twitched and since richard is celebrated for his forgiving nature how can you fail he made an indecisive movement and henry feared he was about to go but instead he reached out and grasped his fathers arm we both know that not even gods own angels could make richard and me anything but enemies he is to be king so be it then you said you were sorry that id misread your intentions you can prove it by giving me the means to defend my duchy what do you need money i want anjou geoffreys grip tightened it makes sense papa politically and geographically i am more angevin than richard could ever hope to be for he is mamans son not yours he cares only for aquitaine and for the crown anjou would never mean as much to him as it would to me and if i held it hed be far less likely to declare war upon brittany you know that is so give me that much papa give me anjou so that i can honor your heritage and protect my family and my lands henry was moved by geoffreys eloquence and by his urgency he wanted to say yes to give his son what he wanted so desperately hed gladly have given geoffrey aquitaine if it were his to give anjou was dearest to his heart of all his domains the land of his birth he did not doubt that it would be in good hands if geoffrey held it hed proven in brittany that he could rule and rule well but how could he rend his empire like that anjou and normandy and england were his legacy meant to be passed intact to his eldest son could he give up the dream that had sustained him through even the worst of times the dream of establishing a dynasty that would endure long after he and all whod known him were dust i can see how much this means to you geoffrey i cannot promise you that anjou will be yours but i can promise you thisthat i will give it very serious consideration geoffrey was silent for several long moments yes he said and smiled tightly i am sure you will constance admitted a servant and instructed him to place the tray on a coffer following him to the door she slid the bolt into place and then hurried over to her husband geoffrey was leaning back in his chair his eyes half closed his body as limp as if his bones were made of liquid he looked utterly exhausted and she was not surprised not after hed told her hed left rouen just four days ago that meant he and his men had covered more than forty miles a day which sounded to her more like an escape than a departure denez has brought food and wine she said whilst youre eating theyll heat water for a bath is that your subtle way of telling me that i reek he asked opening his eyes long enough to give her a quick smile but when she offered a wine cup he shook his head i have not eaten all day would be roaring drunk after three swallows she reached for the plate of meat and bread and he shook his head again laterim not hungry she didnt insist for she was scornful of women who hovered over their husbands as if they could not be trusted to take care of themselves geoffrey was a man grown knew if he was hungry or not fetching a chair she dragged it over and sat down beside him do you want to talk about it or wait till the morrow youd let me do that of course she said and would have risen had he not caught her wrist she sat down again and watched him as he seemed to doze but then his lashes flickered and he turned his head to look directly at her it is done constance she waited and after another long silence he said he wanted to know what was wrong can you believe that when i told him he seemed truly taken aback and swore that hed never meant to mislead me to make me think that i might be king did you believe him does it matter he laughed a sound that was not pleasant to hear he lies to everyone even to himself especially to himself he smothered a yawn saying ill have that wine after all i asked him for anjou what did he say what does he ever say he fell back upon his usual stratagemdelay and evasion promising to give it serious consideration he does not seem to realize that by now we understand the code and i know damned well that he turned me down after it had become obvious to them that their hopes of a crown were illusory theyd had several sobering conversations about their future once richard was king constance wanted to discuss their options now but she held back for she was not taken in by his bitter bravado and she realized that his hurt went far deeper than hed ever admit i cannot believe that i let him play me for such a fool constance i should have known better should have known he drank slowly and then startled her by flinging his cup against the wall watching the wine stain the whitewash looking eerily like blood to her constance said it may not be as hopeless as you think how long ere your father and richard start quarreling again who is to say that he will not turn to you this time for true in his way he does love you after all indeed he said cracking the word like a lash of course hal comes first and then johnny but after that yes he finds space in his heart for me hal is dead and johnny has just made a bloody botch of his irish command she pointed out he surprised her then by coming to his younger brothers defense saying that his father was as much to blame as johnny that hed thrown the lad into deep water without first teaching him to swim mayhap it is better not to be loved by my father he said after a time for it can be argued that richard and i fared better than poor hal and johnny he set us loose at eighteen and seventeen sent us into aquitaine and brittany to learn how to fight how to govern he kept hal and johnny close not giving them the chance to stand on their own as god is my witness constance i will never do that to my sons never i know you will not she said moving behind him and beginning to massage his shoulders as she expected his muscles were rigid taut with tension come to bed geoffrey get some sleep our troubles will still be there on the morrow he did not seem to hear her i am glad he forced that talk for now i see much more clearly ill play no more of his accursed games leave that to richard and johnny and good luck to them both what i am going to do is to safeguard our future and our duchy ill need a few days to rest upand then i think it is time you and i pay a visit to the french court this had always seemed like the obvious move to constance the french king had a keen interest in brittany an even keener interest in clipping angevin wings and philippe was already showing signs of a ruthless will to rival henrys philippe would make a useful ally if not an entirely trustworthy one but she felt confident that her husband was more than his match shed never urged geoffrey to reach out to philippe even though shed long thought it made political sense for she understood that thered be no going back for geoffrey it would be a repudiation of his own blood and shed not thought she had the right to ask that of him she moved around the chair now so that she could see his face are you sure geoffrey they are still your family and no he said not anymore you are my family you and our children his eyes sought hers sowhat do you say she leaned over brushing her lips against his forehead and then cradling his head against her breasts well i have always wanted to see paris chapter fortyeight february paris france constance was not impressed by the entertainment provided by the french king although in fairness she supposed she was spoiled geoffrey was an enthusiastic and generous patron of the troubadours of his mothers duchy and as a result hed never had trouble attracting renowned performers to the breton court when she said as much to her husband geoffrey murmured well you get what you pay for reminding her that philippe had so far shown little interest in music or literature forcing men of talent to look to others for support to henry and his sons the count of flanders or marie the countess of champagne whod been acting as regent since her husbands death five years ago constance was willing to concede that philippes dinner in their honor was a culinary triumph clearly the french monarch was more generous with his cooks than with his musicians so far shed not seen enough of philippe to form any impressions of him but that seemed about to change when they were summoned to join the french king and his queen upon the dais after the trestle tables had been cleared away and dancing begun isabelle was a pretty slender blonde who looked younger and acted older than her sixteen years she was obviously attuned to her husbands wishes for when philippe asked constance jovially if he could borrow her husband for a short while isabelle immediately chimed in with compliments about constances gown saying that she would like to discuss the countesss seamstress with her constance was not taken in by the flattery how dare philippe dismiss her as if she were an errant child had he forgotten that brittany was hers but as her eyes met geoffreys he winked and she reconciled herself to playing the role philippe cast for her the dutiful unobtrusive spouse of course you may my liege she said and then smiled sweetly as much as it grieves me to be deprived of your company i know my husband will relate to me all that i miss you see we share everything as isabelle did her part and drew constance aside philippe said to geoffrey with a bemused smile your wife is rather spirited yes she is geoffrey agreed with a grin im a lucky man philippe thought that was open to debate but it would hardly be politic to insult the wife of a man whose good will he wanted when he proposed now that they schedule a private meeting on the morrow geoffrey suggested instead that they take a stroll in the gardens such spontaneity was not philippes modus operandi but he could see no reason not to go along with it and sent a servant for their mantles then signaled to his bodyguards as the two men left the hall geoffrey was quick to notice the men trailing at a discreet distance for their presence seemed to confirm the tales hed heard about philippes nervous disposition he could not imagine that being said of any member of his familymale or femaleand hoped the young french kings circumspection did not bode ill for his hopes of an alliance in geoffreys view statecraft and kingship were not for the faint of heart they walked in companionable silence through the gardens dormant now in winters grip daylight was a limited commodity in february and dusk was not far off the seine had not yet been closed to traffic for the night and they could see boats bobbing past their lanterns swaying in the wind brief glimmers of light against the dimming sky and icy dark river when they reached the end of the island philippe sat down upon a wooden bench but geoffrey chose to perch on the garden wall a position that seemed precarious enough to make philippe uncomfortable do you mind sitting down here he said id have a difficult time explaining to the english king that his son drowned when he tumbled into the seine although geoffrey hid it well philippe suspected that the other man was humoring him when he obligingly switched seats philippe did not care though he never worried what others thought of him this is my first opportunity he said to express my sorrow over the death of your brother the young king hals unexpected death was a great loss to us all yes geoffrey said indeed it was it must have been a particularly sharp blow to you my liege philippe thought that was an odd thing to say for hal had been merely a brotherinlaw and theyd never been close he made no comment though and when geoffrey saw he was not going to respond he said after all hal would have been the perfect kingfor france he saw philippes eyes flicker and he bit back a smile as he continued blandly my brother had many admirable virtues he never lacked for courage and he was remarkably goodnatured and so generous that hed literally give a man the shirt off his back he was also one of the most malleable men ive ever known easily led and easily bored given his lack of interest in the drudgery of governing i am sure hed have been grateful for any guidance offered by the french crown when you heard of his death at martel and realized youd now have to deal with richard you must have felt as if your affectionate docile dog had been transformed by evil alchemy into a feral ravening wolf that is hardly a brotherly description of richard philippe was rarely surprised by other men and he regarded geoffrey with suddenly sharpened interest so we are speaking candidly are we under the right circumstances it can save a great deal of time philippe glanced across the garden to reassure himself that his bodyguards were not within earshot fair enough let me begin by saying that ive been expecting you ive watched the brazen way your father used you to put the fear of god into richard and i knew it was only a matter of time until you turned your eyes in my direction yes geoffrey said dryly my brothers and i seem to look to paris the way infidels look to mecca i am not hal i am not a king and i am neither malleable nor overly trusting but that does not mean we could not forge an alliance that would be to our mutual benefit just what are you seeking security geoffrey leaned closer lowering his voice to evoke an intimacy more conducive to sharing secrets my fathers health is beginning to fail philippe nodded hed paid a sickbed visit to henry that past november at belvoir castle well he is old he said from the comfortable vantage point of his twenty years so it is only to be expected if you know a storm is coming you do not wait until the wind is raging against your house ere you take protective measures i want to be ready when that storm breaks over brittany philippe nodded again and what would make brittany safe from the storm anjou mayhap even normandy geoffrey was pleased that philippe was so quick anjou he confirmed and an alliance that i can rely upon once richard becomes king it would certainly be in frances interests to have more reasonable leadership in anjou or normandy ive long thought that the bretons are natural allies of the french not the english your fathers meddling in brittany was a shameless encroachment upon the suzerainty of the french crown i will not deny i find it offensive that youve done homage for your duchy to the duke of normandy and the king of england but never to your rightful liege lord fortunately geoffrey said that can be remedied easily enough now that theyd come to it philippe drew a deep breath to dampen down his rising excitement so you would be willing to do homage to me i would well then i do not see why we cannot come to an understanding advantageous to us both for example i think it would be only fitting to name you my lord duke as the seneschal of france as that office traditionally belonged to the count of anjou philippe could not have made geoffrey a more welcome offer he studied the french king intently and then startled philippe by laughing i feel he admitted as if id ventured into a foreign land expecting to have difficulty making myself understood imagine my surprise to discover that we speak the same language philippe thought that geoffreys reputation for eloquence was well deserved for hed just articulated perfectly what the french king was also feelingthat hed finally found the ally of his dreams one who shared his insight shrewdness and sangfroid philippe had long known that he was more intelligent than most of those around him and while the knowledge was undeniably satisfying it was occasionally lonely too for the first time in his young life he was discovering the pleasure of finding a kindred spirit and he joined in geoffreys laughter laughter that sounded surprisingly carefree and gleeful to his bored bodyguards not like philippes usual guarded chuckle at all morgan fitz ranulf could hardly believe he was at lagny site of some of the most famous tournaments of recent decades when geoffrey returned to the french court that august morgan had not expected such a marvelous surprise as lagny tournaments were not frequently held in august for even the most enthusiastic devotees of the tourney preferred not to have hundreds of men trampling through their fields and vineyards during the harvest season but upon their arrival in paris geoffrey and his men discovered that philippe was absent from his capital not likely to return from senlis for another week they also learned that a tournament was to be held that coming monday at lagny just twenty miles from paris and suddenly geoffrey no longer minded the wait for while hed never been as enamored of the sport as hal he enjoyed testing himself against men of equal skill for morgan the lagny tournament had even greater significance hed been knighted by geoffrey in the past year and this would be his first chance to compete in one morgan had just helped his squire to roll a wooden barrel up a slight incline and was watching as josse then rolled it back down taking care not to let it get away from him you need to be quicker lad for it almost ran over your foot he joked and then noticed that he had company a small boy about six or seven was at his side watching too what is he doing he is cleaning my hauberk the best way to remove rust and dirt from mail is to shake it in a barrel of sand the boys eyes fastened upon morgan with flattering attention are you going to fight in the tournament sir knight i am because he believed the best knights were not braggarts morgan added frankly it will be my first but that works to my advantage since i can take part in the jousting which is reserved for newly made knights and then fight in the melee too encouraged by morgans affability the boy edged closer this will be my first tournament too he confided my mama thought i was too young in the past but my brother is taking part in this one and he spoke up for me well be over there he said pointing across the field toward the wooden stands will we be able to see everything well youll be able to see the vespers jousting tonight for those too eager to wait and on the morrow youll get to watch me joust lucky lad morgan said with a grin that the boy returned and youll have a good view of the charge that will begin the melee both teams will try to stay together as long as possible for that is the best strategy but theyll eventually split up into smaller groups and the fighting can range over several miles this field will stretch between lagny and the town of torcy and ere the day is done youll have knights laying ambushes in the woods and taking refuge in barns and chasing one another right into villages seeing the look of disappointment on the childs face morgan said reassuringly youll still get to see all the jousting and the lance charge and the start of the melee and afterward when the prize is awarded to the knight who was the most valiant youll be able to watch that too ive been told it is a fine greenland falcon my brother will win it but i hope you do well too thank you morgan said gravely and when the boy continued to interrogate him he answered readily enough for he genuinely liked children and looked forward to the day when hed have sons of his own the main rule is that there are no rules well mayhap a few you see that staked enclosure off to your right that is the recet for our team the one for our opponents is located near torcy since that is their base if a knight is hardpressed he can take refuge in his recet and therell be menatarms to guard it and make sure the other side stays out when a knight breaks his lance during the charge he can ride over and get another one from his squires but once the melee begins lances are of no use in such close quarters and men rely upon swords and maces how can you tell friend from foe the boy blurted out and then flushed that is a foolish question no it is a very good one each lord will have his own banner and his knights will have his coat of arms emblazoned on their shields and we all have our own battle cries too the french shout montjoie and the english cry dex aie which means god our help the young king always used that one my lords men will be yelling saint malo a favorite breton saint you saw the young king fight the boy asked in awe my brother says he was a sight to behold morgan thought that geoffrey was as adept at arms as hal but it seemed meanspirited to deny a dead man his due and so he said indeed he was lad one of his most celebrated fights was right here at lagny hed become separated from his men which is highly dangerous for a great lord his foes swarmed him eager for a kings ransom and he was so hard pressed that his helmet was torn from his head fortunately his best knight will marshal was close by and he and another of the kings men rode to his rescue the childs eyes were as round as coins do men die in tournaments of course their weapons are not blunted and morgan caught himself remembering that the boy had a brother fighting on the morrow but any deaths would be by pure chance he said hastily for that is not the goal the idea is to capture your foe and his horse hold him for a goodly ransom lord thibault a plump pinkcheeked woman was hastening toward them i have been looking everywhere for you arms akimbo she frowned down at the child who scowled back unrepentant morgan gallantly came to thibaults defense it is my fault too dame he said with his most charming smile we were talking about the tournament and lost track of time he kissed her hand then with a flourish i am sir morgan fitz ranulf one of the mesnie of the duke of brittany thibaults nurse was thawing quickly soothed by the mention of geoffreys name it had an immediate affect upon thibault too he is my uncle he exclaimed looking up at morgan with a pleased grin morgan had known thibault was from the upper classes his clothing and speech and even his selfconfidence all proclaimed him one of fortunes favorites hed not expected the boy to be quite so highly placed though if he was geoffreys nephew he must be one of the sons of geoffreys half sister marie that made perfect sense for lagny was on the border of champagne then your brother is henri count of champagne thibault nodded proudly but then bridled when his nurse sought to lead him away morgan again played the good knight and offered to escort them to thibaults mother that not only satisfied them both but it would give morgan a welcome chance to meet one of christendoms great beauties for all of eleanor of aquitaines daughters were as physically blessed as she had been thibaults mother was at that moment standing in the top tier of the spectator stands checking out the view and bedeviling geoffrey i recently discovered one of your dark secrets she teased thanks to gaucelm faidit he was performing at my court last month and he let it slip that you and he had composed an erotic tenso with you singing in french and gaucelm responding in the lengua romana naturally i had to hear it oh lordi was drunk at the time marie i swear actually it was rather good she said giving him a sidelong smile richard is an occasional poet too have you heard any of his songs richard and i are more likely to share insults and threats than poetry that is a pity she said and meant it shed first met her mothers sons thirteen years ago at the time of their first rebellion and shed become quite fond of all three of them john shed yet to meet shed grieved for hal and she was sorry that richard and geoffrey acted more like blood foes than blood brothers nor did she approve of geoffreys new rapport with her other half brother although shed been compelled by the political realities of her world to make peace with philippe she neither liked nor trusted him and she was sure that no good could come of his sudden friendship with geoffrey since no others were within hearing range she took advantage of her status as geoffreys elder sister to speak her mind i find it curious that you and your men are fighting with the french instead of the normans and angevins merely a courtesy to my host he said and she gave him a skeptical glance that made her look uncannily like the mother shed not seen since childhood i am going to tell you a story geoffrey about my father papa would often wander off by himself and one time my brotherinlaw thibault found him dozing under a tree when thibault chided him for it he said calmly i may sleep alone quite safely for no one bears me any ill will i know that story geoffrey said grinning as he remembered how it had vexed his father who found louiss sanctimony hard to swallow i also heard about the time he said that the english king had men and horses and gold but in france they had only bread and wine and gaiety my parents called him louis lamb of god for some time after that one and did you hear what philippe answered when hed seemed lost in thought during a council this is soon after hed been crowned so he was all of fourteen he said that hed been wondering if hed be able to make france great again as it had been in the days of charlemagne no i had not heard that but it does sound like philippe what is your point marie i am trying to warn you that philippe might well be a changeling for he could not be more unlike our father i do not know what the two of you are up to but i hope you take heed geoffrey despite his youth philippe is a clever dangerous man i agree with you but you seem to have forgotten that i am a clever dangerous man too marie rolled her eyes but when geoffrey laughed she could not help laughing with him very well ive done my best will say no more on it she promised and proved it by changing the subject why did constance not come with you i would have liked to meet her come to our christmas court this year geoffrey said expansively and well show you that breton hospitality is second to none constance had been suffering morning queasiness and she thought it best to remain in rennes in case she might be pregnant i keep telling her that all happens in gods time but she is impatient to give me a son its passing strange that you are the only one of the english kings sons to produce heirs so far he shrugged well richard might get around to wedding poor alys one of these days now that she will bring him the vexin and johnny is keen to marry the gloucester heiress i wish him luck for the last thing my father wants is to allow him to have incomes and lands of his own he sounded so bitter that she gave him a quick searching look far be it from me to offer a defense of henry fitz empress but you might keep this in mind at least he has permitted contact with your mother and that is more than my father did once their marriage was over he did his best to exorcise her from my life and memories she stopped then having caught sight of the small boy running across the field trailed by his nurse and a young knight leaning over the railing she waved to thibault and smiled she loved all four of her children dearly but she had a special fondness for thibault her youngest and as she watched him race toward her she felt a maternal pang thinking that they grew up so fast thankful that thibault was only seven years away from the time when hed risk his life and honor in tournaments and war like her elder son henri and her brothers geoffrey and richard geoffrey was watching with amusement as his men teased tormented and chaffed his cousin morgan an initiation of sorts into the ranks of knighthood morgan bore it in good humor fending off the jests and gibes with a becoming modesty that was belied by his wide grin and dancing dark eyes geoffrey knew his cousin would remember for the rest of his life that moment when his lance had unhorsed his foe a knight never forgot his first joust heralds were parading up and down crying out helmets on geoffrey adjusted his own helmet and then mounted his favorite destrier a spanish stallion hed called tempestad in recognition of the horses silverygrey coat and stormy temperament reaching for the lance that his squire was holding out he playfully tapped the boy on the shoulder with it a lighthearted reminder that mikael might one day be dubbed a knight too the estor the grand chargewas eagerly awaited by spectators and participants alike and geoffreys breath quickened this was the moment he most loved about tourneying that first glorious sortie with banners streaming trumpets blaring and the earth atremble with pounding hooves as hundreds of knights came together in a spectacular clash of sound and fury they were close enough now to couch their lances under their arms to home in upon targets geoffrey selected a knight on a rangy bay stallion unhorsing an opponent was as much an act of skill as it was luck required steady nerves and perfect timing as they closed with each other geoffrey veered at the last minute just enough for his foes lance to glance off his shield he would then lean back in hoping the almighty would keep his own aim true it was a maneuver hed performed times beyond counting both in tournaments and war and indeed the other knights lance did not hit his shield fullon but against all logic the blow still slammed him back against the saddle cantle with such force that he lost his balance and unable to catch himself crashed heavily to the ground the fall drove the breath from his lungs but he reacted instinctively rolling away from his horses thrashing legs his sense of danger was strong enough to override his bodys pain and by the time his foe turned his mount and circled back geoffrey had managed to get to his feet surrender the other knight cried out flinging away his shattered lance and raising his sword menacingly over his head geoffreys shield had been ripped from his shoulder and his lance sent spinning out of reach hastily unsheathing his own sword he spat out one of his fathers favorite angevin oaths and made his refusal even more emphatic by slashing at the other mans leg his defiance was unthinking dictated by pride a knight unhorsed was in grave peril and he was a particularly tempting target his opponents would soon be trampling one another in their eagerness to capture the duke of brittany he knew though that he need not hold out for long a knights first duty was to protect his liege lord and his bretons would race to his rescue as soon as they noticed his plight it was just a question who would arrive first friends or foes sparks flew as he parried the other mans sword thrust and then jumped back forcing the knight to rein in his mount do not be a fool the man panted yield and if you give me your parole ill free you to rejoin the melee he swore bitterly then not at geoffrey but at the riders coming up fast stay back hes mine to me you always were a greedy sod ancel one of the new arrivals laughed a dukes ransom is too much for one man geoffrey had seized his opportunity and snatched up his shield spurning ancels repeated demands to surrender he swung his sword in a sweeping arc to keep the horses at bay taking a blow on his shield that staggered him facing down three knights he despaired when he saw others galloping toward them but then he heard the sweetest sound this side of heavens golden harps saint malo saint malo the battle cry of the bretons his attackers were turning to meet this new threat geoffrey recognized gerard de fournival in the lead with matthew de goulaine and his cousin morgan only a few strides behind him more and more of his men were turning away from the melee too starting to ride in his direction and geoffrey saw salvation was at hand he had no time to savor his reprieve though gerards destrier screaming like a banshee smashed into the closest of its foes and the other animal reared to meet the attack unseating its rider all was chaos shouting men and slashing swords and maddened horses acutely aware of his danger geoffrey darted for the closest open space but before he could break free the riderless stallion bolted and he was brushed by its haunches as it turned knocking him off his feet blinded by the clouds of dust being churned up he never saw the flailing hooves above his head i think hes coming around the voice seemed to echo from a great distance and when geoffrey opened his eyes he saw nothing but sky the sun was so bright that he squeezed his eyes shut again as he sought to orient himself to understand why he was lying on the ground feeling as if every bone in his body was broken geoffreymy lord this voice was familiar and so urgent that he tried to filter the glare through his lashes enabling him to focus upon the circle of worried faces clustered around him he was not surprised to see gerard and morgan but he was puzzled by the presence of his sister although he did not remember what had happened he sensed that she ought not to be here seeing his confusion gerard knelt and leaned over so geoffrey could hear you are in the recet you were unhorsed and trampleddo you not remember we drove them off and carried you to safety the menatarms are guarding us making sure none of those knaves make another try at capturing you it alarmed geoffrey that he remembered none of this he did not even remember the estor the start of the tournament how ancel de vernon cheated morgan came back into geoffreys line of vision that whoreson did not couch his lance kept it in the fautre he denied it but hes done it in the past geoffrey understood what morgan was saying it just did not seem very important at the moment marie obviously did not understand though in the fautre what does that mean morgan the fautre is a spear rest my lady attached to the front of a mans saddle enabling him to balance the lance upright whilst riding he ought to have braced the lance under his arm when he charged by leaving it in the fautre he gave his thrust much more power that is why he was able to knock the duke from his horse even though the lance did not strike my cousins shield a direct blow one of the knights produced a wineskin and marie took it from him tilting it to her brothers lips geoffrey swallowed gratefully you oughtnot to be here he mumbled surprised that his words sounded so slurred i should have remained in the stands and watched the estor when i did not know if you lived or not marie frowned down at him and geoffrey thought hazily that she looked like his mother sounded like her too he was touched that theyd all been so concerned for him and he wanted to reassure them that his greatest injury was to his pride areare we winning he asked and they burst out laughing taking his question as proof that the legendary luck of the english king held true for his son too marie had lost all interest in the tournament after geoffreys narrow escape shed accompanied him back to his tent not departing until she was sure that he had indeed suffered no more than bruises scrapes and contusions shed have preferred to go to her lodgings at the abbey of st pierre but shed left her young son in the stands with her ladies and his nurse and she did not trust them to keep thibault out of mischief upon her return she found that the melee had long since broken up into smaller presses continuing the fighting out of sight and sound of the spectators but thibault was still so excited that she had to promise shed bring him back later to watch the awarding of the prize true to her word marie and thibault were back in their seats several hours later she knew theyd have a wait but she did not have the heart to deny her son whose enthusiasm for the tourney had not been diminished by his uncles mishap to thibault the day had exceeded his expectations and he was soon proving to be a handful for his harried nurse bouncing up on his seat to watch knights returning to the field squirming and wriggling and demonstrating that no adults could hope to match the boundless energy of puppies colts and small boys marie kept a sharp eye upon him for she was not a novice to motherhood and her vigilance soon paid off for she was able to stop thibault from dashing down onto the field when he sighted her eldest son the young count of champagne rode over delighting his little brother by swinging him up into the saddle and taking him for a slow gallop around the lists after turning thibault over to one of his knights henri reined in beside the stands and marie hastened down the steps to meet him his flaxen hair was tousled his face smeared with sweat and dirt and there was a reddish stain on his hauberk that was worrying until she could be sure the blood was not his maman i heard what happened to my uncle geoffrey and so i stopped by his tent he insisted that he was unhurt and said he means to attend the dinner tonight what why must you men be so loath to use the brains god gave you henri grinned for this was a conversation theyd had before his mother was convinced that males were born without any common sense whatsoever id want to go too if i were in his place he admitted it is a matter of pride but lowering his voice he said the thing is that i do not think he is as well as he claims he is very pale and holloweyed like a man trying to pretend hes not suffering from a morningafter malaise i think it would be best if he keeps away from the revelries tonight they can last till dawn after all i thought mayhap if you talked to him finding a smile he joked that she was a force to be reckoned with and geoffrey would not dare to defy her but marie was not misled by his attempt at humor geoffrey must look like walking death if her daredevil son henri had taken notice tents of the nobility were often so large that they had to be erected with winches and geoffreys was a spacious one but it was so crowded that marie did not at once see her brother geoffrey knew most of the tournament participants and friends had quickly gathered once word spread of his fall a number of french knights and lords were there too their presence confirming maries suspicions that geoffrey and philippe were plotting together she finally found geoffrey seated on the edge of his bed talking with the renowned french knight guillaume de barres one glance was enough to convince her that he was in pain her husband had suffered from chronic headaches and she knew the signs the tightness around geoffreys mouth the vein throbbing in his temple the ashen cast to his skin marie was at fortyone still a beautiful woman and an accomplished flirt she drew upon that charm now to disperse the men clustered around her brother sitting beside geoffrey she asked if he had seen a doctor he swore he had saying the physician had been impressed that his injuries were so trifling marie hoped he was right but did not let that distract her from her purpose and launched into her argument why he should not attend the nights dinner much to her surprise geoffrey did not dispute her i am not feeling so good he admitted my headache has gotten worse and im having some pain here he gestured vaguely toward his abdomen the mere thought of food roiled his stomach but he saw no need to share that saying with a flickering smile so you need not fret sister i shall keep to my bed tonight i promise i am glad to hear that but the more marie scrutinized geoffrey the more uneasy she became i want you to come back with me to the abbey she said their infirmarian is experienced in the healing arts and i can vouch for his skills which i cannot do for your tourney leech do it for me geoffrey i implore you youre forgetting the churchs hostility to the tournament marie i doubt that the abbot would be pleased if one of his monks tended to a sinful tourneyer and you are forgetting that my husbands father was a great patron of st pierres not only is he interred in their church his son hugh was the abbot there for seven years trust me when i say the monks will bid you welcome marie was both relieved and disquieted when geoffrey raised no further objections for if he was willing to see the infirmarian without being coaxed into it he must be in considerable pain henri promised to stay with thibault through the ceremonies so we can go straightaway she said determined not to give him a chance to change his mind but then he turned to face her and she felt a throb of fear for the pupil of his left eye was so dilated that it looked black ill be back she said and jumped to her feet going in search of gerard de fournival for she knew the french knight better than the others in geoffreys mesnie gerard did not protest when she told him geoffrey was going to see the abbey infirmarian he did balk though when she told him to find a horse litter or cart i cannot do that madame the duke would be shamed to ride in a conveyance meant for women and the elderly ill order horses saddled we have more urgent concerns than the dukes pride she snapped i fear he has suffered a serious head injury gerard stared at her and then beckoned to the closest of geoffreys knights matthew de goulaine and morgan after a brief murmured exchange they both hastened toward geoffrey at their approach geoffrey started to rise but he felt so dizzy that he had to grab matthews arm for support i am all right he insisted just a little lightheaded releasing the knights arm he stepped back to show hed regained his balance but then his knees buckled they caught him before he fell maneuvered him toward the bed marie and gerard were beside him now and when his sister grasped his hand geoffrey tried to squeeze it reassuringly my head hurts he said indistinctly and by the time they got him onto the bed his eyes had rolled back in his head and hed gone limp in their arms gerard de fournival sat up with a start surprised that hed actually dozed off even though hed slept little since geoffreys collapse getting stiffly to his feet he glanced quickly toward the bed where his liege lord and friend lay motionless as hed done for the past two nights and a day the infirmarian and another monk moved quietly about the chamber but gerard found their composure to be oddly comforting these aged men of faith had seen too much to fear death some of the knights were napping sprawled in the windowseat slumped in chairs or on the floor a few of themlike morgan and matthew and geoffreys friend ivo de la baillewere still staving off sleep for keeping vigil was all they could do for their duke now marie was not present and gerard assumed shed gone to check upon her son for only the duties of motherhood had taken her away from her brothers side gerard stretched and winced as his knotted muscles protested then crossed to the open window dawn was streaking the sky in delicate shades of pink and pearl the last of the night stars flickering out like quenched candles it took gerard a moment to remember the day of the weekwednesday the feast day of st bernard of clairvaux gerard would normally have implored the saints intercession on his day but bernard was a newly made saint and the mortal bernard had been a fierce foe of geoffreys parents from the devil they came and to the devil theyll go had been bernards terse judgment upon the angevins would he bestir himself on geoffreys behalf geoffrey had been taken to a private chamber rather than to the large infirmary hall and from the window gerard had a view of the abbey garth watching without interest as riders were admitted but then he leaned forward in amazement jesu that attracted the attention of the other men and morgan and ivo came to stand beside him though they saw nothing unusual about these new arrivals that man on the chestnut palfrey gerard cried it is my brother roger they looked at him blankly unable to understand how he could be so excited about a family reunion when their lord might be breathing his last seeing their lack of comprehension gerard said impatiently roger is the french kings best physician the men were dismounting by the time gerard came striding toward them with morgan and ivo on his heels hastening forward he enveloped his brother in a grateful embrace never have i been so glad to lay eyes upon you roger your arrival here is so providential that the almighty himself must have directed you to lagny not the almighty the king roger handed his reins to one of his companions the countesss messenger reached senlis late yesterday afternoon king philippe was sorely distressed to hear of the breton dukes injury and dispatched me at once with orders to spare neither expense nor effort to save him we rode all night he said sounding vaguely surprised that hed proved up to such a great exertion for a royal physicians life was not usually so arduous nowtell me what you know the infirmarian thinks duke geoffrey has a grave head injury he cannot be sure if his skull has been fractured for there was no open wound he lost consciousness briefly when it happened but once he came around he was quite lucid although he did complain of a headache that got worse as time went on but weve not been able to rouse him since he collapsed in his tent can you help him roger god willing roger said reverting to the professional tone he used with patients he did not like what hed just been told but he saw no need to share his misgivings with gerard if the dukes prognosis was as poor as he feared thered be time enough for that god willing he repeated resolutely take me to him they waited in the abbey guest hall while roger conducted his examination were soon joined by marie and henri the hosteller sent servants over with food and wine but none of them had any appetite they sat without talking for there was only one voice they wanted to hear nowthat of the french kings physician when roger was escorted by one of the monks into the hall they went to meet him in such haste that several benches were overturned a royal physician was expected to have the social skills of a courtier and roger greeted marie and her son with the deference due their rank and the sympathy due their kinship to geoffrey once the formalities had been observed he looked from the countess to his brother and then said quietly was the duke shriven yes he was he heard a votive mass of the holy spirit on monday morning and then my chaplain heard his confession ere the tournament began maries words faltered for she could still hear geoffreys laughing voice joking that he never passed up an opportunity to seek absolution of his sins any more than he passed up an opportunity to sin anew are you saying that there is no hope i am saying that he is in gods hands madame roger said carefully for his wounds are beyond my abilities to heal marie closed her eyes for a moment and then turned away without speaking after a brief hesitation henri hurried after her the other men were struggling with disbelief for even though theyd known of the severity of geoffreys injuries theyd been holding on to hope gerard and morgan were the most incredulous for gerard had enormous confidence in his brothers medical skills and morgan was by nature an optimist always expecting the best outcome never the worst butbut there must be something you can do he stammered i know head wounds are dangerous but even soone of the breton lords andre de vitre came back from pilgrimage last year and he told duke geoffrey about some miraculous surgeries performed in the holy land about a christian knight saved when the doctors bored into his skull can you not do something like that no i cannot i am not a surgeon but we could find one roger in his urgency gerard grabbed his brothers arm in an iron grip i know surgeons are not held in high regard by physicians but surely that would not matter now if there is nothing you can do and a surgeon could this has nothing to do with my wellfounded misgivings about most surgeons i know about the procedure in question it is called trepanation and is done to drain blood and pus and noxious humors from the skull but it is rarely if ever successful when the patient is unconscious or feverish and the duke is both i could not in good conscience recommend surely it is worth trying if you would have me speak bluntly gerard it is too late dilation of one or both pupils is a sign of bleeding in the brain and the dukes other symptoms are not encouraging his skin is cold and clammy to the touch his pulse is weak and his breathing has become shallow and uneven moreover i fear that he has suffered damage to his liver or spleen that is not so morgan interrupted for i helped the infirmarian to undress my cousin his body was badly bruised and scraped but there were no contusions on his belly internal injuries do not always show external signs what i found far more significant than the presence or absence of bruises was the swelling of the dukes abdomen this usually means that the liver has been lacerated and is bleeding into the abdominal cavity either injury would be grievous enough to kill a man they stared at him momentarily stricken into silence what are you saying roger that we just sit back and let him die i said nothing of the sort roger said testily weve been trying to get him to swallow yarrow and white willow though that is obviously not easy and there most certainly is something you can do for the duke you can pray for him now i need to see the hosteller about getting a meal they watched him go and then by common consent headed for the abbey church where they lit candles and prayed for geoffreys recovery when they returned to the infirmary they found marie and the abbot standing by the bed marie clutched a jeweled reliquary and they felt a flicker of hope remembering that st pierre had one of christendoms most sacred treasuresa nail from the holy cross leaning over marie kissed her brothers forehead then opened the reliquary and placed the nail in his hand gently closing his fingers around the blessed relic then she and the abbot knelt by the bed and began to pray geoffreys knights knelt too and added their voices to hers marie was sitting on a bench not far from the infirmary hall several of her attendants hovered nearby close enough to be summoned far enough away to give her the semblance of privacy the day had been a scorching one and dusk had not yet dispersed much of the heat there was not even a breath of wind and maries tears dried on her cheeks almost as soon as they trickled from the corners of her eyes shed lost track of time would never know how long she sat there so weary that her thoughts drifted without direction or purpose she was heedless of passersby the curious eyes of monastery guests the silent solicitude of her own knights and ladies it took a sudden stir of excitement and noise to dispel her sorrowful reverie to bring her back to the august eve and the illusory peace of the abbey looking up she gazed dully at the man coming toward her it was only when he was several feet away that she rose to her feet and made a dutiful curtsy to her brother the french king she was puzzled by philippes presence at lagny but not enough to dwell upon it he always looked rather untidy but he seemed more disheveled than usual his unruly brown hair flopping across his forehead his clothes layered in dust his eyes glazed with fatigue he surprised her by reaching out taking her hands in his sisteris it true the porter at the gate said that geoffrey yes it is true geoffrey died as vespers was ringing just like hal she was not sure why that was relevant but her tired mind was blurring her losses and she could not separate geoffreys death from hals the brothers shed loved taken too soon philippe released her hands and stepped back she thought he would go but instead he sat down heavily on the bench gestured for her to do the same marie obeyed and they sat in silence for a time while philippes men milled about in some confusion unsure whether to wait or take their horses on to the abbey stables sure only that philippe would not welcome their intrusion marie glanced at him thinking it was very unlike philippe to ride all the way from senlis in such haste hed shown no such compunction when their father lay dying but his unexpected presence here might be a blessing might forestall any unpleasantness with the church we must give him a fitting funeral she said firmly as if daring him to object when he did not she continued less defiantly there might be trouble with the church though philippe seemed lost in his own musings but at that he turned to look at her and she was stunned to see his eyes were wet with tears why the church forbids men who die in tournaments to be buried in consecrated ground she reminded him the last lateran council reiterated the ban just five years ago id forgotten that he said surprising her again for philippe had a memory to rival the english kings it is of no matter none will protest and if they do theyll regret it thank you my lord brother marie rose with another perfunctory curtsy shall i take you to the abbot now philippe did not appear to have heard her he was staring into space scuffing the dirt with the toe of his boot his head lowered so she could no longer see his face what a waste he said thickly what a bloody waste geoffrey died on august just a month from his twentyeighth birthday he was buried with great honors before the high altar in the cathedral of notre dame in paris with all the french court in attendance philippe grieved openly and he and marie each founded two chantries to pray for geoffreys soul chapter fortynine august rennes brittany my lady always a light sleeper constance opened her eyes to see one of her attendants leaning over the bed what is it juvette the chamberlain is here madame he says he must speak with you sitting up constance reached for the bed robe that blanche was holding out she slid her feet into her slippers and was standing by the time juvette admitted the chamberlain hed obviously been roused from sleep too for his clothing appeared to have been donned in haste i beg your pardon for disturbing you madame but sir gerard de fournival has just ridden in and he insists that he must speak with you straightaway that it is urgent and cannot wait till morning will you see him i will while the chamberlain went to fetch gerard constance tightened the sash on her robe and smoothed back her hair she wore it loose when she was sharing a bed with geoffrey for he liked to play with it during their lovemaking tonight juvette had braided it neatly in a long plait so it would not tangle while constance slept only a womans husband and family usually saw her uncovered hair but constance was not about to bother with a wimple or veil for gerard she was striving to appear composed but her pulse had begun to race geoffrey would not have used a man of gerards rank to deliver a routine letter what had gone wrong in paris did philippe have a change of heart deciding that richard might make a more useful ally had geoffreys father learned of their plans or was the threat coming from richard whatever geoffreys message she did not doubt it would be a warning of some kind and she was braced for bad news as gerard was ushered into the bedchamber gerard looked like a man whod spent days in the saddle his boots and mantle were travelstained and muddy his hair windblown constance saw only his eyes though bloodshot and redrimmed filled with pain my ladyi tell me gerard she said hoarsely and he knelt at her feet giving her a look of such naked misery that her breath stopped your lord husband he no longer met her eyes saying in a rush he is dead my lady god help us all he is dead constance heard juvettes muffled scream the chamberlains gasp the whining of her favorite spaniel she saw gerards bowed head the chalkwhite faces of her ladies even the toes of her felt slippers peeping out from the hem of her robe she was acutely aware of her surroundings but none of it seemed familiar she felt as if she were floating no longer tethered to reality as she knew it she found that she was sitting on a coffer and gerard was kneeling beside her clutching her hand in his now that hed begun talking he could not seem to stop and she was being pelted with words gerard was gripping her fingers so tightly that her rings were being driven into her flesh but she welcomed the pain for it gave her something to focus upon something to think about beside harrowing images of dust blood and plunging hooves they were all hovering around her now fanning her as if shed been made faint by the summer heat trying to get her to take a few sips of wine asking if they should send for a doctor and juvette who knew her secret made hesitant mention of a midwife at that constances head came up sharply no her face looked drained of all color and shed bitten her lower lip deeply enough to show flecks of blood but her voice was infused with steel noi want no one she stared at them defiantly leave me she said and they reluctantly obeyed after she was alone she sat motionless while her spaniel whimpered and licked her hand moving like a sleepwalker she finally rose and started toward the bed but she could not bring herself to lie down upon it to sleep alone in her marriage bed placing her hand protectively over her abdomen she realized that geoffrey had died not knowing for certes that she was pregnant her child would be born without a father would never know geoffrey and her daughters were so young how long would they remember him how long would her own memories last would the day come when she could no longer see his face hear his laughter remember the feel of his arms around her what a sad dreary dangerous place her world would be without geoffrey she sank to her knees by the bed but she could not pray it makes no sense she whispered why even she was not sure if her cry was meant for the almighty or for her husband she knew only that thered be no answer and burying her face in her hands she did something shed once have thought impossible she wept bitterly for a son of henry fitz empress after the pope had refused to grant a dispensation for the marriage of henrys granddaughter to the scots king henry took it upon himself to find william another wife the daughter of the viscount of beaumont whose mother was a natural daughter of the first king henry and therefore the english kings cousin not content with providing a highborn bride henry offered to host the wedding feast and on this late august day he was holding court at woodstock which would be the site of the scots kings marriage in early september illustrious guests had already begun to arrive and the great hall was crowded with bishops and barons and their ladies henry was standing on the dais dictating to a scribe at the same time that he was discussing richards campaign in quercy with his son geoff the earl of essex and his justiciar ralf de glanville fortunately his clerk was a veteran of royal service and was able to distinguish between henrys asides to his advisors and the thoughts to be set down in the letter the last i heard richard and the king of aragon were on the verge of capturing cahors henry revealed with obvious satisfaction and if the men found it odd that richard was once again exercising authority in aquitaine they were too worldly to let such sentiments show on their faces interrupting himself to speak with a servant henry turned back to the others with a smile morgan fitz ranulf has just ridden in he told them explaining for ralf de glanvilles benefit that morgan was his uncles son he has been in my son geoffreys service for several years is likely on his way to visit his parents in wales i am gladdened to see you morgan he said brushing aside the younger mans formal obeisance and waving him up onto the dais i assume youre heading for wales will give you a letter for your father ranulf is not ailing is he or your mother he smiled again when morgan shook his head and invited his cousin to dine with him that evening thinking that would provide an opportunity to interrogate morgan about geoffrey for hed not heard from his son in months my liege morgan had never shouldered such a daunting responsibility did not know how to go about it was it better just to blurt it out or ought he to lead up to it may i speak with you in a more private setting i do not bring good news morgan had no way of knowing it but those were the same words that the prior of grandmont had used to inform henry of hals death his memories of that dreadful day were never far from his mind and as he looked now at his young cousin his breath hissed through his teeth for he read the truth of morgans mission in his forlorn unhappy face morgan shifted from foot to foot uncomfortable with the silence but when he glanced toward geoff the other man shook his head and he deferred to his cousin keeping his eyes on henry though hed listened without speaking as morgan had stumbled through an account of geoffreys last days and then moved across the solar to the window morgan yearned to slip away for there were still awkward questions to be asked about geoffreys death and he did not want to be the one to answer them he looked over again at geoff and willem neither one spoke they seemed content to take their cues from henry and morgan could not tell if they shared his fervent desire to disappear this was by far the most difficult task of his life and yet hed volunteered for it for hed soon realized that neither the french king nor the countess of champagne nor geoffreys knights cared about breaking the news gently to henry he was convinced that henry had treated geoffrey shabbily but his own father had often insisted that henrys love for his children was heartfelt and morgan thought the king deserved to hear of his sons death from a sympathetic source trapped now in woodstocks solar and feeling more and more like daniel in the lions den he found himself thinking that the bearers of such tragic tidings ought to have bells or clappers so they could warn others of their approach much as lepers did when henry finally spoke morgan flinched for this was the question hed been dreading why was geoffrey in paris ii do not he stammered for he could neither lie to the king nor tell him the truth he was there to take part in the tournament geoff said quickly and both morgan and willem winced at the transparency of the falsehood for that did not explain why geoffrey had been given a lavish state funeral by the french king geoff soon saw the weaknesses inherent in his explanation and realizing the futility of trying to protect his father from the truth he said no more henry had spoken with his back still to them when he turned at last morgan was shocked by how ravaged he looked and he knew that henry was not taken in by talk of tournaments that he understood what geoffreys presence in paris meant once again a son had died in rebellion against him and this time hed been denied even a chance to make things right between them for geoffrey thered been no sapphire rings no promises of forgiveness no avowals of affection and as he realized what a burden this would be for henry to bear morgan felt his own anger with the king ebbing away replaced by an overwhelming sense of sorrow for his cousin and the father left to mourn him september began with a promise of perfection and the women had been lured out into the gardens they set up a trestle table under a shady chestnut tree and enjoyed wine bread cheese and honeyed wafers afterward eleanors granddaughter richenza played the french game jeu de paume with her attendants and several of mauds and eleanors ladies even amaria gamely joined in as they dashed about the gardens batting the ball back and forth eleanor and maud prudently assumed the role of spectators watching with amusement as the younger women laughed and shrieked and attracted several knights who were quite happy to join in the fun this was an excellent idea maud i have not seen richenza so merry in a fortnight i am glad to be of assistance eleanor had explained that richenza was downcast as the nuptials of the scots king drew near only fourteen shed set her heart upon becoming queen of scotland and she was not yet reconciled to the popes verdict pleased that shed been able to cheer the girl up maud resolved to arrange for her granddaughters to spend some time at winchester with richenza is harry looking at another match for her actually he had an offer one which would have made her a queen bela the king of hungary expressed interest in wedding the english kings granddaughter but harry seemed to feel that hungary was the back of beyond and he never gave bela a definite response bela eventually grew tired of waiting and approached the french king for marguerite philippe was happy to accept the offer and she will be departing for hungary at summers end eleanor sounded sad and maud easily understood why the remarriage of hals widow was bound to stir up hurtful memories ive talked with my daughterinlaw about marrying again she confided for it has been five years since hugh died she says she has no interest in taking another husband and reminded me that ive been a widow for more than thirty years eleanor had never been surprised that maud had not remarried for widowhood was the only time in a womans life when she was not under a males authority maud had obviously relished her independence raising her children traveling and proving to be a generous patron of the church shed even founded a priory at repton in derbyshire eleanor suspected that shed also discreetly taken lovers no it was very easy to understand why maud had found life more enjoyable as a widow than as a wife i always appreciated the irony maud that canon law includes widows in the class of miserabiles personae the miserable wretches deserving of special protection i suppose the church fathers thought any woman without a husband had to be an object of pity speaking for myself i expect to have the chance to discover the joys of widowhood for i plan to outlive harry if only from spite eleanor grinned and maud grinned back but she was not completely sure that the queen was joking and she felt a pang of regret that their precarious rapprochement had been a casualty of henrys doubledealing shed seen them take tentative steps toward a marital peace as the years passed and then watched sadly as it all ended when henry used eleanor to win his clash of wills with their son are we caught up now on family gossip she asked lightly so far ive learned that richard is wreaking havoc on the count of toulouses lands and your daughter in castile has given birth to another girl and you have not heard lately from geoffrey but you recently received a loving letter from joanna in sicily any other interesting rumors to relate i do have some news about my youngest son believe it or not harry has sent him back to ireland eleanor grinned again at the expression on mauds face for a man who rarely makes the same mistake twice harry acts like a dog chasing its tail where our sons are concerned you may have heard that hugh de lacy his justiciar for ireland was slain this summer john had blamed de lacy for much of his irish follies claiming the justiciar had acted to hinder his rule and harry of course accepted johns story as gospel so when he learned of de lacys death he decided it would be a good idea for john to return to ireland and lay claim to de lacys estates in meath her smile fading she said with real regret in all of christendom only harry and john think that his second try will be any more successful than his firstand i am not even sure about john grandmother richenza was back followed by denise eleanors newest ladyinwaiting grandfather is here he just rode into the bailey her duty done the girl spun around and ran to greet henry with denise right behind her so only maud was there to hear eleanor mouth a colorful profanity that does not sound like the most loving of spousal greetings she said dryly and eleanor summoned up a taut smile the last time harry was at winchester we had a particularly heated quarrelabout richard of course we did not patch things up when he left so id rather our first meeting not be a public one in other words youve not yet forgiven him well this is why friends have their uses ill go out and welcome him whilst you slip out the side gate and return to your own chambers i happen to be very good at creating a distraction maud said with a wink and walked briskly along the path to the gardens main gateway there she saw richenza the ladies knights and other men clustered around a small group of riders dismounting in the bailey making her way through the growing crowd she greeted her cousin with a graceful curtsy and a playful smile my liege you came all this way to visit with me i am very flattered she started to offer an explanation for eleanors absence but henry gave her no chance stepping forward he drew her into a wordless embrace holding her so tightly that she knew something was wrong even before he murmured against her ear thank god you are here maud eleanor will have need of you ignoring the other spectators he moved toward the gardens maud trailed after him but he gave her no chance to question him opened the gate and entered when he closed the gate behind him maud took that to mean he did not want her to accompany him and she halted uncertainly watching as he strode along the path she was not surprised to see eleanor emerge from the arbor for the queen had finely honed instincts on reflection shed probably concluded that his unexpected visits always boded ill cousin maud turning she was delighted to recognize morgan and she kissed him fondly on both cheeks before asking him what shed not had time to ask henry we bring the worst news a mother could get he said somberly geoffrey was injured in a french tournament and died a few days later oh no she clapped her hand to her mouth staring at him in horror and then swung back toward the gardens henry had reached eleanor by now thankful they were out of earshot maud watched tears stinging her eyes she knew when henry had revealed his heartbreaking message for eleanor spun away from him then sank down on the nearest bench when henry followed she flung up her hand as if to hold him off and mauds tears flowed faster for what could be sadder than parents unable to console each other over the death of a child morgan did not know how to comfort her but he did his best putting his arm around her shoulders and sharing her sorrow it was not long before henry was heading back toward them head down steps heavy and plodding as he came through the gate maud embraced him pressing her wet cheek into his shoulder as she whispered the only words she could a choked litany of i am so sorry shed lost both her sons and henry almost asked her how shed survived such a loss but eleanors need was greater and he said only go to her maud as she slipped through the gate and hastened into the gardens henry glanced over at his young cousin now is not the time lad but shell want to hear about geoffreys last hours be sure to tell her that her daughter marie was with him till the end that might helpa little morgan nodded and they walked in silence back to the now subdued crowd of onlookers henry held out his arms and richenza ran to him wept against his chest as she told him how much shed liked her uncle geoffrey and how distraught her mother would be by his death henry had not been sure if he should be the one to tell eleanor at last concluding that he owed her that much despite her rebuff he was glad now that hed made the trip to winchester at least he could console their granddaughter holding the girl he looked over her head his eyes seeking morgans you said you were returning to wales but what then lad what will you do when morgan admitted that he did not know henry paused before saying quietly i would like you to come into my service morgan i know you are not yet ready to consider your future but when you do remember that there will be a place for you here caught off balance morgan murmured his thanks then stood watching as the crowd parted to let henry and his granddaughter pass after a few moments he sensed someone had come up beside him and he turned looked into the sympathetic eyes of will marshal did he ask you to be one of his household knights the older man said and smiled when morgan stared at him in surprise i thought he would just as he did with me his offer to you makes more sense though will for you are a renowned soldier whereas i am just one of his last links to his son will finished for him and morgan finally began to understand the surrender of cahors was a sweet victory for richard and alfonso of aragon for their armies it was not as rewarding theyd been forbidden to sack the city since it had not been taken by storm some of alfonsos soldiers were tempted to see how much they could get away with but richards men soon disabused them of that fancy warning that even mercadiers fierce routiers knew better than to defy their dukes orders so the streets were reasonably calm as the aragonese king rode into the city to meet richard at the cathedral of st etienne alfonso was very pleased with their campaign so far they had the count of toulouse on the run reduced to sending urgent pleas to his liege lord for help but so far philippe had not responded and theyd retaken most of the lands seized by count raimon during hals rebellion for alfonso it had been a satisfying summer he enjoyed fighting alongside his friend and was relishing their mutual foes humiliation if they could be sure philippe would stay out of it they might even take the war to the russet rock walls of toulouse once he and his men reached the cathedral garth alfonso headed for the chapter house where he expected to find richard and the bishop of cahors he suspected bishop gerald must be cursing his ill luck as this was the second time his city had been taken by an angevin army henry had captured cahors when hed sought to assert eleanors claim to toulouse alfonso fervently hoped that count raimon was losing sleep now that richard was in a position to finish what his father had begun theyd almost reached the cloisters when they encountered some of richards household knights they seemed in high spirits and veered in alfonsos direction as soon as they saw him andre de chauvigny and rico fitz rainald were arguing goodnaturedly about which one got to tell the king the good news and alfonso regarded them with a mixture of amusement and impatience well someone tell me andres cousin nicholas stepped into the breach the most remarkable occurrence sire our lords brother has died after being trampled during a tournament outside paris alfonso whistled in surprise the duke of brittany he said just to be sure there were no misunderstandings although he could not see why johns death would matter to anyone but henry and when they gleefully confirmed geoffreys identity he continued on to the cloisters marveling at richards great good luck the chapter house was crowded with men but the bishops woes had been forgotten in the excitement over the news from paris the prelate was standing off to the side with some of his canons looking disgruntled his sense of disapproval only intensified when alfonso strolled in and greeted richard with a breezy well the lord god has been uncommonly busy on your behalf separating the wheat from the chaff and he was further scandalized when richard laughed come on richard said leading alfonso back out into the cloisters where his men dropped back to afford them a modicum of privacy richard gave alfonso a concise summary of the report hed gotten of geoffreys death and then said half seriously and half in jest i do think god is on my side alfonso for geoffrey was not in paris by happenchance it seems that he and philippe discovered they shared many of the same vices a taste for conspiracy and a hunger for lands not theirs lucky for you then that geoffreys aim was off not so lucky for my father though richard said and smiled grimly for i am all the old man has left now he paused and then added carelessly except for the whelp of course brother euddogwy had dutifully sought to obey his benedictine vows of obedience poverty and chastity the last one had given him the most trouble and some sleepless nights but those temptations were safely behind him for lust was a sin more likely to afflict the young and brother euddogwy had gone grey in the service of his god and his church hed never expected to be tripped up by obedience but hed been in a state of rebellious resentment ever since his prior had sent him to minister to the spiritual needs of the english kings son at first brother euddogwy had welcomed the novelty of it his prior had explained that count johns chaplain had fallen from his horse and broken his leg since he was confined to bed as his injuries healed there was a need for a priest at the castle to say mass and hear confessions since brother euddogwy was the only one of the brethren of monkton priory to have been ordained he was the only possible choice but the prior assured him that as their priory was within sight of pembroke castle he need not sleep there could return at nights to the monks dorter moreover his services would not be required for long count john and his men were sailing for ireland as soon as they got favorable winds and so brother euddogwy had no misgivings no forebodings as hed begun his new duty it took him only a few days though to become convinced that hed been given an unwelcome glimpse of hell he knew he was not a worldly man had passed all his years in this quiet corner of south wales the priory of st nicholas had been his home since boyhood for after his father died his mother had pledged him to the benedictine brothers as an oblate once he was old enough hed become a novice and in due time hed taken his holy vows so impressing his superiors that he was encouraged to take the next steppriesthood hed always been content with his lot in life kindly both by nature and experience and when he heard the confessions of the townspeople and his brethren he imposed light penances never resorted to harangues and threats of eternal damnation as some of the other pembroke priests did he truly believed that most people wanted to do the right thing just needed guidance to steer them away from sin his benign view of mankind was severely challenged though by the retainers and mesnie and soldiers of count john like john most of them were younger sons eager for a taste of independence and many seemed to have confused freedom with disrespect insolence and provocation they swaggered into town in search of trouble and usually found it they certainly found women willing to barter their bodies for coins wine or a chance to socialize with these cocky young knights it was brother euddogwys shocked opinion that the behavior hed seen in the castles great hall was the sort of debauchery he imagined took place in bordels those infamous houses for women of ill repute he was as distressed by their blatant bad manners as he was by their lechery they bullied the castle servants and the burghers of pembroke shouted rudely at reputable wives and mothers drank and gambled and squabbled among themselves and they seemed to go out of their way to be offensive his name attested to his dual heritage euddogwy from his welsh mother and huybeerecht from his father whod been a respected member of pembrokes flemish community count johns knights thought that was hilarious and insisted upon calling him euddogwy fitz huybeerecht instead of brother euddogwy competing with one another to mangle the names beyond recognition they made no secret of their contempt for the welsh and brother euddogwy pitied the irish who would soon have these overweening hordes descending upon them the only light in this darkness was provided by an unexpected sourcefather bartholomew the counts impaired chaplain he was amiable courteous and had an inexhaustible store of spellbinding stories for hed spent a few years in the young kings household before being chosen to serve count john when the scandalous goingson in the great hall would get to be too much for him brother euddogwy would retreat to the chaplains bedchamber where father bartholomew mesmerized him with accounts of the royal court convincing the monk that the angevins truly were the devils brood there seemed no end to his trials either for the bad weather had yet to break on this rainy september evening it had been more than a fortnight since the prior had dispatched him to this dung heap of sin and he was guiltstricken to find himself struggling with rebellious impulses that no dutiful benedictine ought ever to entertain after getting johns permission to retire for the night he took one last disapproving look at the antics in the great hall and escaped out into the rain he was trudging along the towns sludgy main street toward the westgate when he was hailed by a mudsplattered rider on a lathered horse a moment brother if you will can you tell me if the count of mortain has sailed yet for ireland no he has been delayed by the foul weather brother euddogwy suspected this was a royal messenger he was young and fit and did not look as if hed be daunted by bad roads storms or outlaws are you one of the kings serjeants he was indeed the rider confirmed and when he learned of brother euddogwys connection to the castle he leaned from the saddle and shared his news he did not need directions for the wooden paling of the strongholds palisade loomed out of the damp mist but when he continued on toward the gateway brother euddogwy walked alongside him for count john might have need of spiritual comfort in light of the message he was about to receive the scene in the great hall was a raucous one a cheerful melange of knights minstrels servants disreputablelooking women and dogs who were dicing performing bawdy songs responding to cries for wine laughing shrilly and barking brother euddogwy flushed as if this unseemly uproar somehow reflected badly on him but the serjeant took it in stride weaving nimbly among the clots of merrymakers he soon made his way to the dais with the monk following in his wake john was lounging in a highbacked chair with a blonde in his lap she was younger and prettier than most of the women in the hall for a kings son naturally had the pick of the litter he looked bored seemed to be half listening to the girls prattle and the fawning courtiers hovering at his side but brother euddogwy had learned that his careless pose was deceptive he missed little of what occurred around him his gaze soon settled upon the bedraggled messenger and he beckoned the man up onto the dais i am master lucas my lord i come from your father the king and alas i am the bearer of sad tidings he knelt and waited patiently until john shouted for silence then drew out a sealed letter king henry bids you return to england straightaway as he no longer wants you to make the journey to ireland that was not well received by johns mesnie and they made their disappointment known with profanitylaced protests john did not look pleased either i wish my lord father would make up his mind he said peevishly reaching out to take the letter since he seemed in no hurry to open it the serjeant took it upon himself to speak up that is not the message my lord merely its consequences i regret to tell you that the duke of brittany was fatally injured in a french tournament there was a shocked silence and then to brother euddogwys horror the hall burst into tipsy cheering he watched in disgust as john was mobbed by his knights and hangerson each one wanting to be the first to congratulate him that he was now second in line to the english throne that had not even occurred to the monk but johns men were euphoric for this was every younger sons dream to be elevated by the almighty whatever john might have said was drowned out in the riotous din brother euddogwy could not read his face but he did not seem in need of religious comfort so the monk took the serjeant to find the steward whod arrange for a meal and a bed he then went to see the bedridden chaplain feeling that father bartholomew ought to be told of the dukes death he was heading again for the castle gateway when he heard footsteps behind him and one of johns squires came running across the bailey brother wait my lord wants to see you that surprised the monk and he was even more surprised when he was led not back to the hall but to johns private chamber john was alone pacing back and forth his face shuttered and remote come in brother i want to ask you something how may i serve you my lord i would like to have a requiem mass for my brother can you make the arrangements of course my lord brother euddogwy beamed delighted by a natural reaction to tragedy after what hed seen in the hall the castle chapel is not large enough but we can use the priory church or if youd prefer i am sure the priest at st marys will gladly make his church available whatever you think is best this was the first time that brother euddogwy found himself warming to the kings son and since hed not been dismissed he ventured to express his regrets and offer solace if he could i am very sorry for your loss my lord you and the duke were close then no john said actually we were not whilst i was growing up i thought my brothers were the spawn of satan but in the last few years wed gotten to know each other better and when i needed him he was there for me providing generous support for my poitevin campaign brother euddogwy did not know how to respond to that for only the angevins would see a rebellion as an opportunity for brotherly bonding i will ask my prior if we may say daily prayers for your brothers soul my lord thank you john moved to the only source of heat in the chamber a brazier heaped with coals he held his hands over the flames glancing over his shoulder at the monk does it ever stop raining in wales he said and then i wish it had been richard philippe wasted no time in demanding the wardship of geoffreys daughters since geoffrey had done homage to him for brittany he was the dukes rightful liege lord and ought to have custody of the little girls henry naturally did not agree contending that the right of wardship was his neither king bothered to consult constance chapter fifty march nantes brittany the ducal castle at nantes was crowded with highborn breton lords their ladies and retainers constances mother margaret had come from england for her daughters confinement two of constances female friends clemencia de fougeres and mathilde de mayenne were present too and both young women had been escorted by their male kin clemencia by her grandfather raoul and mathilde by her husband andre de vitre clemencias betrothed alain de dinanvitre was also there as was maurice de lire the seneschal of nantes and several churchmen normally the men would not have accompanied the women at such a time not only were males barred from the birthing chamber the process of childbirth was shrouded in female tradition and myth but raoul de fougeres and the de vitre brothers andre and alain were men of power and influence men with a keen interest in the future of their duchy and theyd seized this opportunity to be among the first to learn the results of their duchesss confinement they were seated in chairs by the smoking central hearth in the great hall passing the hours drinking and making idle conversation the one subject they assiduously avoided was what was occurring in constances birthing chamber they were superstitious enough not to want to discuss it beforehand but they all knew what was at stake possibly the very survival of their duchy if constance gave birth to a third daughter it was just a matter of time until shed be compelled to make another marriage and she and her lords would have little say in the matter the husband would be chosen by the english or french king depending upon which one prevailed in their competing claims to lordship over brittany theyd been very lucky in constances first husband for geoffrey had proven himself to be dedicated to the duchys welfare and shrewd enough to ingratiate himself with the breton barons they doubted that theyd be so fortunate again for it was geoffreys status as the kings son that had enabled him to assert so much independence constances next husband was likely to be a mere puppet of the english or french king theyd see to that if however constance gave birth to a boy that altered the dynamics as the focus would shift to her son her role would change and shed be acting as regent for the infant duke henry and philippe would still want her safely wed to a husband of their choosing the new husbands influence would be circumscribed though for he would not be the father of the heir geoffreys unexpected death had plunged his wife into grieving and the duchy into great peril its future dependent upon the sex of the child being born on this easter sunday in late march the men thought it was a good omen that their duchesss pangs had begun on so holy a day but their edginess increased as the hours dragged by as evening drew nigh they sought to distract themselves with an intent discussion of the dangers facing the holy land andre de vitre had passed two years in outremer and hed returned to brittany with compelling stories of the tragic baldwin iv the leper king andre had great admiration for baldwins courage and stoic acceptance of his affliction hed died at the age of twentythree soon after andres departure naming his nineyearold nephew as king but the boy was sickly and hed died not long afterward leaving the fate of the kingdom of jerusalem in the hands of his mother sybilla and her much mistrusted husband guy one of the notorious de lusignan clan andre had stories to tell too of the man many considered to be outremers most dangerous foe sultan salah aldin yusuf ibn ayyub known to much of christendom as saladin hed been defeated by king baldwin at montgisard eight years ago but had suffered few reverses since then now ruled syria as well as egypt he was one of those men about whom legends formed and andre was easily persuaded to recount the most famous of these tales although he warned he could not vouch for its veracity saladin launched an attack upon kerak the stronghold of his blood enemy raynald de chatillon as it happened a wedding had just taken placeraynalds stepson and the young half sister of king baldwin the story goes that the grooms mother sent out some of the wedding dishes for saladin and he asked where the weddingnight chamber was located he then ordered his men not to turn their siege engines upon that part of the castle not wanting to disturb the newlywed couple the men laughed and andre continued relating that the kings army had arrived in time to lift the siege with baldwin too weak by then to ride but insisting upon accompanying his men in a horse litter it is often thought that leprosy is the judgment of god he said somberly but none who knew baldwin could believe that his suffering was the result of sin he was a man of honor and had he only been spared the scourge of leprosy the holy land would not be in such peril he stopped so abruptly that the others looked up in surprise when he leaped to his feet they followed his example for they now saw what had drawn his attention the woman just entering the hall in recent hours clemencia and matilde had made brief appearances to report on the progress of the birthing assuring the men that all was going as it ought but at the sight of constances mother a stir swept the hall for surely her presence must mean the child had been born margarets visage gave away nothing of her thoughts she looked tired yet composed but then she favored them with a smile resplendent enough to light the hall my daughter she said has given birth to a fine healthy son and after that there was such chaos that the rest of her words were drowned out margaret could still hear the clamor as she left the hall by the sound of it theyd be celebrating until dawn she thought and why not god had been good to brittany this easter night good to her daughter but as soon as she reentered constances chamber she discovered thered been a dramatic development shed left her daughter exhausted and pale smiling at her son now constance was crumpled upon her bed sobbing so despairingly that her entire body was trembling while the other women clustered around her in dismay madame juvette greeted her with obvious relief she just began weeping of a sudden and weve been unable to console her marveling that the girl sounded so surprised margaret took charge soon had the chamber cleared of all but the midwife who was bathing the baby skirting the overturned birthing stool she sat on the bed and gathered her daughter into her arms you go ahead dearest and cry she said soothingly youve earned the right after a time constances shudders eased her breathing no longer as ragged and choked raising her wet face from her mothers lap she regarded margaret with swollen dark eyes i was so happy maman but then she swallowed with difficulty hiccupped and struggled to sit up margaret slid a supportive arm around her shoulders helping her onto the pillows before she rose and brought a wine cup back to the bed watching as constance obediently took a few sips i would have been astonished if youd not given way to tears constance as great as your joy is how could it not be bittersweet you have what you most wanted in this worlda son a son that geoffrey will never get to see or hold or protect you cannot exalt in what youve gained without mourning what youve lost that made sense to constance yes she said huskily wiping away the last of her tears with the corner of the sheet and margaret looked over at the midwife standing a few feet away with the newly swaddled infant when she nodded the midwife approached the bed and gently handed him to constance geoffrey had often called aenor his perfect little pearl and constance thought now that their son was perfect too a warm breathing blessing in her arms a miraculous reprieve for her duchy the midwife stepped back beaming have you chosen a name madame constance smiled drowsily i was favoring margaret for a daughter geoffrey for a son but then my fatherinlaw the english king sent us word that if the baby was a boy he would like him to be named henry in his honor she glanced up briefly finding it difficult to take her eyes away from her babys face after that my lords and i knew there could be but one name for my son we shall name him after a great breton king we shall call him arthur the french king demanded the wardship of arthur as he had done with the infant dukes sisters and he insisted too that henry stop richard from making war upon his vassal the count of toulouse philippe then ordered the arrest of any of henrys subjects found in his domains and henry responded by arresting the french kings subjects skirmishing erupted in the vexin and an april meeting between the two kings resolved nothing both sides prepared for war henry divided up his army giving separate commands to richard john geoff and william de mandeville philippe mustered his army at bourges and in june he invaded berry an ongoing source of contention between the french kings and the dukes of aquitaine john had long known he was uncomfortable in small or enclosed spaces but he discovered in june that the worst sort of confinement was to be trapped in a castle under siege sent south by henry to counter the threat in berry he and richard had set up command in the castle at chateauroux and soon found themselves fending off an assault by the french army this was johns first taste of a siege and so far he didnt care much for the experience it bothered him more than hed expected to know he was a hostage of sorts like a trout in a fish weir he thought morosely he was not truly worried that the castle might fall to philippe for theyd sent word to henry of their plight richard would have been his last choice of company in a castle under siege though moreover he was soon utterly bored for he did not share the pleasure richard seemed to take in manning the castles defenses hed heard of sieges lasting for months how had such beleaguered men not gone stark mad out of the sheer tedium of their days he knew he should try to sleep for with daybreak the bombardment would begin again he was too restless to stay in his bedchamber though and eventually wandered over to the great hall hoping that he might find some men still awake a dice game seemed as good a way as any to pass the hours the hall was crowded with knights and soldiers sleeping on pallets and blankets using their boots as pillows rushlights still burned in wall sconces casting a smoky pall over air already stale and sweltering because of the shuttered windows but a handful of men were still up shooting dice in a corner albeit without much enthusiasm john headed toward them only to stop when he spotted his brother richard was by himself in a windowseat softly plucking the strings of a small harp so you cannot sleep either he commented so amiably that john found himself pausing for most of the time his older brother treated him with offhand indifference or outright condescension why are you not abed he asked for richard had passed a very demanding day when not up on the battlements he was overseeing their mangonels checking upon the wounded handing out casual compliments to soldiers who actedto johns annoyanceas if his words were gold prowling the castle like a sheepdog keeping a watchful eye out for predators determined to keep the flock safe my bodys tired enough richard acknowledged but my brain will not slow down i keep thinking of possible weaknesses in our defenses or wondering how long our supplies will last or worrying that some of the sentries are too sleepy to stay alert you think they might try a night assault i would in philippes place but i doubt that he has the ballocks for it john sat down across from richard in the windowseat although he wasnt sure why you think our father will get here soon richard continued to strum the harp but he gave john a curious look you are joking right nowhy because you are trapped with me of course now if it were just me he might be sorely tempted to take his time but for you hell be killing horses in his haste to get here he laughed but john remembered that geoffrey had occasionally told bald truths in the guise of humor and he wondered if that were true for richard too he started to remind his brother that their father had often ridden to his rescue in the past but the words that emerged from his mouth seemed to come of their own volition do you hate me for that richard blinked for what john had been as surprised as richard by what hed said he was committed now though and had no choice but to continue for papa favoring me over you richard didnt seem to have given the matter much thought before he was quiet for a moment considering no he finally said i cannot say i was overly fond of hal or geoffrey but i hold no grudge against you lad why not john demanded feeling somehow insulted by his brothers lack of rancor i did invade your duchy after all richard was starting to look amused far be it from me to deny you the credit for that bit of treachery you just assumed that it was all geoffreys doing john said accusingly the way papa did as if i could not possibly have formed the intent upon my own even after you mocked me like that when did i mock you that day at le mans when papa said aquitaine was mine if i could take it you looked me up and down and then laughed did i ill take your word for it johnny if it makes you feel better though i never imagined geoffrey had dragged you along at knifepoint the reason i am willing to let bygones be bygones is because you were all ofwhat sixteen it was only to be expected that youd act like a damned fool god knows i did at sixteen john did not share his amusement i was seventeen he said sullenly in that moment realizing that he resented richards indulgence more than his hostility he also realized that he did not like to be called johnny not by richard richard had gone back to his song frowning as he tried several chords when he was finally satisfied he glanced up saying how does that sound to you but john was gone henry proved richard right by reaching chateauroux in record time philippe raised the siege but to the surprise of all he did not retreat and with two armies separated only by the waters of the river indre it began to look as if a battle was inevitable this was uncommon for battles were usually a commanders action of last resort sensible men were not eager to submit themselves to the judgment of the almighty and a decisive battle seemed to prove that the victor had god on his side most people preferred not to put the lords favor to such a stringent conclusive test nor were the barons of either army keen to fight with one another for many had kin and friends in the opposing camps these men did their best to persuade henry and philippe to resolve their differences by more reasonable means so too did the numerous clerics and prelates accompanying both armies for the church did not want to see two such powerful christian kings at war when the real enemy was to be found in the holy land in this way a fortnight dragged by with highborn messengers shuttling back and forth between encampments with proposals and counterproposals no real progress had been made however and the fate of many continued to depend upon the whims of two strongwilled unpredictable kings richard had just returned to his tent and his squire was helping him to remove his hauberk when he was informed that the count of flanders had ridden in under a flag of truce asking to confer with him richard swore and then sighed for by now he was thoroughly disgusted with the mummery masquerading as peace negotiations he was tempted to tell philip to go away but he knew of course that he could not do that and he directed that the count be brought to his tent he was somewhat surprised when philip had his men wait outside and as soon as they were seated he could not resist a sardonic gibe at the flemish rulers expense since you want to speak in private should i assume cousin that you are thinking of switching sides there is little love lost between you and philippe after all philip gave him a sharp look and then smiled somewhat sourly true enough my relationship with the french king is almost as stormy as yours with the english king taking a taste of his wine he nodded approvingly it would be a shame to see your poitevin vineyards go up in flames when you can produce wines like this look richard lets speak plainly your interests are not being well served if this standoff results in a bloody battle despite your fathers gamesplaying we both know england will eventually be yours but so will normandy and anjou is it truly wise to make an enemy of the man who will be your liege lord what would you suggest instead that i betray my father to court favor with philippe youre losing your touch cousin if this is your idea of subtlety shall i also renounce my christian faith whilst i am at it philips smile did not waver even as he marveled to himself that the genial hal and this man could have come from the same womb sheathe your sarcasm cousin i am asking only that you talk directly with the french king see if you can persuade him he will gain little and risk much by taking to the battlefield i in turn will do what i can to get your father to see reason adding wryly and may god have mercy upon us both richard had been acquainted with philippe capet since the latter was four but as he studied the french king he realized that he did not really know the younger man they had little in common philippe was stiffnecked and judgmental disapproved of swearing had shown little interest in those pleasures that other men enjoyed he denounced tournaments disapproved of gambling and minstrels and troubadours and did not even hunt much because he disliked horses to richard a superb rider and swordsman who loved music and swore like a sailor philippe seemed as alien as a carthusian monk but he knew philip of flanders was right he would eventually have to deal with this man and so it made sense to find out more about him so far theyd been dodging and weaving using polite language and courtesy to guard their real thoughts and richard was growing tired of evasions and ambiguity as he looked into the french kings pale blue eyes he saw what his brother geoffrey had also seena cool calculating intelligence making up his mind then he said lets talk about my real reason for being here you and my lord father are far from fools so i assume you will eventually agree to a truce how much longer must we wait what makes you think i am bluffing although philippes tone was composed richard noticed that his hands had briefly clenched upon the arms of his chair so the french king was sensitive to slights upon his manhood he marked that down as a useful fact to know and set his wine cup aside leaning forward in his seat you are bluffing for the same reason that my father is bluffing because neither one of you wants to risk all upon one throw of the dice i am paying you a compliment for no capable commander commits his men to a pitched battle unless he is confident he will win or he has no other choice hellfire philippe even i do not want to fight at chateauroux and you know what they say of methat i get drunk on bloodlust the way other men do on wine philippe looked taken aback but when richard grinned at him he grinned back lets talk then he agreed about how your father and i save face and come away with enough to satisfy us both and when this is done i would like you to visit parisas my honored guest i got to know both hal and geoffrey would like to know you better too i daresay you do richard thought for what better weapons can you have against my father than his own sons i will give it serious consideration he promised and as soon as he said it he realized that he meant it so if i agree to let philippe hold on to the castles he took at issoudun and freteval he will agree to a twoyear truce when richard confirmed it henry regarded him skeptically and what do i get out of it you get what you want richard said impatiently a chance to defer your reckoning with philippe that is your favorite tactic after all papadelay and delay and delay again it has served you well in the past think how long youve managed to keep philippe in suspense over alys and the vexin are you telling me that you now want to wed the girl or that youre willing to hand over the vexin i was not being critical of your stratagem richard insisted of course i am not willing to yield the vexin to philippe and since i have no great interest in wedding alys what else can we do but put philippe off what i am saying is what we both know that you do not want to meet the french army on the field so how much time are you willing to waste here whilst you and philippe swap threats of course we can always go with one suggestion being bandied aboutthat you resolve your differences by choosing your best knights to joust on your behalf the last i heard men were proposing philip of flanders henri of champagne and the count of hainault as the french champions and will marshal your friend de mandeville and me as yours by now henry and richard were both laughing for in that they were in full agreement that war was not a game and ought not to be treated like one very well henry said let him keep those damned castlesat least for now ive matters to deal with in brittany cannot spend the rest of the summer camping out here in berry henry paused then looking pensively at his son we can accomplish a great deal when we are united richard if there is trust between us what could we not do together if that was meant as an olive branch richard made no move to grasp it yes he said trust is essential but he knew better for he knew the old man would never trust him once that awareness had hurt but no more he no longer cared if he had his fathers trust or respect he wanted only what was his birthright to be openly acknowledged as the heir to the english throne and he meant to do whatever he must to secure his legacystarting with a trip to paris leon was one of the most remote inaccessible areas of brittany and its viscount had liked to boast that he feared neither god nor man hed long posed a threat to ducal control of brittany and more than once henry had led campaigns to quell his rebellions hed eventually broken faith one time too many and geoffrey had seized the barony compelling the viscount to make a penitential pilgrimage to atone for a lifetime of spectacular sins and disinheriting his sons upon geoffreys death in paris the sons promptly rebelled again capturing two ducal strongholds after concluding the truce with philippe henry led an army into brittany and retook the castles he then visited nantes in order to see his grandson henry was cradling arthur in his arms looking for the moment more like a doting grandfather than the man who cast such a formidable shadow over brittany constance was neither charmed nor placated by this glimpse of her fatherinlaws softer side and had to dig her nails into her palm to resist the urge to snatch her son out of his grasp the breton barons were just as unhappy and like their duchess more angry than grateful for his punitive expedition into leon as his campaign only underscored their subordination to the english crown not that they needed a reminder for after geoffreys death henry had dismissed raoul de fougeres as seneschal of brittany and replaced him with the angevin lord maurice de craon arthur a curious lively baby seemed content in this strangers embrace but constance was reaching her breaking point and signaled to the nurse hoping henry would take the hint he did and reluctantly handed his grandson over to the woman saying to constance i think he looks like geoffrey dont you yes constances elder daughter was tugging at henrys tunic hed brought lavish gifts for the children an expensive ivory rattle carved wooden tops whistles felt puppets balls and poupees for the girls one of linen and the other of wood with yellow yarn hair and their own wardrobe what had won aenor over though was his willingness to kneel on the ground and show her how to spin the tops now she brandished her favorite new toy a leather ball stuffed with wool and dyed a bright shade of red entreating her grandfather to play catch with her before constance could intervene henry assured aenor hed like nothing better and clasping her little hand in his he suggested that he and constance take a stroll in the gardens this did not meet with the approval of her barons who had been sticking closer to their duchess than her own shadow but henry had already started for the door matching his pace to aenors toddlers steps and constance had no choice but to follow the day was overcast without even a hint of a breeze for so far september had been as humid and sultry as august with constances spaniel leading the way they crossed the castle bailey and entered the gardens fragrant with the last flowering of summer blossoms constance settled upon a turf bench watching with a stiff smile as her daughter and the english king tossed the ball back and forth he showed surprising patience with the little girl continuing to play until she lost interest and began to throw the ball for the spaniel only then did he return to constance and drew her to her feet saying that they could talk as they walked they circled the grassy mead in silence for constance was not able to feign pleasure in his company she thought he should count himself lucky that she managed to be civil henry paused in the shade of a pear tree for it afforded them a good view of aenor but was distant enough to allow them to speak privately i have been dealing with the duchess he said but now i would talk with my daughterinlaw you have never liked me constance and in all honesty you have not given me much reason to be fond of you either but we share a common interest that matters more than our personal ill will yesthe duchy of brittany he ignored her sarcasm that too but i am speaking about your children my grandchildren their future is inextricably entwined with that of the duchy and i want to make sure that they do not suffer because of adult missteps or mistakes what mistakes do you have in mind for one the decision geoffrey and you made to ally yourselves with the french king henrys voice was even his face impassive as if he were speaking of mundane matters not the rebellion of his son as a stratagem it had much to recommend it with one great flaw it had hopes of success only if geoffrey lived to carry it out without him you were likely to find yourself at philippes mercy and that is indeed what happened constance said nothing and after a moment he resumed philippe has made his intentions very clear he means to deprive you of both legal and physical custody of your children he will send the girls off to live in the households of their future husbands men he will handpick for them i would expect him to keep arthur in paris ruling on his behalf until he comes of age for your duchy that will be more than twenty years with philippes hand firmly on the helm twenty years in which to mold your son into a ruler whod put the interests of france above those of brittany as for you hell marry you off as quickly as possible to a man of his sole choosing possibly even one of inferior rank since his primary concern will be the loyalty of your new husband and you can expect to live out your days on a remote manor far from the breton borders constance could stand no more for he was giving voice to all the fears that had haunted her nights since geoffreys death i know she said sharply i know full well what i would have to look forward tothe loss of my children and my duchy and a miserable marriage to one of philippes lackeys this is what always happens is it not what highborn widow gets the wardship of her own children even my mother the dowager duchess of brittany sister to the scots king when her english husband died the custody of their young son was not given to her why should i care whether my life is ruined by english or by french doing what difference does it make to me because it need not be that way i do not want to take your children away from you and i am to believe that saint henry champion of widows and orphans say what you intend for me for brittany but do not insult my intelligence too why should i expect any more justice from you than i can from philippe because these are my grandchildren of my blood can you truly doubt what family means to me surely ive proven it each time that i forgave my sons for betraying me yet again as i would have forgiven geoffrey for his conniving with the french king he was no longer dispassionate his voice rising and aenor stopped playing to look toward them in concern all is well sweeting constance said hastily and they both mustered up reassuring smiles for her benefit turning back to henry she said quietly you say you do not want to take my children away what does that mean exactly it means that they remain with you i want what is best for them andand i know it is what my son would have wanted this is what i am proposing constance you retain the custody of arthur aenor and matilda the corner of his mouth curved in a hinted smile arthur eleanor how did you ever let matilda slip in there im surprised you did not call her melisande since you seem to enjoy picking names sure to vex me geoffrey wanted to name matilda after his sister she said simply for she was not up to trading barbs with him not now you say i can keep my children with me and where would we all be england ruling brittany from england would not make a great deal of sense he heard her swift intake of breath and said i expect you to continue to govern brittany on arthurs behalf i also expect of course that youll be willing to be guided by my counsel when necessary and you would expect me to wed a man of your choosing naturally i do not think you will be disappointed with my choice though for he is very highborn my cousin in fact he holds a rich earldom in england but he also has vast estates in brittany so the match makes sense moreover he is a fine lad clever and courtly and ought to make a satisfactory husband a kind stepfather you are talking about the earl of chester when he nodded she blurted out buthe is just a boy fifteen or sixteen he is seventeen i intend to knight him at years end so he will be eighteen or nigh on to it by the time of your marriage i was thinking of a date sometime in february ere the start of lent and i assume you would prefer that the ceremony be held in brittany when she did not respond he reached out and tilted her chin up so that their eyes met i understand that you might not be ready to wed again lass unfortunately it is too dangerous to let you remain unmarried for long if you were to fall into philippes hands all our plans would be set at naught if he were able to marry you off to one of his lackeys as you so aptly put it he released her then and stepped back i daresay you want to give it some thought youll want to consult with your barons too of course not trusting her voice she merely nodded but he did not press her for more she sank down upon the edge of the freestone fountain as he crossed to her daughter bent over to whisper in the little girls ear he then continued on along the pathway as aenor came running toward her with the dog yipping at her heels grandpapa said you wanted to give me a hug constance gathered the child into her arms holding her so tightly that aenor soon started to squirm protesting i cannot breathe maman i am sorry poppet aenor stayed on her mothers lap turning so she could splash her fingers in the fountain and constance watched her play smoothing back the childs chestnut curls when she whispered a name though aenor looked up her expression quizzical are you talking to papa i talk to him a lot maman i am glad you do aenor constance smiled at her daughter a smile that was edged in selfmockery what was she going to do ask for advice from a dead man what did she expect geoffrey to tell her she already knew what she must dowhat was best for her children and her duchy the spaniel had begun to bark and she glanced up saw raoul de fougeres and andre de vitre coming toward her she took several deliberate breaths then rose to her feet and went to meet them henry had been shocked and alarmed when richard departed chateauroux in the company of the french king but worse was to come reports soon came from paris about the newfound friendship of the two men reports of a growing intimacy that could only bode ill for the english crown henry did his best to coax richard away from the french court and when his messengers went unanswered he delayed his planned return to england by now his spies were warning him that philippe had persuaded richard his inheritance was in peril that his father planned to disinherit him in favor of john claiming that a plan was afoot to marry alys to john richards response was swift and characteristic leaving paris he rode for chinon where he seized the treasury and then withdrew into poitou to fortify his castles henry eventually prevailed upon him to discuss their problems in person and they held a tense meeting in angers not long after henrys return from brittany he was able to convince his son that philippes charges were untrue and richard then did homage to him again no one believed that a true and lasting reconciliation had been achieved though not even henry but events were occurring in the holy land that were to have a profound effect upon the angevin empire in july guy de lusignan had been lured into a disastrous battle against saladin the result was a catastrophic defeat for the christian army guy was taken prisoner over a thousand of his twelve hundred knights were either slain or captured the knights of the military orders of the templars and the hospitallers were executed and saladin captured the most sacred of relics the holy cross word of the battle at the horns of hattin reached europe by october pope urban iii died of a seizure upon hearing the news and his successor at once urged another crusade to rescue the holy land and the city of jerusalem richard learned of the defeat in early november the next morning he sought out the archbishop of tours and took the cross henrys multitude of enemies commented that he seemed more distraught by his sons action than he did by the news of saladins victory william de mandeville wrapped himself in a blanket and slid out of bed caen castle was filled to overflowing with guests attending henrys christmas court but willems rank and friendship with the king guaranteed him one of the better accommodations and the chamber was spacious heated by a wall fireplace that was now burning low willems squires were stretched out on pallets close by the hearth theirs the sound sleep of young men whod downed more than their share of wine during the course of the evening he hadnt the heart to awaken them and foraged for himself until he found a flagon of wine and a loaf of manchet bread hastening back to the bed with his windfall bless you his wife proclaimed eagerly breaking off a chunk of the bread i ought not to be so hungry for i ate a goodly amount of food at supper tonight but i feel as if ive not had a decent meal in days im glad to be of service willem said with a smile for it amused him that hawisa who was as slender as a willow wand had an appetite that would have put a burly quarryman to shame i am glad too that you are here for the christmas court that was not something he could take for granted as hawisa had a mind of her own and was not one to be summoned like other more docile wives he supposed it was to be expected that a great heiress was strongwilled and because he was easygoing by nature her assertiveness had rarely caused troubles in their marriage all in all he was very satisfied with the wife that henry had given him marveling that their eighth anniversary was not far off i am very glad that youre here he repeated and handed her the wine cup she took a swallow and then gave him a wineflavored kiss sotell me all the gossip is the king still swiving that wench with the red hair is it true that young chester is going to wed the duchess of brittany what sort of devilment has john been up to in caen have you heard how the french kings baby is faring they say he is as sickly and pitiful as a stray kitten and i doubt that philippe will get many more off that little queen of his i heard that she almost bled to death expelling the afterbirth she paused for another swallow of wine and another quick kiss and is it true that the king was in a tearing rage when he was told that richard had taken the cross i heard that he would not come out of his chamber for days just like when archbishop thomas was slain willem chose to address her last query first reaching over to steady her grip on the wine cup that is not so the king was not happy about itill not deny that and he did some brooding for a few days but he was not so much angered as he was troubled he was also vexed of course that richard had done this without consulting him first if he thinks richard will ever be as biddable as john he is blinder than old peter my almoner some hawks are too wild to be tamed can never be broken to the creance and jesses hawisa devoted herself then to eating the bread but was soon ready to resume her interrogation of her husband i know you have a great fondness for the king love and ill not deny he has been right good to you but i do not understand why he has so little interest in the holy land most men would be proud that their son had taken the cross as richard did as i recall he was not happy when hal took the cross either and he would not let john go back with the patriarch of jerusalem nor has he fulfilled his own vow to go on pilgrimage to atone for the archbishops death this was their one serious bone of contention that hawisa did not see the king as willem did he did not want another argument on the subject but he could not keep a defensive note from entering his voice yes harry did vow to take the cross but soon after his sons and queen rebelled and he could hardly leave then could he and since then his kingdom has been in ferment thanks to those same sons he has been extremely generous though with his financial support has given the vast sum of thirty thousand silver marks for the defense of the holy land yes but you told me once that the money is being held by the templars and hospitallers cannot be dispensed without the kings consent is that not like giving a gift with the proviso that you can always change your mind and take it back indeed it is not the bulk of the money was to be spent when the king was able to travel himself to the holy land in any event guy de lusignan and his barons drew heavily upon the funds this year to increase their army in the face of saladins growing threat and that was a great success hawisa said caustically i daresay the king considers that money well spent i assume the rest of it is being used to defend jerusalem and harry would never begrudge a penny of that willem insisted seeing that his wife did not look convinced he said you cannot blame the king for fearing for the safety of his sons in so dangerous a place as outremer and as it happens i did ask him why he was not more concerned about the threat to the holy land hawisas eyes brightened with interest did you now and what did he say he gave me one of those looks of his where he cannot believe anyone could ask so foolish a question and then he said of course i care about the fate of the kingdom of jerusalem but i care more about the fate of the kingdom of england chapter fiftyone january gisors normandy henry was at barfleur waiting for favorable winds when he learned of the french kings new threats it seemed that philippe was no more pleased than henry by richards decision to take the cross for he was warning that richard must wed alys before he departed for the holy land or gisors must be returned at once to the french crown if not he would lay waste to normandy henry reluctantly delayed his return to england and agreed to confer with philippe at their traditional meeting place the ancient elm tree near gisors castle henry was not sanguine about their chances of reaching an accord he could not really blame philippe for in the latters place hed have been making the same demands but he was not about to yield up gisors for he was convinced the vexin was rightfully part of normandy neither he nor richard wanted the marriage though richard had never shown any interest in alys and henry had learned to his cost how dangerous a marital alliance with the french was for he was convinced that hal would not have been so easily led into rebellion had he not been the french kings soninlaw the last thing he wanted was to give philippe an opportunity to suborn another one of his sons he felt some pity for alys but if the price of her freedom was the loss of the vexin or outright war it was too high to pay a king must do what was best for his realm the conference started badly with philippe insisting at the onset that thered be no compromises on this issue and henry saw they were in for a long difficult day only half listening to arguments hed heard many times before he found his attention wandering to the crowd of onlookers eager to watch the spectacle of two kings in conflict to the lowering winter sky that was threatening snow and then to approaching riders even at a distance he could see they were well mounted and richly garbed his gaze drawn to a man wearing a stiff linen miter that marked him as a prince of the church no longer even making a pretense of listening to philippe henry watched as they dismounted the spectators parting to let them pass the prelate was resplendent in a blue chasuble and purple dalmatic both of finely spun silk brandishing a crozier with a delicate ivory crook but his face was unfamiliar by now philippe had paused to watch too and shook his head when henry asked is he one of yours identification came from the count of flanders i know him he exclaimed in surprise we met in the holy landjoscius the bishop of acre no henry corrected for hed spotted the lambs wool pallium around the mans shoulders hes no longer a bishop cousin were being honored by a visit from the archbishop of tyre greetings were prolonged for the archbishop was accompanied by a number of highranking churchmen and the two kings by many of their lords and barons but once the amenities had been observed the archbishop drew philippe henry and philip aside and shared with them the heavy burden hed been carrying since leaving outremer that autumn as dire as the news of the battle at the horns of hattin had been this was far worse after a brief siege the holy city of jerusalem had been captured by the saracens as word began to spread the grieving swept through the crowd like a rogue wave engulfing men and women alike people wept openly cursed aloud fell to their knees on the frozen ground to pray it had been less than a hundred years since the first crusaders had retaken jerusalem for christendom but no one had expected the city to fall to the infidels surely the almighty would never let such an atrocity happen the kings and their highborn vassals were no less stunned than the spectators the count of flanders was striding up and down slamming his fist into his palm again and again philippe was making the archbishop repeat the story as if he expected the ending to change upon hearing it again and henrys shock was giving way to horror for he was a student of history and he knew what had happened when jerusalem had been captured by the christian army in gods year it had been a massacre men women and children alike were shown no mercy and it was reported that the bodies of the slain muslims and jews had been stacked up in the streets like kindling and knights rode in blood up to their horses ankles the archbishop was still occupied with philippe and henry beckoned to one of his companions clad in the distinctive red cross and white mantle of the knights templar the warrior monks who prided themselves upon being the soldiers of god tell me the worst he demanded how many died when jerusalem fell to saladin to his amazement the knight shook his head there was no slaughter of the citizens are you saying that saladin allowed the city to surrender peacefully this time the templar nodded balian de ibelin the lord of nablus was commanding the defense of jerusalem when he saw they were doomed he went to saladin under a truce and asked to be permitted to surrender saladin refused reminding him of the thousands of muslims whod died when the christians had taken the city lord balian warned him that if they had nothing left to lose they would kill all of the muslim prisoners they held then they would destroy the dome of the rock and all the holy places in the city those sacred to christians and muslims both and burn jerusalem to the ground saladin then agreed to ransom the citizens you saved thousands from slavery or death my lord king me ahbalian paid for the ransoms with the money id provided for the holy land yes my liege we paid ten dinars for a man five for a woman and two for a child the knight paused for it was not easy to speak well of his infidel enemies not after the blood of his brother templars had flowed so freely at the horns of hattin but he was an honorable man and felt compelled to admit that they did show some mercy saladin protected patients at the hospital of st john and he freed hundreds at lord balians behest and spared the elderly his brother asked him for a thousand christians and then set them free about seven thousand men and eight thousand women and children were still sold as slaves with your money though we were able to buy the freedom for seven thousand of the citys poor thank god for that henry said softly he was pragmatic by nature and could take comfort from the fact that it could have been so much worse as he looked around though he saw that few would see the loss of jerusalem in that light for them all that mattered was that the holy city was now in the hands of the infidels and it was only then that he realized what this dreadful defeat would mean for him he glanced quickly toward philippe saw that the french king had not yet recognized how adroitly theyd been ambushed and he smiled grimly philippe would not long remain in ignorance and indeed archbishop joscius was already stepping forward it is only fitting that i speak to the people tell them what has occurred he said and gestured to some of his companions who began to shout for silence when the throng finally quieted he took up a jeweled cross and raised it high behold the cross of our salvation he cried in a rich resonant voice that confirmed henrys suspicions the archbishop was a polished orator but alas this is not the most precious of christendoms holy relics this is not the fragment of the true cross that was stolen by the infidels at the horns of hattin and weve heard it was paraded through the streets of damascus to jeers and mockery he paused for his audience to react and then held his hand up to quiet them when i was chosen to tell the holy father in rome of the dreadful calamity that has befallen us our galley had black sails so that all would know we were the bearers of evil tidings everywhere on our journey we have left wailing and lamentations in our wake men and women of faith cried out to mary mother of mercy we poor banished children of eve mourning and weeping in this vale of tears again he flourished the cross aloft you know those words of the salve regina have sung it in our churches for the feasts of the purification annunciation and nativity of our lady but how many of you know its origin how many know it was composed by the bishop of puyenvelay or that he was the first to take the cross from pope urban of blessed memory for that is the message i bring to you this day good people the time for tears is past more is demanded of you of us all because of our sins the enemy of the cross has devastated with the sword the promised land has dared to invade the holy city itself but we must not lose faith for when god almighty has been soothed by our repentance he will bring us gladness after our grief i say to you he thundered turning suddenly to face the assembled kings and nobles you soldiers of hell become soldiers of the living god it is christ himself who issues from his tomb and presents to you his cross wear it upon your shoulders it will remind you that christ died for you and that it is your duty to die for him so said pope urban when he first called upon men to take the cross his plea is echoed by our holy father today he has charged me to remind you of your duty as sons of the faith and to those who undertake this quest with a humble heart and who die in repentance for their sins he promises a plenary indulgence for all their sins and eternal life the crowd was cheering wildly now but he never took his eyes from his true audience the men of rank and power the two kings and their vassals who will answer the call who will come to the defense of zion who will free the holy city from men who do not know god henry looked around appraisingly philippe appeared impassive showing the public stoicism expected of royalty but a muscle was twitching in his cheek the duke of burgundy and the counts of flanders blois champagne sancerre and ponthieu were listening to the archbishop with as much outrage as the prelate could have wished henry was sure theyd be trampling one another in their eagerness to answer the archbishops call but now all eyes were turning to him and to his adversary the french king suppressing a sigh henry stepped forward and in silence utterly remarkable for such a large crowd he knelt before the archbishop i henry by gods grace king of the english duke of normandy and aquitaine count of anjou do hereby pledge myself to the recovery of the holy city my lord archbishop i ask to be allowed to enter the way of god and to take the cross from your hand there was a roar from those watching as loud a sound as henry had ever heard and within moments the field was echoing with the chant that had launched the first crusade even those who knew no latin but the response to the mass knew this the battle cry of their church deus vult god wills it nothing would give me greater pleasure my lord king the archbishop said smoothly as one of his archdeacons appeared at his side crusader crosses were usually small and crudely cut from whatever cloth was available the one that the archbishop offered henry now was of fine linen embroidered with gold thread the eyes of the two men caught and held henry conveying an ironic appreciation of the archbishops tactical talents and the latter offering an equally ironic acknowledgment of the unspoken compliment and then henry rose and raised his cross high for all to see setting off another spate of cheering philippe stepped forward hastily then giving henry a look sharp enough to stab before he knelt and he too asked for the cross philip of flanders could barely contain himself rushing toward the archbishop as soon as philippe was done followed by maries son the young count of champagne his uncle the count of blois the duke of burgundy and other men of rank jostling as they awaited their turns so many men sought to answer the archbishops call that he dispatched the other prelates to accept these vows and for a time there was considerable chaos an emotional day became even more so when some people cried out that they saw a cross shimmering in the sky above them and this celestial sign of divine providence encouraged even more men to volunteer for gods army the response was so great that the more practicalminded among them suggested that crosses be assigned according to realm and it was soon agreed that the men of flanders would bear green crosses the french would bear red ones and henrys vassals would wear white it was some time before the archbishop had a moment to himself and he accepted gratefully when one of his archdeacons proffered a wineskin for by then his throat was sore and his voice hoarse he could not remember ever being so exhausted both physically and emotionally nor could he ever remember feeling such a sense of peace the bishop of tripoli had joined him saying i confess i did not see the cross in the sky myself by the time i looked it was gone but none would argue that this has been a day for miracles the archbishop glanced at his friend and then across the field where the kings of england and france were being mobbed by their supporters the greatest miracle he said with a smile was getting those two to take the cross constance knew she was sprinkling salt into an open wound but she could not seem to help herself lying awake in the dark of a cold february night sharing her bed with a stranger she could not keep her memories at bay could not stop comparing her two wedding days she remembered well how unhappy shed been as she struggled to play the role of geoffreys blushing bride looking back upon it she realized that her barons had not shared her discontent by then theyd had six years to take geoffreys measure had a better idea of the man she was marrying than she did this time around the bretons and she were of one mindembittered that the english king had forced his own man upon them theyd not bothered to make much of a pretense of amiability either proof that they expected the young earl of chesters influence to be limited in scope the duchy was bilingual with breton and french both in widespread use the breton tongue was more likely to be heard in the western areas such as leon lords such as the de vitres and the barons of fougeres were native frenchspeakers as constance herself was but the wedding feast had resonated with the sounds of breton an effective means of isolating their new duke for randolph of chester spoke only french he had spent enough time in brittany though to understand the insult he was being offered by his wifes vassals randolph stirred and constance stiffened listening intently until his soft even breathing assured her that he still slept even though their initial coupling had not been a success giving her no pleasure and him very little she knew that with youths of eighteen the flesh was always willing and a naked woman in his bed would be a temptation he was not likely to resist his eagerness had been part of their problem she could tell he was embarrassed by how quickly hed spilled his seed geoffrey had taught her well and she could easily have shown him those tricks a man could use to prolong his pleasure but why should she shed wanted only to get it over with as quickly as possible for it had been harder than shed expectedhaving to submit to the wrong mans intimate caresses her mind may have accepted the unwelcome reality of her marriage but her body still felt violated it had not helped that shed felt geoffreys presence so strongly that her memories had been so merciless it was too easy to envision geoffrey watching from the shadows offering a sardonic commentary on randolphs lovemaking she knew she had to exorcise him from her head and heart if there was any hope of reaching an accord with her new husband she knew too that she might even feel a flicker of pity for randolph if she let herself for he was laboring under some severe handicapsthrust into a land that was not his own having to cope with vassals who did not want him there and a worldly older wife who did not want him either but if his plight was awkward what of her own widowed at twentyfive left with three young children to raise and protect on her own caught between the french and english kings like those ancient sailors forced to brave the perils of scylla and charybdis where was the fairness in that was it fair that geoffrey had died so needlessly that hed left his wife and family in such peril was it fair that she must now share her body and her bed with this callow lordling that she would never again know the pleasures to be found in a mans arms unlike her first wedding when shed abstained from wine to be sure shed be able to govern her tongue shed lost track of the cups shed drained this night hoping that if she were tipsy enough shed find it easier to submit to randolph it hadnt helped much she was definitely not sober but all that wine had done little to dilute her misery if she ever did get to sleep shed likely awaken in the morning with a wretched headache too what geoffrey had called the drunkards penance was he going to haunt her like this for the rest of her days go away geoffrey she entreated silently please go away do you truly want me to go away darling she knew it was not really his voice that was echoing in her ears but it sounded so real so like him no she whispered no and shut her eyes tightly as she tried to squeeze back her tears later in the month henry convened a council at le mans where it was decided that a tax would be levied upon a tenth of all the movable property and revenues of his subjects what would be known as the saladin tithe and would become extremely unpopular even among churchmen those who took the cross were exempt from the tithe any debts they owed were postponed until their return and their property was taken under the protection of the church men found themselves under increasing pressure to take the cross and those who did not were mocked and presented with distaff and wool as an obvious slur upon their manhood crusading fervor swept through christendom and rulers vowed to set their differences aside and unite for the defense of the holy land it was expected to take well over a year to make the necessary preparations but richard was not willing to wait that long and he sought henrys permission to raise money on the security of poitou and to receive public acknowledgment of his status as heir apparent before he departed but henry insisted that richard wait arguing that they should travel to the holy land together richards demand for official recognition was once more brushed aside richard was not dissuaded and began to make his own arrangements for an early departure it was then though that another rebellion broke out in poitou begun when a friend of richards was slain by joffroi de lusignan and quickly joined by the count of angouleme and geoffrey de rancon richard swooped down upon them once again captured the impregnable castle of taillebourg sparing the captured rebels only when they agreed to take the cross richard had little time to enjoy the resumption of peace in his duchy for his old enemy the count of toulouse seized this opportunity to make trouble maltreating poitevin merchants passing through his lands richard retaliated by capturing one of count raimons closest advisors and refusing all of the counts offers to ransom the man count raimon then arrested two english knights making their way home from a pilgrimage to santiago de compostela outraged by this sacrilegious attack upon pilgrims richard launched a major assault upon toulouse capturing seventeen castles with impressive speed and driving his army into the heart of raimons domains an alarmed french king then came to the defense of his liegeman and raided into berry to the dismay of the church and those men whod pledged to recover the holy city the accord reached at gisors seemed about to go up in the smoke of burning towns in toulouse and berry july had been an inclement month so far and the castle at sarum was being buffeted by high winds and thunderstorms eleanor had been surprised by henrys unexpected arrival that week for sarum was out of his way he was planning to sail for normandy in response to the latest crisis and his fleet was awaiting him at portsea her transfer to sarum had shown eleanor that she was back in her husbands bad graces because of his deteriorating relationship with richard each time his son dared to defy him his suspicions invariably spilled over onto her too but during his brief stay at sarum shed come to the startling conclusion that hed made a deliberate detour in order to bid her farewell shed attempted to find out if he was ailing again to no avail no one was better than henry at giving evasive responses to questions he did not want to answer and she finally decided that as he aged he was coming to share the natural anxiety of all sensible people when making a channel crossing that theory lasted no longer than his announcement that he planned to sail if the winds were in his favor the rain and choppy seas notwithstanding gazing at her husband in exasperation she could only shake her head in feigned disbelief if it is your destiny to drown why do you need to give fate a helping hand her scolding sounded so familiar that henry could not help smiling since when have i let bad weather interfere with my plans have you forgotten that we sailed in a godawful storm to claim the english crown eleanor remembered that turbulent voyage all too well although it seemed so long ago that it might have happened to two other people knowing it was futile to argue once hed made up his mind she focused instead upon the crusaders emblem stitched to the shoulder of his mantle well they say the almighty looks after those whove taken the cross however halfheartedly they took their vows he was not offended by her gibe for eleanor was the only one with whom he could be truly honest about the crusade even with close friends like willem he could not confess his misgivings for willem had already undertaken one pilgrimage of his own and was eager to undertake another nor could he confide in his sons for richards crusading fever burned fiercely and he did not feel comfortable talking to john mantoman his instincts still to shelter his lastborn if you think i was halfhearted he said you ought to have seen philippe capet trying to hide his lack of enthusiasm i think he was convinced that id taken the cross just to spite him but one of the few advantages of aging is that you learn to recognize when defeat is staring you in the face wearing an archbishops miter not even merlin himself could have escaped that trap moving to the window he pulled the shutter back to gaze out at the dismal raindrenched bailey i do care about the recovery of jerusalem eleanor but i cannot help putting the interests of my own kingdom first philippe and i are struggling against the tide though and all we can do is try to stay afloat eleanor could sympathize for poitiers mattered more to her than the holy city moreover louiss disastrous crusade had raised doubts in her mind about the efficacy of such a quest it is not always easy to be a good christian and a good king unable to resist adding or a good father and a good king or to be a good mother and a good wife he shot back and she acknowledged his riposte with a wry smile that is not as difficult as you seem to think harry let me prove it let me tell you a simple way to resolve your differences with richard and restore peace both to our family and your empire he raised a brow can you also turn water into wine no nor can i turn a rebellious resentful son into a respectful contented one but you can harry and it would be so easy you need only make a public declaration that richard is your heir to be king after you that is all it would take you just proved my argument for me if i were foolish enough to take your advice richard would benefit greatly all at my expense if there were no longer any doubts about the succession id have no leverage at all no way to exert any influence over richard but youd not need leverage if you formally named richard as your heir for he would have no grievances then all he wants is his birthright as your eldest surviving son he is entitled to inherit the kingdom in his turn you need only say so without evasions or equivocations and you remove the main cause of contention between you id like to give you the benefit of the doubt assume that you honestly believe what youre saying how can i though when you know the sorry story of richards past history fully as well as i do does your memory really need refreshing eleanor must i remind you that last years nearwar with philippe ended with richard riding off with him to paris or that all reports had them acting closer than brothers have you forgotten what richard did next he rode to chinon seized the treasury i kept there and hastened into poitou to fortify all his castles against me henry had been endeavoring to sound matteroffact but he betrayed his inner agitation by the color rising in his face and that is not the half of it richard never fails to believe the worst of me indeed i think it gives him pleasure he nurses his suspicions the way a miser hoards his coins and nothing seems too farfetched for him to believe i have even heard that he suspects me of providing money to the poitevin rebels and the count of toulouse supposedly i am the mastermind behind all the strife in his duchy hoping to create enough unrest to keep him from going to the holy land oh my eleanor said biting her lip to keep from smiling you know that sounds just devious enough to have come from your brain harry i did nothing of the sort he snapped so indignantly that she could not doubt his sincerity on this much at least i believe you but you cannot blame richard for giving it some credence youve always been too clever by half harry and now you are reaping what youve sown youve spun such fine webs over the years that i suppose it was inevitable youd eventually ensnare yourself in one i am glad that you find this so amusing believe me my lord husband i find nothing even remotely amusing about any of this i will not deny that richard trusts you no more than you trust him but why is that because of your determination to keep him in suspense about his heritage because you gave him reason to think you were considering geoffrey in his stead and you continue to raise suspicions with the favor you show john because you even sought to take aquitaine away from him i meant to deprive him of nothing i was only trying to provide properly for johnny as any father would you keep blaming me for not acknowledging richard as my heir well i offered to do just that after hal died but richard scorned the offer surely the only man in christendom whod choose a duchy over a kingdom dear god in heaven eleanor was staring at him in dismay you have not given up on that have you you still hope to coax or coerce richard into yielding up aquitaine to john he was too angry to deny it what if i do as you delight in reminding me aquitaine is your legacy it makes more political sense to have it ruled by its own duke as brittany is if richard becomes king hell have little time for personal rule over that hornets nest of rebels and malcontents if richard becomes king that truly goes to the heart of the matter to your reluctance to anoint your successor the only thing worse than not learning from your mistakes is learning the wrong lessons richard is not hal and your refusal to see that may end up costing you dearly he glared at her then swung around to stalk out he halted at the door though standing motionless for a moment and then slamming his fist into the heavy oaken wood when he turned back to face her his mask was gone do you think i wanted it this way i loved my father dearly never imagined that my sons would not love me ah harry i lost hal and then geoffrey and richardhe was always yours never mine if it were not for johnnycan you not see why i want to do right by him he is all i have left she was shocked by what hed just done dropping his defenses to give her a glimpse of an open bleeding wound crossing the chamber she came into his arms he held her so tightly that it hurt and they stood like that for a timeless moment one in which they recognized all that still bound them together and mourned all that had been lost when henry released her and stepped back he was once more in control of himself i would ask you to come with me to the holy land he said lightly but it has been agreed that women are to be banned from the expedition save only laundresses of good character my legacy i daresay she said with a smile apparently the stories of my pilgrimage with louis have passed into legend he smiled too encouraging her to make one last attempt harry i am imploring you to give some thought to what ive said there is still time to make things right with richard shed half expected him to react in anger again instead he took her hand in his pressed his lips to her palm wondering if their marriage might have been different if shed given to him the utter unconditional loyalty that she gave to richard i hope richard realizes how fortunate he is to have you as his advocate she almost told him the truth that her fears were not for richard time was richards ally not his but she knew hed never forgive her if she admitted that she saw him now as the vulnerable one so she said only i will pray for your safe voyage to barfleur henry sailed in a violent storm but he found conditions no less turbulent upon his return to normandy and the rest of the summer was taken up with skirmishing raids threats and futile peace conferences at one held near gisors that august it went so badly that philippe angrily ordered the ancient elm tree be chopped down a second meeting in october at chatillonsurindre was no more successful it began promisingly with the agreement that philippe would return the gains hed made in berry and richard would relinquish his conquests in toulouse but then philippe demanded that henry surrender his castle at pacy as a good faith pledge and the council broke up in acrimony richards frustration grew by the day for he could not depart for the holy land as long as this sporadic war raged between england and france he received some unexpected support that autumn when the count of flanders the counts of blois and champagne and other french lords balked at continuing to wage war against their fellow crusaders and faced with the defection of a large part of his army philippe reluctantly agreed when richard proposed another peace council at bonsmoulins in november henry was willing too and richard set the plans in motion but he was determined to end this impasse one way or another and he had a secret parley with the french king before they were to gather at bonsmoulins c hapter f iftytwo november bonsmoulins normandy richards new chancellor guillaume de longchamp was meeting his duke at the cistercian abbey of la trappe not far from the conference site at bonsmoulins he was unpopular with richards knights partly because of their natural distrust of clerks and partly because of longchamps physical flaws the young men agreed that longchamp was one of the ugliest individuals theyd ever seen short and swarthy with closeset black eyes a flat nose and a receding chin moreover he was crippled lame in both legs and theirs was a world in which deformity was often seen as the outer manifestation of inner evil as the chancellor limped toward the abbey guest hall he was aware of the hostile scrutiny of a handful of richards knights he knew what was said of him that they referred to him behind his back as a dwarf and elf and gargoyle he knew too that they resented him all the more because he was not meek and obsequious because he refused to act like one of societys misfits he believed that his superior intellect mattered more than his physical defects and saw no reason why he must defer to these fortunate young men with handsome faces and healthy bodies and empty heads he could hear their muttering as he was admitted into richards presence without delay it vexed them no end that he stood so high in the dukes favor richard smiled at the sight of him come with me guillaume he directed we need to talk in private as he followed richard across the hall longchamp took satisfaction in the disgruntled expressions on the faces around him let them call him arrogant and presumptuous their enmity did not change the fact that he was the dukes confidant viewed as utterly trustworthy by a man who did not find it easy to trust once they were alone in richards chamber he waved his chancellor toward a seat even though he remained on his feet the only way that he ever indicated his awareness of longchamps physical frailty was by this casual concern for the older mans comfort acknowledging longchamps special needs without making a fuss about it it was as close as longchamp had come to acceptance in a life of rejection and he valued it almost as much as he did the chancellorship his ambition had drawn him to richard after an earlier stint as a chancery clerk but his fierce absolute loyalty was rooted in these small acts of unexpected kindness how did your meeting with the french king go my lord and when richard said it had gone well longchamp felt secure enough to venture a small jest has he forgiven you then for calling him a vile recreant at chatillonsurindre richard grinned hed have forgiven much worse guillaume i made an interesting discovery at mantes philippe is not only eager to ally himself with me he is downright desperate to bring it about he is a very clever lad the french king but he shares the same weakness that my father doesa tendency to undervalue his adversaries will he support you at the bonsmoulins conclave yes he will we are going to demand that my father formally recognize me as his heir i can no longer abide his infernal gamesplaying need to have this settled ere i can depart for the holy land if my foes think i may not become king theyll take advantage of my absence to stir up rebellions in aquitaine and start courting my little brothers favor in hopes of playing kingmaker do you truly think your lord father would dare to disinherit you in favor of john richard took his time in answering i am not sure guillaume i do not doubt that hed rather see john succeed him than me would he actually do it if he thought he could get away with it probably he must know that id never accept it though and johns reign would be the shortest in english history of course philippe swears by all the saints that there is no doubt whatsoever that he means to put john in my place even if it means war richard had been pacing as he talked stopping abruptly he glanced toward his chancellor with an expression longchamp could not easily read philippe never misses an opportunity to sing that song to hear him tell it my father spends every waking moment scheming to rob me of my rightful heritage but according to what i was told at mantes that is not exactly true apparently he found time to pay some nocturnal visits to my betrothed longchamp could not believe hed heard correctly ii am not sure i understand my lord i think you do philip of flanders was the one to break the news to me but he was doing philippes bidding they claim that my father seduced alys a few years back and this is the real reason why he is loath to allow our marriage i suppose he thought i might balk at sharing her favors once we were wed the chancellor was dumbfounded and suddenly fearful feeling as if he were teetering upon the edge of a cliff where the slightest movement might send him plunging into a fatal fall hed not have thought the discord between the king and the duke could get any worseuntil now adding a woman to the mix would do it though but how was he supposed to react to such news what did richard want him to say my lord i should he express outrage horror at the kings depravity but what if richard did not believe the story what if he did want to marry the girl he could find no clues in richards face if he erred there would be no recovery oh the duke might not dismiss him but the wrong answer was bound to affect his prospects to impair his credibility he took several deep breaths to steady his nerves and then made the only choice he could since he did not know the right answer to this deadly riddle all he could do was speak the truth i have my doubts about that my lord richard showed no reaction why is that longchamp knotted his fingers together in his lap if i may speak candidly my lord duke from what ive heard said of the english king he is a man given to sins of the flesh he has violated his marriage vows time and time again i would not find it easy to defend his sense of honor but i have never heard him called a fool and to have taken your betrothed the sister of the french king as his concubine would be an act beyond foolhardy it would be quite mad he could feel sweat trickling down his ribs could taste it on his upper lip he even imagined his thudding heartbeat must be audible to richard in the endless silence that greeted his words when he could endure it no longer he said hoarsely if i have offended you my lord you have not richard said composedly as their eyes met longchamp saw that he had guessed right and he went limp with relief understanding just how much had been at stake richard agreed with him did not credit this malicious rumor but more important this had been a test both of his judgment and of his willingness to speak honestly to tell the duke what he really thought and he had passed it had proven himself worthy of the dukes trust richard sat down in a highbacked chair stretching his long legs toward the warmth of the hearth your logic is impeccable guillaume he said approvingly my father is as you say given to sins of the flesh but he has never been one for thinking with his cock and alys capet is no helen of troy philippe ought to have known better longchamp had no interest whatsoever in the french princess he neither liked nor trusted women but he said now what he thought was expected of a man of god and shook his head disapprovingly it is indeed shameful that the french king would besmirch his own sisters honor for political gain shameful indeed richard echoed so dryly that longchamp realized the duke was not taken in by his sham indignation knew it was feigned and did not care in the least it is not as if philippe has ever been the soul of sentiment and i do not think he has even seen alys since she was handed over to my parents at the time of our betrothal when he was all of four five at the most it would not surprise me though if my cousin philip was the one to suggest the idea to philippe that is how philip got control of his wifes inheritance after all by accusing her of adultery we are dealing with some very unscrupulous men my lord yes the gathering at bonsmoulins ought to be a most interesting encounter it is all such hypocrisy guillaume any peace between my father and philippe would last as long as ice on a summers day for there is not enough trust between them to fill a walnut shell the both of them are born liars but i will do whatever i must to patch up a peace for without it i dare not leave for the holy land so i will let the french king think that he is using me i will even overlook the fact that he clearly believes me to be as easily duped as my brother hal ill admit i was somewhat insulted at first by that but then i realized what a convenient excuse he has given me for refusing to wed his sister he wants that wedding you see for the same reason that my father does not want it hals sorry example but i have no intention of taking alys as my wife i do not need her to hold on to the vexin and i can do better for england the marriage would not turn philippe into an ally it could be revealed that he is really one of my fathers bastards and hed still hate the angevins richard debated telling his chancellor that he was thinking of a marital alliance with navarre which made a great deal of strategic sense but he decided hed shared enough of his secrets with the cleric this day so he concluded should philippe ever attempt to compel me to honor the plighttroth with alys i would be quite indignant how could he expect me after all to wed my fathers bedmate i think the english and french kings are going to find you are more than a match for either one of them longchamp said admiringly what a formidable team they were going to make and since richards future held the promise of a crown mayhap he could dare to dream of a bishops miter longchamp had learned that richards moods were mercurial and like his father he was as changeable as the winds he was not surprised now when richards acerbic amusement gave way without warning to a far grimmer humor i am not going to let him win guillaume he said not this time i could not keep him from making my mother pay the price for our failed rebellion fifteen years she has been his prisoner fifteen years and she is his prisoner for all that she no longer wants for a queens comforts i have had to submit to his demands and subject myself to his whims and endure the indignity of having him brandish the crown before me as he would tease a dog with a bone but no more i will not let him rob me of my birthright and i will not let him keep me from honoring my vow to defend the holy land i do think he is behind that very opportune rebellion in my duchy and i would not put it past him to be conniving with the count of toulouse either and if by chance he did not it is only because he did not think of it no a reckoning is long overdue and we will have it at bonsmoulins the peace conference at bonsmoulins would prove to be one of the worst experiences of henrys life his suspicions were immediately ignited when richard and the french king arrived together not believing for a moment richards nonchalant claim that theyd just happened to meet on the way still brooding over the offer richard had made at chatillonsurindre declaring that he was willing to submit his dispute with the count of toulouse to the judgment of the french court if that would end the hostilities henry needed little to convince himself that they were secretly in league against him for eleanors charge had been right he did not trust his eldest son the first day had gone well enough with all parties maintaining civility by the second day tempers had begun to fray and by the third day negotiations had become so heated that henry and philippes knights were keeping their hands on their sword hilts as was customary they were meeting in an open field not far from bonsmoulins castle and the blustery november weather only added to the general sense of discontent and distrust but even henrys bleak expectations had not prepared him for what was to come the cold and the damp seemed to have penetrated to the very marrow of his bones and his bad leg was aching but henry would not show weakness by requesting a chair his physical discomfort was just one more aggravation on a day of many so far little progress had been made despite the best efforts of the norman and french bishops who feared that their holy crusade might be doomed before it even began and by midafternoon henrys patience had run out this is a waste of all our time he said curtly for three days we have been wrangling like barn cats and what have we accomplished weve agreed on a truce to last till st hilarys day unless you have a new proposal to make my lord king of the french i suggest we put an end to this trumpery resume once you are truly interested in reaching terms we can settle our differences here and now philippe said coolly we have but two demands to make and are willing to overlook all our other grievances if you are prepared to concede on these two points henrys eyes turned accusingly toward richard does he speak for you now in this he does before philippe could continue though richard stepped forward but first i would have a private word with you my lord father this was the first time that richard had even acknowledged their blood bond and henry nodded his agreement they walked away from the others coming to a stop under a gnarled oak stripped bare by the winter winds i want to caution you richard said bluntly to think carefully ere you answer us there is no room for compromise here and more rides upon your response than you could ever know henry scowled is this why you took me asideto threaten me richard started to speak stopped himself so be it he said and turned on his heel leaving his father to return on his own to the waiting circle i am willing to make a true and lasting peace with england philippe demanded and to return all of the lands ive claimed in this past year but in return my lord king you must at once hand over the lady alys to our keeping so that we may make arrangements for her marriage to the duke of aquitaine and you must also order your barons and vassals to swear an oath of fealty to the duke as your heir and kingtobe do this and we will be content i daresay you would be content henry jeered and why not you would be dictating terms to another king meddling in english internal matters and using the threat of war to gain your own way i would be a poor king indeed if i yielded to french extortion or allowed you to crown my heir apparent id sooner abdicate than betray my coronation oath and the promises i made to preserve and protect the english kingdom before philippe could respond richard strode over to confront his father are you denying that i am your rightful heir i am saying that i will not be coerced or compelled any declarations i might make today would be suspect and bring shame to me and to my subjects for it would seem as if i were not acting of my own free will for a long moment they stared at each other and then richard slowly shook his head now at last i must believe what i had always thought was impossible turning his back upon his father he unfastened his mantle let it slip to the ground removed his hat and unbuckled his scabbard handing his sword to the closest of his men he then crossed to the french king and knelt before him my lord king and liege lord as duke of aquitaine and rightful heir to the english throne i do willingly enter into your homage and faith and become your sworn man for the duchy of aquitaine the duchy of normandy for anjou maine berry toulouse and all my other fiefs on this side of the sea saving only the fealty that i owe to my lord father the english king philippe had listened with the glimmer of a smile we do promise you my vassal and liegeman that we and our heirs will guarantee to you and your heirs those lands that you now hold of us against all others and we do hereby promise to return to your keeping those lands wed taken in berry and to assure your possession of those lands you now hold in toulouse rising richard accepted the kiss of peace from his new liege lord and then reclaimed his sword we are done here then he said and walked away without once looking back at his father morgans family was not pleased by his belated decision to accept henrys offer his mother had been very happy to have him home again his brother could not imagine why hed want to leave wales and his father was wary of him becoming entangled in the political turmoil roiling the angevin empire when it became apparent that he was determined though ranulf insisted upon giving him a letter for the english king pointing out that henry may have forgotten all about his young welsh cousin by now in light of the ongoing crisis but ive always been his favorite uncle he said and if i ask it of him hell be sure to find a place for you morgan accepted the letter with thanks but he doubted that hed have to use it he was convinced that he needed no other credentials than his link to henrys son and when he finally caught up with the king holding his christmas court at saumur in anjou his confidence was justified by the warmth of his welcome henry seemed genuinely pleased to see him so much so that some of the other knights looked askance at this newcomer thrust into their midst morgan had always heard that royal courts were breeding grounds for intrigue envy and rivalry and those stories seemed confirmed by the coolness of the kings household mesnie his first few days were lonely ones and he began to wonder if hed made a mistake but hed grown bored in wales missing the energy and excitement of the breton court in truth hed been tempted from the first by henrys offer he could not in good conscience join the kings service though until he was sure henry would not be making war on geoffreys lady when word had finally trickled into wales that constance had thrown her lot in with henry rather than philippe he felt free then to offer his services to geoffreys father hed not expected to be treated like an interloper outgoing and sociable he was accustomed to making friends easily the rules seemed different at the royal court though it was shaping up he thought to be a bleak christmas indeed for the kings anxieties naturally filtered down to his followers but things changed for the better with the arrival of william marshal returning from a diplomatic mission to the flemish court to morgans surprised pleasure the celebrated older knight greeted him as if they were comrades of long standing and his approval was enough to win acceptance for the kings newest knight morgan was very flattered by wills friendliness because the older man had risen in the world since their last meeting hed always been acclaimed for his battle and tourney skills but now he was a man of substance too henry had given him the wardship of an heiress and the manor of cartmel in northern england upon his return from fulfilling hals pilgrimage pledge in the holy land but that past july henry had bestowed upon him a far greater prize denise de deols the heiress who would bring will the honour of chateauroux the castle itself had fallen to philippe that summer but denise was safe in england lodged with richards unhappy betrothed alys and johns bridetobe avisa of gloucester she was too young for marriage yet will explained to morgan but his future was now assured and all agreed hed done remarkably well for a younger son with no lands of his own as christmas drew nigh the weather took a nasty turn and on this friday evening snow was falling thickly upon the ancient castle perched high above the river loire the nights fish meal had been a modest one by royal standards for henry was ailing again and his cooks were taking advantage of his failing appetite to slack off at least that was the view of the knights gathered around the halls center hearth hours later they were still complaining about the inferior quality of the fish that had been served grumbling that the sauce had been too salty and the bread hard enough to pound nails will and morgan and several of the marshals friends were listening to these laments with amusement for soldiers had griped about such matters since the dawn of time in one breath theyll be claiming the wine tastes like goats piss and in the next breath asking for more will said with a wry smile though it is true that this was a meager meal to serve at a kings table ive talked to the steward about it but he insists the cooks and kitchen servants are doing the best they can pointing out that theyd not expected the king to celebrate christmas at saumur when chinon is so close at hand i once knew a traveling player and he told me one of the tricks of their trade when they arrived in a town they liked to give their performances in as crowded a site as possible to make it look as if theyd drawn twice the audience they actually did morgan looked curiously at the speaker for this was not the first time that hed heard comments about the poor turnout for a royal christmas court the kings son john was present as was his other son the chancellor the steadfast earl of essex and his wife maurice de craon and some norman barons and bishops but many more were conspicuous by their absence either keeping to their own hearths or paying court to henrys rebel son richard morgan had been stunned to learn that richard had done homage to the french king for hed not realized how serious their rupture was until his arrival at saumur the king had gone white as death will told him sadly and since then not a one of them had heard him so much as mention richards name unlike many of the kings knights morgan was not personally hostile toward richard if geoffreys rebellion was understandable then in fairness he could not hold richard to a higher standard of accountability for he had genuine grievances too still he regretted richards public repudiation of his father for that seemed like such a drastic step to take the other knights were still discussing the lords and barons whod chosen to stay away from saumur the more he listened the more unsettled morgan became you make it sound he protested as if the king will not be able to rely upon his own vassals surely that is not so there was a telling silence and then will said stoutly men of honor will stand by the king and the others will wait to see who is likely to win the king or his son anyone want to wager that the second band far outnumbers the first this was the same man whod implied that henry had chosen saumur over chinon to make the disappointing attendance at his christmas court less noticeable renaud was one of the sons of the count of dammartin a young man with a sardonic tongue a swagger and a disconcerting habit of saying what was on his mind some of the others viewed him with mistrust for hed been raised with philippe in paris but will marshals look of disapproval now was aimed at renauds cynical appraisal of henrys chances of victory i have more faith in the kings vassals than you do he insisted but he saw renauds pessimism mirrored on many of the other faces renaud himself did not look impressed by the rebuke if you are right sir william saumur ought to be swarming with men eager to display their loyalty to the king but the hall does not look all that crowded does it whether we like it or not rats rarely swim toward a sinking ship there was another awkward silence for most of the men were not comfortable with such blunt speaking if henrys ship was floundering they were at peril too once again it was will marshal who took charge i cannot speak for any others he said brusquely but i will not be amongst those who abandon their liege lord and if you are right renaud it is a shameful commentary upon our times as i said no man of honor would betray the king renaud de dammartin opened his mouth to argue further but before he could speak baldwin de bethune leaned over and clamped his hand warningly upon the younger mans wrist baldwin was a close friend of the marshals renaud considered him a friend too though and he looked at the flemish knight in surprise baldwin shook his head almost imperceptibly and renaud saw several of the men were gazing over his shoulder toward the stairwell he turned in time to catch a movement in the shadows and felt a sudden unease that he could not explain no one spoke for several moments not until baldwin said softly hes gone who is gone renaud demanded though he was not sure he wanted the answer to that question the kings son i saw him standing in the stairwell listening to us renaud cursed softly you do not think he thought i was advocating a waitandsee approach do you i am here with the king now am i not he was more disquieted than he wanted to admit though so much so that it did not occur to him to ask the natural question will did and renaud felt some relief when baldwin said it was the count of mortain not the chancellor for geoffs fiery loyalty to the king was legendary lord john was more of an unknown quantity and renaud assured himself that there was no reason to think hed go to the old king with what hed heard after that they found safer topics of conversation morgan was among those listening to a minstrels plaintive song of lost love when he received an unexpected summons to the kings bedchamber baffled and a little bit nervous morgan followed a servant from the hall the snow was coming down so heavily now that when he glanced over his shoulder he could no longer see the footprints theyd tracked across the bailey why would the king want to see him flames were crackling in the hearth and morgan was grateful when henry instructed him to warm himself by the fire the king was seated in a cushioned chair his leg propped up on a stool he looked very tired and caught up in thoughts that were far from pleasant i had sorrowful news today morgan he said his voice so low that morgan could barely hear his words a message from brittany from the lady constance morgan felt a flicker of unease the duchessshe is well my lord noshe is heartsick her daughter is dead morgan gasped then said haltingly whichwhich one matilda her younger a sudden fever henry closed his eyes for a moment constance says she was not sick long sire i am so sorry i hope it is of some comfort to the duchess and to you that she is with her father now henry looked up his eyes glistening at least geoffrey was spared this it is an awful thing to lose a child morgan i hope you never learn what it is like morgan nodded mutely not knowing what to say i will pray for her soul he promised at last but henry did not reply it soon became apparent to him that the king had forgotten he was there he waited a while longer and then quietly withdrew henry did not seem to notice continuing to gaze into the flickering wavering flames sharon kay penman devils brood c hapter f iftythree june la fertebernard maine in the months since richards dramatic public repudiation at bonsmoulins henry tried in vain to reestablish communications between them entreating his son to return to the english court but even when he dispatched the archbishop of canterbury as his messenger richard refused to meet with the prelate the truce between the english and french kings had expired when henry was too ill to attend the conference and that spring philippe and richard began to stage raids into henrys domains much to the dismay of those whod taken the cross and were eager to depart for the holy land the arrival of a papal legate the cardinal john of anagni rekindled hope though for the church was determined to make peace between the warring crusaderkings the cardinal succeeded in gaining their agreement to arbitration and a meeting was set up at whitsuntide at which time their grievances would be submitted to the cardinal himself and the archbishops of rheims bourges rouen and canterbury the cardinal was a tall elegant figure in a silk cappa magna and linen miter banded in gold his impressive bearing enhanced by his regal aplomb this was obviously not a man to be intimidated by those who wielded secular power and many of the witnesses took heart daring to hope that the peace of god would prevail it was soon evident though that neither philippe nor richard was in a conciliatory frame of mind philippe wasted no time in articulating their position that war was inevitable unless henry acceded to their demands they reiterated the conditions theyd set forth at bonsmoulins that alys be wed at once to richard and that richard be formally recognized as the rightful heir to the english crown and they added a new proviso insisting that john take the cross and accompany them to outremer john looked startled to find himself suddenly the center of attention henry ignored philippe although he had been the speaker and looked coolly at his elder son are you saying that the success of our holy war depends upon the presence of the count of mortain that is indeed a great compliment one i am sure he appreciates but i do not believe that the blessed mother church approves of compelling a man to take the cross richard was quick to take up the challenge ill let you worry about the state of his soul but his body will be in the holy land with me i will not even consider departing myself unless he goes too for reasons i am sure you well know my lord king john flushed the cardinal frowned and henry gave richard a look that was far from fatherly before he could respond though philippe stepped in not wanting richard to openly accuse henry of seeking to disinherit him that was at the heart of richards quarrel of course but philippe thought that it was important to couch their complaints in more elevated terms hed taken the cardinals measure and did not think the prideful papal legate would want to be dragged into a family squabble it must seem that greater issues were at stake just as he and richard must seem reasonable and sincere thinking that there were definite drawbacks to having an ally as impetuous as richard philippe said quickly my lord cardinal i would hope that well not be distracted from the true purpose of this meeting i do indeed support the duke of aquitaines insistence that his brother accompany us to the holy land and justice demands that the duke be acknowledged as the english kings heir the law of primogeniture very clearly states that an inheritance is passed on to the eldest son and since the death of the young king that son is duke richard but our greatest grievance lies in the shameful treatment of my sister the lady alys he paused deliberately to give henry a look that was both indignant and sorrowful before turning back to the papal legate and the bishops my sister was betrothed to the english kings son in gods year nigh on twenty years ago your grace she is now twentyeight years old well past the accepted age for matrimony my lord father of blessed memory was greatly troubled by the english kings refusal to honor the plighttroth and tried repeatedly to remedy her predicament and i in my turn have done what i could for my unfortunate sister again and again i have implored the english king either to marry her to the duke as he promised or return her and her dowry to france philippe shook his head sadly in truth my lords i do not know why the english king continues to be so arbitrary and unfair those are questions best addressed to him i can say only that i will no longer abide her continuing exile she deserves better than this and as her closest male kin it is my duty to act on her behalf she must marry the english kings son or she must come home and gisors and the vexin must be returned to the french crown as he glanced around at their intently listening audience philippe was gratified by what he saw heads nodding in agreement and challenging looks being directed in henrys direction by members of the cardinals retinue let the old fox talk his way out of this snare seeing that all were waiting for his response henry let his gaze linger upon the french kings face not even glancing toward richard so the lady alyss marriage is what matters most to you my lord king when philippe nodded gravely henry smiled with such satisfaction that the french king felt a prickle of foreboding i am pleased to hear that henry said for this means we can resolve our differences here and now and turn our attention to what matters mostgoing to the rescue of the holy city you would have your sister wed my lord king fine i am quite willing to see it done and with no further delay but let her wed the count of mortain there was a stunned silence and then pandemonium richards shock gave way almost at once to utter outrage and he cried out angrily that this insulting proposal justified all of his past suspicions philippe was no longer feigning indignation glaring at henry as he scornfully rejected the english kings gamesplaying richards men and the french were voicing support for their lords the assembled prelates were murmuring among themselves and john was gazing at his father in disbelief was it too much to have expected papa to mention this beforehand i do not understand why you refuse even to consider it my liege henry said looking at the french king with a puzzled air if the marriage of the lady alys to my son will put an end to this needless strife between us what are your objections youve just proved that all my suspicions were correct richard snarled your intent has always been to put john in my rightful place henry gave richard a dismissive glance keeping his eyes on philippe it is for you to answer my liege he said not one of your vassals philippe was as angry now as richard your duplicity knows no bounds my lord you expect us to forget your years of bad faith and doubledealing as you play us for fools i daresay youll be bargaining with the devil on your deathbedbut not with me ive had enough will waste no more time here today but as philippe turned to stalk off he found his way barred by the papal legate the cardinal was also furious but his anger was not directed at henry the english king told me that you were using your sisters marriage as a pretext an excuse for aggression against his norman lands i was doubtful but i see now that he was right if your sole concern is your sisters welfare why would you refuse his offer if you suspect that he intends to name the count of mortain as his successor i would think that ought to make the marriage even more valuable in your eyes of course if your real interest is in continuing this war then your refusal makes deplorable sense i am surprised my lord cardinal that you are so trusting so easily swayed you do not truly think hell let alys marry john do you this is a bluff prove it then by accepting his offer the cardinal challenged and waited for a response that was not coming your silence speaks for itself my liege let me now speak for the holy church if you persist in this war and thus doom the holy city i will lay your lands under interdict until you come to your senses you dare to threaten me with an interdict philippe said incredulously as a good son of the church i will match my history against the english kings any day of the week but i will not allow you to meddle in this matter i have every right to punish a rebellious vassal and lest you forget he is indeed my vassal you have been warned my lord king and you have been bought my lord cardinal take your threats and your saddle bags filled with english gold and go back to rome philippes accusation set off another uproar and arguments began to break out all over the field richard shouldered his way forward to voice his own anger with the cardinal the exchange becoming so heated that the bishops hastened to intercede between the two men fuming richard finally allowed the archbishop of rouen to draw him away but he was only half listening as the prelate assured him that the cardinal bore him no malice that his sole concern was the coming quest to the holy land his eyes searched the crowd and when he found his father he was not surprised to see henry standing apart watching the commotion like a playwright observing a drama of his making and despite his fury richard felt a flicker of grudging admiration philippe was storming off trailed by his lords and clerics and the cardinal was preparing to depart too one of richards squires had brought his stallion up and he reached for the reins swinging easily into the saddle before he could signal to his men though he noticed his brother standing by himself a few feet away on impulse he nudged his mount in johns direction to give the devil his due he said he does know how to stir a pot john shrugged and richard leaned from the saddle so that his words reached his brothers ears alone a bit of advice johnny an infidel who converts at knifepoint will not be valued as much as one who converts of his own free will john looked up at him his face unreadable i do not know what you mean richard a pity richard said laconically and turned his horse away john stood motionless watching him go henry withdrew south to le mans after the conference fell apart hoping that philippe would heed the cardinals warning once his anger cooled hed gambled all upon one throw of the dice having concluded that his only chance was to drive a wedge between richard and philippe without the french king backing him up richards threat would be blunted and hed either have to accept henrys olive branch or depart on his own for the holy land but hed underestimated the intensity of philippes hostility either that or philippe considered richard so useful an ally that he was willing to defy the church in order to safeguard that alliance at least hed been able to win the cardinals support but it would not count for much if philippe was willing to wage war even under the threat of an interdict henry found it hard to believe that the young french king would be so reckless he soon learned that his hopes of a peaceful settlement were no more substantial than shadows and smoke the very next day philippe and richard launched a surprise and successful assault upon his castle at la fertebernard in quick succession they moved on to capture the castles of montfort maletable beaumont and ballon the loss of ballon was particularly disturbing for it was just fifteen miles from le mans when john was admitted to his fathers chamber he found henry playing chess with geoff henry greeted him with a smile and pushed his chair back from the table but john was not impressed that his father would interrupt the game for him when other men told him how lucky he was to stand so high in the kings favor he was hard put not to point out that a diet of promises was a thin gruel for all his fathers fondness and fine talk he had yet to grant the incomes of mortain and the gloucester heiress seemed likely to join alys in a chaste old age i heard that some of the breton lords have thrown their lot in with richard and philippe joining them at ballon he said is it true yes henry admitted you know raoul de fougeres hes never one to miss a rebellion john was not cheered by henrys humor not with their scouts reporting that the french king and richard were heading south toward le mans i do not understand why you insist upon staying in le mans papa surely it would make more sense to withdraw into normandy where your army is gathering here you have only your household knights and your welsh routiers why put yourself needlessly at risk henry had already had this discussion with willem and geoff and several others all of whom had advocated a retreat into the greater safety of normandy le mans has always been the city closest to my heart johnny i was born here and my father is buried in the cathedral i have promised the citizens that i will not abandon them his fathers logic eluded john altogether he looked at henry in frustration but he had no chance to continue the argument for it was then that will marshal was announced john stepped aside so will could confer with henry just in time to catch geoff surreptitiously shifting several of the chess pieces on the board john did not like his half brother any more than richard did and when he realized what geoff was up to he shook his head thinking that only geoff would cheat to lose henry beckoned will into the chamber will my scouts report that philippe and richard have turned in the direction of tours but i want to be sure it is not a trick on the morrow take several of our men and find out if they are indeed heading away from le mans will promised to leave at first light and then asked about the defensive ditches theyd dug outside the city walls john saw that henry was going to be occupied for some time and quietly slipped from the chamber there were two royal residences in le mans the ancient castle near the cathedral of st julien and the palace in the place st pierre where henry was lodging willem was standing on the town walls looking down at the sprawling suburb that had grown up around the city sheltered on two sides by the rivers sarthe and huisne le mans had an ancient past and its walls dated back to the time when it had been a roman outpost it had long been the heart of anjou but willem was scrutinizing it now with a soldiers eye his only concern the defenses it offered against assault he would have been more content had the city not held such a great prizethe king himself it was that ephemeral hour between day and night clouds still tinted with the red hues of sunset the sky taking on the deepening haze of a summer twilight willem was too tense too preoccupied to appreciate the quiet beauty of a country eventide and he started visibly at the sound of his name turning he saw henrys youngest son approaching along the battlement walkway not a welcome sight for he was sure john was seeking reassurance he could not in all honesty provide johns greeting was perfunctory and he wasted no time in social amenities i have just come from my father and he is still balking at withdrawing into normandy i do not understand him at all anymore willem how can he be so lethargic in the face of such danger he has always been acclaimed for the speed of his campaigns and yet now he does nothing what would you have him do john he does not want to make war upon his son the choice is no longer his john pointed out impatiently surely he means to defend himself he showed no such reticence during the first rebellion nor when hal and geoffrey sought to overthrow richard i know he is older now but even so he is fifty and six which is hardly doddering part of willems annoyance was due to the fact that he and henry were born in the same year but he was also thoroughly disillusioned with the ingratitude of the kings sons after years of witnessing henrys strife with hal and geoffrey and richard hed decided that a fertile queen might well pose a greater danger than a barren one and so far hed seen nothing in john to soften that harsh judgment for henrys youngest seemed like a typical spoiled and callow young princeling to him not likely to be the staff of his fathers old age has it never occurred to you john that heartwounds can be more dangerous than those inflicted with lance or sword especially now what do you mean by especially now willem stared at him how could he not know i am talking of your lord fathers failing health of course john frowned i know he is troubled by that recurring leg injury and he suffered greatly this spring from an abscess in his groin but as painful as they are they are not mortal ailments he always gets better does he not willems hesitation was brief john was not a child after all he was a man grown of twenty and two it was time for him to look at the world with a mans eyes time to realize how greatly his father needed him he is loath to speak openly of his ills but he has been troubled for months by an ulcer and he has a wound in his heel that is not healing as it ought constant pain saps a mans strength all the more so when he must endure one family crisis after another john was silent for a time then this is why so many of his barons are deserting him they fear he might die they fear he cannot win this war and for a king death and defeat are one and the same i do not mean to alarm you unduly john but i felt you had the right to know how serious your fathers maladies are thank you john said softly for telling me the truth willem patted him on the shoulder and then moved on heading for the ladder john remained where he was gazing over the walls at the deceptively tranquil scene below candles had begun to glow through the open windows of the houses and bobbing beacons appeared on the streets as lanterns were struck but these cheerful flickers of light were soon swallowed up by the encroaching dark during the night thick fog drifted into the valley and when will and his companions set out they could barely see more than a few yards ahead of them they almost ran into an advance party of french scouts but since they were not armed for combat they let the french riders pass by in peace will led the way toward the river huisne and there he found that henrys caution had been well warranted using the fog as camouflage the french and poitevins had stealthily advanced as far as the river and were now encamped on the other bank with the obvious intent of laying siege to le mans entering the great hall john made his way toward the dais where henry was talking quietly and intently with will marshal and several of his knights you sent for me my lord henry nodded said come with me and led the way behind the oaken partition that screened off one end of the hall the french army is gathering for an attack upon le mans i have given orders to break down the pontlieu bridge over the river huisne to place stakes in the places where the river can be forded and to scatter caltrops and sharpened stones in the riverbed we are deepening the ditches and pulling down those houses closest to the city gates john nodded hed already heard about the french armys advance for rumors were sweeping the city what do you want me to do henry hesitated then reached out and placed his hands on his sons shoulders i want you to go johnny i expect to be able to withstand the siege long enough for my army to reach us but it would be foolish for both of us to be trapped in le mans so i want you safely away from here john caught his breath papaare you sure henry felt a vast relief for hed feared that john would balk nothing ever came easily if one of his sons was involved thank god almighty that johnny could be reasoned with unlike richard very sure lad it makes the most sense to have you in normandy to take charge of the army and lead them back to lift the siege id rather not leave you john said slowly but if that is your wish i will obey henry pretended to reel back in shock that is a word i never thought to hear from the lips of a son of mine he joked bless you lad for not arguing with me keeping his arm around johns shoulders he steered the young man toward the door take your household knights johnny and go at once the sooner his son was on the road to safety the sooner he could draw an easy breath he was not about to admit that though knowing that too much fatherly concern would sting johns pride make him more likely to insist upon staying so he continued to banter with john bidding him farewell as nonchalantly as if this were a routine separation and only once did they acknowledge more was at stake john had turned to go then came back and gave henry a quick hug henrys eyes misted but he then gave his son a playful push be off with you johnny and try not to get lost the next morning henry decided to venture out to reconnoiter the french camp confident that thered be no immediate assault since hed had the bridge destroyed neither he nor any of the men with him wore their hauberks only will marshal was insistent upon fully arming himself and henry was both amused and irked by the knights stubbornness exiting the city through a postern gate between the palace and the church of st pierre de la coeur they rode through the suburb known as bourg dom guy the streets were eerily empty now as the residents had taken refuge within the city walls even the maison dieu de coeffort the hospital henry had founded nine years ago had been evacuated a sight so mournful that he had to avert his eyes as they passed they had agreed that if the french did attack the suburb would have to be set on fire and the knowledge that these poor people might lose all they had only dragged henrys spirits down further when hed first learned that richard and philippe meant to attack the city of his birth henry had been sustained by the intensity of his rage but it had not continued to burn at white heat and this morning he felt numb and exhausted after another sleepless night and uncomfortably aware of his bodys aches and pains with every step his stallion took my lords one of the scouts theyd sent ahead was racing toward them spurring his mount without mercy they have found a ford are making ready to cross when henry galloped past him several of his companions cried out in protest but he had to see for himself french knights had ridden out into the river huisne using their lances to test its depth and discovered a ford by the remains of pontlieu bridge they were already lining up to cross and henry thought he caught a glimpse of richard mounted on a favorite roan stallion not yet armed but shouting commands making order of chaos papa geoff had reined in beside him swinging his mount around as if to block henry from view we have to get back into the city none of us are armed so we cannot engage them and if they see you theyll be on us like a hawk on a thrush indeed no sooner were the words out of his mouth than they heard shouts and men were pointing in their direction as the first french knights splashed into the river henry and his men wheeled their horses about and raced for safety will marshal had been left behind to guard the postern gate and as it opened to admit the king and his knights will charged toward the pursuing riders for he knew that taillebourg had fallen when richard had gotten into the city with the fleeing garrison at first he was alone but men on the parapet began shouting over here for god and the marshal and some of wills knights came galloping through the gate to fight at his side soon a number of henrys men now armed joined the fray and before long a sharp battle was taking place in the streets under the city walls one of wills knights hugh de malanny was struck with such force that his horse lost its footing and rider and animal both toppled into the marshy moat will promptly shattered his own lance on the french knights shield and the man also splashed into the moat casting aside his lance will soon spotted another worthy foe and spurred his stallion toward andre de chauvigny will was famed in tournaments for his ability to capture knights by seizing their bridles using his own considerable strength and his horses momentum to drag his helpless opponents off the field the maneuver worked perfectly now with richards knight to his horror andre suddenly found himself being towed toward the gate faced with several choices all of them unpalatable he could try to cut his mounts bridle which would give him no way to control the animal he could fling himself from a galloping horse or he could become the marshals prisoner drawing his dagger andre leaned forward in an attempt to slash the reins before they reached the gate men up on the parapet were heaving large rocks down upon the french and one of them hit andres arm while another stone struck his mount in the head the horse reared screaming and suddenly will found himself holding the bridle while andre found himself clinging desperately to his saddle as his stallion bolted back toward the river by now he was in such pain that he knew his arm was broken and he felt a surge of fear for hed not be able to halt the panicked animal but hoofbeats were thudding behind him and from the corner of his eye he saw rico ranging up alongside andre took no time to consider kicked his feet free of his stirrups and leaped this was a maneuver hed often practiced in the tiltyard but hed never tried it with an injured arm and sprawled awkwardly across the destriers rump for several terrifying seconds he hung there holding on for dear life until rico displaying fine horsemanship managed to halt his stallion andre slid to the ground and sank down in the grass he was chalkwhite in such agony that he was on the verge of blacking out but he was alive and so had no complaints at the gate will looked for new quarry and in quick succession he used his bridle trick upon two other knights but both men preferred runaway horses to captivity and cut themselves free wills third foe was not so lucky and was hauled through the city gate where he was quickly disarmed and turned over to wills excited squire will then switched horses with his prisoner for his own stallion had been lamed after stepping on a broken lance returning to the combat he led a charge that soon had the french in flight toward the river by now will was drenched in sweat and finding it hard to catch his breath for the seneschal of anjou had set fire to the suburbs and smoke and flames were adding to the dangers of the battlefield i think weve beaten them back for now will panted looking at his comrades with pride for baldwin de bethune and renaud de dammartin and morgan fitz ranulf and peter fitz guy were men he was honored to fight with even to die with if need be the french had retreated across the river but henrys knights knew theyd soon be trying again and they turned their mounts back toward the city it was an exceedingly hot and humid day and they were all exhausted winded and badly bruised from deflected blows but they were triumphant too for the first onslaught had been a victory for the english theyd almost reached the gate when morgan gave a sudden shout of alarm jesu look the wind is shifting and as they watched appalled sparks and cinders and burning embers were caught by the wind sent spiraling up into the sky many of them came down within the city and screams warned the men of le manss peril even before they saw the smoke not finding henry at the palace will was heading for the castle when he heard a woman crying for help one of the flying embers had set her roof afire and she was frantically trying to drag her belongings from the house before it went up in flames will at once dismounted and he and his squires came to her aid she wept with gratitude as they were able to recover a table and bedframe and a coffer chest of her familys clothing carrying out a smoldering feather quilt will found himself choking on the acrid fumes coming from the bedding and after dropping it into a horse trough he knelt pulled off his helmet and splashed water on his face he could tell from the noise that the citizens were doing their best to put out the fires but he could see smoke staining the sky in several quarters of the city and he feared that le mans was doomed riders were coming up the street and he recognized the earl of essex in the lead when willem reined in his horse will felt as if he were looking at a stranger for the normally imperturbable earl was as alarmed as will had ever seen him the french crossed the sarthe downstream and circled around to the west they have taken the perrin bridge and will soon be in the city we must get the king away whilst we still can n o henry looked defiantly from willem to geoff but there was more despair in his voice than anger i have never run from a fight in my life am not about to start now geoff grasped henrys arm desperate enough to try to take his father from the city by force if need be papa you cannot stay you must make a choice harry willem took advantage of years of friendship to speak bluntly now no longer as subject to sovereign but as one battle commander to another we cannot hold the city cannot fight the fire and the french too so you must retreator you must surrender to the french king and your son and youve precious little time to make up your mind henry turned away he who had always prided himself upon his swift response to a crisis now found himself crippled by indecision by a paralyzing sense of unreality how could it have come to this how could he lose le mans the city dearest to his heart we will retreat he agreed at last and they sprang into action not wanting to give him a chance to reconsider with the french forcing their way into the city through the west gate and the body of their army just an arrows flight to the south the only escape still open to henry was through the north gate out onto the road to alencon having shed their hauberks and helmets so they could make better speed they galloped out of the city heading north but henry was already having second thoughts how could he abandon the townsmen always so steadfast and loyal how could he let himself be chased away by that paltry french stripling and his wretched ingrate of a son to the dismay of his men he insisted on drawing rein upon the crest of a hill and as he looked back at the burning city his anguish gave way to a wild unholy rage o god since you have taken away from me the city that i loved most on earth the city where i was born and bred the city where my father is buried i will repay you as best i can i will deny you what you love best in me my soul his listeners shivered in horror hastily making the sign of the cross to distance themselves from henrys bitter blasphemous rant geoff pleaded with him to ride on but it was only when they saw the horsemen galloping after them that he let himself be pulled away from the sight of the smokeshrouded city richard had not taken a personal role in the assault upon le mans feeling it would be unseemly to lead an attack upon his own father he was not clad in armor therefore when he entered the city and learned that henry and his knights had fled without stopping to think it through richard at once led his men in pursuit his was an instinctive response wanting to put an end to this once and for all wanting the satisfaction of being the one to take his father prisoner and perhaps sensing too that it would be better if he caught up with henry rather than the men of the french king not burdened with hauberk helmet or shield wearing only an iron capa cervellierhe rapidly gained ground on them was soon in sight of the retreating rearguard one of henrys knights had once been a friend and when he saw him jousting with a poitevin knight richard could not resist jeering as he swept by you are foolish to waste your time with tournament tactics des roches would do better to put on a bit of speed at the sound of richards voice another knight turned back and charged straight at him richard was suddenly acutely aware of his vulnerability for the man riding at him with lance leveled at his chest was one of the best of their age his mentor who now seemed likely to be his nemesis his mouth went dry as for the first time he experienced the purely physical fear of death in desperation he tried to ward off the lance with his arm shouting out gods legs marshal do not kill me i am unarmed they were close enough now for him to see the grim expression on the other mans face to anticipate the lance driving into his chest with all the force of the marshals body behind it but at the last possible moment will shifted his aim and plunged the weapon into richards stallion death was instantaneous and as the animal fell richard was thrown to the ground gasping from the impact struggling for breath he looked up at the knight whod reined in only a few feet away let the devil be the one to kill you will said and he then spurred his horse rode to catch up with his king by now several of richards knights had reached him and were dismounting in haste to make sure he was unharmed waving their helping hands aside richard insisted upon struggling to his feet by himself more shaken than hed ever admit he stood watching as marshal disappeared into the distance suddenly able to appreciate the kind of courage that was not fearless that owed nothing to bravado or daredevil abandon but was the pure product of the will no he said when they asked if they should resume the pursuit it is done their flight from le mans was a hellish journey for henry and his knights they were never out of danger for they had to pass several of the castles that had been seized by the french men and horses collapsed in the scorching heat as they dared not slacken their pace by the time they reached fresnaysursarthe that evening henry was in such pain that he could barely stay in the saddle geoff and willem would have preferred to press on to alencon for fresnay was a small castle unable to accommodate hundreds of knights but they knew henry could go no farther fresnay was one of the castles of the viscount beaumont in happier days henry had played host to the wedding of his daughter to the scots king he was with henrys army at alencon but his castellan did all he could to make them welcome turning over the best bedchamber to henry offering to feed as many as he could and suggesting that some of their men could lodge in the towns three priories henry needed geoffs help to climb the stairs for that hard ride had inflamed his old leg injury sinking down on the bed he stirred only when geoff would have departed saying he meant to pass the night in the town keeping vigil in case the french found them no henry whispered stay here stay with me not closing his eyes until geoff promised he would remain henrys young squire hugh de sandford had shown the presence of mind to bring along a sumpter horse and geoff gladly accepted a change of clothing for hed left everything behind in le mans henry did not have the energy to remove his dusty tunic and sweatsoaked shirt so geoff covered him with his own mantle then settled down in a nearby chair to keep watch while he slept awakening the next morning geoff was so stiff and sore that he could not move without wincing to his relief henry still slept and after instructing hugh to let him sleep he stumbled downstairs the great hall had been used as a bedchamber by some of henrys knights they were up by now though consuming bread cheese and wine talking and even laughing among themselves for their spirits had risen with the sun geoff shared their sense of rejuvenation for they were less than ten miles from the norman border and safety he wished that he could convince his father to return to england to recover but he knew that was a lost cause and so contented himself that at least henry would find security and time to convalesce in rouen morgan was also feeling much more cheerful for he was still young enough to be restored by a good nights sleep and a meal he and several of his friends were prodding will marshal to tell them again about his clash with richard and will who had no false modesty when it came to his knightly skills was happy to oblige he soon had a large and enthusiastic audience but their laughter had a nervous edge for richard was not known for his forgiving nature and few doubted that he would be king one day when henry entered the hall a sudden silence fell for the past days ordeal was writ plainly in his face for all to see his complexion was livid his eyes sunken his mouth tightly clamped morgan was so shocked by the kings haggard appearance that he soon fled the hall feeling as if he were reliving a nightmare thrust back in time to those wretched days at lagny forced to stand by and watch helplessly as geoffreys life ebbed away in his misery he turned to the almighty and headed for the chapel on the far side of the bailey there he offered up a fervent prayer for his cousin the king and then lingered to talk with the chaplain the chapel priory was a cell of the abbey of st aubin in angers and the young priest was passionately loyal to the count of anjou with him as with so many angevins the fact that their count was also englands king was an interesting irrelevancy morgan found it comforting to speak to another one of henrys partisans and it was some time before he emerged from the church he was immediately hailed by two of his friends and fellow knights peter fitz guy and robert de tresgoz morgan weve been looking all over for you as soon as he joined them they both blurted out their news at once youll not believe what happened peter exclaimed while rob declared that he feared the kings wits had been affected they paused for breath and this time rob deferred to peter the king is not going on to alencon morgan he is sending his son and the earl of essex into normandy with our men but he says he is going back into anjou morgan was staggered but that makes no sense we know you should have heard the others when he told them that i thought geoff would go as mad as the king they all decried it speaking more frankly than he is accustomed to hear first arguing and then pleading to no avail he told them this was not open for debate and in the end he got his own way as he usually does he made the earl of essex promise not to turn any of his castles in normandy over to anyone but count john and insisted that geoff continue on to alencon geoff was so distraught though that the king did agree he could join him in anjou after leading our men to alencon morgan did not understand henrys rash decision any more than his friends did and he remained silent as they told him that will marshal had begged to come but the king was adamant you see why i wonder if he is in his right senses rob said unhappily he escapes le mans by a hairbreadth and gods grace and now he wants to go right back into hell morgan didnt reply for hed just spotted geoff and willem leaving the hall geoff at once swerved in their direction with willem following giving morgan no chance to speak geoff reached out and grasped the younger mans arm hard enough to hurt you heard when morgan nodded solemnly geoffs grip tightened you must promise me cousin morgan promise that youll not leave him he will not let me come with him so it is up to you to all of you he added his gaze now including peter and rob you were steadfast in your loyalty to geoffrey and you two were just as faithful to hal i want you to swear to me on the surety of your souls that you will give the king the same devotion you gave his sons wideeyed they all pledged their fidelity to the king vowed not to abandon him morgan then took advantage of his kinship to the chancellor and confessed cousin we do not understand why is the king doing this geoff looked at him mutely and then turned away but not before they saw his despair they watched him stride toward the chapel and then glanced imploringly at the earl of essex willem did not reply at once he is going home to anjou he said at last his voice muffled going home to die chapter fiftyfour june chinon anjou for the rest of his life morgan would remember that harrowing journey through lands now occupied by the french army they had to swing well to the west of le mans passed two nights at the small hilltop castle of saintesuzanne and then avoiding the main roads and enemy patrols ventured on into anjou much of the time they had to traverse narrow forest paths where henry had hunted since his youth and there were a few nights when theyd had to camp out in the woods which henry had done before but never when he was feverish and in constant pain it was easy for morgan to imagine them as a small band of outlaws on the run from the law an astonishing image for one of the most powerful rulers in christendom the handful of young knights who were accompanying their king were impressed by his knowledge of the back roads and byways of anjou for he was often the one acting as their guide and impressed too by his stoic endurance of his suffering they were greatly relieved when they got safely to angers but after a brief stay to husband his waning strength henry insisted upon continuing on toward saumur geoff caught up with them at savigny for hed remained at alencon only long enough to select one hundred handpicked knights and then set out after henry they finally reached chinon in late june as the crow flies their journey was over a hundred miles but theyd had to detour and sidetrack and veer off so often that they agreed theyd probably ridden twice that distance a man famed for the speed of his travels a man whod once covered two hundred miles in four days henry had taken fully a fortnight to get home to the loire valley at the end of june william marshal and his household knights arrived at chinon in response to henrys summons the angevin baron maurice de craon also joined them but the royal army remained at alencon for many of the norman barons were loath to fight for a king who might be dying against the man most likely to succeed him henry had been running a high fever for days he was propped up with pillows not having the strength to get out of bed but he was lucid and determined to do this to express his gratitude to the men gathered in his bedchamber have you heard will what has happened my city of tours has fallen to the french yes sire i know and my barons and vassals are cravenly keeping away fearful of offending a rebel duke and the false shameless whelp who sits on the french throne but you did come will henry had to pause overcome with gratitude and affection for these loyal courageous honorable men i am grateful beyond words to you he said huskily above all to you my dearest son i pray that the almighty grants me enough time to reward you as you deserve with the archbishopric of york his cracked lips twitched in what was almost a smile even though i know you have never burned to take holy orders i want only your return to health and prosperity my lord father geoff managed to get out before his throat closed up at least i can reward the rest of you henry murmured and nothing has given me greater pleasure than what i do now a scribe had been standing off to the side ready to capture the kings words with pen and ink one by one henry called upon the young knights whod shared such adversity with him and made grants and conferred wardships and heiresses upon them he bestowed the castle and forest of lillebonne upon renaud de dammartin rendering that cocksure young man speechless for once he gave a marcher castle to his welsh cousin morgan he rewarded peter fitz guy and the other knights whod stayed with hal at martel and then he shocked them all by giving to baldwin de bethune the rich heiress denise de deols whom hed once promised to will no will i am not growing forgetful in my old age he said smiling at the dumbfounded expression on the marshals face i have another highborn lady in mind for you will had quickly recovered his aplomb for he was courtier as well as soldier and he assured henry that he asked no more than to enjoy the kings favor a courteous and blatant falsehood that amused them all including henry but he was growing very tired and so he did not tease will by dragging out the suspense it is my great joy to bestow upon the marshal the hand of isabella de clare heiress of richard strongbow earl of pembroke and lord of striguil and leinster will gasped and his friends forgot for a moment that they were at a kings sickbed they cheered and thumped him boisterously on the back excited by his great good fortune for isabella de clare was the richest heiress in england would bring will vast estates in england normandy wales and ireland they soon subsided though realizing the insensitivity of celebrating wills bright prospects when the kings were so bleak will had begun to stammer his thanks but henry stopped him you served my son well he said softly just as youve served me hal would have wanted me to do this for you and will had to swallow a sudden lump in his throat for henrys words had conjured up a beguiling ghost his manifest flaws expunged by death handsome and dashing and forever young on the first of july the archbishop of tours arrived to give henry an eyewitness account of the capture of his city he was also able to tell them what had happened in le mans after theyd fled it had not been sacked most likely due to the dukes orders he reported diffidently nervous at having to say anything complimentary about richard under the circumstances all of henrys welsh routiers had been massacred save only those whod retreated into the castle and withstood a threeday siege the fire damage was not as great as first feared he said hoping that might give henry some comfort but seeing that it did not geoff and will begged henry to let the archbishop shrive him of his sins for they greatly feared that he might die before he could atone for his blasphemy on the hill overlooking le mans but henry refused for he was not yet ready either to forgive the almighty or to ask his forgiveness as his fever continued to spike he found himself drifting back in time although his memories were fragmented and random flashes of his boyhood and his garden courtship of the beautiful french queen whispers of past triumphs and echoes of unhealed sorrows his father and eleanor and hal wandered through his dreams as did thomas becket miraculously young again the kings chancellor and loyal friend laughing and telling him that the lucky man was one who died without regrets upon awakening henry found that his face was wet with tears for he had regrets beyond counting one of his greatest was that hed not have the chance to explain to john why hed never taken any measures to secure the crown for him you could not have held it lad not against richard and your kingship would be as brief as it was bloody hed wanted to spare his sons pride but now he wished hed been more forthright sought to make john understand he was beginning to worry about him for johns whereabouts were still unknown nigh on three weeks after the retreat from le mans geoff and will had not seen him at alencon and while henry thought he was likely safe in normandy the silence was one more burden to take to his grave the next day henry had more visitors the count of flanders the archbishop of rheims and the count of blois riding in under a flag of truce do you wish to see them papa geoff asked shall i bring them up to your chamber no henry said and only when he tried to rise did his son realize he was not refusing to see the men but unwilling to see them at his sickbed geoff argued against it in vain insisting henry did not have to do this by now henry had managed to swing his legs over the side of the bed yes geoff i do he said and beckoned for hugh to help him dress henry felt no surprise when they seemed so taken aback as he limped into the hall by now he was used to having people react to his appearance with poorly concealed shock i know he said sinking down into the chair that will was holding out for him i look like a corpse that is overdue for burial so spare me the solicitous queries about my health and tell me why you are here thibault of blois and the archbishop seemed disconcerted by such candor but philip of flanders gave henry a grimly approving smile fair enough he said and leaned across the table we never wanted this war cousin we ought to have been halfway to jerusalem by now but philippe has the bit between his teeth i fear hes in danger of getting drunk on battlefield glory blissfully unaware that he is drinking from richards cup we have been urging him to make peace without success and yes i know i seem like an unlikely peacemaker but my vow to take the cross apparently means more to me than his does to philippe and it is not in any of our interests to have the balance of power turned on its head like this an overly mighty french king is no improvement over an overly mighty english one henry could believe them for all three men had been involved in rebellions against philippe during the early years of his reign years in which hed come to the boys rescue time and time again no one ought ever to doubt that the almighty had a sense of humor then if you bring no peace offers what exactly do you have for me cousin once philip would have relished this moment but he discovered now that he could take no pleasure in henrys defeat and humiliation philippe and richard wish you to come to colombieres the day after tomorrow he said doing his best to transform a command into a request henry was not misled knew full well that this was no invitation tell the french king and the duke of aquitaine that i will be there theyd brought out a stool to assist henry in mounting for hed adamantly refused to use a horse litter his squires stood by as it was obvious to them that hed still need help in getting securely into the saddle geoff waved them aside though let me lend a hand papa he said and then i am such a coward for i cannot bear to accompany you to colombieres cannot watch as you must humble yourself before men not worthy of your spit i am sorry to fail you like this so sorry you owe me no apologies geoff for your reluctance is proof of the love you bear me in truth henry said trying to smile i would as soon miss this spectacle myself as much as i fancied hunting i never cared for a bearbaiting his attempt at humor only made it harder for geoff who hugged him tightly then boosted him up into the saddle geoff then retreated back into the great hall to grieve and to curse his brothers the french king and himself for not being there when his father had such need of him henry somehow made it all the way to colombieres actually was the first to arrive by now he was in such pain that his men insisted he await their coming in the commandery of the knights templar at ballan just a few miles to the east they should have been relieved when he agreed but his acquiescence only alarmed them all the more for it proved how ill he truly was upon reaching the commandery henry almost fell when dismounting and had to lean against a wall for support when he opened his eyes will marshal was at his side looking so concerned that he could hide the truth no longer the pain has gotten so bad will it began in my heel then it spread to my legs now my whole body is afire come inside sire and rest for a while will said firmly and giving henry no chance to object he put his arm around the older man helped him into the commandery and into bed theyd brought along the doctor theyd engaged in angers but there was little he could do the templars fetched a basin of cool water and they took turns putting compresses upon henrys forehead while sending one of his knights to inform richard and philippe that henry was too ill to attend the conference morgan was leaning over the bed trying to coax henry into taking a few swallows of wine when the knight returned one look at his face and they knew the news he brought was not good gilbert lets go outside will said quickly but he was not in time gilbert pipard hastened toward the bed where he knelt and looked at henry with tears in his eyes i am so sorry my liege i failed you i told them you were ill but they did not believe me duke richard his mouth twisted as if hed tasted something rancid he told the french king that you were feigning this sickness that it was just another one of your tricks and they demand that you come to colombieres straightaway henrys knights were outraged and began to swear calling richard and philippe every vile name they could think of and most of them had a considerable vocabulary of obscenities henry said nothing though struggling to sit up he managed to lurch to his feet retaining his balance only with morgans help the templars had been watching in dismay and they sought now to persuade henry to remain abed warning him that it might be the death of him to get back on his horse henry had bitten his lower lip so deeply that he tasted blood on his tongue it does not sound he said hoarsely that i am being given a choice jesus wept the involuntary cry came from philippe genuinely shocked by his first sight of the english king this man was not feigning illness he was dying after glancing at richard who showed no emotion philippe hastily ordered one of his men to spread a cloak upon the ground my lord there is no question whatsoever of your standing do seat yourself on this mantle i have no need to sit henry said stonily i am here to learn what you want from me philippe shrugged as you wish but ere we speak of peace you must first submit yourself utterly to my mercy agree to be guided in all matters by my counsel and advice and not gainsay whatsoever i have decreed henry looked at him saying nothing for he did not trust his voice feeling as if he would choke on his rage and humiliation philippe was waiting for his response though he opened his mouth not sure what he would say when thunder sounded directly overhead both henry and philippe flinched as did many of their men none sure what this meant was thunder in an empty sky a sign of divine displeasure and if so who was the object of the lords wrath a second thunderclap rumbled and henry was almost thrown when his stallion shied and bucked nervously with morgan on one side and renaud de dammartin on the other holding on to his legs to keep him erect in the saddle he agreed to place himself at the mercy of the french king very well philippe said with a brief satisfied smile these are the terms you must meet you will agree to do homage to me for all of your lands on this side of the channel you will surrender custody of my sister the lady alys to a guardian chosen by the duke of aquitaine and agree that he shall marry her upon his return from jerusalem for the first time henry looked over at his son richard was standing a short distance away listening impassively his face revealing nothing of his thoughts had the circumstances been different henry might have appreciated the irony of it so richard had talked philippe into delaying the wedding yet again philippe was going to find that it would be no easy task to get richard and alys to the altar philippe waited until he had henrys attention again before continuing you shall pay the french crown an indemnity of twenty thousand silver marks to compensate me for the expenses i incurred in this war you will have your barons on both sides of the channel swear fealty to duke richard acknowledging he is your rightful heir you may not avenge yourself upon those of your lords or knights who have withdrawn their allegiance to you and pledged themselves to the duke to make sure of this none of them need return to your service until the month ere we set out for jerusalem the departure date for this journey will be midlent of the coming year philippe paused as if realizing how pointless this last provision was for few of the men at colombieres imagined that henry would ever be able to fulfill his crusading vow all of your barons shall swear that their allegiance to you is contingent upon your compliance with the terms of this treaty and as a pledge of your good faith you are to surrender to me and to the duke your city of le mans and your castles of chateauduloire and trou until these terms have been honored if you would prefer to yield the castles of gisors pacy and nonancourt that is also acceptable to us i agree to your terms henry said tersely is there anything else you demand of me you may defer your act of homage until your health is on the mend philippe said with such an air of magnanimity that henrys men seethed in silence but you must openly acknowledge your reconciliation with duke richard by giving him the kiss of peace until now richard had been regarding henrys surrender as dispassionately as if he were merely a spectator not actively involved in the proceedings a shadow crossed his face and then he stepped forward obviously intending to approach henry so he need not dismount but henry was already struggling from the saddle held upright with some discreet assistance from morgan and renaud richard reached out to offer support but henry ignored the gesture as commanded he gave his son a brief kiss of peace but as he pulled back he hissed in richards ear god grant that i live long enough to avenge myself upon you henrys lacerated pride then suffered another wound for it was evident even to him that he could not ride back to chinon and a horse litter had to be found philippe and some of the french lords joined richard and they all stood watching in silence as henry was borne away from colombieres upon his arrival at chinon henry found a delegation of canterbury monks awaiting his return they were feuding with their archbishop and undeterred by war and rebellion theyd managed to track him down to seek his support in their quarrel henry once would have been amused by the ludicrous incongruity of it but now he was past finding humor in anything and after promising curtly to dictate a letter to the canterbury chapter he took to his bed one of his men had remained behind to be given the list of those whod disavowed allegiance to him and could not be punished not returning to chinon until after nightfall henry had refused to eat speaking little and staring into some dark vista that only he could see but he showed a flicker of interest when roger malchael was ushered into his bedchamber you have the names of those who betrayed me roger read them to me geoff and will frowned not wanting henry to deal with still more misery in his weakened state but there was nothing enfeebled about henrys will and they knew better than to object roger was already obeying approaching the bed and breaking the seal on the parchment roll once he looked down at the list though he sucked in his breath before glancing up at henry in dismay may jesus christ help me sire the first name written here is count john your son henry jerked upright in the bed then fell back gasping i do not believe it i am sure roger has misread the name geoff said swiftly but will said nothing standing apart and watching sadly as the last act of the tragedy was played out let me see it henry demanded and roger obeyed looking as stricken as if he were handing over a draught of lethal poison for a long time henry stared down at johns name without speaking and then he crumpled the list in his fist let it flutter into the floor rushes when geoff tried to offer comfort he muttered say no more and turned his face away from them toward the wall that night henrys fever flared even higher and he lapsed into delirium geoff stayed by his side putting wet cloths on his burning skin fanning him and flicking away the flies it was too hot to close the windows will and morgan and maurice de craon also kept vigil at his bedside most of the time they could make no sense of his feverish mumblings but occasionally he said something intelligible and when he did they winced and fought back tears for he was cursing his sons cursing himself and the day he was born in his anguish mumbling over and over shame on a conquered king wednesday evening he surprised them by regaining his senses he whispered words of love to geoff calling him his true son and asking that a ring be bequeathed to his soninlaw and another one to geoff but when geoff urged him to confess so he could be absolved of his sins henry closed his eyes again saying nothing geoff began to sob and the other men were just as distraught appalled that henry was putting his immortal soul at risk deliverance came from an unlikely source renaud de dammartin had been watching from the shadows so quiet that the others had assumed hed fallen asleep but now he rose and approached the bed leaning over to whisper something in henrys ear henrys lashes flickered and he looked at the young knight then murmured his sons name geoff bent over listened intently and straightened up with a radiant smile yes papa i will turning toward the others he said joyfully he wants to be shriven at henrys own request a bed was made up for him before the altar in the chapel of ste melanie and he was carried down the stairs and across the bailey by his son and knights there he made his confession his voice so faint that the archbishop had to put his ear close to henrys mouth and was absolved of his sins while outside the chapel geoff leaned against the wall and wept it was will who eventually pulled renaud aside demanding to know what hed said to change the kings mind renaud gave will an enigmatic look and then grinned you really want to know i asked him if he wanted to be trapped in hell for all eternity with richard will didnt know whether to laugh or cry he shook his head managed a bemused smile and then started back toward the chapel for he wanted to keep vigil with geoff but his steps began to flag and instead he swung about and disappeared into the shadows of the vast yew tree in the middle bailey where he grieved privately and alone for his dying king and for his young lord whod also joked in those final moments of his mortal life in that stifling chamber at martel henrys delirium soon returned and he did not speak coherently again dying the next day after a hemorrhage that stained his bedding with dark blood he was fiftysix had ruled almost thirtyfive years as king of england and even longer as duke of normandy and count of anjou c hapter f iftyfive july fontevrault abbey anjou the nuns had never seen their selfpossessed abbess so fretful gillettes position was one without parallel in christendom for she ruled over no less than four monasteries including the male priory of st jean de lhabit the priory of st lazare which had been founded to treat those unfortunates afflicted with leprosy and the priory of ste mariemadeleine which offered sanctuary and salvation to women whod sinned and repented only at fontevrault were men subject to the authority of a woman and there had been occasional discipline problems caused by resentful or rebellious monks in the early years but these minor scandals had ceased during the kingship of henry fitz empress for he had taken a keen personal interest in the welfare of the angevin abbey and abbess gillette had soon shown herself to be a fair but firm mother superior rising through the ranks from cellarer to mistress of novices to grand prioress and eventually to the ultimate office there was no doubt though that she was now faced with the most daunting challenge of her nineyear reign there could be no greater honor than to have their abbey chosen for the burial of a king particularly one whod been such a generous patron of fontevrault henry had exempted them from royal taxes conferred an annual stipend founded one of their sister houses in england as penitence for the murder of st thomas entrusted the nuns with the education of two of his children and provided in his will for a bequest of two thousand silver marks he deserved a royal funeral that was one for the ages but they had neither the time nor the resources for such a majestic pageantry theyd gotten word only that morning that the king was dead it was a meager and melancholy funeral cortege that made its way from the castle at chinon it was with great difficulty that henrys men had found for him the trappings of sovereignty for much had been left behind at le mans they were deeply distressed that they were unable to dispense alms to the poor and to will marshal there was a dreary familiarity about the straitened circumstances evoking painful memories of hals unhappy death they moved slowly in the summer heat bearing the funeral bier upon their shoulders somber crowds gathering by the roadside to watch them pass they were not yet within sight of fontevrault when they heard the tolling of the abbey bells and then the wind brought to them the melodic sound of prayer the nuns were coming out to meet them in solemn procession with flaring torches and pealing bells and the sacred music of the benedictus reverently chanted by the sisters and monks as they advanced to welcome the king to his last resting place and will and geoff whod been anguishing over the selection of fontevrault knowing that henry had wanted to be buried at grandmont felt a sweet sense of relief sure now that theyd chosen well for him g eoff had insisted upon accompanying his fathers body into the church but his knights had gathered in the guest hall to quench their thirst ease their hunger and fortify themselves for the nights vigil they found though that most of them had little appetite renaud de dammartin was one of the few able to eat with relish and one of the few too to dare to broach the subject of their uncertain prospects as men whod been on the wrong side of a bitter internecine war do you think richard will attend the funeral he asked stabbing a chunk of bream with his knife i do not know will said honestly i sent him word and now it is up to him renaud drained his wine cup before sighing melodramatically a pity he said that my lordship of lillebonne castle should be so brief i was looking forward to having my own hunting preserve the other men could not help feeling a sense of personal loss too midst their mourning for henry their hopes of the promised heiresses and wardships and grants had died with the king and that disappointment might be the least of their troubles their eyes sought will for he had the most to fear not only had he lost a great heiress and a kings favor hed bested richard in combat inflicting a public humiliation upon a man no less prideful and hottempered than his sire at least will already had the manor of cartmel given to him by henry upon his return from the holy land assuming that richard let him keep it maurice de craon had less to fear for he was a powerful baron in his own right and therefore not as vulnerable as henrys household knights hed eaten little absently crumbling a piece of bread as he regarded the marshal we might as well speak candidly he said you are the most likely to suffer from the new kings displeasure will i want you to know that i would be pleased to offer you horses or money whatever you need to get through the bad days ahead i cannot offer you as much as lord maurice baldwin said quickly but all i have is yours will several others chimed in touching will with their loyalty and generosity but he could not help feeling shamed too that he should at this time in his life be dependent upon the charity of friends he knew hed not have to beg his bread by the roadside could always find a place in the count of flanderss mesnie but it would not be easy to become a landless knight again not at his age i thank you my lord thank you all but i cannot accept not knowing if i could repay you i shall put my trust in the almighty as ive always done he cocked his head then listening they are pealing the bells for vespers he said getting to his feet the others did too following him back toward the abbey church for evensong the office of the dead service known as the placebo had ended but the abbey church was still full the nuns were kneeling by the funeral bier set up before the high altar and many of henrys knights had also lingered to pray morgan said a prayer for geoff too asking the almighty to give him strength for his grieving was painful to see he was admiring the elegant marble columns and domed roof thinking this was one of the most beautiful churches hed ever seen when henrys squire hugh came dashing into the nave he paused by morgan long enough to gasp out he is here before hurrying to warn will and the others morgan spun around to see richard framed in the nave entranceway the men hastily made their obeisances but he acknowledged only the abbess gillette and the archbishop of tours before continuing on into the choir and halting by the candlelit bier for a time richard gazed down at his father and then he knelt barely long enough to say one pater noster some thought indignantly richards face was inscrutable a mask of royal reserve rising to his feet he did not speak to his brother geoff who was kneeling on the other side of the bier he did signal to will marshal and maurice de craon though gesturing for them to follow him as he strode through the door leading out into the cloisters although compline had been rung summer daylight was not easy to rout and was still holding the night at bay so the men had no need for torches or lanterns yet richard was regarding will in silence grey eyes giving away nothing the other day you intended to kill me marshal and would have had i not deflected your lance with my arm maurice started to speak thought better of it wills nervousness was washed away by the rising tide of his indignation my lord duke it was never my intent to kill you i am still strong enough to direct my lance where i want it to go had i wished i could have struck you instead of your horse and i cannot repent of that for it ended the pursuit of the king he raised his head then meeting richards eyes steadily bracing for the worst but the dukes mouth was curving ever so slightly at the corners you are forgiven marshal i bear you no malice i am gladdened to hear that my lord will said knowing richard must be able to see his relief but too thankful to care richard was looking over wills shoulder turning will saw that some of the knights had followed them out into the cloisters and were hovering at a discreet distance they came forward quickly when richard beckoned to them that is true for the rest of you too he said you have nothing to fear loyalty to the king is an admirable trait not one id want to discourage and now that inkling of a smile was unmistakable indeed he continued i value men such as you more highly than those who abandoned my father to be on the winning side glancing back toward will then he said after the funeral on the morrow i want you to leave at once for sarum i will have letters for you to deliver to my lady mother and others naming her as regent until my return to england i want it known that her wishes are to be obeyed in all matters will was promising that he would when there was a stir and some of the men parted to let geoff pass my lord duke he said coldly managing to make his very formality sound insulting i am gratified to hear that you are following the noble example set by our father in showing magnanimity to defeated foes brother richard said and he somehow turned that fraternal greeting into an insult too geoffs eyes softened as he glanced toward will and the other knights i think you should know that our lord father gave the lady of pembroke and striguil to the marshal in recognition of his steadfast and admirable loyalty richard looked over at will and then shook his head no he did not give her to the marshal rather he promised her to him i am the one who will give her to him sure that she will be safe in his hands will dropped to his knees thank you my lord sire renaud prompted the king your father made gifts to the rest of us too richards gaze moved from face to face i will honor his promises you need not fear now i would take my leave of the lady abbess and my lord archbishop i shall pass the night at saumur will return on the morrow for the funeral richard started to turn away then paused bury richly the king my father will eleanors relative freedom had been curtailed once richard declared war on henry she no longer had such easy and unquestioned access to visitors her household was reduced and surveillance was once more intrusive her confinement was not as stringent as in the early years of her captivity but she very much resented these new restrictions saying bitterly to amaria that she felt like a hawk with clipped wings cruelly kept from flight within sight of the sky the windows of her chamber were unshuttered open to the humid sarum air eleanor was playing chess with amaria when sir ralph fitz stephen and the justiciar ralf de glanville sought admittance rising eleanor stood watching as they came toward her their faces grave their eyes apprehensive the king is dead she said before either man could speak their mouths dropped open and they regarded her for a moment with awe and unease before the justiciar rallied yes madame that is so the lord king died at chinon on the sixth of july not long after being compelled to make peace with the duke of aquitaine and the french king i regret we can tell you no more than that for weve had word only of his mortal illness and his funeral at fontevrault abbey fontevrault eleanor said softly the abbey where hed meant to exile her now his burial site i would have a requiem mass said on the morrow for the repose of his soul of course madame afterward i shall return to winchester for sarum has never been to my liking eleanor looked at them challengingly but they raised no objections whatsoever to the contrary seemed eager to oblige her it shall be as the queen commands once theyd gone eleanor moved to the window stood gazing out at the starless summer night amaria was watching her uncertainly not sure whatif anycomfort to offer my lady it must be a great relief to recover your liberty and my heart rejoices for you and of course you are gladdened that lord richard will now be king as am i butdo you notnot mourn eleanor did not turn around ive been mourning for months amaria ever since i learned about bonsmoulins after that i knew it could only end like this will marshal waited as the queen read her sons letter shed moved to the open window for better light and will marveled that a woman of her age could take the harsh glare of the sun and still look so handsome he found it hard to believe she was just five years away from her biblical three score and ten but then he found it hard to remember that he was past forty hed loved hal had developed a great respect for henry and was very grateful to richard for bearing no grudges but hed always had a special bond with the queen whod ransomed a young knight of no consequence not only saving his life but putting him on the path that now led to isabella de clare and possibly even an earldom he deeply regretted the kings unhappy death he was glad though that eleanor would flourish now that her son ruled very glad indeed it seems congratulations are in order will eleanor glanced up from richards letter a smile playing about her mouth so you are to be married indeed my lady from here i go to seek out the damsel in london his smile was joyful but wry too she is very young seventeen or so i hope shell not be disappointed to find herself wed to a man so much older than she eleanor was touched surprised that a boys shyness could still survive under the polished worldly mien of this accomplished courtier and knight dearest will she said you think your renown has not reached english shores isabella will be so bedazzled to wed the famed will marshal that shell never notice a grey hair or two at your temples she grinned then and he had to grin back i am loath to cut short your time with your bride but do not tarry with her too long will there is much to be done and i shall have need of your services of course madame i assume you will be making the arrangements for the dukes coronation she inclined her head but that is only one of the tasks i must undertake my son is not that well known in england for he has passed little time here i want to do what i can to make sure his welcome will be a warm one will did not doubt she would succeed hed known few men with the shrewdness and political acumen of the queen hed begun to hope that he might actually evade the question hed been dreading but it was then that eleanor said you were with my husband until the end tell me about those last days will was quiet for a moment how much do you want to know madame her eyes narrowed as bad as that yes my lady as bad as that eleanor found herself hesitating uncharacteristically irresolute she did not truly want to know how henry had suffered she already had enough bad memories to last a lifetime yet she felt oddly obligated to hear it all one final act of atonement irony was not likely to be an effective shield though tell me she repeated and will did hed have spared her if he could but he respected her too much to lie to her after shed asked for the truth she listened in silence but when he told her of johns betrayal her eyes burned with tears id been told that john and richard had made their peace but i assumed it had happened after harry died will shook his head grimly i would to god it had been like that madame for this was the true mortal blow i know the king made mistakes many of them but he did not deserve a death like this no she said very low he did not neither spoke for a time and then will roused himself to tell her the rest the most shameful part of this sad story by ill chance neither geoff nor i were with him when he died and whilst we were being summoned some of his servants and men stole what they could theyd dared to search his body and when we entered the chapel we found him lying there on the bed without even a blanket to cover him one of his knights at once removed his own mantle and wrapped the king in that we did the best we could found a fine robe to bury him in and a scepter and lacking a crown we made do with gold embroidery we were distraught that we had no ring for his finger but fortunately hed given one to his squire for safekeeping and hugh produced a jeweled ring of great beauty we had no money for alms though and several thousand of christs poor had gathered as word spread stephen de marcay the kings seneschal insisted that there was no money left in chinons treasury and i reminded him how much hed benefited from the kings favor saying that he may have none of the kings money but he had plenty of his own which hed amassed in the royal service but the ungrateful wretch claimed he could do nothing and so we had to turn the people away which would have grieved king henry greatly he waited and when she said nothing he crossed to her side kissed her hand and bade her farewell she did not speak until he reached the door willtell the lady amaria that i would be alone i will my lady he said and closed the door quietly behind him eleanor moved to the table and poured wine with an unsteady hand but she did not drink for her chest felt congested her throat too tight to swallow her hand tightened around the cup and then she dashed it to the floor sent the flagon flying with another sweep of her arm damn you harry i am not going to let you do this after all the grief you gave me over the years i am not going to let you torment me from the grave too sitting down upon the edge of her bed she closed her eyes and counted her scars as if they were pater noster beads the expression on his face during their dreadful confrontation at falaise look upon the sun youll not be seeing it again i will never forgive you never i offered to make you the abbess of fontevrault but it can just as easily be an impoverished irish convent so remote and secluded that not even god could find you no she did not lack for reasons to curse his memory she had sixteen of them she need only think of all those lonely christmases all those wasted years she need only remember how hed used her to compel richard to surrender aquitaine careless of the damage he might be doing between mother and son or the awful sound of the key turning in the lock on her first night of captivity at loches castle but memories were as elusive as quicksilver as hard to control other images jostled for attention harry holding her as they grieved for joannas baby despairing together over hals follies a lifetime of tears and laughter lusting after crowns and each other their wedding night his first words after their lovemaking good god womanforget what i told you in paris i would have married you without aquitaine laughing when she called him a gallant liar and laughing too when she related scandalous stories of her grandfather exclaiming gleefully between the two of us weve got a family tree rooted in hell yes there were good memories too thirtyseven years of good and bad quarrels and reconciliations eight cradles and too many gravestones and rosamund clifford and power that rivaled caesars an empire that stretched from the scots border to the mediterranean sea she lay back on the bed hot tears seeping through her lashes and trickling across her cheeks until she tasted salt on her lips one more memory was taking shape with painful clarity another bitter argument angry words traded back and forth accusations and reproaches and her scornful warning that echoed now across the years as the final judgment upon their marriage weve schemed and fought and loved until we are so entangled in hearts and minds that there is no way to set us free god help us both harry for we will never be rid of each other not even death will do that from the twelfthcentury annals of roger de hoveden queen eleanor the mother of the beforenamed duke moved her royal court from city to city and from castle to castle just as she thought proper and sending messengers throughout all the counties of england ordered that all captives should be liberated from prison and confinement for the good of the soul of henry her lord inasmuch as in her own person she had learnt by experience that confinement is distasteful to mankind and that it is a most delightful refreshment to the spirits to be liberated therefrom richard soon met the archbishops of rouen and canterbury and sought pardon for taking up arms against his father after taking the cross he was then girded with the ducal sword of normandy on july in rouen two days later he met with the french king near chaumont and reached terms that would prevent a further delay of their crusade in the meantime eleanor was very active in england on his behalf after securing the treasury in winchester she rode to london and then began a royal progress through the southern shires she issued edicts establishing uniform weights and measures for corn liquid and cloth as well as a currency valid anywhere in england she freed the english abbeys from their obligation to stable and provide for the kings reserve horses and magnanimously gave these mounts to the monks she continued to release those imprisoned for offenses against henrys harsh and unpopular forest laws and she allowed those whod been outlawed under these laws to return for the good of king henrys soul and wherever she went she demanded oaths of fealty from all free men in the name of lord richard and the lady eleanor her efforts were so effective that richard was given a tumultuous welcome upon arriving at portsmouth on august two days later he got an equally enthusiastic reception in winchester and was reunited with his mother the queen richard was laughing you know maman your enemies are going to accuse you of practicing the black arts how else explain how you emerged from sixteen years of confinement still looking so elegant and comely not to mention having more energy than a kennel full of greyhounds i hear that between your travels and councils and proclamations you managed to find time to found a hospital for the poor in surrey i assume that upon the seventh day you rested not for long she said laughing too if you want your coronation to be as splendid as i suspect you do that is going to take a great deal more work sitting beside him in the windowseat she exercised a mothers prerogative and reached over to brush his hair back from his forehead you were telling me about the meeting with philippe richard made a mocksour face i had to bribe him with another four thousand marks and that in addition to the twenty thousand he extorted from my father at colombieres then agree to relinquish my rights in auvergne and give up two fiefs in berry i had no choice though not if i hope to depart for the holy land ere i am too old to fight but philippe is going to be troublesome it is hard to believe that one came from louiss loins you think he could be a foundling he laughed again laughter came very easily to them both on this august afternoon i have made a good match for richenza i do not know why we bothered to change the lasss name when none of us call her matilda i am wedding her to the son of the count of perche eleanor nodded approvingly shed be marrying into a highborn family and the marital alliance would strengthen their northeast borders and what of johns marriage to avisa of gloucester she kept her voice noncommittal john had arrived with richard but shed yet to have a private moment with him ill be in marlborough ere the end of the month to give the bride away in addition to the gloucester estates i am settling upon him lands worth four thousand a year in the counties of cornwall devon dorset and somerset our father had promised it to him again and again but not surprisingly he never got around to actually doing it eleanor regarded him thoughtfully i know youve been implacable with the men who abandoned harry toward the last dismissing them from your service in favor of those whod stayed loyal even seizing the lands of raoul de fougeres and juhel de mayenne it is always wise policy to reward loyalty to the crown of course but you seem to have made one exception are showing john great generosity richard shrugged i can hardly do less for him maman until i have a son of my own he is my heirunless youd rather i pick arthur in brittany so he must be provided for but you notice all his new lands are located in england not normandy or anjou id as soon keep the channel between him and my good friend the french king so in effect you are buying johns loyalty he shrugged again well my father kept him hanging too with little to call his own so he deserves a chance to show he can be trusted if i play fair with him and if he proves himself to be unreliable ill deal with it i cannot say i see him as any great threat now geoffreyhe would have borne watching but im not likely to lose sleep fretting about johnny he paused to take a sip from his wine cup i did not tell you did i i am honoring my fathers last wishes and one of them was to see geoff as archbishop of york and you are going to follow through is that wise richard geoff will not be grateful to you will never forgive you and i think you know that of course i do hellfire i could buy him the papacy and hed still act like i am saladin but there are advantages to having him wear a miter once he is ordained as a priest he cannot harbor any illusions about laying claim to my throne you look dubious maman geoff is an able man and an ambitious one you cannot tell me it has not crossed his mind that william the bastard was born out of wedlock too so id as soon he kept his eye upon heavens crown and not my own besides he added with a sudden grin he is not at all happy about it so how could i resist he continued to confide his plans pleasing her with most of them so far hed yet to take a misstep she would have felt better though if he were not intending to journey to the other side of the world leaving his kingdom for god knows how long so i mean to name the earl of essex as one of my justiciars whilst i am away willem is a good man and if he serves me half as well as he served my father i will be content i hear there will soon be a vacant bishopric at ely as the current occupant of the see is ailing once he goes to god i will name guillaume longchamp in his stead i intend to give longchamp geoffs chancellorship too for i want to make sure that i have men i can trust to watch over my kingdom whilst i am gone of course you will be the one ill truly depend upon to keep order and quench any rebellious sparks ere they can take fire eleanor assured him that she would do whatever he asked of her and he smiled but then startled her by saying you know maman youll have to see johnny sooner or later hes as nervous as a treed cat so why not put him out of his misery and let me get him she hadnt realized that hed sensed her ambivalence about john you are too sharpeyed for my own good very well go and fetch him if you do not mind ill send someone for him i am a king now he joked and it is not seemly to be running my own errands he got to his feet but took only a few steps toward the door before he halted do you blame me for my fathers death eleanor was taken aback no richard i do not she studied his face intently and then said quietly do you no no i do not but despite the vehemence of his denial she was not convinced and waited for him to reveal more others do though he said with enough heat to tell her that this had been preying on his mind no one dares say it to my face of course but i know what is being whispered behind my back there is even talk that when i stood beside papas body he began to bleed from the nose and mouth that is not so eleanor was not surprised by the story for it was a widely accepted belief that a murder victim would often bleed in the presence of his killer that is foolish folklore richard no one of any sense would believe it i would hope not he said brusquely obviously vexed with himself for paying any heed to superstition he was not yet ready to let it go though shooting her a searching glance i did not believe papa was ill he said abruptly i was positive he was feigning that this was yet another of his cunning tricks and i assured philippe of that it was only when he dragged himself from his bed to ride to colombieres that we saw hed not been lying well your father gave you reason to suspect his good faith he was always too clever by half and it was inevitable that it would eventually catch up with him richard nodded as if agreeing but he was gnawing his lower lip but i still did not believe he was dying maman it was obvious at colombieres that he was ailing i still expected him to recover though how did i not see what everyone else did eleanor smiled sadly sons always find it difficult to see their fathers as they truly are and how much more true that would be for a living legend like harry now wives rarely have that defect of vision but i suspect most sons are like you finding it hard to realize their fathers are mere mortal beings no longer the allpowerful patriarchs they remember from childhood so you are saying i was not willfully blind merely immature he said wryly philippe insisted that he give me the kiss of peace for the first time i saw how frail hed become almost feeble but then he growled that he asked only to live long enough to revenge himself upon me and i found myself looking into a hawks eyes fierce and proud and still defiant yes she said according to will his spirit burned brightly to the end it was his body that failed him richard was silent for a moment i truly did not think i had a choice but to do what i did i know he tossed his head then as if shaking off the past well let me get johnny for you he stepped forward gave her a brief hug and then strode from the chamber eleanor paced as she waited still not sure what she would say to john with her other sons she could argue convincingly that theyd had legitimate grievances especially in richards case it was not that easy to absolve her lastborn for hed been the bestloved by henry and his betrayal seemed the cruelest of all when john entered the chamber she saw what richard meant his unease was evident what struck her most forcefully though was how young he seemed at his age henry had already made himself englands king and geoffrey and richard were putting down rebellions in brittany and poitou even hal had carved out a niche for himself upon the tournament circuit why had john not crossed the border from boyhood to manhood by now she reminded herself this was harrys doing not hers but she had her own sins to answer for and she owed a debt if not to this faithless young prince to the wounded child hed once been when he greeted her formally and warily she smiled and held out her hand to him we are alone she said greet me as your mother not the queen johns relief was as obvious as his discomfort had been he came quickly toward her took her hand in his motheri want to explain to make you understand why hush john she said stopping his words by putting her fingers to his lips we need not talk of it the summer heat that had seared france and england did not reach north wales august was cool and rainy but on the day the message arrived from morgan the sky was clear of clouds and the manor at trefriw was dappled with mellow sun ranulf regarded his sons missive with some trepidation he knew of henrys dismal death at chinon thanks to his niece emma he sensed though that this news was not likely to be good escorting his wife out into their hillside garden he seated her on a wooden bench and only then did he break the seal scan the contents rhiannon waited patiently until he was ready to read it to her morgan is not coming home is he she said at last and ranulf nodded before remembering that his wife needed verbal not visual cues passing strange that after so many years of marriage he occasionally forgot that no love i think not he does not say so but i expect he will take the cross and accompany richard to the holy land sitting beside her on the bench he slipped his arm around her shoulders and read her their sons letter they were regretful but resigned for theyd realized long ago that wales was too small to hold their youngest rhiannons fears were more immediate her concern for her aging husband not her adventuresome son i suppose she began trying to sound matteroffact not wanting him to hear any echoes of reproach in her voice i suppose you will want to go back to england to attend richards coronation ranulf did not answer at once regarding her fondly this brave woman whod done so much to heal his wounds whod assured him on their wedding night that she understood his loyalties would always be divided understood that england would always exert a powerful pull upon his soul no rhiannon he said i will not be going back to england i can grieve for harry here in gwynedd i wish richard well but that is morgans world now not mine i am home her smile was luminous he read morgans letter again for her and they lingered in the garden afterward sharing the quiet contentment that had no need of words as she rode along winchesters high street eleanor soon drew a cheering crowd she smiled and waved before turning into the narrow street that led into the cathedral close later that day she and her sons would be departing the city for sarum and then marlborough this visit to the cathedral of st swithuns had been an impulsive one she was still enjoying being able to indulge her whims as she chose it amused her that she was being escorted by her erstwhile gaolers ralf de glanville and sir ralph fitz stephen richard had given her the right to punish them if she wished but she could not blame them for merely obeying henrys orders and in his unobtrusive way sir ralph had done what he could to mitigate the severity of those early years of confinement the bishopric of winchester was presently vacant and so it was the prior of st swithuns and his monks whod gathered in the garth to bid her welcome when she explained that shed come to offer prayers for the success of her sons reign the prior personally led her toward the west door and then showed unexpected sensitivity by asking if shed prefer to pray alone she would and leaving her companions outside eleanor moved up the nave pausing briefly at the font of black tournai marble before turning into the north transept the small chapel of st saviour had always been a favorite of hers for she greatly admired the vibrant biblical scenes painted on the wall above the altar she noticed now that several of them were looking dull and faded though she resolved to give the prior money for their restoration and then smiled thinking that shed not take her privileged life for granted again kneeling before the altar she said a prayer for richards safety in the holy land and murmured prayers for the repose of hal and geoffreys souls rising she lit a votive candle then for her husband ive been doing good for the sake of your soul harry she said laughing soundlessly as she imagined his pithy response to that what a twisted road theyd traveled together what is so very sad she said softly is that it did not have to end like this we had chances to turn aside to find our way again ah harry we were so wellmatched you and i if only we could have learned to forgive each other if only and what if fitting epitaphs for both our tombs well youll have all eternity to learn to forgive us and yourself knowing you it is likely to take that long too the candle flickered and seemed about to go out but then it steadied and she smiled again at least it was never dull my darling and you will be remembered long after weve all turned to dust but so will i the sound of footsteps drew her attention then and she glanced out into the nave saw a monk approaching forgive me for disturbing your prayers madame but your son the lord duke has sent a messenger to inquire when youll be returning to the castle eleanor sighed thinking her husband and son were much more alike than theyd been willing to admit like henry richard had no patience for delays was eager to be on the road thank you brother she said i am coming and she walked with a sure step from the shadows of the cathedral out into the sunlit priory garth
